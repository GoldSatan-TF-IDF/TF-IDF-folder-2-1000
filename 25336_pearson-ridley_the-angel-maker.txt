ridley pearson the angel maker i am a sort of phantom in life who has lost all beginning and end and who has even forgotten his own name fyodor dostoyevski the brothers the young womans pale lifeless expression cried out to daphne matthews from across the room nearly all of the kids who sought out the shelter were high on something the hollow cheeks and dirty hair were common to all the runaways as were the torn jeans the soiled tshirts and the disturbing smell the windowless basement room in the king center baptist church on south jackson held thirteen beds and was void of any color except for the odd assortment of unframed art posters the beds arranged in perfect rows were each covered with a gray wool blanket atop which had been placed a white towel and a dull green cardboard box containing a toothbrush comb bar of soap a package of condoms and a leaflet on aids the boys dorm across the hall and next to the room where the choir robes were kept held only eight beds because teenage boys were less likely to seek help from such places and because girls between the ages of thirteen and eighteen accounted for a larger percentage of the runaways who wandered seattles streets the other volunteers at the shelter welcomed daphnes expertise as a psychologist as much as her being a member of the seattle police department though this latter qualification was rarely called upon and never mentioned in front of the girls for daphne each young woman who passed through the shelters door represented a challenge each had her own unique often terrifying story by coming here they called out for help homeless penniless distrustful addicted pregnant filthy diseased the job of each volunteer was to reverse all of that to connect the runaway with counselors doctors halfway houses government funds jobs housing recovery programs and safety to rescue and rebuild a life daphne sat down quietly and slowly on the bed opposite the girl and forced a welcoming smile that made her feel cheap and dishonest there was nothing to smile about here she noticed a tiny scab on the inside of the girls elbow joint and felt her heart sink to her relief she didnt see any other needle marks perhaps this was the girls first time with any luck her last the girl never looked at her she just stared off into the room in a catatonic daze daphne suggested gently would you like to lie down the girl nodded slightly daphne moved aside the towel and box and supported her head as it traveled to the pillow some of the drunks felt this hot some of the druggies but this contact gave daphne a sickening feeling in her stomach that told her this was something worse exactly what she wasnt sure she wasnt even sure she wanted to find out the girl cried out sharply as she leaned back clutching her side daphne cleared the tangled hair from her face wincing as she noticed a pink circle on the girls temple without looking she knew there would be an identical mark opposite this electroshock cold the girl complained in a dry raspy voice daphne covered her with a blanket told her she would be right back and hurried over to sharon shaffer who had just arrived sharon a remarkably petite woman with large gray eyes and an oversized mouth a former graduate of the shelter was now its spokesperson working the circuit of rotary clubs and ladies luncheons in fundraising efforts to both the volunteers and the community she was a symbol of everything right about the shelter its leader and patron saint to daphne she was a dear friend daphne asked one of the other volunteers to check the hospitals for a psych ward discharge or escapee she briefed sharon on the recent arrival as the two of them crossed the room the needle mark the evidence of electroshock therapy the girl clutching her side are you thinking restraints sharon asked she had a way of reading daphnes thoughts before daphne could answer sharon said lets hold off on that okay theres nothing more frustrating than a tiedown its horrible ive been there daphne didnt argue reaching the girl they perched themselves on opposite sides of her bed where am i the girl wondered aloud why am i here the only requirement for being here sharon explained in a comforting voice is your desire to be off the streets she hesitated okay the girl squinted painfully it hurt daphne to see that kind of painpsychological or physical and it worried her too the druggies usually felt nothing again the combination of electroshock and that needle mark warned daphne of an institution her policewoman instincts kicked inthis girl could turn violent without warning sharon said calmly youre safe now my name is sharon im a runaway this is daphne were all women here okay we can keep you warm we can feed you we want nothing from you nothing at all the girl began to cry we are not going to notify the police or your parentsyoure home youre safe here whatever you have done is behind you here you are safe if you need medical attention you will have it we want nothing more of you than your name something to call you a first name is all can you tell us your name cindy the girl answered cant you stop them she asked desperately sharon repeated youre safe here cindy she reached out and took the girls limp hand the girl attempted to sit up she cried out painfully once again clutching her abdomen and then shielded her ears cant you stop them she pleaded the blanket fell away from her a wet bloodstain colored her side a stabbing daphne wondered how had she missed the wound earlier the girl pleaded do you hear that barking cant you stop that barking daphne reached out and lifted the girls shirt her skin was colored an iodinebrown from surgery at the center of this stain was a threeinch incision laced with broken stitches it was so fresh it had yet to scab she was losing an enormous amount of blood call sharon shouted across the room we need an ambulance pronto she caught eyes with daphne then and whispered what the hell is this daphnes fingers gripped the handle but she couldnt quite bring herself to open the door from inside the nightclub came the muted melody of his jazz piano she had carefully avoided coming to the big joke because new lives came at a price and that price was distance two years had passed since that evening spent with him a single evening a single event long since over but her nearly tactile memory of it remained she had her feet firmly on the ground now and he had a family why challenge any of that she answered herself she needed the best cop available she needed lou boldt retired or not a car pulled up a young couple climbed out and approached she had to make up her mindturn back or go through with it there were other people to whom she could turn not as good as boldt but certainly qualified to hell with it she went inside a short stocky doorman with no head hair but a mustache waxed like an airplane propeller requested a twodollar cover charge for the piano player the piano player she thought the sergeant she felt like correcting the most celebrated cop in this city to ever walk away from the jobso important to homicide that his departure was still technically termed an extended leave she intended to play upon that fact she handed the doorman the money cheap at twice the price the club was dingier than she remembered its low ceiling hung over a roomful of small cigarette scarred tables and an army of armless chairs inset into the brick wall was a handsome fireplace it was fake so were the bricks the pianos sounds filled a pair of overhead speakers to her left some guys were busy playing video games to her right the piano and the man behind it remained hidden on the other side of an imitation chinese screen perched on the far left of a small stage where comedians performed standup on the weekends she crossed the room toward the tables nervous and even a little afraid a single blue light shone down on him his head trained on the keys in strict concentration he shouldnt be in blue light she thought because it makes him look older than his fortyfive so did the thinning haira shade more gray if the light could be trusted if there had been any question about the identity of the player the halfempty glass of milk answered it with his eyes in shadow he looked kind of like an owl up there this was how she thought of him she realized as an owl up on a branch out of reach wise silent even majestic terrifying to some inspiring to others he was both to her she negotiated her way through the tight furniture not a very good crowd tonight boldt was the kind to take that personally she wondered if this was something to use in her attempt to win his help with her investigation the walnut bar had been imported from a british pub by the owner bear berenson attached to the mirror using a decal from a local brewery a happy hour menu advertised peanuts french fries and fresh oysters a hardfaced woman wearing too much makeup stood watch behind beer taps a hopeful gaze fixed on her customers like that of a fisherman scanning the sea daphne slipped into an empty chair and flagged down the rooms only waitress a tall black woman built like a dancer in the process daphne caught boldts attention as well he looked up and their eyes met god how shed missed him boldt felt her presence before he saw her as close friends or former lovers often do as they caught eyes he dropped a stitch necessitating the recovery of the lost beat in the next measure he felt himself blusheveryone had noticed the error everyone but the bartender mallory who never noticed anything but an empty glass or a waiting tip she looked real good high strong cheekbones heavy eyebrows and shoulderlength brown hair that in certain light held a rusty red intense concentrating eyes and an outdoors complexion he knew damn well shed been home to fix herself up and that made him wonder all of a sudden about her intentions she didnt wear silk blouses and pearl necklaces around the fourth floor unless a hell of a lot had changed in the past two years would she comment about the way he looked a jazz rat wearing the same pair of khakis for a week you could track his meals on these pants his shirt was on its second day he generally did laundry mondays and thursdays it was kind of strange to see her again strange to have not seen her for so long not that he hadnt kept up with her through others but seeing her in the flesh was altogether different nice flesh at that but he felt none of the lusty urges he had been caught up in two years earlier she felt to him more like a high school sweetheart someone from long ago whom he had known before the rules had changed of course the rules hadnt changed he thought he had he and his wife liz had rebuilt their relationship from the ashes of overwork failed promises and a disintegration of purpose interest and spirit it had required enormous sacrifices on both their parts boldt had left the department liz had borne the burden of pregnancy and a difficult delivery to bring them a son new roles now liz the provider mother and lover boldt parttime jazz rat fulltime house husband and mr mom together they had found a new rhythm carved out a new existence now here was daffy glowing in the limited light of the cheap seats nervous eyes seeking him out he bought himself a few precious moments by delaying the ending of the song with a long improvisation it would all be improvisation from here on out he rose from the bench and interrupted mallory before she could complain about the length of the set push drinks on them he suggested feeding her one instinct ill stretch the next set to compensate mallory grimaced but didnt argue daphne would call that a learned behavior he fingercombed what hair he could find up there she kept her eyes on him as he approached he wiped his palms on his pants and offered a smile two years had passed and all he could think to say was hey there she grinned and nudged a chair away from the table with her foot he felt big and clumsy as he sat down in the chair he had added a dozen pounds and knew he looked it not her they shook hands and he was thankful for that no need to be weird about this he said cant even see the scar though he wasnt sure what possessed him to do so she tugged at the scarf and revealed it to him three or four inches long still slightly pink it would always be there to remind her he remembered the knife held there as if it were yesterday daffy attempting to talk a known killer out of using the knife on her boldt the one with the gun she in the way of the bullet her throat in the way of that blade her weapons were her words and they had failed her boldt wondered if she had recovered from that one yet those things tended to haunt you that was a stupid thing to say he admitted is this the new you looking for my flaws let me tell you something there are women who would kill to have flaws like yours he hoped a compliment might erase his mistake keep your shorts on casanova thats all behind us hey you think i dont know im a father now though thats probably news to you i keep up she said i didnt think it would have been too appropriate for me to throw you and liz a baby shower it must have taken some courage to break a twoyear habit of staying away this is no visit is it not dressed like that it isnt have you been somewhere going somewhere are you selling something why are you here not that im complaining i heard the piano player is terrific mediocre on his best nights boldt replied you must be hanging around with some critically tonedeaf people theyre your friends my point exactly homicide right you are selling something how is the baby she asked miles terrific thanks just the mention of the boy made boldt homesick and liz that took some real courage fine he answered honestly happy i think and how about you she asked he nodded the same why should it feel odd to admit such a thing you im good im volunteering at the shelter now so ive heard he said ive kept up too he added wanting her to hear this through dixie she said referring to king county medical examiner dr ronald dixon a close friend of boldts a short silence fell between them are you going to tell me about it he asked the case he added trying to sound smart it worked she gave him one of those impressed looks shes sixteenyears old is or was is she confirmed she walked into the shelter this afternoon in real bad shape drugs evidence suggesting the use of electroshock therapy a fresh incision right here she touched her side too fresh the bleeding kind of fresh we thought she might be an escapee we checked with hospitals and institutions no one had record of her her stitches had popped hence the blood we admitted her to the medical center i cant tell you what drew me to her lou not exactly it was more than curiosity more than sympathy you run out of those after a few weeks at the shelter youre the one who taught me to listen to the victim victim he interrupted they got her stitched back up i take it exactly what was daffy after why the compliments she was a professional manipulatorhe had to watch that she knew her way around the human mind dealing with her was like playing blackjack with someone who could count cards she answered they stitched her back up but they took xrays shes missing a kidney she let it hang there a second no hospital record of any such operation she has no memory of any surgery none no explanation at all im looking for the explanation phil went along with this he asked curiously as staff psychologist daphne reported to lieutenant phil shoswitz homicide the logic of which was known only to the upper brass if there were to be an investigation and she part of it it would more than likely be overseen by shoswitz he doesnt even know about it yet she admitted looking awayan uncommon gesture for her thats one of the reasons ive come to you she added i need your help your expertise trouble he knew her too well help her name is cindy chapman shes been on the road for seven months left arizona last winter after her stepfather sexually abused her she went through flagstaff salt lake city and ended up here about a month ago her longterm memory is fine but shes lost a twentyfourhour period during which she was exposed to electroshock and her kidney was removed let me tell you this no two medical procedures could be less related to one another ive studied this stuff lou this is my turf but investigating it thats why im here he felt the stability of his marriage was at stake police work swallowed him whole he and liz had come to certain agreements what are you saying someone stole her kidney if a hospital or an institution is involved it has to be local these kids stick to a pretty small area they develop small societies of selfhelp or selfabuse when they move away its forever on to portland san francisco la you champion the cause of the victim its the victim that can tell you the most about a case dead or alive right youre the expert on the victim more compliments he fought like hell to maintain his guard she may have been raped she wont admit to consensual sex the evidence is there but she doesnt remember thats the electroshock you see she was beginning to frighten him no he admitted i dont see a commotion at the front door attempted to steal his attention but failed daphnes eyesconvincing terrified searching hopefulheld him firmly someone cut this girl open and stole her kidney im convinced of it the electroshock was used to ensure she didnt remember anything about it fire filled her eyes i cant prove it not yet she placed her hand on her chest but i feel it in here you know that feeling dont you i know you do he resented being cornered by her yes he knew that feeling yes he had been forced to defend it on a dozen occasions and no there was no real sense to it but this was her feeling not his he reminded himself her case her instincts not his what evidence is there he asked coldly she winced im not an investigator i cant even take this to shoswitz until i have something convincing hell hes homicide he may not want it even then shes alive after all what do i do where do i turn the helpless female i dont buy it she glared this young woman was violated in the worst most heinous sense some monster monster was not a word that daphne matthews the psychologist often usedcut her open reached inside her and removed an organa physical part of her my god phil shoswitz may be committed more to the dead than the living but you after they stole her kidney they burned her shortterm memory with electroshock am i getting through maybe one of them raped her just for fun evidence do i need probable cause sergeant in order to investigate or just the suspicion that a crime has been committed she stared him down will you help me or not she asked adding if for no other reason than as a parent he couldnt help but picture mileseinstein the nickname belonging to his blond curly haired soninvoluntarily under the knife of such a butcher she interrupted his thoughts the electroshock may have done permanent damage to her memory not to mention her mind she hears a constant barking im out of the business im off the force my badge is collecting dust in shoswitzs drawer youre on extended leave thats just phils way of holding a carrot out to me of keeping my chance at twenty alive thats the way it reads on paper daffy but in here he said repeating her gesture of placing his hand on his chest in here im a father and a hack pianist he had never dared speak the words aloud had seldom even thought them for he wasnt one to lie and he couldnt be sure this was the truth its over it felt sacrilegious to say such a thing just hearing it spoken confirmed its falsehood he felt a terrifying loss of control as if hitting a patch of ice on a dangerous curve it wasnt over was it someone out there had torn the guts out of a young girl what surprised him most of all was the way he took to it so quickly he wanted whatever evidence she had he wanted the pieces of the puzzle he wanted to put a stop to it before it happened again cop instinctsshe was counting on them perhaps it was because the victim was alive a voicea mans big and thunderousreverberated through the club partys over everyone no more drinks im going to have to ask you all to leave boldt looked over his shoulder expecting to see some drunk on the stage but instead he saw a crew cut wearing a tenyearold gray suit and scuffed wingtips with worn heels a badge hung out of the breast pocket of the suit four or five clones of the man swept quickly into the club fanning out to various responsibilities it felt like a bank job to boldt an organized robbery but when this guy announced treasury department he realized what it was the man continued these premises are being sealed he repeated loudly over protests im going to have to ask you all to leave your idea boldt asked her nodding toward the tman trying to pressure me into this she grimaced looking past him toward the stage one of the suits was screwing a padlock clasp into the pianos keyboard cover boldt could feel the screws biting into the wood as if they were drilling into his own flesh he rose angrily daphne following what the hell boldt hollered as he closed the distance thats a musical instrument goddamn it the one with the big voice was smart enough to step aside the assistant kept right on twisting the screwdriver stop that now dont make any trouble pal the assistant cautioned the screw chewed more deeply into the wood you dont do that to a musical instrument boldt repeated wrapping one of his big hands around the boys wrist you just dont do that the agent threatened you want me to call the cops i am a cop boldt declared his eyes met daphnes she wasnt going to let him live that one down boldt released the man so am i daphne informed the agent producing her identification id sure as hell like to see the warrant that authorizes the destruction of private property in the process of seizure you want to show me that document please agent she craned forward to read his nametag campbell the mans face went crimson he looked first at her then at boldt then over at his superior you want to see warrants youll have to talk to agent majorksi i got a job to do here leave it be boldt said definitively grabbing his wrist again two screws had already violated the ebony across the room bartender mallory struggled with one of the agents in an effort to lock the cash register but lost the agent took the key from her they had practiced this drill well or had performed it enough times to execute it flawlessly piece by piece stage by stage the agents took control in a matter of minutes confused patrons were herded toward the door several chugging beers on the way another commotionbears arrestgrabbed boldts attention as the agent started twisting that screwdriver again the club owner was placed in handcuffs and read his rights he glanced over at boldt shrugged and smiled i should have hired h ampr block bear shouted over to boldt that was bear ever the comic he threw a couple of oneliners at the agents who had him but they didnt seem to appreciate the humor drinks are on the house fellas he tried one last time as they escorted him toward the door hey monk he called out using his nickname for boldt i thought all you badgers were on the same team hey elliot ness he called to the gray suit majorski this here is lou boldt the lou boldt of the seattle police department have a heart he was ushered out of the building louis boldt agent majorski asked thats right boldt answered surprised to hear his proper name come from the mouth of a stranger these guys were as stiff as cardboard you mind calling this guy off hes screwing a friend of mine daphne displayed her id for the second time id like to see the warrant that permits him to do that majorski looked over her badge and photo tommy he said stopping the one at the piano why dont you help with the files reluctantly the rookie abandoned his task boldt and daphne briefly exchanged looks of triumph the euphoria was shortlived majorski consulted a typed list he withdrew from his coat pocket youll be hearing from the irs he said to boldt with a disturbing smugness id speak to my accountant if i were you he moved off to reorganize his people my accountant boldt responded desperately the man not listening liz handled their tax returns daphne and boldt were herded toward the door just let me use you as a sounding board daphne pleaded ever persistent i can bounce my ideas off you show you what ive got she feared she had lost him that her effort had been overshadowed by the raid that all was for naught she couldnt leave it as it was she couldnt bear the thought of facing shoswitz alone she needed boldt daffy i can sleep at night my stomach is better than its been in years i take naps in the afternoon with my little einstein purring in his crib i read books imagine that liz and i actually find time to speak a few complete sentences to each other you know what youre asking please she tried ii the way she said it boldt looked at her intently as a sounding board but thats all sure she said unconvincingly thats all he hated losing thursday february sharon shaffer barely tall enough to see over the wheel even with a cushion under her was driving her sevenyearold ford escort daphne in the passenger seat daphne lived on a houseboat at gas works park sharon lived about a mile away on linden a block from the freemont baptist church they carpooled together whenever possible mostly for the company following her meeting with boldt at the hbrary daphne was going to spend the evening at the shelter and then ride home with sharon crossing the colorful freemont bridge toward town daphne strained to see her marina but couldnt with lake union to their left they drove along westlake cluttered marinas gradually evolving into condos and corporate headquarters as they drew closer to town ninth avenue was a nomans land of struggling small businesses then it was the fastfood and franchised commercialism of denny way a ferry horn sounded dull and low like the groan of a huge animal daphnes watch read three twentyeight the ferries represented a kind of freedomisland life isolation escape judging by yesterdays weather daphne said id say the groundhog drownedwere halfway through the rinse cycle sharon agreed four more weeks of this at least makes you really love the place doesnt it you look a little tired sharon said i spent the day poring over some autopsy files the medical examiner wanted me to see its exhausting sounds disgusting i made some headway im not sure cindy chapman is all alone in this meaning i need to run it all by a friend and see what he thinks daphne explained i dont like the sound of your voice im a little scared thats all i dont think i could ever be a cop sharon said she ruminated on this for a moment three years ago if someone had tried to tell me that someday one of my best friends would be a cop and a forensic psychologist at that i would have tagged them for the bird housethe loony bin its weird how things work out in your case theyve worked out rather nicely itll happen to you sharon encouraged its all in your attitude and your attitude is improving somethings working its the therapy whatever it is its good to see have you ever worked with someone after youve had a thing with him astonished sharon cried did you sleep with your therapist i not my therapist dummy just answer the question sharon stopped at a light and said on the street i slept with everyone youd sleep with someone because they had the coke that week coke whores we were all coke whores she drifted off for a moment when she spoke again the pain was gone from her voice but i know what youre asking about and it did happen to me once i slept a couple of times with a guy i met in aa then it fizzled out im not sure why but we kept running into each other at all the meetings it worked out okay except that no matter what we talked about on the surface there was always this sexual tensionat least for megoing on underneath you know i wasnt after himnothing like thatbut you dont forget the really good ones and this guy was really tuned in really good for me but you dont forget do you daphne asked repeating her friends comment i sure dont and it worked out depending on who you ask hes got a woman now i have the shelter but and she laughed its hard to curl up with the shelter and there are times well you know but you cant project one day at a time girl an attitude of gratitude yeah yeah dont preach daphne chided sometimes i think im lucky i got so messed up on the streets without aa well youve heard all of this a number of times even three years into the program sharon was still on a sort of honeymoon sometimes it was all she could find to talk about whos the guy sharon asked just that a guy dont give me that she laughed if you slept with him hes not just a guy hes an endangered species once only once and i didnt even spend the night it isnt the sex those are the dangerous ones sharon said turning the corner and pulling over to the curb yeah i know agreed daphne she looked at her watch thirty minutes in which to do her research youre meeting someone here arent you sharon asked him she stated ill catch up with you later daphne reminded she climbed out of the car wondering why she felt so damned nervous the lakeview animal clinic veterinarian offices occupied the ground floor of a relatively new business complex facing madison the reception area had vinyl flooring in a brick pattern and long benches against each wall in huge letters a sign read keep animals caged or leashed at all times dogs to the left benches cats to the right there were a few of each in the small room the air electric with possible conflict pamela chase short and overweight wore a yellow crew shirt with the words lakeview animal clinic embroidered on her breast pocket she inspected the form that belonged to the cat she was carrying camile hadnt eaten in three days when she had managed to get food down she vomited it back up camile like so much of their work was a referraldr elden tegg was the one vet to whom the other vets turned the examination room had a chart on the wall that diagramed the nerves lenses and muscles in a cats eye there was a large framed color photograph of puget sound at dawn a nuclear submarine just barely visible alongside a pod of surfacing orca whales the room had no window but did possess a large air grate in the ceiling it smelled of rubbing alcohol and disinfectant camile wrestled to be free but lacked the energy for a prolonged struggle she resigned herself to pamelas hold a moment later the door swung open and the veterinarian stepped inside dr elden tegg dvm as his name plaque introduced him stood close to six feet tall in a wiry frame with a dark complexion brown eyes and a black beard carefully trimmed he wore a white lab coat khaki pants and brown leather walking shoes with rawhide trim he had a protruding adams apple that bobbed as he spoke in a grating voice his attention fixed immediately upon his patient pamela chase passed him the cat as he nodded he had exceptionally long fingers immaculately clean hands perfectly manicured nails and he wore a gold wedding ring he studied the cat thoughtfully squeezing probing he looked into her eyes and glanced quickly into her ears loss of appetite and vomiting pamela chase informed him he grunted an acknowledgment they sent pictures along tegg returned the cat to his assistant and approached the light board turning it on and studying the xrays well he asked in a professorial tone did you have a look at these she answered i was thinking we should try a milk shake referring to a barium upper gi have i told you how fortunate i am to have you he asked she glowed with the compliment lets sedate her he said shall we fifteen minutes later she reentered carrying both the cat and the new xrays tegg slapped the large negatives into the clamps on the light box studied them carefully and signaled pamela over to him she responded without thought heres what the others missed he said confidently running one of his clean fingernails over a section of the xray see here and here he asked its not what you see he advised its what you dont see which might explain how it was missed so easily just a ghost see yes now i do theres some kind of obstruction in the stomach maybe a furball but i doubt it lets try an endoscopy and have a look pamela chase prepared all the necessary equipment for the procedure and stood alongside him like a corporal at the side of a general he inserted the black eel of plastic tubing down the cats throat the tiny fiber optic camera inside the animals stomach sent back blackandwhite pictures to the small sony television that tegg studied the problem with something plastic like this is that the veterinarian cannot feel it in the exam cannot see it clearly in an xray and yet to this poor creature it feels like her tummy is full all the time she tries to crap but the stomach rejects it probably picked it up off the floor on the screen under his direction a small set of pinchers moved like jaws tegg deftly maneuvered them to apprehend the foreign object a moment later he extruded the endoscopy tube from the cat a small piece of soft plastica swimmers ear plugfell into the stainless steel dish that pamela held tegg stated clinically that should do it send along the usual instructions regarding the anesthesia also some buffers to help out with the abrasion to the stomach lining if the vomiting continues they should reschedule immediately he moved toward the door whats next he asked her you havent taken a break all day she said whats next he repeated a toy poodle she advised checking a list blood in the urine are we set up for surgery he asked all set she replied give me five minutes he told her then he added sincerely i hate toy poodles the downtown branch of seattles public library is two blocks from the public safety building the police departments central offices it is overshadowed by an intriguing skyline sprouting new glass and steel in amounts that ten years earlier would have seemed inconceivable the big money had hit seattle in the mids bringing with it a renewed downtown renovations public transit and the ubiquitous shopping centers the thirty and fortystory towers competed for the best view of breathtaking elliott bay and puget sound to the west and the majesty of glaciercapped mount rainier to the southeast by city standards seattles downtown is remarkably small contained to the south by the kingdome and to the north by the seattle center a holdover from the worlds fair to the west is the greenmarble estuary with its gray ferries and black freighters to the east downtown is stopped by interstate pill hill and seattle college downtown is surrounded for miles by rolling hills blanketed in twostory clapboard homes and communities like ballard ravenna northgate and richmond highlands it is a city of water the sound lakes canals and rivers for boldts taste the citys growth and expansion was happening too quickly seemed too uncontrolled seattle was learning life the hard way theft drugs organized crime and shrinking budgets its art culture and traditions kept it vital and unique its music dance fine arts its fishing sailing and native american history its festivals and celebrations its libraries museums theaters and public market the library is a mixture of formed concrete and garden plate glass windows and deciduous trees as with any such library entering it is like stepping into a silent movie on the thursday afternoon of their meeting it was a little busier than usual probably because of the drizzle boldt thought in a city with a winter climate like seattles the library took on a position of great importance a kind of mecca for the mind the faces in these rooms were not pale nor were they dispirited the people of seattle were a vibrant redcheeked resilient bunch whom boldt counted as his own the wet winter weather extremely temperate considering the latitude was essentiala few years of drought had taught the locals that much this weatheror its reputation was what kept the masses away it was the citys best defense in its increasing battle against californication boldt entered wearing a baby carrier that supported his son miles he joined daphne at one of the large reading tables on the second floor as far away from others as possible she steeled herself for what lay ahead this was her chance to convince him they had a caseto win him over that child hanging around his neck represented his other life she couldnt allow herself to think of it in those terms boldt was a friend certainly but more importantly he was a cop with the connections and talent to make this case happen this was her focus the image of cindy chapmans bleeding incision was lodged in her mind on the table in front of her lay three pendaflex folders and a pile of photocopies from her research at the library she felt both exhausted and afraid and the two sensations fed on each other injecting her with an anxiety she found difficult to overcome without him without some male to support her god how she resented itshe had little or no chance of convincing lieutenant phil shoswitz to open this investigation she wore gray stirrup pants a white blouse buttoned high and a crimson scarf to hide her scar she had her brownred hair pulled back off her face a pair of simple silver studs in her ears boldt was as always disheveled wrinkled worn khakis a tattersall shirt brown walking shoes with thick rubber hiking tread he looked tiredprobably wasand older than he had last night at the big joke meet my son miles boldt said proudly speaking in a hushed voice dropping into a chair and putting down the baby bag he carried with him miles he said to his sleeping sixmonthold child in the carrier this is the other woman ive told you so much about hes adorable i hope he gets his mothers hairand her brains daphne said he glanced down at the folders and then up at her disapprovingly youre not supposed to take these out of the office he declared they arent ours dixie gave them to me she said referring to the chief pathologist of the medical examiners office he thought they might help convince you that we have something we i need a partner someone with whom shoswitz will allow me to partner as of this morning dixie is a believer but i cant very well partner with a pathologist wait a minute i agreed to be a sounding board thats all there are a dozen guys who could run with this thing his eyes strayed to the folders again and she realized she was taking the wrong approach with him for lou boldt it was always the victimsthe evidencethat did the talking she said you take each one of these autopsies separately and they dont say much you add them up and weve got a problem boldt leaned forward his big hand shielding the boys small head and dragged the folders across the table maybe i dont want to read these he said sensing the trap they represented she willed him to open the top folderjust get him started that was all it would take sure you do she argued three of them youre suggesting a pattern he said thinking aloud pathology reportsso theyre dead theyre connected to what happened to cindy chapman or i wouldnt be here would i she leaned forward and nudged the files even closer if dixie came up with these then the pattern the similarity between them has to do with the way in which they were killed the way they died she corrected and who they were or werent all three filed as unsolved cases there may be more runaways they make such nice victims no one knows theyre here no one knows theyre gone dont do this to me to you this isnt about you she ran her red nail down the spine of each folder this is about glenda sherman peter blumenthal and julia walker he reached for the first folder but stopped himself once again she said how do you prove something like this hes counting on thatwhoever is doing this hes counting on our paying no attention these kids are as good as john does to us theyre nobodies i want to help to do what i can but its not easy there are a lot of forces at play here even if i did reactivate theres no saying id end up on this particular ticket im not buying that the lieutenant would do anything to have you back hed meet any conditions you laid out scheduling day care anything whats the latest with the irs i i you dont miss a beat do you the baby spit out the pacifier boldt caught it in a reflex only time or instinct had developed she was in over her head there were a lot of forces at play he returned the pacifier to the waiting lips he placed his huge hand on the boys tiny head and encouraged him back to sleep youre a natural cherish or perish maybe youre right maybe you shouldnt read these files i dont want to take you away from him smooth very smooth i mean it i know you mean it thats the problem you didnt answer meabout the irs i i we have to make an appointment liz and i shes our accountant is it a big deal if it means more money yes its a big deal liz had a horrible delivery yes i heard it ran into some serious money insurance companies are wonderful until you show them the bill anyway you want to remind me that im in a financial bind and that liz and i could use a second income that i could borrow from the credit union i know what youre up to point taken okay he scrunched his nose do you smell something he grabbed the bag and stood in a minute everyone in the library will smell it my son and i are going to pay a little visit to the boys room you read these she persisted and you realize hes a surgeon has to be that gives us a place to start a surgeon he asked eyeing the folders she reached over and hoisted the top folder can you read and change diapers at the same time absolutely not then let me she said motioning for the baby you wont like it its messy you read the files ill handle mr miles youre a poet she motioned again for the child boldt unfastened the carrier and passed his son to her along with the bag cloth diapers she noticed classy environmentally sound thats lizever the proper mother and citizen read she chided she didnt want to hear about liz when she returned wondering whether she could ever live with doing that several times a day his face was buried in one of the files the two others were spread open in front of him fast reader fast learner lou boldt how sure are you about this he asked accepting miles he thanked her and attempted to return him to the carrier fully awake the boy struggled to be free tying up boldts hands and attention cindy chapman the woman who sought out the shelteris missing a kidney she touched the files all three of these kids died from hemorrhaging associated with a and she quoted surgically absent organ two kidneys walker and sherman blumenthal was missing a lung i think we may have a doctor selling stolen organs on the black market a black market for organs she fingered the photocopies in front of her is it so impossible a thought i have a halfdozen articles here wall street journal new york times the new yorker vanity fair fama new england journal of medicine in third world countries harvesting is an everyday occurrence thats what its called organ harvesting nice ring to it huh organized well run quite the business fifteen thousand dollars a kidneythats the going rate fifteen thousand its so obvious that something like this would grow out of the lack of donor organs transplant technology has outraced supply its all in here she said again tapping her copies of the articles there are not enough farsighted people out there who think to become donors prior to their deaths livers kidneys lungs hearts ovaries testicles eyes bone marrow you name it theres a shortage in nearly every category and what happens when theres a shortage its simple economics third world countries are hit the worst because they lack the technology for lifesupport the dialysis machines the respirators egypt india argentina brazilkidneys practically trade on the open market if youre an egyptian farmer whos had a bad crop you go into the city and sell one of your kidneys you come home a few weeks later with ten years worth of income and when those organs are in short supply maybe the doctors there turn to their colleagues overseas fifteen grand a kidney lungs about the same livers and hearts go for ten to twenty times that but not here not in this country not in my backyard come on what would you pay to stay alive what happens when you find yourself number one hundred and fifty on an organ donor list where theyre averaging three transplants a month and your doctor has given you six months to live you start making inquiries you beg borrow or steal the money necessary and you buy what no one will donate you establish a market where theres demand someone will supply it never fails if youre a doctor can you imagine how frustrating it must be to see your patients die because so few people will take the time to fill out a couple of forms youre right about it giving us a way to investigate it us you said us what you do is identify their method of selection meaning if it is organizedif it is a business just as youve suggestedthen this surgeon must have some way of identifying of selecting his donors meaning she asked wanting to hear him think this through aloud she could feel his enthusiasm she almost had him listen either theyre stealing them in which case chapman and these others are innocent victims or theyre buying them contracting them from people either desperate for money or sympathetic to their cause or both like your egyptian farmer right unfortunately we dont know which we need to establish that first we need to know their game plan how do they identify their donors that comes first these organs are perishable goods she reminded there are time factors involved do they kidnap the donor steal some kid off the streets thats a hell of a risk to take theyre runaways whos going to notice but why take that kind of risk if you can cut a deal instead what if the donor comes into the plan willingly that makes a lot more sense cindy chapmans a victim lou daphne said obstinately we dont know that what if she offered to sell her kidney what if it was voluntary runaway teenagers are not exactly long on cash i dont believe that why use electroshock if theyre part of your conspiracy she sure as hell didnt volunteer for that dont get all high and mighty damn it your point is welltaken okay i agree with you the electroshock doesnt fit okay you agree with me but you wont help me i will help you all i can but you wont take it to the lieutenant i cant get that involved not yet anyway he looked down wiped some drool from the babys mouth extenuating circumstances he added quickly but i will help if cindy chapman dies then will you take it to shoswitz for me is that what you need a fresh victim shes in bad shape you know you can really piss me off when you try good im trying real hard i noticed have you run chapmans clothes through the lab he asked she had been withholding this and another file from him hoping to time their delivery correctly and sink the hook leave it to him to ask she thought courtesy of the professor she explained referring to the head of the departments forensic sciences unit she handed the first of the two files to boldt he rushed this for me it was the state labs preliminary hairs and fibers report i used your name she added reluctantly she pulled both files to the table top handing him only the one he opened it and read the top of the page listed the identification numbers followed by how they had been received in this case handdelivered by sgt daphne matthews spd the next section was divided into two columns evidence description and conclusion boldt scanned the conclusions he suggested lamoia could handle this she answered quickly as good as his instincts are john is about ten years short on experience and a lifetime short on manners he just doesnt have the qualifications you do he waved a finger at her youre playing with me again i dont you wish she teased not in your wildest dreams it provoked a grin what do you know about my dreams he teased right back animal hairs found on her jeans he said we dismiss them too common blood type opositive he rummaged through the other files before him she filled in these other three were also type opositive she indicated the stack next to her and when you read these medical stories youll understand why type o is the biggest blood group the biggest market he glanced up understanding theyre all four the same blood type they select their donors by blood type thats our lead the professor forwarded the animal hairs to the udub she said meaning the university of washington to attempt to identify the particular breeds youre getting off track its the blood group match thats important lets stick with that for a minute the animal hairs are important too i cant get too excited over some animal hairs we all have pets and if we dont our friends do most of us come in contact with pet hairs on a daily basis most of us she agreed handing him the last file but not cindy chapman he started to say something but caught himself and opened the file containing a copy of cindy chapmans hospital admission forns scanning the contents quickly he said you have been busy allergies she hinted she watched his eyes track down the form allergic to house pets he read aloud severe reactions shallow breathing elevated pulse rate it was how she felt at the moment theres no way she would have voluntarily been in a situation that would literally cover her clothing with animal hair thats good police work daffy he said complimenting her but she could sense a reluctance in him but she said waiting but its too broad a field too difficult to trace it was the professors idea to run them over to the university not mine there were some white hairs that sparked his interest the professor will run down any hair or fiber its his job it doesnt mean its worth getting excited about she was excited she hated to admit it she also hated it when he was rightwhen he could read her so easily she had long hours invested in this she wanted something to show for it how could guys like lou boldt stay with an investigation without victories along the way miles spit out his pacifier boldt plugged it back in boldt said id say we focus on this blood group overlap thats the closest thing to hard evidence we have and it isnt much animal hairs wont convince shoswitz you have a case we have three victimsfour including cindy she complained masking her relief at his use of we unfortunately we cant choose the evidence these people leave behind dixie says each file indicates that there was some physical evidence stored from each autopsy tissue samples that kind of thing they do that for the unsolveds and john does hes having the evidence brought up he seemed pretty optimistic dixies always optimistic he says that surgeons sometimes leave signatures in their work style technique hes going to review and compare autopsy photos when he has the time that would help boldt said but knowing his workload i wouldnt count on it being very soon he reviewed the files again so were looking for a surgeon thats another avenue worth pursuing when in doubt take the direct route not necessarily just surgeons she corrected him he nodded a surgeon another kind of specialist who wishes he were a surgeon a medical student an impersonatora fake a retiree but of all of these a surgeon is still the most likely can you draw up a profile for us she nodded she could feel him committing to the investigation she wanted to hear it spoken she wanted to snare him beyond any chance of retreat she asked how many surgeons are there in seattle and of these how many are transplant surgeons a handful and if we were both to question themi mean you and i togetheryou could ask your questions and i could ask mine and we just might find this person there are certain traps i could laypsychological trapsthat he might fall into you dont want to tangle with somebody like this daffy i dont have to remind you of that his cruelty hit her hard involuntarily she tugged her collar up higher on her neck as she glared at him hiding that scar for an instant she hated him there was no need for that she snapped sometimes youre just another insensitive ape you know that he apologized several times but she didnt buy it he had wanted to remind her of her mistake she had failed to react she knew that she didnt need him to remind her she let it go back to business when we talk to the girls at the shelter about how they raise money out on the streets one thing that comes up besides selling sex or running drugs is selling their blood theyve all done it all it takes is a fake id even sharons done it she passed him several photocopies they were from back issues of medical journals both blood and tissue type are extremely important in transplants thats where a doctor begins in what can sometimes be a long process of matching a donor with a recipient these articles will fill you in he scanned the articles quickly blood banks he mumbled then he said outright they select their potential donors from blood banks she said its certainly a strong possibility one worth following up well divide and conquer boldt said talk to cindy chapman press her for information did she sell her kidney did she sell her blood ill pay a visit to our local blood banks he supported miles as he stood she caught his eyes she held him there waiting say it she said he stared at her you cant just walk out of here after all of this and not say it is it so important boldt asked its a young womans life she reminded you tell me he nodded in resignation im in dr elden tegg retained the only key to the lakeview animal clinics refrigerated walkin because of the drugs it contained he never would have chosen to install the walkin himself but this office had previously been a small italian restaurant and the walkin served a useful purpose both as the repository for the medications and as a holding closet for the surgical waste and dead animals that were byproducts of any busy surgical clinic the man he met at the clinics back door was short and stocky dressed in a blackleather jacket with black hair that peaked sharply in the center of his forehead donnie maybeck was hired freelance to drive the clinics chuck wagontransporting the various bags of organic waste to a private incinerator because they would temporarily store this waste in the walkin he made only two trips a week tegg unlocked the heavy door to the walkin and stepped back allowing the man to do his job but keeping an eye on him because of the abundance of controlled substances wanna gimme a hand with this maybeck asked tegg he had horrible teeth chipped and gray with decay this question posed as it was signaled tegg he stepped inside the cooler and pulled the door behind him until it thumped shut closing them in make it quick he said you could see your breath in here tegg crossed his arms to fend off the cold the man in the blackleather jacket spoke softly some guy called me about a meeting said it cant wait what cant wait what guy sounded like a chink said a doc up in vancouver recommended you asked me to set up a meet with you wanted it asap like tonight vancouver tegg knew this could only mean one thing he felt hot all of a sudden the guy says either you agree to meet him or no theres no bullshit with this guy tegg felt his knees go weak the man next to him continued said he was prepared to pay some major bucks and what did you say tegg asked anxiously i didnt tell him squat okay id like to know how the fuck he got my name im checking with you doc thats all no need to sprout a fuckin hemmi i got this covered tegg attempted some measure of selfcontrol he slowed his thoughts down separated them and dealt with them one by one his thoughts tended to leap ahead of him making the present something he saw only upon reflection so that much of his life felt more like instant replay than the real thing he lived life as much from recalling that which had just occurred as he did from experiencing it making him feel like two different peopleone moving through life and the other attempting to come to grips with his actions could he allow an opportunity like this to pass him by on the other hand could he protect himself well enough from the possible dangers listen the other man said youre my needle man for felix tonight dont forget you agreed to do that for me so what if i got this guy to meet us out there tegg had forgotten about this commitment it rattled himit wasnt like him to forget anything even something so distasteful maybeck added listen i could run point for you get this chink out there ahead of you check him out keep you close by if its cool i give you a shout on the car phone if you dont hear from me by say nine oclock i get rid of him and you hang until its clear to come in and help me out with felix one thing about these fights we got bitchin security if this guys trouble hes gonna wish he stayed home know what i mean tegg suddenly realized that in surgery his thoughts did not get ahead of himhis hands kept up effortlessly he wondered if this explained his love of surgery he said to this other man what if he doesnt like the setup i sure as hell wouldnt meet somebody at a dog fight ive never even been to a dog fight hey its not our problem okay this is pay or play he said misquoting things he knew nothing about this mans vocal drivel always set tegg on edge if he doesnt want to show tough titties for him tegg contemplated all of this while the other man gathered the plastic bags of contaminated waste set it up tegg ordered he turned and punched the large throwbar that released the walkins outside latch he walked slowly down the hall pensive and concentrating he sensed that everything had changed the closer he drew to the examination room the more put off he was by the thought of cats and dogs boring meaningless work earlier in the day he had simply wanted to do his job wellget through another day have some fun earn some good money listen to some wagner all the while working a blade now all he wanted was to meet this unidentified man he glanced at his watch impatiently hours to go he looked in on pamela chase who was just bringing up another set of xrays ever the diligent assistant we didnt get much on our first series she explained you do good work she glowed at this comment tegg knew exactly how to play her how to feed her needs she fed his in her own wayher unending compliments her adoring glances other ways too he stepped up to the xrays childs play compared to the real work that lay ahead of him he could feel her sweet breath warm against his cheek as she leaned in to share in this exploration he moved over so that she could see better and allowed his hand to gently brush her bottom as if accidentally she didnt flinch her eyes searching out the elusive fracture in the fuzzy blackandgray images besides he thought selfamused she knew this contact was no accident she loved it she loved everything about him whose turn is it to heat up dinner boldt asked his wife feeling a little apprehensive about how to steer the conversation to the subject of his returning to work how to negotiate his future with her they had found a routine that worked he was about to challenge all that and he knew before he began that flexibility was not her long suit she was changing clothes out of her executivebanker look and into some blue jeans and a cotton sweater she had tossed onto the bed it was past sevenhe was starved liz answered i suppose its mine but i refuse lets go out what about einstein boldt asked looking over at miles who was fighting to keep his eyes open not wanting to miss anything all so new to him each of his expressions meant the world to boldt an inquisitive glance a furrowed brow simple pleasures okay she said you win takeout and im buying if i make the call will you pick it up he asked have you noticed how much we negotiate everything chinese vietnamese thai you name it fish and chips he suggested too fattening you said i could name it i lied she patted her belly how about sushi wheres your wallet the front hall i think make it a big order im starved and that stuff never stays with me and get some beer would you while boldt was gone liz had put miles to sleep when they finished eating boldt caught her hand and led her out to the living room where he sat her down it was after nine the irs shut down the joke last night confiscated all the books the irs so thats whats bothering you they want to talk to us disbelief came over her eyes us oh god i hope they dont know about the cash income i dont see what else it could be oh shit i signed that return we both signed the return but cash cash under the table how could they goddamn that bear berenson he must have tried to deduct it damn it all you realize the penalty well face oh my god and the joke is closed down i can look around for other work but no ones going to pay me like bear did oh god you realize the penalty i wonder if they can send you to jail for something like this moneys all they want its all anybody wants but thats just the point what money every available cent we have is going to pay off the hospital boldt didnt want her thinking about this he glanced back toward the room where miles now slept and remembered the complications of his delivery as if it had been yesterday would he ever forget that night could any price tag be put on having them both alive well manage manage you dont do the books i do we wont manage thats just the point we need that income are they going to audit us is that what you mean oh god i dont believe this he hated himself for manipulating her like this for doing to her what in her own way daphne had done to him but on this subject liz had special handling written all over her i heard an awful story today about a girl named cindy chapman they nail you for unreported income you know you know that dont you shes a sixteenyearold runaway as he had hoped liz momentarily forgot about the irs what are you talking about they stole her kidney boldt explained who did she gasped worse than that she hemorrhaged she almost died sixteenyears old he repeated lou there it was that flicker of recognition he had been expecting but dreading if i go active again im eligible for a loan through the credit union her eyes grew sad and then found his she didnt speak just stared boldt said wed have to juggle miles i realize that maybe day care he said tentatively expecting an eruption instead she turned a ghastly pale she rose her back to him and walked into their bedroom she shut the door behind her closing him out he loved this woman her sense of humor her courage the way she laughed when it was least expected the way she reached into the shower to test the temperature little things all of them important the way she hummed to herself when she didnt know he could hear her sense of organization the silly presents she would show up with on no particular occasion her pursuit of pleasure the way she made love when she was really happy he could hear the radio through the closed door the news the weather more rain they couldnt take any more rain the flooding was as bad as it had ever been suicide rate was up bungie jumping off aurora bridge without the bungie cords he looked around for something to do lately miles this woman and the big joke had been his whole life now he found himself thinking about cindy chapman and daphne matthews maybe hed try to talk her into this in the morning maybe he would admit to a promise already made maybe cindy chapman was an isolated case maybe there wasnt some guy out there carving up runaways after all maybe maybe maybe he went to the bedroom door and opened it cautiously mind if i join you she was on the bed her jeans unbuttoned she shrugged more rain she said as if nothing had come before yeah i heard she patted the comforter beside her he knew that look forgiving cautiously optimistic he loved her for it boldt stepped inside kicking off his shoes and shut the door a hundred yards down the dark narrow overgrown lane elden tegg encountered a truck blocking his way a huge man with an untrimmed beard asked him his name checked his drivers license consulted a list and finally backed out of the way allowing him to pass he drove under a canopy formed by the limbs of trees the road was all mud and leaves he parked the trooper amid a group of battered pickup trucks and hurried through the rain toward the large barn a yellow light escaped the slats in the wood he pulled open the door and stepped inside he smelled cigarettes hay manure and musty rotting wood he smelled a metallic salty odor as well one that as a veterinarian he knew only too well animal blood he stepped into shadow and studied the scene before him the fighting ring a wooden box tenfeet square had been hastily constructed out of gray barn wood it occupied an area in the middle of the wide dirt aisle between the stalls a hayloft cloaked in darkness loomed above them the buildings only light came from a single bare bulb suspended directly above the center of the ring it cast harsh shadows on the rough faces of the nearly twenty men in attendance this scene repulsed him pitting dogs to the death he repaired life he did not waste it a head in the crowd turned and faced him the same man from earlier in the day donnie maybeck his gold rolex winked at tegg as it caught the light he approached tegg with an exaggerated stride he smiled flashing his ragged graybrown teeth at tegg like an old whore lifting her skirt at a wouldbe john are we set tegg asked everythings cool he indicated the loft with a nod but before we get to that we gotta do felix spurred by an act of local government that amounted to canine genocide for all pit bulls tegg had rescued felix and others from certain death in favor of lives devoted to science and research these dogshis creations in a waywere now hidden out at teggs farm where he maintained a surgical research laboratory as much as tegg hated the idea the only way to fully test the success of the latest surgery was to fight this dog in the ring although maybeck had assured him that there was always someone competent on hand to sew up any inflicted woundsa socalled needle mantegg did not want anybody else doctoring the dog besides he thought this dogs insides would only confuse another vet and raise suspicions about teggs practices im not here to fight him only to provide medical attention if he needs it tegg reminded hes up next maybeck explained up against stormin norman you understand norman aint lost no fight in six gos but im gonna need your help doc youre the only one can handle him where is he tegg asked donnie maybeck led him to a creamcolored airline travel cage perched high on a hay bale the animal inside bared its razorsharp teeth and growled ferociously at donnie who grinned back with his own ragged teeth pressing his face close to the grid of bars on the door teasing the dog with a growl the pit bull charged the door so strongly that the cage nearly slid off the bale dont taunt him tegg protested at the sound of teggs voice the dogs behavior reversed it quieted and pushed its wet nose tightly into the bars of the cage toward tegg see this here is your dog doe youre the one who saved himand he knows it you gotta help me do this i showed you how to work the collar what kind of fool cant work a shock collar you can push a button cant you it was a rare display of spleen for tegg a terrible sign of weakness he regretted it immediately maybeck did not take well to denigrating comments about his intelligence or lack thereof maybecks eyes hardened i dont want to use no collar before the fight it might weaken him and i would hate to lose him the idea that felix might lose cut tegg to the quick maybeck was rightthis was no time to shock the dog tegg kept the shock collars remote device in hand as he led felix from the cage leashed him and led him toward the ring to teggs delight felix behaved impeccably under escort maybeck followed but at a distance once alongside the ring tegg cradled felix in his arms and removed the shock collar felixs opponent stormin norman waited in the far corner around his throat he carried a dozen healed scars of a warrior a threehundredpound man with a beard of barbed wire peered out from beneath a john deere farmers cap and declared solemnly to the death the announcement sobered and silenced the spectators the rain drummed on the roof the air went electric with anticipation felix fixed his attention on his opponent i cant do this tegg told maybeck even in the name of research he was spared any such decision as the other dog was released felix broke loose and dove into the ring the dogs exploded at one another a roar went up from the crowd tegg withdrew to the shadows he suddenly felt as if he was being watched he looked around no one again he scanned the barns interior and again could identify no one interested in him then he looked up into the hayloft there in the soft shadows stood a man dressed in a business suit his full attention focused on tegg who recognized him immediately as wong kei an infamous seattle mob boss his face was constantly in the news though this was a different face tonight pale skin stretched tightly across sharp bones hard spiritless eyes a man desperately sad an explosion of applause from the audience signaled the end of the fight maybeck tugged on teggs arm and pulled him toward the ring felix was circling the bloodied corpse of his failed opponent not a scratch on him doe you understand he dropped norman like he was a toy poodle norman not a scratch youre a fucking genius doc a real fucking genius expressionless disgusted tegg collected the dog and returned him to the travel cage tegg glanced up into the loft he told maybeck ill see him now by the time they reached the hayloft via a set of rickety stairs and tegg had submitted himself to a frisksearch by one of wong keis two stocky bodyguards another contest had begun below there were no introductions a man of wong keis reputation needed none in and out of the courtsalways acquitted they sat opposite each other on hay bales maybeck and the bodyguards remained standing wong kei got to the point my wife is fiftyseven years old she is suffering from unstable angina that will shortly claim her life if nothing is done she had her first myocardial infarction two years ago as i am sure you are aware he said venomously heart transplants are refused to anyone over the age of fiftyfive my wifes case is made worse by both a rare blood typeabnegativeand the fact that shes an extremely small woman i arranged a private transplant surgeon some time ago a man willing to help hes out of vancouver he attempted to locate an unregistered donor heart but to date has been unsuccessful he recommended i contact your associate i understand you have found him a kidney from time to time i must admit that i am not terribly comfortable turning to a veterinarian for a human heart that is one of the reasons i wanted this meeting to meet you he paused as the crowd below erupted in cheers i make no promises tegg stated i have done my homework the asian said i would not be here had i not as a veterinarian you have few equals in a situation such as your wifesone of life and deathtime is the real enemy time forces certain decisions im perfectly aware of that how long does your wife have he asked taking charge but time wasnt teggs real enemy internally a dialogue of a different sort began now that the opportunity had presented itself how far would he go to erase a mistake he had made nearly twenty years earlier could he knowingly sacrifice a human being she will be strong enough to move in a few days to vancouver yes days if i put my wifes life into your hands i will expect results he announced sternly if you cant help me you must say so now if its a question of money tegg waved his hand to stop the man he did not want maybeck to hear the amount being offered a heart was worth no less than fivehundred thousand if wong kei had indeed done his homework as he claimed then he knew that much im sure youll be generous tegg said the money accounted for only a part of his stake in this there was more to be gained here are you interested extremely may i count on you tegg glanced briefly at maybeck the man looked frightened you didnt fail a man of wong keis reputation the mobster was telling him that much by just the look in his eye he wanted a commitment tegg answered i will have to do my homework hmm well have to see whats available he pointed to a file folder on a bale of hay her records seize control thats how you dealt with people like wong kei the asian passed him the folder we will begin looking for a donor immediately how do i reach you wong kei removed a business card wrote a phone number on the back of it and handed it to tegg youll be hearing from me tegg said confidently they didnt shake hands wong kei rose crossed the darkened loft and disappeared down the stairs maybeck sat in the shadow of a post well have to zoom the donor to get the heart am i right maybeck asked believing maybeck was nervous about this tegg returned to a justification decided upon many months earlier if one human life is sacrificed to save many then what harm is done if not one but four five six lives are saved does this not balance the scales maybeck answered i just mean in terms of what we gotta do we go zooming someone this had better be big money reading the file in the limited light tegg spoke without looking up check the database for an abnegative shell have to be small a hundred pounds tops all you do is bring me the donor youll be rich after this fifty thousand for your part thats what you want isnt it through the cavity in the hayloft came the chorus of barking dogs among them tegg could hear felix as clearly as if he alone were barking felixs superiority in the ring confirmed teggs brilliance there would be more tests of course there always were life it seemed was one long test victory came not from a single win but from a series of accomplishments he stopped to take one last look at donnie maybeck who still hadnt moved mention of that number had numbed him just right as tegg descended the stairs he felt exhilarated this was his chance to erase the slate to prove something to himself to give something back he intended to make the most of it juggling his household chores and his role as mr mom boldt visited two area blood banks friday morning with his son miles in tow it was not until the second interview that he learned that the donation of whole blood was strictly voluntary he had neglected to raise this question at the first location plasma centers paid not blood banks bloodlines incorporated seattles only plasma center occupied the back half of the ground floor of a former first avenue warehouse which had years before been converted into retail space then a dry cleanerlaundromat boldt remembered them both a uniform rental shop now occupied the half that fronted first avenue mannequins dressed as nurses and security guards stood at inanimate mock attention in the display windows the entrance to the plasma center was from the side street up four cement steps through a set of glass doors stenciled in blue with the name bloodlines as well as a parent corporation lifeways incwhich in finer print turned out to be a subsidiary of the atlanta charter and group health foundation boxes inside boxes a reminder of lizs banking world reception held two orangevinyl padded benches each fronted by an oakveneer coffee table stained with white rings and littered with thumb worn outdated copies of people magazine a pair of dustyleafed silk ficus trees stood forlorn in opposing corners the dirt bucket that held the closest one had been used as an ashtray a large sign thanked you for not smoking a coke machine its light burned out hummed from across the expanse of institutional gray carpet there were several doors leading from this room the one most often used boldt sawnoticing the accumulated dirt around the doorknobwas to the left of reception a high counter attended by a matronly woman wearing a nurses uniform that had probably been rented from next door behind her were shelves filled with files marked with colorful alphabetized index tabs her name tag read mildred hatch she looked tired suspicious and unhappy a couple of gary larson cartoons were taped up for everyone to see you been with us before she asked she was apparently used to a regular clientele boldts face didnt jog her memory id like to speak to someone in administration if i may miles nearly got his hand on one of the cartoons boldt arranged himself to prevent another attempt concerning one of your donors not possible thats strictly confidential information cant help you she pointed out a paragraph on a photocopied flyer a stack of which waited to the right of a computer terminal boldt explained im not trying to find out who the person is i already know that i just need a few questions answered someone in administration if you please i dont please not easily she warned she found a pen your name he told her your company boldt said seattle police department it shocked her she flushed why didnt you say so she asked angrily i was hoping i wouldnt have to the baby threw me off she explained you always lug her around him boldt corrected she looked closely at miles for the first time briefly she softened he knew in an instant that she didnt have any kids and by her ring finger no husband either name of the donor she asked thats strictly confidential boldt said her eyes flashed cold like green glass marbles she had plucked her eyebrows thin and bleached the hair above her lip a real beauty she had missed with her eye shadow cynthia chapman boldt told her the donors name is cynthia chapman she consulted her terminal striking the keyboard with blunt stubby fingers when she paused there was something in her eyes that confirmed she had found the name shes in there boldt asked his heart racing the woman didnt answer she picked up the phone and spoke too softly for boldt to hear by the time she started her third call he said today if possible a street person entered a bum in his midfifties although a quick glance and the clothes might have fooled you not quite pressed but not all that wrinkled not exactly cleanshaven but not disgusting by any means it was his wornheeled unpolished shoes that gave him away that and the pungent scent of a cheap aftershave which attempted to cover a week without a shower boldt watched as this man located the clipboard and ran the attached pen through the multiplechoice boxes with the practiced efficiency of a regular the man knew the routine he signed it handed it to miss mildred hatch and headed for the coke machine blood sugar boldt thought they drink the pops to keep from getting lightheaded he seemed a man more accustomed to muscatel he headed over to the orange seats and a back issue of people boldt wondered how they guaranteed a clean blood supply then he took one of the flyers and read while miss hatch continued her two jobs simultaneously the phone pasted in the crook of her neck the bums application form being studied boxbybox answerbyanswer the blood was thoroughly tested for drugs alcohol and aids the flyer explained a process that took four to seven days donors were personally interviewed each time they gave blood by signing the form you were verifying your personal activities sexual preferences and your working knowledge of the condition of your blood anyone caught lying would be permanently refused acceptance by any branch of bloodlines the plasma was paid for only after it had cleared the testing labs they paid fifteen dollars a pint you could donate every fortyeight hours but no more than three times a week it seemed impossible how can a person give blood three times a week he blurted out without looking up from her terminal mildred hatch answered automatically we dont take your blood only the plasma the red blood cells are returned to you during the process the plasma is removed by a centrifuge your body replaces the plasma within twentyfour hours she glanced at him then as if to say dont you know anything boldt folded up the flyer and slipped it in behind miles who chose that moment to become vocal boldt found himself bouncing around the room in an effort to settle the boy down the waiting donors attention fixed on him in a puzzled expression embarrassed boldt found the mens room and prepared miles a bottle little murmurs of satisfaction little slurps of joy mildred hatch signaled the man who went through the moreoften used door a the source of the medicinal odors that permeated this place five minutes later following two more extended phone calls miss hatch gave boldt the nod permitting him to enter the inner sanctum which as it turned out was through door bjust to the left of the coke machine he helped steady his sons bottle and found his way down a narrow corridor flanked by several workers tending computer work stations was the database of their donors available to any one of them was one of these persons directly or indirectly involved in the harvests with this the only plasma bank in the city and a policemans knowledge that something connected the four runaways boldt experienced the electricity of anticipation he didnt believe much in sixthsense phenomena but there was no denying the quick beating of his heart and the internal sense that there was evidence to be uncovered here he put questions to a ms dundee a twoseater black woman with no neck and huge breasts her hands were swollen like some corpses boldt had seen and she wheezed when she spoke she guarded all her explanations and smiled in the same contrived manner as a usedcar salesman her face was so bloated he could barely see any eyes and so round and wide that she seemed more a caricature of herself miles didnt like her either on first sight of her he started crying and became a pest he pushed his bottle aside demanding boldts repeated attention an ever cautious ms dundee requested boldts police identification boldt went through the ruse of pretending to search for it realizing at that moment that events had led him to the inevitable would she call downtown and ask after him whether she did or not boldt now had no choice but to pay lieutenant phil shoswitz a visit technically he was impersonating a police officer it seemed ludicrous to him but he could be arrested for it just answer me this please he said to the huge woman is cynthia chapman in your database or not she nodded reluctantly boldt felt a flood of relief curiosity surged through him so many questions to ask could the harvester have selected cindy from this database had he kidnapped her or was a child desperate enough to sell her blood also willing to sell a kidney were the names of dixies other three victims in this database as well does bloodlines keep an active database of all its previous donors he asked she viewed him suspiciously their eyes met this can all be done formally he informed her warrants subpoenas attorneys press have you ever been to our city police department ms dundee there is a database of all our donors yes boldt withdrew his notebook from his coat pocket i have three other names id like to check he said he supplied her with the names of the three runawaysjulia walker glenda sherman and peter blumenthalall of whom had been missing an organ at the time of death ms dundee entered these names into her computer terminal a moment later she said nope none of them damn it all he protested in disappointment then a thought occurred to him how far back do your records go a donor is kept active twelve months the database is swept monthly swept cleaned up and what happens to those records he asked our data processing department in our home office maintains a complete donor list thats required by the federal government in case health problems arise in the blood supply she added as a way of showing off the care they took you cant donate without a social security number a current address and a phone number boldt having witnessed the street person in the reception area wondered how careful they were in obtaining accurate identification but he didnt press the issue can you check these three names with the home office another expression of disapproval boldts patience was running thin how much could he tell her this isnt about traffic tickets ms dundee a little cooperation now could go a long way toward protecting your companys image later this branchs image just what kind of trouble are you talking about why dont you make that call for me and lets see where it leads then maybe well discuss it a few minutes and a brief phone conversation later she informed him theyll call back it wont take long boldt used the down time to press for more information miles had dozed off how many of your employees would have access to your donor database he asked she hesitated unsure how much to share with him a woman was kidnapped ms dundee kidnapping is a federal offense the kidnapping may or may not be related to her association with bloodlines am i getting through she answered at this branch about two dozen of us would have access to our client base maybe more hard copies of the files are kept behind registration and is registration manned constantly constantly no i would doubt it no you said this branch how many are there in seattle just this one and the others were a regional corporation mr boldt twentyfour branches in eleven states i can give you the literature if you want or i could put you in touch with our home office in san francisco the database would contain a donors blood type would it not blood groups of course and personal information meaning dyou tell me you mentioned home address how about age marital status all of those yes accessible from any terminal no the terminals deal with donors only by donor number the personal information requires an access code only i have the access code and only two terminals share the complete database reception and mine but there are the hard copies as i mentioned though they are locked up in a vault at night we dont take our situation lightly lieutenant sergeant he corrected no im sure you dont we take client confidentiality quite seriously miles stirred boldt asked what if i entered a particular blood type into the computer would it be able to give me back the names of all those donors with that particular blood type can it sort that way you should talk to our data processing about that he hated these kinds of answers back to your employees how many of them do you know well depends what you mean i know them all i hired them i dont know about how well i know them how long have you been with bloodlines he asked me going on nine years now and your employees have any of them been with you say two or three years she considered this three or four maybe i could check for you if i had the home offices permission and that would be up to me to obtain he reasoned yes it would miles was awake and quickly losing control boldt resigned himself to leaving he tried a long shot of those three or four longtime employees one of them has shown a particular interest in your computer system which one would that be maybe he or she helps you out with the system now and then she appeared both surprised and impressed by what hed said you never did show me any identification she reminded no i didnt he paused which employee he repeated sensing she had the name on the tip of her tongue i need that name her phone rang sparing her from answering when she hung up she faced him with a dazed expression that was your call the three names you gave me theyre all on our list they were all clients of this office seattle were they kidnapped too boldt repeated softly but severely i need the name of that employee the one who helps you with the computer ms dundee nodded ever so slightly muttered i hate computers she picked up her pen and wrote out the name connie chi by fivethirty that afternoon over one hundred cars had filled the lower parking area of the broadmoor golf club mercedes bmws acuras the occasional cadillac and olds a spectacular turnout in one corner of the enormous walled party tent highspirited kids dressed in ralph laurens finest took turns blindfolded swinging a louisville slugger at a yellowandblack phiata in the shape of a toucan heaters hummed softly the champagne flowed and the conversation reached a feverish pitch that all but drowned out the announcers running commentary on the dog show taking place just off the practice putting green a string quartet was all set up on a small platform stage at the far end of the tent the musicians in their formal wear sampling the buffet as they awaited the special guest and a cue from their hostess dr elden tegg moved through his guests agreeably if not comfortably taking their hands making small talkcharming flattering he wore a navy blue cashmere sport coat a turquoise polo shirt khakis and brand new leather deck shoes he glanced over at his wife peggy and offered a soft appreciative smileeverything was going well two weeks earlier peggy had turned forty to look at her you might have guessed thirty she was in her element here mingling with the top of the heap rubbing elbows with the real power of the city the banner behind the buffet read rd annual friends of animals benefit tegg mentally ran down the list of the days events the dog trials a small wine auction an awards presentation and then the special entertainment peggy had arranged a few of the members of the operas board of directors were already here all of them had been invited tegg spotted james hall and his wife julie and crossed over to them this is a better turnout than even last year jim hall said shaking teggs hand youll raise a fortune you must stay for the entertainment james to his wife the man said the mystery musical guest ive been hearing about this all week peggys trying awfully hard to curry favor with the board elden dont you think julie asked she had a way of speaking her mind of speaking the truth that put you on the spot hows the art world tegg asked her attempting to steer her clear of his wifes ambitions dodging the question are we she replied one of the kids broke open the pfflata right then sparing tegg an embarrassing moment peggy most certainly was trying to win favor with the board julie knew it everyone knew it but it wasnt the type of thing you talked about he had personally paid to fly in the winner of the milano festival to sing two arias here today the string quartet also brought in specially had wowed aspen last august it had cost him a fortune if this didnt impress the board nothing would except perhaps the donation he was planning to make with the prospect of the heart harvest now on the immediate horizon tegg faced the difficult decision of what to do with the enormous sum of money it would generate he could buy his wife a seat on the opera board or he could buy himself a transplant practice in brazil he knew whom to pay off he knew which wheels to grease elden tegg md facs her dream or his could he leave all this behind he excused himself and hurried over to the children who were collecting the candy that had spilled his son albert and his daughter britany ran up to show him their take offering it like pirates treasure a bunch of the children gathered at his feet excited eyes sparkling they wanted another pihata another game it gave him great pleasure to bring the children this kind of joy to include them in the event this way how could you possibly benefit animals without involving children the two seemed fundamentally linked tegg signaled his veterinary assistant the plump d officious pamela chase and turned the children over to her pin the tail on the zebra was next last year some democrats had complained about using a donkey everywhere he went people called out softly wonderful party terrific event having a great time elden he felt like santa claus pleasing so many people at once he glanced out the door in time to see a collieelsie was her nameparaded on leash around the circle as dr elden tegg he had healed a gunshot wound to elsies humerus scanning the field of contestants he recognized several animals as patients of his he knew each by name knew each case history in detail in a way he regarded them as members of his own family he hoped that elsie won somethingif for no other reason than to prove his own expertise with a scalpel in another vets hands she would have been a threelegged dog today his wifes nervous voice came from behind him its going beautifully dont you think he turned and kissed her splendidly the food is excellent youve done a wonderful job we might consider using these same caterers at our party next week if we could get them what do you think iitts a great idea this he knew from the hopeful glint in her eye was what she wanted to hear so this was what he told her she kissed him lightly as an excuse to whisper into his ear be nice to the feldsteins hes had prostate cancer you know alan has he relied on peggy to keep him up on such things how she kept it all straight was anybodys guess she reminded alan is very close with byron he has his ear the aging byron endicott who ran a multinational shipping company was city operas chairman and someone peggy would have to win over in order to be invited onto the board so basically what youre saying he teased is i should avoid asking alan what it feels like to be reamed with something slightly larger than a penlight she winced and chased a waving hand aimed at her from the crowd tegg headed straight to alan feldstein feeling better alan hmm they got it all im told nothing like the big c to get you thinking ill tell you that he studied tegg and said confidentially youre a doctor how much of what you tell your patients is bs i dont believe half of what my doctor tells me my patients have four legs we dont enter into a lot of conversation i suppose not have you seen byron this afternoon i dont believe hes here alan feldstein said stretching his neck he added if you had a wife that young would you be here well at least we know your operation was successful tegg whispered quietly to the man feldstein grinned tegg bailed out while he was still ahead he was on his way to check how pamela was handling pin the tail on the zebra when he spotted a leather jacket out of the corner of his eye maybeck pretending to be one of the public spectators of k dog show tegg did his best to contain his anger he brushed off several attempts to snag him cut outside the tent and walked over to stand beside the man facing in the direction of the dog show what are you doing here he asked connie found an abnegative in the database maybeck said softly screening those horrible teeth from sight with his hand ninetyfive pounds single she aint been an active donor in over two years but shes in the phone booklives in wallingfordtegg experienced that weightless feeling in his stomach of being in an elevator that was falling too quickly it was one thing to consider performing a heart harvest another thing entirely to actually set it in motion can you deliver tegg inquired they had never attempted a kidnapping this aint pizza were talking about dont toy with me donald tegg said knowing how the man disliked the use of his proper name are there any other abnegs tegg asked rhetorically knowing abnegative accounted for less than four percent of the population he was one himself they were extremely lucky to have found even a single match none age shed be maybeck attempted to add in his head it bothered tegg it should take him so long about twentysix thats very good why you think im here i know its good look into it find out if it can be done we can do it i already got it figured i been watching her place back door is fucking perfect for this tegg didnt trust his assessment maybeck was more than likely blinded by the possible money what wouldnt he risk for that but im gonna need your help my help tegg asked youre the one whos going to get her to open the door for us us tegg was thinking their relationship was symbiotic tegg needed a flunky a gobetween with the runaways and with connie chi at bloodlines maybeck liked the idea of large amounts of cash for relatively little work but us tegg seldom thought of them as any kind of team it was an arrangement was all often an unpleasant one at that im telling you doc i got it all worked out we go for it tomorrow morning tomorrow tegg wanted this chance at a heart but how badly how far was he willing to go he glanced at his watch he would have to make arrangements with wong kei could he arrange a meeting for later tonight it started to sprinkle rain would put a quick end to the dog show maybeck said one phone call from you to this girl doc and shes not only going to let us into her home but shes going to make sure no one else is there you want me to tell you about it tomorrow tegg was still thinking ill call you he said turning and walking away then he changed his mind and headed toward his trooper parked alongside the pro shop he could use the cellular to call wong kei he could put this in motion immediately dr ronald dixon had something to tell him and it pertained to daphnes investigationboldt knew that much from the way dixie had phrased the unexpected invitation to this dinner show the entrance to dimitis jazz alley is appropriately enough down an alley opposite a parking garage boldt parked his sevenyearold toyota and crossed the alley feeling out of place he was accustomed to the big jokes sticky floors and chairs with uneven legs this place was aimed more at the bmw crowd dixies wife had allegedly been called to an emergency session of the local girl scout chapter freeing the ticket he now handed to boldt as the two met at the front door boldt didnt believe the story for a minute nancy dixon didnt like clubs that was just dixies way of sparing boldt the fifteendollar ticket dixie confirmed his status as a regular when the two men were greeted warmly by the host and shown immediately to one of the best tables dixon placed a flight bag on the floor but kept it within reach he could have checked it upstairs along with their coats why hadnt he boldt ordered a glass of milk from the waiter who delivered a scotch for dixiethey knew his drink the house began to fill goodlooking women with goodlooking guys computer whiz kids and aerospace experts older couples who remembered s and big noise from winnetkafalse teeth false hair but real lives a couple of smokers relegated to the distant seats under the air vents bread roll baskets passing by in a blur nylons even a few spike heels god it was good to get out now and then good to be out with dixie again i bet its been a year since ive been here boldt said kids do that itll change i hope not i like things the way they are some part of boldt in spite of his rampant curiosity wanted dixie to leave that bag on the floor wanted to keep the conversation personal and off whatever that bag contained i want to tell you a story dixie announced boldts skin prickled with anticipation what happens in my line of work as in yours is that cases come and go some are solved some are filed some go dormant though they never quite leave your mind he sampled the scotch and clearly approved every now and then something triggers you something goes off in your brain and you think ive seen this before or didnt i hear somebody talking about something like this or i know this is familiar to me you know what im talking about it happens to all of us boldt nodded he felt impatient and restless cases overlap he went on boldt fidgeted with his spoon barely containing himself it happens all the timemore often than seems possible there are reasons for such overlaps there are only a limited number of murderers in king county at any one timeat least we hope somore often than not a relatively small number given the population base we average less than ten in any given month sometimes zero right from my viewpoint it means theres a good possibilityeven a probabilitythat any two bodies discovered around the same time or in the same area or relating to a similar cause of unnatural death may in fact be the work of the same person it takes a certain jump in logic however to immediately reach that conclusion in this particular case but thats my job isnt it damn right it is thats exactly what im here for and my job is to pass along my concerns to the police if and when such suspicions bear investigation in this instance you my friend are the police and ill explain why nearly six months ago now he continued a man carrying a brown paper bag arrived unannounced at our offices requesting to see whoevers in charge thats me of course he was of average height in his early forties with graying curly hair e was of a slight builda hundred and fortyfive pounds maybethe kind of guy who stays thin from an excess of nervous energy youve met a dozen just like him he was wearing a suita nice suit this was his lunch hour he was a corporate attorney by trade name of carsman mr carsman was a hunter a bird hunter talked about not liking to kill talked about no one understanding hunting except other hunters said he liked to listen to the wind blow the rain fall the rain i asked is that why youre here he said no it was on account of his dog his dog i verified that then he lifted this paper bag this grocery bag the top of which was choked down tight so it looks like an old mans neck hed been sitting there holding it between his knees im starting to think this guy is over the top and im part of his plan somehow im starting to wish i carry some kind of revolver in my desk im about to come out of my chair when he hoists this bag onto my desk thump it goes that thump worried me because i knew that sound bone im thinking its a head maybe he says he wasnt sure what to do with something like this he said stu colemans a neighbor of his i know stu from the state lab stus all right stu told him to bring it to me i asked him if i could see the bone that threw him but like i said i knew that sound theres no mistaking the sound of a bone on your desk whatever you say boldt said his palms were moist he wanted to order his dinner he wanted dixie to stop with his storytelling and get to the point but dixie spent a lot of hours with the dead and he appreciated someone alive to talk to when he got the chance he was hunting in a very remote location timberland northeast of the city he shoots a birda blue grouse i think it wasand he sends his dog after it dog disappears a long time when he comes backthe dog that ishe has dixie leaned over with some effort boldt heard the sound of a zipper the bag dixie righted himself saying this in his mouth dixon let the large bone down gently onto the table to him it was perfectly normal to show someone a bonea human femur big and unmistakable to the people passing by their table it proved a source of great curiosityand for some disgust boldt studied it turning it over repeatedly and said you could have waited until i ordered my dinner after a little bit of searching the stream he found this as well dixon informed him placing another much smaller bone on the table this is the one that interests youits a rib what if i was planning on ordering barbecue i thought liz had you eating vegetarian who told you that word gets around well what if i am then youre not ordering barbecue dixon said the second scotch arrived this was followed by a dinner waiter whose attention kept drifting to the two bones boldt ordered the greek salad dixon just to be spitefulordered a rich pasta with smoked turkey and prosciutto when the waiter left boldt handled the rib im supposed to be interested in this yes you are its human just like the femur just like you dixie stared him down i took a personal interest in locating the rest of the corpse human bones discovered in such an isolated area suggest a buried body and buried bodies seem to be epidemic these days the discovery of any human remains has to be investigated if for no other reason than that it is illegal to bury a corpse in the watershed area where carsmans dog discovered the bone maybe you remember monty my assistant lewis montgomery hes our forensic anthropologistand hes very good monty coordinated a search team using boy scout troops because at the time search and rescue wouldnt touch it boldt interrupted boy scouts dixie ignored him nothing turned up and the case was filed under unsolveds i havent spoken to monty about the bones since he and i ran some tests on them back when carsman turned them over to us measurement and calcification tests indicated this femur had once belonged to a woman between the ages of eighteen and twentyeight the pelvis if it can be found will not only confirm this but will also tell us whether or not this woman had children dixon continued to formally identify a person from his or her bones one needs more bones than this and a lot of luck a young woman in her midtwenties buried fifty miles from nowhere suggests the obvious to me homicide boldt finished for him he toyed with the partial bone on the table look at the rib would you boldt studied the rib more closely taking it into his hands and spinning it around the waiter arrived with their meals boldt moved his arms to accommodate the man who remained fascinated by the bones he bumped a water glass nearly spilling it the waiter offered ground pepper which both men declined and he left backing away still fascinated boldt ran his index finger along the square end of the bone some kind of surgical technique interesting isnt it boldt waited him out we use gardening shears they work the best we boldt asked my office dixon replied for the autopsies he clarified youve seen me use them you just dont remember but this was no autopsy boldt said i have some serious hunches about that rib about this skeleton and the young woman it once danced inside once slept inside the woman inside whom it grew and developed my office closed the case another department could reopen it he stabbed some of the salad youre the investigator boy scouts what did you expect we had some good people leading them nothing wrong with young eyes young legs thats rough country out there boldt asked did they look up river for the rest of her of course and found nothing but there must be some way to find her you want my advice i want more than your advice i want your participation how would you go about it id talk to the experts water resources or army corps of engineers someone responsible for flood predictions for the way water would move a bone like that we had some heavy rains last fall was that six months ago i think it was those rains let up right after miles was born thats how i measure the world now you know in terms of when my boy was born dixie said people bury bodies along rivers for two reasons the wet soil speeds decayboldt interrupted and its easier to dig in matthews showed you the autopsy files on those three runaways ive put in a request for the tissue samples from those cases but this i had forgotten all about this case he touched the long femur that remained between them on the table just as a young man in his twenties passed noticed the bone and nudged his girlfriend oh look they have legoman tonight she giggled boldt did not laugh he was staring intently at dixon patterns my friend were in the patterns businesscops and interior decorators this bone he said shifting his attention to the rib never healed never had time to heal see the different color here that means it was buried within a few days of the operation oh yes operation this woman was cut open either to heal her or to steal from her but not at a hospital not as part of the system quite possibly it killed her if she wasnt dead already cut open by a surgeonsomeone who has done enough rib work to use snippers instead of the medical school tools were told to use snippers work better those runaways the files i gave matthewswalker sherman blumenthalthey were also cut open by a surgeon the same guy the same reason he wasnt after a kidney i can tell you that lung or liver those are your choices the way he cut that rib are all these the work of the same doctor patterns we both know that its patterns that hang these guys were allevery one of usvictims of our own inescapable patterns inescapable patterns boldt thought he examined the bones once again an organ harvest its a strong possibility we have a lot of questions to answer how long ago was she buried who was she what procedure was done we need the rest of her lou or a good portion thereof why did he bury this one and not the others shes been in the ground a long time those bones are picked clean what sets her apart only boldt sensed something in the man a friends can youre jumping ahead of yourself youre linking her to the others with only supposition or are you you wouldnt get this excited over hunches boldt realized thinking aloud theres something else in that bag of yours isnt there something even more convincing you were born a detective did you know that he seemed a little disappointed that boldt had secondguessed him boldts heart rate increased now more than ever he wanted the rest of the evidence dixie dug out a pair of blackandwhite photographs which because of their magnification boldt immediately recognized as lab work peter blumenthalone of the runaways who died as a result of surgeryalso had several ribs snipped he was a lung harvest we saved one of his ribs as is our custom with possible evidence yesterday when those files reminded me of mr carsmans visit i ran both ribsblumenthals and this mystery womansby the lab for comparison tool markings heres what they came up with he handed boldt the photos he had studied hundreds of such photographs when any toola knife pliers a wrench wire cuttersinteracts with a materialwood wire metal in this case boneit leaves a distinct fingerprint a cutting tool leaves grooves that a under magnification resemble scratch marks these scratch marks form distinct patterns like a comb with some of the teeth missing in the photo the two sets of scratch marks had been perfectly aligned indicating the work of the same tool boldt caught himself holding his breath whoever was responsible for the death of peter blumenthal and the two other runaways had also performed surgery on the woman who had once lived inside these bones the cases were inexorably linked by this evidence reading his thoughts dixie said the harvester buried this one lou why why when he turned the other three and chapman back into the streets why treat this mystery woman any different because she died on him maybe but the way these bones were picked clean this woman predates these other harvests by several years these recent ones may have died by accident he may not even know theyre dead yet but with her he said pointing to the bones he certainly knew his first is that what youre saying boldt knew the importance of such a find the first incident in any criminal pattern typically told the investigator more than did any of the subsequent crimes or victims it established method motivation and a key look into the demographics of future victims these bones suddenly took on an additional importance this womanwhoever she wasjust might tell them who the harvester was dixon had reached the same conclusion if we locate the rest of her remains she can tell us more toying with the bones again boldt asked may i keep these dixon grinned i thought youd never ask tegg boarded the tenfifteen ferry for bainbridge island at pier and waited until the ship was under steam the wind blew out of the west bitter cold upon his face gunmetal clouds moved overhead like a giant door shutting when the ferry whistle reverberated out across the water tegg shuddered as orderedhe hated taking orders he worked his way down a series of steep metal ladders into the car hold it was dark down here despite the occasional bare bulb and the wide openings at either end empty cars parked in long tight rows the smell of car exhaust and sea salt kelp and fish he wandered the aisles as instructed twisting and turning to worm his way through the cars sea spray kicked up by the wind blew through the open bow and misted across him blurring the windshields many of the cars showed excessive body roteven a few of the newer ones these were the regular commuters when tegg turned around at the stern and started up the next aisle he spotted a hulk of a figure some yards away as he drew closer he recognized the ape as one of wong keis bodyguards this was wong keis world not his wong keis rules the ape stood alongside a black chrysler new yorker with mirrored windows he opened the car door and signaled tegg inside tegg found himself alone with wong kei in the back seat the emaciated man was drinking a diet coke holding the can with fingers as long and thin as chopsticks you are able to help me he said in an old mans voice you wouldnt have called otherwise would you we have a possibility whats your wifes present condition shes being flown north tomorrow saturday i am told that surgery could follow immediately providing there are no setbacks that will leave us in your hands dr tegg we will be awaiting your call that the heart is on its way she is running out of time you understand this i hope i understand you have found someone i assume braindead dying how long do we have you know as much as you need to he didnt like the change in the mans eyes had he angered him the chinese are so inscrutable he thought its for your own good as well as mine he added i have a down payment for you call it good faith he said he pointed to the front seat where the ape belonged the money was evidently up there no money not yet we can do that when its over wong kei persisted i have a sum for you now which as i have just said is to show my good faith yours as well as mine please take it no mention of a final figure tegg liked it that way no hurry he said the ferry rocked violently to the left dozens of cars complained you are a trusting man won kei put forward not really tegg said if you dont pay me ill take the heart back he waited it was a joke tegg added you joke about my wifes life his chin trembled is that what i am hearing from you he drank more of the coke spilling some allow me to explain something dr tegg allow me to explain the obvious he finished the drink he studied the empty can as if reading it i am relying on you that is all i am going to say about it that should be selfexplanatory yes tegg didnt like the sound of that you will call me when your wife is admitted and ready to go tegg instructed he wrote out his cellular number on a blank memo pad from his daytimer no name just the number only the cellular if you call me on the land lines i will hang up wong kei sat forward reached over the seat and dragged a small alaskan airlines flight bag to him he looked incredibly tired anxiety and grief were swallowing him whole tegg knew the symptoms take this this is the purpose for this meeting my purpose our time is wasted otherwise i insist he didnt shove it at him but he made its handle available tegg accepted the bag his curiosity mounting he understood the commitment his acceptance of it represented he was crossing a dangerous threshold he would now owe this man he immediately regretted his acceptance of the bag but knew it would be impossible to return it wong keis expression told him as much for emphasis the asian added we must not overlook the seriousness of the situation time is everything there is nothing i will not do to restore my wife to health yes tegg thought he meant it as some sort of veiled threat although it was difficult to interpret exactly perhaps he was offering his help tegg said if i dont hear from you first ill call when were set to go the man nodded the ferry slowed and bumped the loading dock from the ferrys deck tegg all alone in the wind and the night watched the black car as it and the others disembarked in the glow of a few meager street lamps and a mercury light far in the distance he watched sea gulls resting on pilings standing on one leg balanced tegg felt delicately balanced as well pamela would not assist in the heart harvest they had discussed the possibility of it beforeit was constantly on teggs mindand she had rejected it outright it would have to be a solo harvest even more challenging more risky perhaps it was time to sacrifice one of the dogs to practice practice makes perfect he said into the wind as the ferry lumbered through the chop and headed back toward seattle toward his family his children and yet away from all of that at the same time toward his future he thought however it was now defined saturday february dr elden tegg attempted not to touch anything in donnie maybecks van concern about leaving fingerprints behind had nothing to do with ithe was wearing gloves the place was a cesspool for a man repulsed by dirty environments a man who had a fetish about cleanliness this vehicle was a nightmare a thick layer of dust and grime had baked onto the cracked vinyl of the dashboard some kind of solidified scumsoda beer coffee worse had drooled over the engine cover that separated the two front seats and was now fuzzy with lint the windows were tinted in a yellow filth and the carpet what was left of itwas matted like the hair on the backside of an incontinent dog for a man accustomed to the sights and smells associated with invasive surgery it was strange nauseous you dont look so hot donnie maybeck said drive hey i know you dont like this but i aint doing this alone and connie aint no help in this kinda thing weve been over this dont be so fucking pissed about it because theres nothing can be done just drive its not the same as the others you said so yourself this here is kidnapping this here is some serious shit connie could never do thisyou shouldnt involve her in any of it he saw no point in attempting to reason with a little person like maybeck there were fly specks along the bottom of the windshield donnie maybeck was a fly speck and what was that lodged into the defrost slot a discarded plastic wrapper for a sheik elite with spermicide he recoiled wanting to levitate and not have to touch anything hey shes involved in it all right okay shes in this up to her short hairs aint nothing can be done about it without her without updating the database how we gonna pick which donor to approach humor me shut up and drive tegg felt uneasy a mistake he had made years earlier had cost a human life now he possessed the skills and abilities to correct that wrong even though it came at the cost of deepening his involvement with maybeck youre sure shes alone tegg asked youre the one who talked to her not me tegg had called sharon shaffer twenty minutes earlier and had introduced himself as a public health official he apologized for calling on a saturday but explained that this was something that couldnt wait it was a question of some plasma donations she had made several years back he suggested he and his assistant pay her a visit and that for confidentialitys sake she would probably prefer to be alone she had taken the bait and she had sounded scared just right you understand she could recognize me maybeck said to him interrupting his thoughts i mean chances are since shes in the database that i mighta sold her a fake id at some point if she says anything tell her you work for bloodlines we know she hasnt sold her plasma for over two years she wont remember you i do all the talking not a peep out of you youre only there for control purposesif things get out of hand and only then if i tell you to act hmm the man didnt answer tegg felt nervous a condition so foreign to him that at first it was unrecognizable he thought maybe he was sick maybeck sold fake ids to underage runaways who needed them to sell their plasma in this way he won their confidence and obtained their vital statistics he had been doing this ever since he had stumbled upon teggs secret the secret had led to blackmail the blackmail to a certain draining of teggs available cash and subsequently to a new business for both of them harvesting with maybeck assuming the streetside risks and logistics connecting tegg to the donors this shaky alliance had begun now a kidnappingtheir biggest risk to date tegg searched the dashboards control panel looking for a way to get more air maybeck was in it for the money tegg on the other hand felt uncomfortable with the money he gave every last cent of his share to charities in his wifes name enhancing their social prominence feeling maybecks recklessness he wondered how he would handle the man if he went too farif he asked for too much you had to watch the little pepeople when they cottoned on to the smell of money tegg knew they couldnt screw this up wong kei was unlikely to be a man with a predisposition toward forgiveness he had a mobsters reputation if tegg failed this harvest it might be his last his moral salvation commanded a high price tegg finally threw a lever and a gust of dusty air dislodged the condom wrapper from the defrost vent he swatted at it frantically maybeck slowed and turned into freemont lane a dead end servicing a pair of apartment buildings to the right and to the left the back doors of houses on lyden avenue including the green one thirtysix thirtynine and a half bring the laptop with youitll make you look more official and remember to keep your mouth shut tegg reminded he meant this literally those teeth were enough to terrify anyone sharon shaffer had spent the last twenty minutes in terror she had tried to drown out her recollection of that phone call by cleaning up by running the vacuum public health the blood supply it could only mean one thing she answered the knock on her back door two men the bearded one was well dressed and looked distinguished especially compared to his assistant who reminded her of an aging james dean he carried the toshiba laptop computer in his right hand may we come in the distinguished one asked she knew that voice from the phone call she felt afraid if she refused them entry would the reason for their being here leave with them there were men she had been with during her years on the streets complete strangers there were things she had done that now a few years later she could hardly believe possible she had not blocked them out for she had no desire to forget her past it was memories of her past that inspired her present work that enabled her to so easily relate to the women who found their way to the shelter in an odd way she was even proud of her past but the characters she had encountered during that time were behind her now she felt terrified was it true that your past always catches up with you she stepped back and admitted them she knew what this was about it was about dirty needles about sex about a different life a different sharon shaffer these two were about to ruin her new life she felt faint she waved them toward the dining table for the place was small and there were only two stuffed chairs over by the television and she wanted them all to sit she had to sit no matter what the bearded man said bloodlines incorporated maintains an active database of all of its donors past and present james dean patted the laptop and set it down the bearded man explained the donated blood is tested prior to distribution for disease there was the word she had dreaded fear turned her palms icy her eyes threatened tears as hard as the streets had made her as welcome as death would have been back then she felt weak and terrified now by this one word what has happened the man continued is that the states department of health in a routine audit discovered a glitch in the software that drives the bloodlines database with that glitch removed certain donors appear in an atrisk category as concerns certain diseases hiv sharon said it was no guess they didnt come to your door on a saturday morning over measles yes but we neednt jump to conclusions aids she whispered softly what we need the man continued professionally is a fresh blood sample theres no need to jump to any conclusions until the results of those tests are in no need at all he emphasized the computer has been wrong once it could certainly be wrong a second time iin shown as positive she stated its only a computer we need to run the tests again im a doctor we can take your blood now or you can come downtown later in the week its entirely up to you the doctor added it wont take us five minutes if youd care to get it over with now are you expecting anyone james dean asked she shook her head she found it difficult to speak the doctor said encouragingly one thing in favor of doing this now is that you will get the results much sooner lets do it now she said how long until i know a few days four or five working days usually oh god thatll seem like forever the doctor addressed his assistant ive left my case in the van go and get it for me it was an order not a request and it struck her that there was no love lost between these two james dean stood and left through the back door leaving the laptop computer standing on the carpet our apologies for coming to your back door the doctor said weve found most people would just as soon not explain anything to the neighbors we try to park in the back and keep a low profile again she couldnt find any words she nodded just barely holding on a lifetime lost its probably nothing more than a computer error really thats what your voice says but thats not what your eyes say she wanted to tell him he knew something all right he was as nervous as she was his lips tensed and his eyes hardened and for the second time she felt a nauseating fear she put her hands into her lap so he wouldnt see them shaking i wouldnt worry he said yes you would if you were me you would she stared at him you frighten me she said without meaning to its the possibility of the matter that frightens you not me he explained in that harsh grating voice he seemed stuck with james dean returned with a small softplastic case and handed it to the doctor it had tiered shelves like a fishing tackle box he tore a plastic bag off of a disposable syringe and took hold of her wrist to time her pulse his fingers were ice cold he did some more preparations below the lip of the table out of sight from her and then slipped on a pair of surgical gloves hes afraid of contamination she thought she felt dizzy he swabbed her upper forearm with alcohol and then wrapped surgical tubing tightly around her upper arm he asked her to make a fist she looked away these days she hated the sight of needles ill need to take three samples the doctor explained but just the one needle it shouldnt hurt too much he pricked her arm then she jumped with the sensation all the ramifications all the possibilities of what had been said here in the last few minutes swam through her head her life was finished contaminated contact with anyone at the shelter would be minimized and eventually terminated worse than a leper society would shun her she would eventually fall victim to the virus they all did there would be aztat a few thousand dollars a month there would be counseling there would be tears and lost friendships there would be a long grueling illness weight loss and death she started to cry as she blinked away her tears she focused on the contents of his medical case she noticed an electric shaver some leather strapping that looked more like a muzzlea dogs muzzle next to it a choke collar chain this man wasnt a doctor he was a veterinarian she asked at that same instant a stunning warmth surged through her system it flooded into her like hot water she knew that feeling only too well valium and some kind of narcotic a slam like codeine they werent taking her blood they were drugging her she snapped her head around in time to see the last of the injection administered she looked up at the doctorthe veterinarian whose full concentration remained focused on the injection she glanced up at james dean realizing now for the first time that they had not given her any identification he was smiling at her he had a mouth full of the worst teeth she had ever seen like a rotten picket fence she tried to pull her arm away but it barely movedninetyfive pounds of dead flesh she felt too slow too heavy to offer much resistance she felt terrified she felt marvelously content she felt tired incredibly relaxed youre going to be fine he said in a fuzzy voice as if miles away helpless powerless nothing she could do across the room she saw a shadow move along the floor and believed at first it was another effect of the drug but realized all at once that it was her housemate and hoped that she might yet be rescued agnes came around the corner her seventyyearold blind eyes open wide in curiosity help sharen forced out numbly loudly enough to be heard had any sound come out at all the invasive warmth loosened every muscle it felt like love pure and perfect love liquid love her eyes grew hot and her lids fell like dark blue curtains agnes was agnes out there anything but this she thought give me more she felt like saying sharon it was agnes sharon shaffer struggled to open her eyes but only managed one last fleeting glimpse of the womans silverblue hair and pale white skin someone was dragging her the last thing she heard was the doctors angry whisperlike cracking iceas he demanded of his accomplice who the hell is that homicide lieutenant phil shoswitz loved baseball he arranged his working hours around mariners home games and captained the police softball team one of his favorite and most overused jokes was that he was the only guy on the force who was a captain and a lieutenant at the same time his office which remained constantly cluttered with stacks of pending case files since boldts last visit had become something of a combination baseball locker room museum its walls were crowded with autographed artifacts photographs and shelves of championship trophies as boldt shut the door one of the boys called outa warm greeting you dont know how many friends you have he thought until you return to a place after a long absence he hadnt realized how good how rightcoming back here would feel thanks for coming shoswitz said in his typically tense voice i know its a saturday but this is important he had a dark complexion a long thin face and evervigilant eyes not unlike the hardened criminals he dealt with so regularly a highstrung type he chose his clothes poorly and shaved too fast married once he was a weekend father nowat least if he wasnt stuck with a saturday rotation he had been a fair detective but was a brilliant lieutenant some people were made for a position of authority and a series of endless meetings what are you and matthews up to first she pays you a visit at the joke now i get some inquiry from a place called he checked a memo on his desk bloodlines a woman named dundee is asking if weve got a cop named boldt on our lineup i in wondering do we whatd you tell her shoswitz said thats not an answer to my questionis that why the stern face thats why maybe we should get daffy in here maybe we shouldnt shes a cop lou but shes not an investigator youre an investigator but youre not a copnot active anyway ergo we make the perfect team boldt said sarcastically i decide the teams around here i may manage from the dugout lou but i manage i dont need my players out on the field calling plays especially players who are sitting up in the stands by choice foul ball boldt teased shoswitz didnt appreciate it you learn to watch the foul balls sometimes they pull fair bloodlines was just a quick little questionandanswer session phil if i hadnt said i was a cop whats matthews working on lou boldt felt that sinking sensation of losing your balance when its too late to do anything about it he had committed to daphne but he didnt want that to be the same thing as committing to phil shoswitz if he handled this incorrectly he would end up back on the force but off daphnes investigationif she was even allowed to continue with the case shoswitz was a tough negotiator boldt gave him the details starting with cindy chapmans appearance at the homeless shelter up to and including the coincidence that four out of four names were in the bloodlines database for now he left out dixies matching tool markings saving himself a trump card in case he needed it he concluded you see why we were hesitant to bring this to you were a long way from any hard evidence bob proctor wouldnt give me five minutes with what ive got proctor was the king county prosecuting attorney shoswitz stared off blankly deep in thought he mumbled something about matthews responsibility to involve the department boldt fired back you just said she doesnt qualify as an investigatorwhich is unfair mind you since she took highest honors at the academy he suggested she only came to me because she knew i would listen objectively objectively he asked she doesnt want objectivity shes into the overwork phase shes going through mental pause that incident with the knife set her way back shes still not over it you know how it goes when you start to fight back you go too far shes haunted by that incident she wants to prove herself as a detective wants to be more than a psychologist shes itching to get out of the office and into the squad car she tried to talk her way out of something and it didnt work so now she wants it again wants a chance to prove to herself that shes over it i see what youre thinking he added heading boldt off but it isnt that easy i cant very well recommend her for another rotation when shes the only shrink on the force thats her specialtythats what we took her on for even if she is qualified for investigations besides she hasnt asked for any kind of active duty what if she did what if i signed back up on the condition that we be allowed to partner together on this harvester investigation fiftyfifty partners no seniority on my part but i would be there to help her out maybe work her through this at this same time shed agree to continue to handle the more pressing aspects of her job as departmental psychologist youve thought this out havent you shoswitz said i know you phil if i sign back up youll yank me over to some murderone ticket and ill never see this thing again what thing youre the one pointing out the of evidence in this thinglac give me the manpower and authority to run with this give me a few weeks to come up with something to convince proctor we have a case if i cant im yoursill see out my twenty one week no more hes stealing organs phil at least three kids are dead the deaths are a direct result of his work and that makes it multiple manslaughter at least how many more are there i thought that was the point of homicide three weeks so its hardball is it is it i want you back thats no secret i suppose thats half the problem he said allowing a rare smile but im not going to deal like this boldt interrupted what a crock you make deals like this every waking hour shoswitzs face turned red and his nostrils flared two weeks and thats final is this the new you maybe it is boldt admitted im not feeling real new at the moment actually babies tend to make you feel ancient you dont even have a formal complaint do you is this on the books as a crime im complaining boldt said carefully avoiding the second answer the problem with you is you only see your side of things shoswitz said in a frustrated voice now youre sounding like liz this elicited a smile from the lieutenant and boldt could feel he had won shoswitz glanced over boldts shoulder boldt saw a flicker of distraction in the lieutenants eye and knew before turning that it would be daffy he turned to see her coming at them like a freight trainno stopping her a beautiful freight train at that a nice engine she opened the door without knocking in a desperate voice she said a friend of mines been kidnapped i need your help pamela chase climbed into her car having decided on a drive because it was raining again and she couldnt stand it another minute inside her apartment alone the occasional roundtrip flight to vancouver airport that she performed for tegg did little to assuage her overall feeling of emptiness begrudgingly she lived alone alone with her weight problemwith what she had come to think of as her ugliness a low ceiling of thick storm clouds blotted out the night sky and dumped more rain onto the drowning city four years of drought now this she didnt know exactly where she was going but like a dog on a scent she followed her instincts away from the deafening drumming of the rain on her small balcony with its plastic fern and blownout lawn chair another few minutes and that rain would have driven her right out of her mind she pulled up to a red light and studied her reflection in the windshield mirrors were not popular in her apartment she searched her face trying to see it as beautiful as elden claimed to see it she ignored the heavy checks and the squinty black eyes the lifeless hair and spotty eyebrows she saw someone else entirely she briefly forgot all about her childhoodher parents malicious remarks about her weight problem her being left behind to study when her family went on social outings the kitchen cabinets being locked her being fed different size servings and different food than her siblings the neighborhood changed suddenly she left behind the stores and fastfood chains the plastic marquees and cent lettuce signs and was surrounded instead by towering trees manicured shrubs and elegant homes this was familiar territory to her not unlike her childhood neighborhood less than a mile away this was where the money lived the professionals along the lake shore away from the noise and exhaust the teggs owned three cars since they had only a twocar garage and his was the one always parked in the driveway it was easy for her to determine tegg was not at home she drove by here often waiting for the hours to pass waiting for work she lived for business hours for monday through friday for latenight emergency calls for something more than the boredom of that apartment she tried the clinic next but he wasnt there either the place was locked up tightly and the security was on so where was he out at another of his social functions with her the ballet the opera out with the big names and big money he loved that world the more she couldnt have something the more she wanted it just like peanut butter there was one way to make sure of his whereabouts she pulled over at a quikstop bought herself a reeses peanut butter cup and ran through the rain to a phone booth getting soaked in the process she thought about the voice she would use elden had taught her about image about roleplaying and acting she summoned a convincing desperation which wasnt too far from the way she felt anyway the phone rang several times which she knew from experience meant it wasnt the baby sitter answering because the baby sitter always either occupied the phone line keeping it tied up or sat close enough to answer an incoming call on the first ring the multiple rings confirmed her suspicions the wife was home elden was not the wife answered hello she said in that snobbish accent she had perfected mrs tegg this is pamela calling for dr tegg oh hello dear she said now in a patronizing tone that implied a warmth between them that didnt exist it came out of the fact that this woman was friends with pamelas parents and felt obliged to a pretense of a certain degree of amiability resentment was more like itthe two of them had squared off on several occasions hes not here im afraid weve had an emergency call at the clinic nothing too badand dr tegg isnt answering his pager she lied in her most appropriate voice concern without alarm hes out at the farm dear working incommunicado im afraid thats what he loves about being out there you know youll just have to refer this emergency elsewhere she said in a notsosubtle tone of disbelief damn her pamela thought its getting so i cant fool her the farm working without me right she managed to squeak out strained though it was she thanked the womanshe hated thanking her for anythingand hung up it was a long drive out to the farm tonight even longer because her mind wouldnt rest filled as it was with the force of her substantial insecurity driven to discover what he was up to without her once off the interstate one road blurred into another trees darkness the ceaseless rain hung in front of her like a curtain headlights flashed her windshield with silver taillights like animal eyes the farm was located far off the beaten track in a section of national forest that had been given over to timber lease some years before the only access a series of unmarked twisting hardpack roads she negotiated her way over these unmarked roads across the narrow bridges and finally pulled into the rutted lane that led to the property to look at it you might guess the place abandoned except for the barking that emanated from the quonset hutthe kennel situated fifty yards down a sloping grade to the right of the old cabin and driveway a light was on in the cabin he was here she parked and hurried through the rain her wet blouse glued to her chest her jeans absurdly tightwere soaked from just below her crotch to her knees her hair was matted and a mess she twisted the handleit was locked she crossed around to the cellar entrance and in doing so passed two glowing basement windows that had been painted over from the inside she didnt need to see through these windows to know he was working inside now drenched she approached the thick wooden door and pounded on it loudly a moment later he called out whos there when she answered he opened the door the hall was dark though to his left the impromptu operating room glowed brightly beneath the surgical lamps he stood in shadow his face partially hidden she slicked back her hair and shook the water off her behind her the loud barking continued inside the kennel she glanced into the operating room where a sedated woman lay stretched out on the operating table green surgical cloth covering her pamela experienced the horror of exclusion he was prepared to do a harvest without her unthinkable so he said in that grating voice of his youve come the fear of abandonment penetrated so deeply that she felt paralyzed unable to move or speak but he touched her elbow and steered her into the cabins basement roomhis operating theater and shut the door the ceiling of exposed floor joists hung low over their heads woven with a network of old pipes and electrical wiring he had created a false ceiling by stapling a thick clear plastic to the underside of the joists he had done nearly the same thing to the stone wallshad placed a series of twobyfours around the perimeter of the room and had fixed the transparent sheeting to them creating plastic walls this room was kept immaculately clean even the plastic was wiped down with disinfectant following every surgery he was a cleanliness fanaticyou only had to look at his hands and nails to see that and although in terms of equipment they got by with only the bare necessitiesanesthesia lights autoclave and various monitoring devicesit was all state of the art there was even a backup generator in case the power failed tegg was overly cautious with every aspect of his surgery obsessive she considered him a great teacher the overhead lights burst with enough candlepower to light a small stadium only his eyes were visible above the surgical mask as he studied her he glanced quickly from her to his patient on the table he seemed briefly confused she couldnt remember ever having seen him with this particular expressionas if he had been caught in some wrong perhaps he knew how much such a discovery would hurt her perhaps he could sense even that her eyes welled with the tears of rejection he didnt need her he had deliberately excluded her just like her parents just like everyone but then he raised and dropped the green cloth as if it meant nothing to him as if discarding his patient and stepped toward her with a renewed confidence strong even mesmerizing my pager must be broken she said to him in a dispirited voice looking for some excuse she knew it wasnt broken but she wanted to offer him a way out even now she felt obliged to protect him he replied no your pager is not broken i didnt call you only now did she notice that he held a scalpel in his gloved hand devilishly sharp dangerous i didnt want to bother you these were the words he spoke but it was not the message carried in his voice this contradiction confused her bother me you never bother me im always available for you for any reason anything at all she strained again to see the patient on the table but he stepped into her line of sight and placed the scalpel flatly against her cheek he clearly didnt want her looking she glanced into his familiar eyes and saw something new there her legs trembled she felt herself flush a crimson red as sexual excitement rushed through her here now he stepped closer to her and ran the scalpel down her neck to between her breasts elden she asked her heart racing furiously one by one he cut free the buttons is this all right he asked she nodded i guess so keeping his mask on he kissed her then for the first time he took her pouty lips between his masked teeth and bit down hard in a way that both thrilled and terrified her she felt powerless next to him is it all right he asked again hmm she hesitated you want this dont you pamela i know you do tell me you do her shirt fell open he pulled it back and studied the long scar below her rib cage he touched it and hummed softly tell me he repeated she thought she might faint he used the scalpel to cut her bra it too fell open exposing her he didnt look he held her eyes he said this is what you want isnt it yes good he ran the flat of the blade over her breasts a penetrating exhilarating chill raced through her the danger that blade represented he then held out his empty hand and offered it to her she kissed his gloved fingers then one by one she drew each of his fingers into her mouth suckling them and curling her warm tongue around them ignoring the odd odor of the latex all the i while tegg continued to stare into her eyes what did he see what was he after he withdrew his fingers from her mouth glanced once quickly nervously over his shoulder at his patient then quickly back at her and said you wont need these he tugged her jeans away from her soft middle and drew the scalpel all the way down one pant leg then the other her jeans came off like a pair of chaps her head swam feeling his hand touch her there all at once she could smell her own excitement and it embarrassed her it mixed with the musty and medicinal odors of the cellar youll like it he said reading her thoughts he pulled the severed blouse from her and left it on the floor he led herunderwear running shoes and pedsto the end of the operating table he positioned her facing him with her back to the patient standing between the unconscious womans bare feet she resisted the urge to cover her tried not to think of the way her flesh must belly look in the glaring light his eyes glowed behind the operating mask she could hear his coarse exciting breathing she felt dizzy almost drunk this wasnt how she had imagined it he was scarcely himself is this how men were she ached with longing and fear he reached past her and moved the patients feet out of pamelas way clearing a small space between them on the operating table suddenly he scooped pamela up and planted her sitting in this space on the end of the high operating table centered between the patients ankles he took one of her hands and placed it on her raised knee then the other so she held herself open for him he spun the scalpel before her eyes light glinted from its edges he lowered it he nicked the waistline of her underwear and then threw the scalpel to the floor he placed both hands on her underpants and tore them open he asked are you sure she nodded unable to speak we can stop he offered no he touched her with his gloved hands she rocked her head back and stared openeyed into the harsh sterile light her left leg cramped she wanted to let go of her knee but she didnt dare do anything this was all so new to her not at all what she had imagined better in some ways worse in others he felt removed and distant and yet his touch was intense and knowledgeable she wanted him to want her he unfastened his belt she grew lightheaded he took her legs and pulled them toward him drew her to him causing her to plant her arms and lean back her head nearly touching the patient her legs wrapped around him her body half on half off the metal table the farther back she leaned the easier it was to support herself but the more contact she made with the woman behind and beneath her humming one of the operas that he played during their surgery he penetrated her a sharp pain she cried out she could tell by his reaction that he liked it so she didnt try to stifle the sounds that shuddered through her with each of his thrusts he went after her with a frenzy her body went numb as all of her senses focused instead of on herself on him his eyes closed he smiled he liked this then nothing he stopped was it over he withdrew and shoved her away from him back onto the table she was filled with a vague longing for something softmuted light a pillow a kind word was it any good she asked you cant answer that yourself it was wonderful there you see then he said mechanically and without emotion now put on a smocktheres work to be done she wont stay under forever pamela went into the adjacent storage room cleaned herself off and changed into a smock remaining naked underneath the sensation thrilled her everything about this night thrilled her with her clothes as they were she would have nothing but the smock to wear for her drive home wild she giggled with the thought when she returned he seemed nervous almost frantic not at all himself he kept checking his watch she joined him at the table alongside the patient and the stainless steel tray of hemostats scalpels and needles only then did she notice shes not prepped she blurted this out without thinking she isnt shaved their eyes met then and she saw panic in his so foreign a sight that it was made all the more obvious like a virtuoso missing a note or an actor forgetting a line he had neglected to prep her inconceivable elden tegg he never forgot a single detail of any operation large or small had the sex been that good she didnt know this man he had treated her so differently this evening done things she had always wanted but had never dared ask for that it was almost as if she was with someone else youre right he conceded shes not properly prepped elden tegg admit a mistake he never made a mistake what was happening he instructed her get what you need and prep her when she failed to respond he commanded harshly go on she didnt like that voice it wounded her a few minutes later as she was soaping the patients side and abdomen she noticed that the surgical cloth covering the patient was damp in the center of her chest it had been dry earlier when pamela had left the room she shaved the woman but her eyes wandered the room curiously and she spotted a surgical sponge stained with betadyne resting on the edge of the sink this too was new since she had been out of the room she put the two together the betadyne had earlier been used to prep the epidermal for surgery and then the patients chest had been washed clean of it while she was out of the room a heart impossible he wouldnt do that they had talked about that recently a lung perhaps all set she said to him all set her hands were shaking her knees weak her eyes fell upon that sponge across the room she thought about the sex what he had done to her out of desire or had it been to distract her to keep her attention off this patient she glanced over at him she felt a distance between them if this was a scheduled harvest why hadnt she been notified who was the courier if not her all set he said his eyes dancing nervously his hands trembling slightlyhands usually as steady as the steel he held yes another man entirely he leaned over the patient his dark eyes trained on her slowly carefully he lowered the blade her name is sharon he said to pamela thank you sharon this was part of his ritualevery donor had a name every donor was thanked for the contribution about to be made he insisted on this thank you sharon pamela echoed in an unsteady voice that betrayed her inner thoughts and caused tegg to glance up at her briefly but not for long only an instant the sharp blade came in contact with the womans skin the first drop of her blood seeped from the incision pamela lifted a sponge there was work to do as elden tegg began the invasive surgery for the kidney harvest thoughts swarmed inside his head like angry bees the problem lay in the fact that pamela would never approve of a heart procurementthe procedure for which this woman had been prepped prior to pamelas intrusion there was no predicting what she might do if she found out about it hence the charadethe lovemaking the distraction the ruse that he had forgotten to prep him and now an unplanned kidney harvest worse maybeck was due shortly hopefully to inform tegg that wong keis wife had been successfully admitted to the vancouver hospital and then to act as courier for both the harvested heart and the other organs once the various procedures were completed a single kidney harvest wouldnt interfere with any of thatthis donor wouldnt need any kidneys where she was going that was all part of teggs planbut pamelas curiosity was sure to peak if she encountered maybeck maybeck delivered donors and he returned them to the streets but this was too soon after surgery for a pickup she would have to wonder what he was doing here this time of night pamela chase was no idiot she would figure this out in minutes and then what there was one possible excuse he realized and he congratulated himself for thinking of it on rare occasions they performed a private harvest selling an organ directly to a friend of teggs a transplant surgeon in vancouveras opposed to shipping it off to the third world market patients on the low end of transplant waiting lists became desperate and this surgeon in vancouveralong with tegg was willing to do something about it for a fee this heart was a private arranged through the same man although pamela had previously delivered the privates there had been talk recently that perhaps maybeck should do it and this provided tegg his out he paid particular attention to his work for he continued to see this womans body as a treasure trove a chalice from which to draw life itself several lives one begets many it was almost poetic he felt a small twitch in his neck but paid it no mindjust nerves he worked more quickly than usual and pamela did a good job of keeping up of anticipating his every need he wanted this finished he wanted the kidney packed readied for travel and pamela on her way before maybecks arrival if maybeck said the wrong thing he could screw this all up tegg glanced up and looked around the room to rest his eyes the plastic walls and ceiling gave the room a strange metallic sheen reflecting the bright light like dulled mirrors again the muscles in his neck and shoulder twitched again he fought it off doctor she asked he had actually blanked out for a minute caught up more in his thoughts than his actions his eye rest had gone on a little too long he returned to his work talking as he did clamping the renal artery renal vein he prepared to sever both scalpel she slapped it into his gloved hand before he completed the first syllable she snatched it back just as quickly and he knew she had spotted a possible problem it was a tangled mess in here he wormed his fingers around the various veins and arteries doublechecking to make sure his clamps were properly placed what had she seen that he might have missed together they had successfully performed over thirty such human kidney harvests and yet they treated each as if it were their first he carefully followed the clamped artery to its source confirming it was the renal artery and not the superior mesenteric which for a moment she had obviously feared it might be satisfied he reestablished his clamp and found the scalpel in his hand once again he glanced into her eyes even with a mask covering most of her face he could tell she was smiling she enjoyed this precision teamwork as much as he too bad she would miss the heart tying off he announced he cut both vessels and tied them securely testing first the veinby carefully removing the hemostatand then the artery this artery carried over fortyfive percent of the bodys blood to the kidney the pressure to the suturc was significant they both studied the two closures alert for any leakage pamela reached in and sponged thoroughly teggs dexterous fingers at the ready looks fine he declared and went about severing the lesser vessels pamela washed the area in a steady stream of saline and antibiotic as tegg continued his work several minutes passed forehead he warned she mopped some perspiration from his brow this tiny room lacked adequate ventilation sealed in plastic as it was and the intense heat from the light overheated it quickly you know she commented the heat is a lot more tolerable like this referring to her nudity under the smock i just bet it is he said close to having the kidney free and clear it was nice what we just did will carry more significance mean more if it is not discussed message received i didnt mean yes you did she added ill live he glanced at her again he didnt like to see her angry at him like this he had come to expect that look of reverence in her eyes he had come to like it here we are he announced as he slowly extracted the cherished organ from the retracted incision cradling it in his cupped hands like a newborn infant saline he commanded she presented the chilled stainless container to him the clamped pink organ sank down into the cool water she added some saline to completely cover it and returned the dish to the bucket of ice where it had been waiting lets close he said pleased with their success the organ in that dish represented a saved human life and it was the product of the work of his hands no such feeling of accomplishment could ever be properly explained he thought still looking at it no one not even pamela could fully understand the magnitude of his happiness at such moments they returned to their teamwork four hands working as if controlled by a single brain and maybe they were he thought in a moment of conceit maybe this woman at his side was a far greater part of him than either of them understood it had begun to feel that way of late and why not what was wrong with that as they closed the various levels of muscle and tissue he instructed theres a unos container in the back room this transplant container one of many stolen by maybeck from the trash bins of the university hospital had been intended for the heart it was a good size for the heart slightly smaller than the ones they normally used for the kidneys make sure you triplebag the organuse viospan as alwayscheck for leaks dont forget and dont scrimp on the ice we received a complaint the last time i always check the ice she protested it was the cabin temperature it wasnt us theres nothing we can do about some old pilot who insists on flying in a sauna just make sure i will you know i will she then inquired what flight am i on tegg spoke quickly this is a private maybecks delivering he awaited her reaction he didnt dare look at her she might see something in his eyes to cover himself he added sternly we talked about this hmm i think its better this way you said so yourself you dont like delivering the privates she didnt say anything just right he didnt approve of the continuous stitch subcutaneous closure he had performed he removed it and began again this time in silence forehead he warned she caught the perspiration in time this contact between them seemed to settle her down some the remainder of their work went flawlessly he oversaw her efforts as she packaged the organ in the viospan she did a splendid job of ithe could have done no better when the small styrofoam container with its bright orange label was sealed and ready to go pamela retrieved her slicedup jeans from the floor tegg added quickly attempting humor its a good thing maybecks handling this one after all what would you wear she forced a smile she wasnt pleased with any of this but hers was a role of obedience five minutes later she was gone like most of the rooms in the small cabin the kitchen was in disrepair from years of neglect maybeck entered shaking off the cold looking like a biker with lockjawhe had the remarkable ability to talk most of the time without showing his grotesque teeth we got trouble problems tegg wondered he was proud of the way he had improvised with pamela the only problem he could conceive of had to do with transporting wong keis wife to vancouver she died he gasped connie says a cop was nosing around bloodlines yesterday had that girl chapmans name knows shes in the database the police the room suddenly seemed to be without air calm down tegg said though rattled himself the guy was pacing faster than a hungry pit bull rubbing his thumb and fingers together like he was trying to remove something sticky from them the police now he felt broadsided maybeck said were gonna shut it down right you got plans for shuttin it down right thats what you said before tegg found it difficult to think with maybeck circling the table like a predator sit down he instructed when issued this order for a second time maybeck sat we are gonna shut it down right maybeck repeated we cant shut it down tegg informed him we have wong kei to think about i took an advance payment hes counting on us you know what that means as well as i do tegg had his own personal agenda his own reasons for wanting to see this heart harvest to completion but he wasnt going to share them with a little person like maybeck who would never understand maybeck would respond better to his fear of the chinese mafia than to teggs needing to right his own past mistakes what advance maybeck asked tegg decided to play to the mans greed dont forget you have fifty thousand dollars coming to you from this heart harvestif there is a heart harvest no advance for you until the job is completed maybeck brooded tegg needed to settle him down he offered i have some vodka gimme some not too much tegg warned theres still work to be done he poured him a glass no ice tegg seldom drank he put the bottle away a thought occurred to him if worse came to worse he could always tell maybeck that he was closing up shop he could courier the organs himself if absolutely forced to but with possession ninetenths of the law he would rather have maybeck do it no more work to do tonight maybeck corrected spinning the warm vodka in the glass as if it were cognac word from up north is that the old bitch barely lived through the flight the chink said that the doctor says we gotta wait at least a week he mentioned next friday next friday but thats insane tegg protested loudly weve already abducted her shes lying on my table downstairs right now he felt dizzy fuck her its the cops im worried about we gotta shut this down doc we gotta do something fast whom do you fear more wong kei or the police tegg let the question hang there maybeck drank half the vodka swallowing it like water he cringed and then coughed out an appreciative ahhh he answered the chink hands down goddamn gooksll kill you for pocket change i hear what youre saying doci hear ya all right but i dont know i just dont know tegg marveled at the incomplete mind of a little person most of all little people wanted the answers decided for them he debated several possibilities and said confidently i suggest the following first we explore the extent of their knowledge police muck about all the time doesnt mean theyre necessarily onto something here hmm connie keeps us up to speed on everything thats going on at bloodlines her time has come to perform for us this is where she earns her bread and butter she gives us the database updatesthats how she earns her bread and butter dont toy with me donald tegg warned a mixture of anger and paranoia sweeping through him the police maybeck killed the vodka and looked around for the bottle tegg edged the glass away from the man using the back of his wristhe wanted a glass with maybecks fingerprints on it in case he needed it later for damage control an ounce of prevention the point being if the police remain interested in bloodlines then we must know about it you have to arrange this with connie no telephones you understand unless its just a signal of some sortno discussions on the telephones thats imperative even a person like you can understand that hmm he didnt care if he insulted the man he was beyond caring about such things it was the police he was concerned about now that and a successful harvest maybe he could up the schedulea week seemed an interminable timehed have to look into changing that if the cellular worked from out here id call the man right now tegg said but as it is well just have to wait on that he wrestled with the next thought that came into his mind because it was more something that maybeck would think to do not dr elden tegg and yet it persisted nagging at him refusing to go away they needed time they needed to distance themselves from the police there were ways to buy insurance that little people like maybeck understood perfectly well he said you understand what kind of trouble youlre in dont you you personally after all it was you who made the contacts with these donors minors dont forget it was you who delivered them to me you who arrange to steal you who paid them you who put them back onto the streets it was both of us maybeck complained oh no not at all think for just a momentif youre capable of thinkingthink about what ive just said and i believe you will see that im correct hmm yes i can see it in your eyes it was you who sliced them open doc what i done aint nothing compared with that he wanted to encourage the man without directly giving him an order if connie poses a problem for us we should take care of her shes the only direct connection between you and bloodlines perhaps i can advance the schedule another week and you could have your fifty thousand he reminded and be out of town take care of her is this stupidity an act of yours that inflamed the man good tegg wanted him angry intense anger was a precursor to violence tegg felt this same anger himself at the moment and violence was perhaps required of donnie maybeck youre saying we zoom connie maybeck asked incredulously trying to appear smart i didnt say anything of the sort i merely pointed out that youre in a hell of a lot of trouble if this investigation goes ahead we cant stop the police from investigating but we can stop them from having any luck things just might work out if connie took a twoweek vacation hmm but what if she freaks out now he was catching on tegg remained silent oh i get it said maybeck he smiled those teeth were anybodys nightmare yes i think you do donald tegg encouraged i think youre finally catching on michael washington was lost he had followed the old railroad grade for most of saturday had slept near a marsh that wasnt on the topomap and now was stuck in a thickly wooded second generation forest a moment before having climbed high into a treetop he had spotted a small cabin and quonset hut poised in a remote and secluded clearing he consulted the map once again hoping this old homestead a few of which appeared as small black squares on the map might serve as a landmark and help him to determine his location nothing doing he couldnt find anything like it on the map the problem was not the map he thought but him for the better part of the morning he had been consumed with trying to debug a software subroutine all in his head while hiking the old railroad grade he worked as a programmer for microsoft in a division developing a database program that remained a closely guarded company secret weekends he backpacked alone exploring new territorythis part of the country was sure a hell of a lot different from cleveland working out problems in his head destressing it left him mentally refreshed and physically satisfied by monday morning when his twelvehour workaday world began again not infrequently these sojourns left him briefly offtraillost this was not his first venture into this region through trial and error he had explored quite a piece of the south fork of the tolt and areas south toward snoqualmie falls even the old railroad grade was no stranger to himit provided sure footing and a slightly elevated trail to follow each weekend he expanded his knowledge of the area as he mentally ticked down imagined lines of source code in his head searching for solutions to various problems inherent in the program he was something of a superstar in a company of superstars he didnt think of himself this way but he knew that others did probably because he was afroamerican if you had any brains at all if you made it up even one rung of the ladder coworkers and supervisors took notice you were the exception not the rule if you solved all the problems that stumped the golden wizards they considered you a genius unwittingly michael found himself in this strange even burdensome position now he was expected to solve the more difficult problems his immediate problem was to find his way to his car by his calculations he was still a good two or three miles from where he had parked it and none of this looked like familiar territory especially the cabin and quonset he had momentarily glimpsed about all he could do now was to ask directions or try to connect with a dirt road that might eventually lead him to an identifiable landmark it would be dark in another three or four hours he couldnt afford too much more exploring despite the numerous no trespassing signs he encountered michael washington walked in the direction of the buildings he respected other peoples right to privacy as much as the next guy but lost was lost although it wasnt exactly an emergency these people would have to be sympathetic to a person being lost surrounded by thick forest his only indication that he was nearing the small farm were these posted threats which occurred with an increasing frequency when eventually he met with a sign that read pass at your own risk he began to wonder what kind of people these were he was no stranger to the occasional news story of the survivalists racial extremists and psychotic killers who hermited the woods of the northwest the warnings were quite explicit perhaps it was a better idea to just move on and avoid the place obey the signs but michael washington was too practical too logical to pass up a chance to establish his location he wasnt after a ride he didnt need help all he needed was the slightest indication on the map of where the hell he was he stood in front of this final warning for only as long as it took the light rain to start up again that did it he was going to find his way out of here if it was the last thing he ever did it was the structure was thirty feet long and about as wide at the far end rain leaked in across the pouredcement floor the canopy of corrugated metal that arched overhead reminded the woman of an airplane hangar rain beat down on it like hailstones her ears rang from it she had awakened in a cagea dog pen she now realized by looking around constructed of chainlink wire mesh and galvanized pipe the cage appeared to be about eight feet long by four feet wide and too low to stand up in there were dogs in nearly all the cages she was naked lying on a brown burlap sack she had no idea what time it was who she was where she was or what had happened to her some kind of nightmare the reality of her situation slowly seeped in she remembered the two men in her house she remembered the needle in her arm she tried to sit up pain screamed from her side her arm tangled in an iv tube she recalled a devastatingly bright light and another warm surge of drugs again she tried to sit up the pain even more intense her hand fell to her side and she felt the bandage there panic overcame her dogs a cage naked there was a bucket behind her a roll of toilet paper alongside of it against the wall an automatic waterer the in bag was clamped to the overhead wire of the cage drip drip drip she could see it feeding her she rolled to get a better look at the bandage it was several inches long redness seeping into the skin around its edges she felt overtaken by a sudden burst of nausea rolled to her side and vomited had she awakened before this she couldnt remember she felt completely disoriented there was nothing here that fit into her reality it was almost as if this were happening to someone else she really had believed it to be some kind of intense nightmare at first one of those in which everything is too real tactile painful and emotionally allencompassing but there was no question as to the reality of her situation if she had awakened prior to this her situation had not taken hold only now as the dogs began stirring in their cages as the pain in her side reached an excruciating level did she begin to grasp her circumstances she began to collect herself there were eight adjacent cages against each of the quonset huts two long walls a cement aisle separating them the buildings only door was to her right her cage was sandwiched between two others that were empty at the far end of the building to her left a cage was stacked high with sacks of dog food across the aisle to her left a gas heater suspended from the high ceiling emitted a warm wind which blew directly onto her perhaps she thought that heater explained her placement in this particular cage she counted twelve dogs some of them carried partially healed scars she felt dizzy at the sight of those scars a kennel she sat up slowly overcoming the pain driven by the need to get out of here there was a weight on her neck she grabbed for it tugged but it was thick and heavy a collar of some sort only now did she realize all the dogs were also wearing such collars big collars with a heavy black lump attached she knew what that lump wasa battery she understood the purpose of these collars she pulled at it again her fingers touched a small padlockit was locked around her neck she panicked she crawled on hands and knees over to the chainlink door and grabbed hold her collar sounded a brief electronic alarm it failed to register on her mind as a warning instead invoking further panic she shook the cage door violently a jolt of electricity flashed from her neck to her toes like scalding water pain as sharp and severe as any she had known she let go fell back and cried out at the top of her lungs the dogs leapt to their feet in unison and barked so loudly so vehemently that it deafened her sharon shaffer clasped her hands to her ears and screamed again tears pouring from her eyes the dogs roared on perhaps this was hell she thought perhaps she had died and gone to hell as michael washington tentatively entered the clearing that held a cabin and a quonset hut he heard a sickening cry that cut him to the core a woman it was immediately followed by the vicious barking of dogs but he felt almost certain that he had heard a woman perhaps it was nothing more than his active imagination he thought he had after all only minutes before been thinking about the weirdos who lived in places like this one of the newspaper stories that lodged in his mind was that of a father and son who had kidnapped a woman backpacker keeping her in chains raping and torturing her until authorities finally raided the camp had he merely projected the terror of that story onto what he had heard or was there a woman trapped in there with a bunch of dogs he broke into a run a minute later he reached the far end of the structure the buildings only door held an enormous padlock locked with dogs inside why he banged loudly on the door and pressed his ear to its cold metal there were so many dogs barking it was impossible to be sure exactly what he was hearing and yet that sounded like a woman calling for help he abandoned his pack and ran toward the cabin stopping abruptly before he reached it because it occurred to him that if it was a womans voice then whoever was inside that cabin was responsible for her being there he returned quickly to his backpack scooped it up and made for the woods he hunkered down and took a minute to collect himself by all appearances the cabin was unoccupied but the car tracks in the mud indicated this place was frequented often and by the look of several of the tracks recently how long would he have to check this out he left his backpack in the woods returned to the structure and circled it fully only the one door hinges on the inside youd need a stick of dynamite to break that padlock he circled again beating on the walls to check their constructiontoo stout to hope to bust up at one point he thought he heard that voice againhe was sure of itbut those dogs were so loud the frustration drove him to a frantic circling of the building around and around he finally caught himself and stopped he had to get help that was all there was to it he ran along the very edge of the primitive driveway that led to the farm alert for any cars ahead of him prepared to hide in the woods if he saw any the drivewaythe roadwas the most obvious route to follow somewhere out there was civilization and this had to be the fastest way to it the more he ran the quicker his pace driven by adrenaline driven as if pursued by someone the driveway a halfmile long joined a dirt road challenged on its edges by weeds he followed this road to the right convinced not only that town was this waythe sun lay to his right he had to be running southbut also that his car was parked somewhere in this general direction he tried to think this through whoever lived in the cabin was gone he decided that if a car approached from in front of him a car returninghe would hide but if a car or truck happened to approach him from behinda car headed south a car headed out of herehe would flag it down he prided himself on his logic the fact that he was able once again to think clearly restored some of his confidence and helped to calm him he pumped hard and continued to run as time wore on he considered flagging down any car he saw he encountered an intersection and then immediately another one here finally was an obvious landmark but he had left his map in his pack he sized up the dim glow of the retreating sun and continued south toward eventual civilization elden tegg was on his way to the farm to check his patient when he first spotted the boot prints coming down his road these tracks stretched in a length and stride that indicated a hard run his heart began to beat frantically his cabin and kennel were at the end of this dirt track nothing else nothing else fresh tracks at that he realized maybecks warning of the night before echoed in his head the police he drove quickly skidding to a stop as he reached his property the boot tracks led directly from the kennel for a moment he found it hard to catch his breathhim dr calm he leapt from the car following the prints like a trapper his fingers groping for his keys selfcontrol was allimportant his strength he settled himself and observed the scene before him whoever it was had stopped in front of the kennel door but there was only the one set of tracks he he hadnt made it inside tegg lost the prints in or s the grass around the side of the structure his mind through a dozen possibilities but he didnt race like where any of them led back to those tracks he unlocked the door hurried inside and breathed a sigh of relief as he saw his captive in her cage locked up tight bewildered she didnt utter a word before he left and locked the structure again how old were these tracks minutes hours he had not seen anyone on the road but there were dozens of roads out here was he too late had the intruder taken a different road than he he jumped back into the trooper and headed down the road as fast as the car would safely take him he followed the tracks on the edge of the road like a bloodhound at the end of the lane they turned right so did tegg these boot prints dragged on for what seemed like miles the distance between each print narrowing and after a while indicating the hiker was walking good tegg thought walking is slower he was still extremely nervous once nearly foreign condition for him but one that was beginning to seem familiar he took long deep breaths and calmed himself he reached the doubletriangle intersection where the aqueduct crossed the south fork and saw at once why he had not passed the hiker on the way in he had followed the roads due south but had taken the fork that eventually wound its way east to the reservoir there was a lot of open road out here tegg drove faster worried now there might be people at the reservoir he didnt want this hiker reaching anyone he rounded a long sweeping corner a hundred yards ahead of him he spotted the hiker as the hiker heard the vehicle hea black manturned and waved his arms frantically tegg felt the blood pounding in his ears he slowed the vehicle and rolled down his window the hiker was young and handsome with anxious eyes please the young man pleaded i need a ride i need some help help are you in trouble please tegg said hop in releasing the cars power door lock wondering how next to handle this as the boy climbed in tegg felt charged with a keen sense of power he couldnt weaken he couldnt allow his fear to show he asked his passenger to buckle up he took control where are we the young man asked are you lost among other things my cars out here somewhere engine trouble no the boy hesitated he asked carefully are you from around here tegg considered this briefly a test no he answered i have some work out at the reservoir he pointed the reservoir is this direction yes it is stop the car tegg slowed problems i have to go the other way he shook his head oh man did i ever fuck up tegg slowed the car to a crawl can i help could you well i wouldnt exactly feel right about abandoning you out here what exactly is the problem hysterical michael washington ranted and raved about being lost about dogs a womans voice and needing help something linking sexual perverts to backpackers calm down a minute tegg said trying to convince himself as much as his passenger he pulled to the side of the road stopping the car won the boys full attention little people were so predictable im telling you theres a woman up there who needs help you saw her tegg wondered if his heart could endure this the wheel was slippery from the sweat on his palms he let go of the wheel an expression of doubt crossed the young mans face it dissipated quickly as he reminded himself emphatically the barn was locked a barn more like a small hangar a quonset hut there were dogs a kennel it was a woman im telling you tegg explained well we can be at the sheriffs in about thirty minutes or we could call he pointed to his cellular phone i can get a clear signal a few miles down the road but you better have your story straight meaning your name michael michael have you ever heard a cat at night hmm have you ever heard that peculiar screaming of a cat during fornication and thought you heard a woman now teggs hitchhiker looked puzzled dont get me wrongim not telling you what you heard i wasnt there youre the one wholl explain it to the sheriff but you mentioned dogs and that made me think of cats and how much they can sound like a woman a woman screaming cats fornicating a mountain lion can sound that way what was it you said you heard his passenger didnt answer at first then he stated emphatically i heard a woman scream tegg added i dont know how you feel about involving the cops but theyre not my favorite people were you on private property was that property posted did you have the owners permission to be there they ask you things like that dont forget that i know that i also know what i heard and youre prepared to deal with them fine tegg went through the motions of pretending to engage the car you ask me cops are stupid theyre little people what choice is there i have to do something he added and what about those dogs tegg nodded the important thing was to remain in control to give this person the sense that he tegg had all the answers even though he was making this up on the fly the key to such manipulation was in allowing the other person to believe that all the good ideas were his to fill in gaps that were never left in the first place for so many animals in the wild the key to survival the way they snared their prey was through convincing camouflage tegg knew his most effective camouflage was to appear to be this mans friend how quickly we place our trust in those we like and tegg could be quite likable when he tried listen if youre saying i should go back there with you tegg suggested i suppose that makes some good sense its a good idea the police are certainly more likely to believe the two of us arent they of course they are he didnt wait for an acknowledgment he had the boy right where he wanted him confused no one likes to disclaim authorship of a good idea he turned the car around he would have to pretend he didnt know the way it was strange how long the ride seemed to take in reality it was only a few minutes a couple of miles for elden tegg attempting to work this out in his head those minutes passed slowly another complication this heart harvest had brought him some bad luck but he wasnt going to bail out not with wong keis money in hand not with a donor all lined up you seized a problem by the throat and you squeezed until it died it was as simple as that problems left breathing came back to life you killed them the first time or you suffered the consequence michael directed tegg through the turns that lead tegg onto his own property tegg remarked convincingly ive been coming up these country roads for years never knew this place existed me either michael said youre on foot are you tegg asked needing as much information as possible his hope was to discourage this person to convince him he had heard wrong send him on his way but if this failed what then where was a person like maybeck when you needed him the most hiking youre a long way from anywhere he added i was under the impression this is mostly private land out here it was all privately leased land nowtimberland owned by paper companies the hiker had been trespassingprobably knowingly and this seemed useful ammunition you preyed on a persons vulnerabilities it was always the weakest link that broke first when his passenger failed to respond tegg said the thing of it is the police may wonder what you were doing up here in the first place especially if it turns out to be a wild goose chasea couple of cats fornicating you say you were hiking are there trails up here theres an old railroad grade the young black man snapped defensively i dont care what the police say tegg knew all about the old railroad grade about the nature conservancys attempts to purchase much of this land he remembered the tree spiking the radicals who chained themselves to the trees he glanced over at his passenger who seemed so righteous so determined tegg rolled down his window and fished for air what next he thought of a possible way out we wont have any trouble with those dogs you mentioned he said once again getting the others attention at least we shouldnt hmm did i tell you im a veterinarian there it was the biggest risk to take but if offered as an asset he hoped it might be accepted as such no shit the young man asked the rangers keep a couple horses out here tegg lied convincingly out at the reservoir he added keeping his story straight he glanced over at his passengerwas that relief he saw he explained quickly i have my kit in the back if the dogs give us any trouble well be fine its just up here his passenger informed him did you speak to anyone in the house tegg asked as they rounded the bend in the road that revealed the cabin he felt in more control now though his adrenaline was still pumping he felt slightly giddy with anticipation are you kidding i mean what if someone is in the house what if there is a woman locked up in that hangar there isnt tegg said asserting some authority there are some strange people back in these woods i know that i mean really strange tegg pulled the isuzu to a stop the dogs barked ferociously with one eye on the cabin michael stated leave it running if theyre armed if there is someone here and they turn out to be armed we should be prepared to leave in a hurry agreed they both climbed out tegg felt suddenly enlightenedwhat a perfect idea youve given me an idea i just happen to have something that might help us feeling stronger nowhimself againhe returned to the car opened the back door and rummaged in his veterinary supplies one thing was for certain if he made it through this a few things were going to change he would leave felix uncaged free to patrol the aisle free to attack if a stranger opened the door and he would muzzle the woman the bitch no more screaming this ought to help us he said showing it to michael washington a gun a dart pistol armed with something called ketamine quite effective i assure you now lets have a listen he motioned the young man over to the structure over here i heard her over here michael said indicating the north side of the structure we wont hear anything with this barking tegg said maybe if we just sit here michael washington said theyll calm down he seemed nervous about the possibility of somone coming from the cabin he checked it continually i havent got all day young man hmm if we could get a look inside its locked up tight weve already trespassed you dont want to add breaking and entering to that do you the police treat all crime the same you know i for one want nothing to do with breaking any more laws tegg felt a strange lightheadedness the air seemed crystal clear he knew what had to be done he checked the dart gun once again tegg attempted to discourage him i for one have other things to do what about you i thought you said you were lost wont this delay of yours be noticed he tested are you with anyone else me no but i understand what youre saying we cant wait around here forever maybe it was just a cat the dogs quieted tegg lifted his hand like a preacher and they waited in silence as the last of the barking stopped completely it surprised him they should stop so soon sometimes they went on for hours nothing he whispered michael stepped toward the building he raised his arm preparing to bang on the wall without actually breaking inside tegg added stopping the man theres not much more to be done were sure as hell not going to break that lock teggs finger slipped onto the trigger despite the isolation tegg had no desire to do this out in the open he had made a similar mistake once before in his life and he was not prone to repeating mistakes helllppp came the distinctive cry of a womans voice from inside it was quickly buried in barking but there was no mistaking it the hiker exploded into a frenzy what did i tell you he ran for the door the pistol was no good for moving targets tegg was no marksman he hurried after him above all he wanted them both inside before he used the dart gun it would take anywhere from thirty seconds to several minutes for the ketamine to take effect he needed the man contained for this period not running wild shoot him inside the kennel then get out quickly and lock the door until the drug took effect in a calm almost serene way he examined his options what was left there could be no trusting this man the threat was too great even if tegg were to move the woman his research laboratory was here in the basement of the cabin could he give it all up on account of one lost hiker problems tended to breed like rabbits solutions required quick decisions something has just occurred to me what about a hidden key a spare key for this shed people always hide a spare i certainly do it shouldnt be too hard to find tegg said this as he fingered the appropriate key in his pocket youre right all we have to do is think like him hmm where would you hide a spare key ill take this side you take that it took tegg only a few seconds to separate the key from his key chain although he had to set the dart gun down to do so he turned over a rock so that it would look as if he had found it there then he announced loudly ive found it the man named michael came running tegg retrieved the dart gun and led the boy to the door he inserted the key and turned the padlock snapped open you first tegg said this was your idea he added ill back you up and displayed the loaded dart gun the door swung open they were greeted with a penetrating darkness and foul bitter odors the dogs barked wildly michael washington checked silently with elden tegg encouraged by him he began a slow tentative walk down the darkened aisle the white teeth of the dogs bared and snarling challenged him at every step the shock collars sang with warnings and the dogs cried with pain as they threw themselves against the chain link walls of their cages elden tegg dart gun in hand followed a few steps behind with each cage tegg passed the dog inside went silent michael washington took no notice made no connection his attention instead riveted on the inhabitant of the cage up ahead on the left on the bare back and buttocks of the woman crouched into the far corner she glanced over her shoulder briefly her arms tucked tightly covering her breasts looking first at michael washington then at elden tegg she hid her face i was right michael washington proclaimed triumphantly turning toward tegg but youll soon wish you hadnt been replied elden tegg who was waiting several feet away dart gun raised he squeezed the trigger the gun went off with a crack tegg had never fired a dart gun at a human he had hesitated an instant too long a shocked and stunned michael washington reached down and pulled the dart free eyes filled with rage he charged tegg who would be no match for the younger man the dogs barking was deafening tes mind worked furiously the shovel leaning against the near wall it offered possibility he lunged toward the wall jumping left toward the shovel as his charger misjudged his intentions and crashed into the door slamming it shut a drugged michael washington got out of his own way then and managed to crack the door open as tegg seized the shovel and swung it in a long unforgiving arc toward the other mans head the shovel dropped quickly only grazing the black mans arm washington caught hold of the shovel and handoverhand drew tegg closerboth of them struggling for possession tegg saw the mans pupils then and he let go of the shovel surprising michael washington who staggered back shovel in hand tegg witnessed the first major seizure in the man a ripple of muscle contraction that ran from his feet to his shoulders michael washington fought it with great difficulty he managed to move one heavy step forward fear belied his intentions tegg watched catching his breath he smiled theres no use fighting it now he said washingtons entire body tensed as a second contraction hit him he collapsed tegg stood over him watching studying he had never seen such a severe reaction to ketamine as a doctor he found it fascinating in higher doses it was lethal oh no the drugged man groaned oh yes answered elden tegg another smile forming on his lips boldt was driving his toyota daphne riding with him he had been warned that it might be days or even weeks until he could draw a vehicle from the pool he didnt have an office cubicle yet either in many ways he remained the outsider his return to the department more technical than actual a few miles passed the emerald city receded in the rearview mirror he could see out across the sound lush green islands like jewels more pleasure craft than on the weekdays their sails catching the brilliant sunshine like sunstarved flowers ferries like big bugs back and forth back and forth the waterways came alive on weekends when the sun shone his eyes refocused objects closer than they appear read the message stenciled across the outside mirror no lie thought lou boldt studying daphnes profile you dont have to be so mad he said to her we should have done this yesterday you did speak to her yesterday it couldnt be official for twentyfour hours thats a stupid law twentyfour hours sharon could be anywhere by now she added and dont give me the statistics sermon youll see once you have spoken to agnes youll be convinced i know you i know you will be sharon did not take off somewhere those goddamn statistics werent made for people like her and dont hand me that crap about her having been a runaway thats all behind her i could have popped shoswitz for that hes a misogynist you know that lamoias running the surveillance on the bloodlines employee connie chi he said trying to distract her she was worked up for nothingthey were almost there in the police department nothing moved at the pace you wanted investigators learned to accept it psychologiststurnedinvestigators suffered for it there was a long silence so how are things he asked things she questioned what things you know he said my sex life she asked bluntly am i getting enough something like that he felt himself blush sorry he wasnt asking about her sex life but her happiness though he felt helpless to explain im on hold at the moment she answered there was someone for a while but i handled it all wrong i wanted too much too soon it wasnt even that i wanted it i expected it the truth is i dont know what i want and that doesnt work in a relationship they stopped at a light but boldt didnt look at her she sounded so damaged you seem happy he said optimistically im in therapy its fantastic thats what i mean about being on hold im working a little too much surprise but it fills the hours you know and the therapy is helping a lot its nice to have some control again a single evening they had spent together a dinner that had run out of control boundaries crossed honesties voiced and now strangely as if it never had happened well you look great he told her feeling stupid to have said it thanks she hesitated no regrets you none he felt her look at him and he warmed all over im glad she said sharon shaffers housemate agnes rutherford was five feet tall with silverblue hair that gleamed like silk and perfectly brilliant iceblue eyes that belied their inability to function agnes rutherford was blind she wore a cardigan sweater littered with dandruff and a skirt that was losing its hem leather slippers worn shiny on the sides from sliding her feet along like a person wearing boots on ice when boldt and daphne were only a few feet inside the door agnes rutherford asked him how old is your child mr boldt or am i supposed to call you by your rank boldt looked over at daphne in astonishment she touched her nose in pantomime hes six months boldt replied still a baby and do you smoke even with a child in the house smoke no not me im a musician on the side he added though he wasnt sure which side anymore a night club he sniffed at his coat its probably my coat that smells like cigarettes agnes rutherford grinned proud of herself her teeth were too perfect to be hers daphne repeated what she and the woman had discussed a day earlier hasnt been home either the blind woman said in a troubled voice boldt asked why is it you think something happened to sharon oh something happened all right why else would that man have lied to me which man you can hear it in a persons voice when theyre lying did you know that he was a very tense man what a voice he hadlike fingernails on a blackboard nervous not just because i surprised him which i did mind you but out of fear strange as it may seem he was afraid of me me daphne suggested calmly why dont you start at the beginning agnes i heard voices through the wall two men talking to sharon and sharon was scared plenty scared i couldnt hear the words you understand but i a didnt have to she was good and scared voices daphne repeated yes so i came in through the kitchen we share the kitchen my rooms are just off the back side there came in to make sure she was all right thats why i say the man liedhe told me sharon had gone out for a minute and that he and his associate were also leaving but the other onethe one with the halitosisi think he dragged sharon out i heard something dragging on the carpet she had been sitting in that chair right over there that chair squeaks i heard it i heard her voice too though not her words not what she said not exactly do you remember what was said boldt asked agnes rutherford nodded thereabouts as i rounded the corner the one with the hard voice asked the other who the hell is that those exact words yes he didnt expect me and then there was a long silence then the other dragged her out i think at the time of course i didnt know what was happening but thats what i think was going on and you didnt call the police boldt asked dumbfounded i wasi amafraid of you i spent a good many years of my life avoiding you hiding on the streets you understand would anyone have believed an old blind bag lady mr boldt would they have you dont believe me now i can hear it in your voice you cant believe an old blind lady can survive the streets but i did daphne believes me i bet but only because she knows me she added i didnt call the police i called the shelter i called daphne daphne glared at boldt then he was trying to see this through the eyes of the lawphil shoswitz or prosecuting attorney bob proctorand he didnt like what he saw there was no proof of a crime no matter whatagnes rutherford believed she witnessed she had not seen it police work was as much practicality as it was instinct sharon shaffers history was that of a runaway this would not be an easy sell despite the cooperative relationship between the police and the shelter the prosecuting attorneys office was another realm entirely boldt examined the room he remembered the stevie wonder line her clothes are old but never are they dirty that was how this room looked pieced together from yard sales but clean to the corners vacuumed recently he asked agnes rutherford is this room still pretty much as it was the woman answered oh yes exactly i havent touched a thing my rooms are back there i dont fool with sharons things boldt walked slowly and carefully over to the table and chairs the cop in him understood the significance of what to untrained eyes might have looked like nothing more than dust on the table it wasnt dust tiny particles of shredded paper perhaps he studied the table top and then using his handkerchief so he wouldnt leave fingerprints applied pressure to the back of the chair it squeaked thats the one agnes said boldt told her the house had just been cleaned he made it a statement she had vacuumed the carpet that morning now just exactly how did you know that agnes rutherford asked daphne asked boldt lou boldt didnt need any more convincing he was standing amid a pile of evidence there were drops of blood on the arm of the chair call the lab he said and tell them to bring a lot of lights lights daphne asked for the carpet boldt explained variations in the nap of the carpet allowed him to see a pair of scuff lines and the perfectly formed impressions of shoe prints boldt enjoyed watching the id unit the scientific identification departmentat work educated as scientists they didnt think like other cops they worked as a team speaking in halfsentences using techie jargon unintelligible to the layman with their nerd packs and a language all their own these men and women remained on the social fringe of the police fraternity but played an increasingly important role in any investigation the star witnesses in an investigation were no longer the boyfriend or the observant neighbor but these id unit technicians convictions relied on a foundation of incriminating scientific evidence a jury even a judge preferred believe a computergenerated enlargement of work from an electron microscope rather than a woman like agnes who had heard voices through a wall you didnt bother bob proctor and his band of pas unless you hada file full of stats to support your case the only thing about id that really irritated boldt was how slowly they went about their jobs if sharon shaffer had been abducted which he now believed he could only imagine how terrified she must be at this momentproviding she was still alive no ransom call no notification whatsoever impatience nagged at him the id unit continued its meticulous examination of the crime scene the first round involved the detailed photographing in varying degrees of enlargement and detail of all angles and aspects relevant to the possible crime several general shots were taken followed by increasingly specific studies of the carpet the chair sharon had apparently sat in the table top and the fixtures the area was vacuumed nextexcluding the carpetfor fibers using small handheld filterspecific vacuum cleaners each filter was removed and labeled and then bagged in a white paper bag plastic bags were rarely used by hairs and fibers because of their static charge while several of the team continued to measure and photograph the impressions in the carpet others began carefully dusting surfaces with dark and light powders using soft animalhair brushes any developed prints were first photographed and then lifted using wide strips of transparent packing tape the powder print and all came up with the lift which was then mounted on card stock labeled and set aside all this while boldt consulting daphne wrote up a detailed first officers report describing the scene exactly as he had found it his suspicions and his findings the report came to two singlespaced legal pages written longhand they both signed and dated it for the specific hour bernie lofgrin ate too much and exercised too little he had the coloring of an irishman and the temper of a scot he wore glasses as thick as ashtrays and suspenders with fullfrontal nudes hand painted onto them when bernie tugged them this way and that the nudes did a belly dance everyone called him the professor he ran his squad like a scout leader and put away more beer at the big joke than an alumnus on homecoming weekend over the past year he had become a regular during boldts piano sets he had joined the boldtdixon jazz record exchangetaping each others albums bemies collection leaned toward drummers and trombone players boldt knew that with this being a sunday it should have been only a skeletoncrew id unit but lofgrin had come himself and had brought additional overtime help as a personal favor as he approached his thick glasses were aimed at boldt like unfocused binoculars he seemed to have eyes the size of fried eggs one of the two suspects wears a shoe size eightandahalf wide maybe d maybe e the other suspect some kind of running shoe the way the nap in the carpet stood up for us these guys might as well have left us plaster impressions we might even have a make on the manufacturer of those running shoes by sometime tomorrow wee got a distinctive triangular tread pattern in a couple of takes size thirteen by the way big foot fibers on the table vacuumed up just fine crisp paper by the look of it we got another small piece under the table light blue ink on it reads usa as in printed in was that what the guy was waving a microphone over boldt asked you jazz guys think anything with a wire running into it is a microphone that device measures lowlevel radioactivity a geiger counter like that yeah the reason being that i suspected it was the paper covering to a bandaid or gauze something like that that paper has a distinctive look that geiger counteras you call it picked up a charge consistent with my suspicions radioactivity its how they sterilize them bandaids gauze nearly every selfcontained disposable item in a hospitalthey zap em with lowlevel radioactivity after theyre packagedthat way they can guarantee sterility live and learn stick with me kid evidence points to two possibilities real careful junkiesdoubtful or a doctormore likely a doctor weve got some real obvious residual fluidsdried up you understanddiscovered both on the arm of the chair and beneath the table we got a good photo of the drip pattern my guess is it was squirted size of the droplets suggest a syringe boldt interrupted either that or this guy is the original needledick and he came all over that chair he smiled well get all this shit off to the state lab might have that blood you found typed sometime tomorrow he said answering boldts thoughts before he could voice them mr eightandahalfwide was carrying some kind of flatbottomed case fourteen by eighteen inches like a doctors bag thats my guess yes bernie went on big foot the guy with the running shoes was carrying a laptop computer he set it down next to the chair and gave us enough of an impression for an educated guess that thats what it was although you cant take that one to the bank if you bring in these two in the next twentyfour to fortyeight hours i may be able to lift some of these carpet fibers from the edges of their shoes its a cheap synthetic loose weave real prone to shedding the static should hold the fibers on the shoes for a while as to your idea that maybe the person in that chair was dragged out of the room its possible but were not likely to prove it something was draggedi can testify to thatand it had two legs or feet or posts but thats as close as well get our other vacuum samples could give us a hell of a lot more to work with stay tuned he slapped boldt on the arm and returned to his crew boldt looked around at an anxious daphne who had just returned from interviewing the neighbors in the apartment houses he waved her over nothing she said fourteen families of people and no one saw a thing he asked her to call the citys dispatch sharons doctor ambulance services and the two closest area hospitals inquiring whether on the previous day sharon had sought medical attention whats up the professor has uncovered some evidence that points to either a drug deal or a doctor not drugs lou not sharon i know her past says otherwise but i know the woman would i have you calling hospitals if i suspected a drug deal she eased noticeably but if she didnt call an ambulance then a drug deal is easier to believe not for me it isnt daffy somehow two people convinced a streetwise woman to open her door for them how it also now appears that somehow she was further convinced to roll up her sleeve for them you know bob proctors reputation its going to be our job to disprove any streetdrug connection the state lab will have a lot to say about that but if we found her admitted to an area hospital wed all feel a hell of a lot better thats not the way agnes reports it she says she was kidnapped i know that daffy lou the professor bernie lofgrin called out kneeling by one of the chairs boldt joined him there youre the quintessential king of no coincidences lofgrin said am i right so so we did the lab workup on the cynthia chapman clothingmatthews runaway kay okay boldt felt his pulse quicken why would the professor bring up cindy chapman now lofgrin who was wearing a pair of jewelers loupes clipped to his already thick glasses found a magnifying glass in a bag and handed it to boldt get a load of this he said he pointed boldt focused the glass onto the spot indicated a clump of animal hairs clung to the fabric of the chair under the glass they looked like pickupsticks what do you see lofgrin asked confidently animal hairs boldt replied a pile of them notice the extremely long white ones see how much longer they are than the others theyre unusually long we lifted similar hairs off chapmans clothes he made a face at boldt a lab guy like lofgrin would never use the word identical in the scientific world identical rarely existed what weve got here is a visual crossmatch lofgrins magnified eyes looked like two ventilated beach balls boldt studied the hairs once again blood thumping in his ears cindy chapman and sharon shaffer connected abducted by the same man both runaways one present one past overlaps mounting coincidences he couldnt buy he asked any way to prove such a connection evidence as ubiquitous as animal hairs was unlikely to hold up in court but boldt temporarily ignored this lofgrin smiled the professor loved a challenge well sure as hell try daphne kept a close eye on boldt as he hurried her off the telephone took it from her and started dialing she protested hey it was you who wanted me to make these calls priorities he replied he avoided looking at her because she was the kind of person to sense something was wrong he didnt know the number so he called information seattle he said coincidences he was thinking bloodlines hoping he had spoken quietly enough not to be overheard but as he turned around there she was only inches from him wearing a puzzled frightened expression the woman who answered connected him to a man named henderson because verna dundee the managing supervisor didnt come in on sundays boldt reintroduced himself and presented his case daphne listening in he cupped the receiver and protested to daphne cant a guy get some privacy around here no she replied fear and irritation flashing from her eyes boldt spelled sharon shaffers name for the man i doubt its a recent file ill wait he said in anticipation as he assumed he was placed on hold he would have to check central processing using anotherline lou daphne asked eyes squinting lips pale boldt felt impossibly hot the seconds grew into minutes he thought i should hang up right now i should leave this for others i should stick to my family and my piano playing because if it turns out it was henderson telling him what he didnt want to hear he wouldnt need the results of the professors tests not now that he had this he felt sick to his stomach daphne had desperate eyes she had already guessed lou how did you put something like this to daphne why as a cop were you always the bearer of bad news sharon shaffer is in the bloodlines database three years ago she was a regular donor daphne gasped i think the harvesters struck again he looked over at agnes rutherford her blind eyes steady and untracking and shes our only witness sharon shaffer looked on as the black man in the kennel next to hers came awake for the first time she remembered the terror of that moment and could do nothing to warn him of the horror he was about to experience nothing to lessen its effect the dogs started barking she knew he would awakenit had been the same for her she couldnt remember exactly when had it been just yesterday it seemed more like forever he looked around surprise astonishment terror he clearly noticed then the chainlink cages and a moment later his own nakedness she knew that his head ached miserably from the drugs just as hers had he spotted her then she tried her best to communicate with her eyes for her jaw was now held in a modified dog muzzle made of nylon webbing one strap of which ran across her mouth keeping a gauze rag stuffed into place to prevent her from crying out as she had to this man she felt responsible for his being here she was responsible his jaw was secured in a similar muzzle although the gag had been omitted probably because the doctor feared he might vomit on coming awake which he did repeatedly she had to wonder was it the effects of the sedation or from looking at her she could only guess at what she must look like a bandage glowing a lurid pink at the edges she had pale skin the color of cigarette ash her hair was matted flat or perhaps that expression of his arose from the dogs and their horrid smell the deafening barking at the slightest instigation it would take him a while to adjust to their situation but she needed him to adjustto settle down to help her escape she was going to get out of here with or without him she thought that if only she could stop him from what he would do next she could spare him some pain but the muzzle and gag prevented her from speaking she could only grunt and gesticulate and that only quite weakly she had little strength drugged as she was by whatever was in the in it felt like a combination valiumdemerol to her she was experienced enough to know when she thought about it it brought on resentment and anger rage and indignation she had spent the last three years of her life learning to live sober now forced on her she found herself drugged up againenjoying the feeling wanting more she looked up at the precious drip drip drip of the in worst of all she couldnt bring herself to disconnect the tube if anything she wished it would flow faster she could take more she had always been able to take more despite her efforts to warn him her neighbor reached out and touched the chainlink door of the cage he actually laced his fingers into it and shook it with his considerable strength he must have heard the collar sound its electronic warningthe buzzbut like her on her first time he didnt associate this sound with the pain that would follow and like her he would learn soon enough she watched as his fingers met the cage as a blinding pulse of electricity stung his neck and literally knocked his knees out from under him she heard his head thump against the cement as he wilted his bowels loosened and he fouled himself he lay there staring up at her flat on his back the pain fear and terror so great in his eyes that she felt herself break into tears a maddening frustration stole through her and briefly she found enough strength to sit up to sit forward and be as close to him as possible as his strength returned he reached for the shock collar and despite her shaking her head in discouragement he tried in vain to rid himself of it how clearly she remembered those first few minutes they seemed so distant now he would deny his situation at first she knew he would think this cant be this is impossible then as reality sank in as his muscle strength returned as he began to assess to realize the hopelessness he would recoil a minute later he sat in the center of the cage wrapped in the fetal position sobbing and mumbling incoherently impossible what did i do cant be he mentioned god he mentioned his parents he glanced over at her several times but seemed not to see her he retreated she sat back onto the burlap and waited in time he would come around given time he would come to realize they were a team now and that their only chance of escape was to work together her one single hope remained that he would come up with a plan after all this time here she saw no way out like the in in her wrist she was stuck here not long after thatshe could not determine the passage of time because of the drugs and the suspended states in which she found herselfthe ground rumbled a car the dogs paced restlessly inside their cages she turned quickly to her neighbor charged with adrenaline she shouted at him through the gag able to win his attention but unable to communicate she resorted to an archaic pantomime pushing her hands along the cement as if to say clean up demonstrating that he should scoop up the vomit and excrement and get it into the bucket left as a toilet when he failed to respond she twisted her face angrily and screamed shaking her fists and then pointed to the door its him she mumbled she grabbed hold of her collar and shook it that reached him he sat up with a jolt again she motioned that he must clean his cage her panic contagious she drove him to it he worked quickly glancing over his shoulder all the while both at her and the door he expected to see opened any second miraculously he got most of the mess into the bucket at the last possible moment the door rattled as the keeper fumbled with the lock the dogs erupted into barking once again sharon covered her ears the door opened the keeper was dressed in a business suit he was smiling good morning he called out sounding more like captain kangaroo than the madman she took him for elden tegg walked down the narrow cement aisle that separated the two sides of the kennel carefully inspecting the inhabitant of each cage he knew the medical history of each of these animals he had grown to love them each and every one despiteor perhaps because oftheir nasty dispositions time to eat he said pushing the wheelbarrow to each cage the bag of dog food precariously balanced at the end of the run he reached the two newcomers sharon and washington sharon was huddled modestly in the corner looking at him through the muzzle he had cleverly rigged out of nylon strapping her contempt for him never left her eyes although he intended to correct that by harvesting her right cornea come on he said to her encouraging her to show him her incision when she failed to obey he reached for the remote device that controlled her collar threatening to use it use of this device had the same effect as coming in contact with the wireit triggered the collar she sprang into action obediently duckwalking toward him paying careful attention to her iv she clung to modesty by keeping folded up on herself let the doctor see he instructed enjoying the title he could care less about her nudity it was the incisions that held his interest his insistence on leaving the two of them naked had no basis in voyeurism a determined person could hang himself with clothing he couldnt afford to lose her that was all he waved the remote again and she turned herself for him the skin around her bandage was slightly pink but not bad he motioned her back into the far end of the cage and let himself inside the shock collars remote wand constantly in hand constantly a threat he changed her dressing removed the muzzle took her temperatureninetynine and change nothing to worry aboutand replaced her iv of ringers solution with a fresh one supercharged with valium a dash of demerol and a higher dosage of antibiotics he gave her new gauze for her gag returned the muzzle and handed her a bucket of a quaternarybased disinfectant they used at the clinic he stood by and watched her as she scrubbed the pens floor he directed her to a few missed spots and then took the bucket back convinced of the pens cleanliness locking her inside he told her cleanliness is next to godliness he turned and faced washington welcome he said youre insane washington whispered tegg went rigid his first temptation was to shock him but he resisted he had never felt clearer sticks and stones he answered she needs medical attention tegg shot back dismissively what do you think i just gave her sharon grunted at her companion waving him off asking him to stop tegg added perhaps you need some medical attention perhaps you do washington protested tegg understood that such charges if left unanswered gained validity in some perverse way by simply having been spoken he picked up the wand for this mans collar and reminded him with a short little zap washington responded with a spasm of pain you are out of your element i would watch my accusations if i were you washington backed into the corner dont do t is tegg objected do what you dont even know what this is about this is about basic needs this is about life and death thats fairly simple isnt it he clearly wasnt getting through tegg paced the center aisle he couldnt describe his present feeling the air seemed to be vibrating his thoughts preciseas in the middle of an operation he felt righteous and angrywhy was he forced to defend such obvious logic he checked his watch eighttwenty from the top of the hill closer to town the cellular would operate he could call pamela she could reschedule some of the morning appointments and be out here in a little over forty minutes why waste a specimen like this he thought pausing by washingtons cage make the most with what youve got some lessons he told the young man are better learned firsthand he returned the shock collars remote device to its hook on the cage clearly confusing his captives remember our little skirmish yesterday i certainly wont allow that to happen again it wasnt a confusing situation to elden tegg with a strong specimen such as washington the dart gun was clearly the only way to go this is my son miles hello miles dr crystal light horse a transplant surgeon on the university of washingtonsthe udubsmedical staff whom dixie knew through his lecture series wore an oversized lab coat and a laminated name plate that included the hospitals insignia she seemed young for a practicing surgeon midthirties she was a native american with laughing eyes barnwood brown she pursed her lips whenever boldt spoke her attention focused on him as if she were looking down a gun sight boldt wondered at all the social obstacles she had overcome to get here he said we tried miles in day care for about three days but we noticed this look in his eyes he explained do you have kids it two then you know what i mean no you see that look boldt asked pointing at his son that sparkle well thats him you know and after day care he waved a hand in front of his own face like a magician and acted out the transformation gone just this glazed look like no one was home she bristled both my children went through day care and i never noticed any such thing as a surgeon boldt asked have you ever had to remove a persons foot from his mouth that won a smile thankfully no she added its a good thing youre a policeman it looks as if you have a kleptomaniac on your hands miles had stolen a fountain pen off her deskexpensive by the look of it boldt wrestled it free and returned it miles promptly grabbed it again his father stole it back and fed him a bic her office was buried in books and papers he worried that she might be one of those morediplomasthanyoucancount typea educators quick to lecture short on substance he explained i need to throw a hypothetical situation at you im involved in an investigation that is really more your field than mine and im at a loss for specific leads to follow a scent exactly ill do what i can lets suppose youre a transplant surgeon which you arewho for one reason or another finds herself in need of a great deal of money youre broke he nodded youre broke and you hear that overseas or maybe right here in this country this city people are willing to pay big money for certain organs theres no evidence that in this country he raised a hand interrupting he didnt want her getting ahead of him now as i understand it in transplanting something like a kidney you would want the donor to be blood type o not accurate you would prefer the donor organ to match the recipients blood group exactly but to sell he inquired she bristled again type o might indeed make it easier to sell she agreed type o is the largest most common blood group and type o organs have the lowest rate of rejection in transplants into any other blood group he suggested so if you put yourself in the roll of the harvester the procuring surgeon she corrected we dont like the word harvester nor do i he completed how would you as the procuring surgeon locate a potential donor with blood type o the procuring surgeon is looking for cadavers i suppose the first resources i would draw upon would be the hospital morgue the medical examiners office and any of a number of mortuaries boldt took notes miles took his pacifier out and threw it across the desk at dr light horse who scooped it up brushed it off and offered it back to him miles liked that he accepted it gladly and sucked noisily boldt asked and if those resources werent available to you or were exhausted for one reason or another what then she offered him a cold and puzzled look youre not suggesting what am i suggesting someone living its possible isnt it ive read about egypt india but those people are desperate for money there are people desperate for money in this country as wellin this city as well but its different there she protested clearly upset in terms of professional health services its true that some third world countries have limited resources limited access to technologies such as dialysis the reason for the high prices for the whole transplant mess in these parts of the world is that without those transplants people die its different here much different he admired her vehemence she was morally and ethically undone by what he was suggesting which means that your market is overseas if im reading you right now youre scaring me good he wanted her scared because he felt scared for sharon shaffer for whoever else was scheduled next for the knife here in seattle you cant quote me on that he said she thought long and hard blood type depends what kind of resources you have i suppose you would need computer access of course but what comes immediately to mind are hospital records the red cross the insurance companies any of those databases would be likely to list blood type a plasma bank he asked just exactly how far along in this investigation are you he handed her several autopsy photos of two of the incisions dixie suggested you have a look at these she studied them thoughtfully anything special he asked she continued to look them over perfectly competent closures although the incisions are a little large as boldt wrote this down one of his notes caught his eye what kind of team does he need how many assistants it depends on which organ were talking about and which procedure kidneys he said harvesting kidneys for a kidney procurement its helpful to have an assistant but again im thinking in terms of cadavers she corrected herself a live procurement an anesthesiologist a surgeon a nurse or two could it be done with less she nodded a surgeon and an assistant at the bare minimum she added youd be busy miles was getting restless boldt contained him but lost his train of thought have you thought about where this would be done she asked a location then in a professorial tone of voice i see problems with this premise of yours first when a procurement is done in a hospital the organ becomes part of the system theres an airtight system in place there has to be because of the publics wariness about the whole transplant process its called unosthe united network of organ sharing the procuring institution assigns the organ a unos number the recipient of that organ is assigned that same number it all has to match there is a paper trail a mile long the moment an organ leaves a bodyhearts kidneys livers marrow it doesnt matter the procuring surgeon lists an organs destination as part of that paperwork the name of the hospital or organ bank the paperwork follows that organ everywhere the organ is transported in specially sealed and labeled ice chests its all computerized unos does an incredible job i just dont see how someone could get away with what youre implying and if the procedure was not done at a hospital could i get an organ into the system thats just my point you cant without a unos number no surgeon is going to touch an organ without the proper paperwork at the end of every year unos follows up on every single organ procured or transplanted numbers have to match if your numbers dont match you come up for reviewyoure in deep trouble and if its not done in a hospital she thought about this for a long minute she nodded and nibbled at her fingernail eyes on her desk boldt looked out the window at the weather he felt tigbtthroated and hot it was growing dark out there more rain she didnt say anything you look puzzled frightened was more like it he thought the thing of it is she said its possible youre right about the third world market if im the procuring surgeon i dont want to mess with unosthey would catch something like this i dont want to get anywhere near the system im telling you the safeguards in this country are just too established but overseas a kidney is good for sixty hours these days thats plenty of time to reach any foreign destination and the moneythe money would be phenomenal i should think you hear about prices like fifteen and twentythousand dollars a kidney cash no taxes no questions a couple of those a month and youre doing just fine excitement stole into boldt so that his writing was illegible he slowed and took down the same notes a second time miles snatched his pen and threw it to the floor with the boy in the harness boldt couldnt lean down to reach it dr light horse handed him a replacement she seemed to be waiting for him to say something he checked his notes once again so he does the harvesting outside a hospital absolutely this makes much more sense but there would be a high risk of infection hospitals invest hundreds of thousandsmillionsof dollars on their surgical suites filtered air double doors regular cleaning you cant duplicate that on your own unless you have more money than god her fear fed his excitement these were leads to follow ideas to pursue the more they talked the more he saw an investigation developing he now saw the investigation dividing into several areas connie chi the bloodlines employee these technical leads and the bones that dixie suggested might have started it all she looked even more frightened when he asked could i lease such equipment the scent you were talking about something to follow yes not my field but i would guess that you could what about transporting the organs how difficult is it technically its not difficult at all you can use anything from tupperware to stainless steel some viospan ice depending on the organ itll keep anywhere from a couple of hours to several days she added ice chests igloo coolers or styrofoamare the most common ways to ship them one of those small picnic coolers unos uses disposable styrofoam coolers with bright red labels sealing the joints if youre going to walk a transplant organ through airport security youre going to want a unos container now there is something you could check on she brightened stolen unos containers or labels airfreight cd organs are usually handcarried by the pilot or another member of the flight crew the legal ones are but a passenger could do the same thing if he or she could get through airport security boldt wanted to grab for the phone he wanted to rush out of here and put a team on it immediately he wanted to reach across the desk and kiss this woman this was the exact information he had hoped for a different angle a different point of view if they couldnt trace the victims to the harvester perhaps they could trace the movement of the organs a courier he said my feeling is that you overrate airport security as long as an object doesnt appear to be a weapon or a bomb theyre not going to stop it youre probably right she picked up the autopsy photos and studied them intently she was getting caught up in this as well thats a large incision for a kidney did i mention that large boldt asked is that significant she had mentioned it he realized hed even made a note of it on the top of the page was the surgical method unique would it provide them with a signature that they could later use to prosecute a suspect he caught himself holding his breath waiting for her she appeared so deeply in thought for such a long time that he wondered if she had forgotten his question she tested her coffee and avoided his eyes in a way that prevented him from interrupting miles was being a real pain in the ass he wouldnt hold still boldt tried to occupy him with a plastic ring but miles wasnt having anything to do with it he wanted some floor space he wanted some moving room she finally said this incision is larger than necessary these closure techniques are antiquated its doubtful that this is the work of a contemporary surgeon a retiree is more likely unless the surgeon simply doesnt care how it comes out but cosmetics are an important part of any surgery keeping the scar small the subcutaneous closure is a continuousinterlocking stitch its an unusual stitch but very strong boldt wrote down in large letters stitching retiree this meant something though he didnt know what more to investigate more to work with impatience stole into hima cops biggest enemy where was sharon shaffer at this moment what had they done to her what did they have planned for her dr light horse glanced at her watch and boldt took his cue he packed up miles put his notebook away as she walked them to the elevator he stopped and said let me ask you this if type o is the best blood type for transplants why would this harvester want someone with type abnegative bloodlines had provided boldt with sharons records that included her blood type the professor had confirmed that the blood found on the chair in her apartment was also abnegative she appeared puzzled is this person soliciting organs he explained we believe hes kidnapped a woman shes blood type abnegative not o her face tightened what is it he asked abnegative is an extremely rare blood group so im told but whats that mean for a transplant she led him over to a string of seats by a coke machine he felt nervous worried about sharon she obviously felt this would require some explanation miles liked the lights of the coke machine he seemed mesmerized she explained the human body is blessed with an immune system to fight disease the technical aspects of transplant surgery were pretty much worked out twenty years ago havent been improved much since then the main avenue of research has been into convincing the bodys immune system not to destroy the transplanted organ the body will reject any organ to some degree unless it is from an identical twin blood is a tissue a transfusion is the simplest example of a tissue transplant are you with me boldt nodded we all belong to certain blood groups and many of those blood groups are incompatible with one another an organ is made up of both a blood type and several different tissue types making matchingfor the transplant surgeoneven more complex the focus for the last twenty years has been to suppress the bodys immune system far enough to accept a transplanted organ but no so far as to allow infection thats a fine line in the past five years drugs have come a long way in helping to accomplish that one day soon immune suppression may be a thing of the past but for the present in the more critical organsthe heart the liver the pancreasyou need an organ not only the right size but also the best possible tissue match the closer the match the less rejection the less you have to suppress the immune system the less chance of a fatal infection okay we talked about kidneys it is true that type o organs transplant well because o is accepted more easily by the other blood groups the body puts up less of a fight if someone is selling organs as you suggest it makes sense to procure type oits your biggest market not only the largest blood group but a good second choice if you dont have an exact bloodtype match type abnegative is less than four percent of the population in the major organs if you had an abnegative recipient youd want an abnegative donor to have any chance at all a custom job is that what youre saying she cringed at the term its a specific match that is what im saying a special order the elevator opened dr light horse caught it and held it for boldt and his restless passenger she walked him to the front of the building she walked quickly expecting him to keep up as they stopped to shake hands she said the implications of what youre suggesting are horrible of course the medical community as a whole and surgeons in particular are just beginning to address ways of more closely monitoring the donor crisis if more people donated their organs at death we wouldnt be seeing any of this if youre looking for a possible candidate she continued i would start with surgeons reprimanded by the amasomeone suspended and out of work frustrated angry i assume we agree this person is deranged and such thinking could easily distort the hippocratic oath as doctors were sworn to save human life wherever possible he or she reasons that the donor can get by on one kidney that the recipient will die without that replacement organ you have three dead you said three out of a hundred or three out of five that is how he is thinking he may be playing percentages im sorry to say she touched his arm all this is just the long way of saying that it could be anyone disturbed enough to convince himself that what hes doing is not only acceptable but ethically sound he may see himself as an angel of mercy mention of the word angel triggered vivid images from his youth he remembered playing in the snow lying down and fanning his arms and legs so that the impression he left behind resembled that of an angel only now he saw things differently inside that impression lay the bleached white bones of a skeleton he said an angel hardly an angel maker is more like it it gave pamela chase a sense of importance to be summoned at a moments notice out to the farm he needed her perhaps he would make love to her again perhaps his callingher out here had nothing whatsoever to do with work as his phone call had implied a low midmorning smokegray fog hung over the area where the farm sat running from the ground to the tops of the tall trees that rimmed the ridges behind it she spotted the fog only briefly before disappearing into it and this made her wonder whether you ever saw things for what they were while you were inside them a part of them the fog forced her to drive more slowly and it gave her a few minutes to think seemed like all she did was thinkthats how a person all alone spends her time she thought trapped inside your thoughts and dreams as this car was trapped inside the fog moving slowly crawling waiting for the phone to ring waiting for the workday to start waiting always thinking ahead never really being where you are but somewhere you hope to be strange way to live your life she parked alongside his trooper and watched the mud as she climbed out because she had been on her way to work when the phone had rung and wasnt very well prepared for the conditions out here she loved the manthat was her problem he knew it too which put her at a disadvantage because there was little she wouldnt do for him and he made the most of it with sex now part of their relationship she wondered where it might lead next either it would turn magical or sourno telling which if those tics of his were any indication then it was going sour she wasnt sure where they had come from but it gave her an incredibly creepy feeling each time one happened and they were getting worse no doubt about that she trudged around to the basement door and knocked it was colder in the fog she was shivering by the time he answered he locked the door securely behind her and started giving orders before he even said hello run the blood tests will you then scrub up and prep him please right kidney and spleen both he stopped turned and looked her in the eye are you questioning me it was just a flicker just something passing across his eyes like a reflection on a pair of mirrored sunglasses but it ran her blood cold there was an implied threat behind this question of his there was someone else someone she didnt knowbehind his eyes just a flicker then gone like the tics when they had first started right kidney and spleen she repeated obediently good he said turning his back on her he had one of those tics then his head snapped violently toward his lifting shoulder remained pinched there intractable and finally relaxed she wanted to offer her hands to himto rub the knots out of his back she knew the pain of these tics because she had witnessed his face recently all the muscles twitching and distorting like some kind of halloween mask it just had to hurt a short backrub was just the thing for him but she didnt offer it they didnt talk about the tics they both pretended they never happened at all she had to think was that the way their moment of intimacy was to be as well as if it had never happened at all it had happened right here in this room and now she was to go parading about her work as pam the helper pam the lover was apparently lost in the shadows burned to a crisp along with all the other contaminated waste he was starting to give her the creeps the way he was so silent over there the donor was a black male between twentyfive and thirty he was naked face up eyes open from the ketamine which paralyzed him but didnt actually render him unconscious she was used to those eyes now but at first they had really terrified her elden used ketamine on all the donors despite the dangers because of its effect on memory on some he followed this up with electroshock she didnt approve but she understood that was how she felt about much of this eldens strength his power of conviction left little room for argument she noticed this mans upper arm then and like so often in her life words came babbling out before she could control them my god elden what happened to his arm his arm did donnie do this to his arm donnie its a mess lacerated bruised it might even be broken by the look of it yes i noticed that perhaps we can help but not now hmm right kidney and spleen pamela are you ready for me or not the image of him framed against the silvery plastic wall was something surreal something not of this world it seemed fitting somehow for a man of such talents she collected herself and asked do you want me to dress it prep him he instructed he never did pay much attention to what she said he was in a mood today more and more so in the last few days you couldnt reach him when he was in a mood so she gave up trying she drew several samples of blood labeled them started the hiv test on one of them the hepatitis a and b test on another and placed the third in the waisthigh fridge there were a number of drugs missing from the door of the fridge she was about to mention this when she caught herself antibiotics mostly some demerol and valium too the thought briefly crossed her mind that perhaps elden was experimenting with the drugs himself perhaps this helped to explain his recent erratic behavior but not demerol and valium she corrected herself if anything he seemed wound up and agitated of late more like on an amphetamine high donnie had probably stolen them he was always sneaking drugs elden knew it just as she did they both did their best to police their supplies but elden never called donnie on it unless he caught him in the act and then he barely slapped his hand a strange relationship existed between those two that she would never understand why elden would tolerate a man like that was beyond her she soaped and shaved the black mans side elden helped her to roll him over and she continued the procedure on his back i made all the necessary arrangements he said that is maybeck did he corrected her youll be back by this evening ive written it all down he hurried over to the work area and returned with a note written in his own handwriting not donnies donnie could barely write at all elden never made the flight arrangements youll meet juanita at the gate the regular flight to rio same as always all right she said accepting the itinerary from him but it felt wrong everything about this felt wrong was it just her she wonderedexpectations carried over from their encounter saturday night now then he said from over by the sink he doused his hands in antiseptic and then snapped on a pair of surgical gloves he turned his back to her to have her tie his mask in place which she did all set im worried about you she said softly to his back she placed her hand gently on his shoulder it was something she could never say while facing him there was a long heavy silence in which she could hear the deep breathing of the man on the table behind her she heard the plastic ceiling crinkle as it warmed neither she nor elden was breathing what she had said had stopped them both finally his head bobbed slightly he took a deep breath filling his lungs completely and said in a ghostly whisper its him id worry about the way he said it frightened her elden his voice returned he reminded her the patient always comes first l l they rose above the city climbing an onramp at the end of columbia that connected to the viaduct then headed south toward the docks and boeing field you could see the next wave of rain out over the water hanging above the stunning green of bainbridge islanda mares tail stretching down a light gray mist feathered beneath charcoal clouds if you didnt mind rain it was a beautiful sight if you minded rain you didnt live here in february and march boldt turned on the wipers to fend off the spray from a van ahead of them daphne crossed her legs and leaned over to check the speedometer i dont like driving fast boldt explained thats an understatement she said at first i thought there was something wrong with this thing she had asked to come along with him at the last second boldt had warned her it might be a long meeting but she had persisted hed been wondering when she would tell him whatever it was that couldnt wait finally his patience ran out so whats up i hate being wrong she complained it doesnt come easy you wrong i had that talk with cindy chapman i wanted to run agnes rutherfords descriptions of the two men by herthe grating voice the bad breath there are tricks you can play with the mind subtle ways to make it safe for a person to remember something they would rather not remember boldt asked where the hell is the toxicology report on chapman the blood workup are you interested in this or not go ahead she remembers sharon and me tending to her at the shelter shes very clear on that i worked with her on the events before the surgery could she remember being abducted could she remember faces voices surroundings a week before a day before an hour before as it turned out you were right about the money she added thats what i mean about my being wrong i was convinced you were wrong about that his hands were sweating against the wheel he rolled down the window for some air they paid her for the kidney he asked it was a business arrangement they offered her five hundred dollars five hundred he asked incredulously i thought the going rate is fifteen thousand thats quite a markup and theres no proof she ever received it well it fills in a few blanks he admitted it helps to explain why we never received any formal complaints against the harvester if youre a teenager and youve cut a deal to sell your kidney you dont turn the guy in it also means there wereareprobably a lot more donors than we know about the lucky ones lived to spend their five hundred it may also explain the use of the electroshock i dont think so she interrupted not the electroshock dixons three victimsblumenthal sherman and the other one julia walker showed no sign of electroshock if a few days had passed that might be more easily explained but in at least two of the casesthe deaths caused by hemorrhagingthose bodies would have been seen by the medical examiner rather quickly wouldnt they and that would indicate that those victims did not show signs of electroshock you have something going he said i can hear it in your voice what if only the dissenters receive the electroshock the real serious memory blocking what if youre right about there being a lot of others a runaway hard up for money cuts a deal arrangements are made the surgery takes place theyre paid up and returned to the streets what if a person like cindy chapman gets cold feet once she looks around her and sees the reality of what shes gotten herself into if youre the harvester what then you take the kidney anywayyouve probably already promised it somewherebut you make damn sure your donor wont remember anything about it she let the idea hang there you dont like it she said it makes sense he admitted it doesnt mean i have to like it so okay lets say im right then why did they take sharon she asked except for her past except for her bloodlines connection she doesnt fit the donor profile at all shes not broke shes not out on the street shes not desperate at this point shes even a few years older than the rest of them he didnt want to tell her about dr light horses theory that sharon might have been taken for a custom procurement if they were after a major organ then sharon was most likely already dead and what have they done with her she added boldt was spared giving an answer he turned into the driveway of the army corps of engineers and searched out a parking space the seattle district office of the us army corps of engineers occupied an enormous brick structure a few miles south of the city on marginal way boldt was hoping that as dixie had suggested these bones might offer them a chance to identify the harvester locating the rest of the bones was the first and most important step in that process the homicide victim was the last living witness to the crime and could tell an investigator much more than the murderer believed possible the receptionist greeted boldt and daphne warmly and made a quick phone call announcing their arrival a few minutes later a wiry man in his midforties bounded down the stairs and extended his hand introducing himself as harry terkel he had bright enthusiastic eyes and a lot less hair than boldt he wore khakis black reeboks and a plaid shirt without a tie he lacked the nerd pack of pens in his pocket that boldt had expected of an engineer he shook hands with daphne and motioned upstairs ill lead the way its kind of a maze at the top of the stairs they turned right down a corridor past scores of office cubicles they walked and walked and walked finally reaching terkels enclosed office where they took seats around a conference table there was a wipeit bulletin board at the far end of the room covered with math equations written in blue marker terkel sat across from boldt rather than taking a place behind his desk boldt appreciated the gesture he said joe tried to explain this to me maybe i had better hear it from you boldt explained six months ago a hunter recovered some human remains in the tolt river we have been unable to locate the sourcethe burial sitedespite some exhaustive foot searches the rest of those remains are important to our investigation to our possibly identifying the victim and therefore the killer the man i spoke with offered to set up your computers to help predict where the bones might have dislodged from the bank joe webster thats right he added theres a book on this that might interest you terkel said fluvial processes in geomorphology river movement river meandering and material deposits sediment actually cements togetherif you willand moves downstream as a whole our job is the quantitative determination of water flow tracking flows predicting the sedimentation process erosion deposition boldt was wondering what language this was fluvial processes in geomorphology nice bedtime reading terkel recited like a student material eroded from one bank will deposit on the same bank one to two bars downstream thats two to four bends he informed boldt and thats a fact thats something we can bank on pun intended thats where the hec computer can help us terkel saw boldts puzzled face hecthe hydraulic engineering centerruns the modeling computers maybe we should talk to them boldt suggested a few minutes later boldt and daphne were sitting alongside a japanese woman becky sumatara staring at a color screen that offered a menu of choices joe webster a stocky man in his late forties towered behind them becky sumatara said when we received your request we updated our tolt model for current flow notes slope sediment size distribution and areas of erosion based on our present data thats what took us a couple of days the updating is a lengthy process boldt apologized when it comes to computers im a technopeasant the screen changed to a graphics aerial view of a map of king county bodies of water in all shapes and sizes are represented by various shades of blue becky sumatara explained her red fingernail pointing out the sound reservoirs and rivers depending on volume the darker the shade the more volume elliott bay and puget sound are a deep navy while some of the smaller creeks are almost white youre interested in the north fork of the tolt yes joe webster answered for boldt she dragged a blinking box to the area in question bordering the box on carnation monroe sultan skykomish and big snow mountain with two clicks of the mouse the screen filled with an enlargement of this area during enlargement color reference is modified youll see the tolt is now navy and its various tributaries are lighter according to volume also she said with another click as the river streams and creeks turned various shades of red and pink we can view according to rate of flowhow fast the various volumes of water are traveling both q v in terms of quantity andthe water all turned as regards land speed all factors shades of green in erosion and flood control with the enlargement a dozen smaller creeks had appeared daphne withdrew the topographic map from boldts briefcase the exact locations where the bones had been discovered were marked ji becky sumatara studied the map with daphne and then narrowed the computers target area yet again creating a corresponding enlargement youre up into snoqualmie national forest there she said stepping the computer through maneuvers rugged country yes what does this tell us he asked we have two views of each stream flow she explained aerial and lateral this gives us a visualization of lateral erosion as well as a cutaway of stream bed depth using the computer i can increase or decrease volume and rate of flow as well as access any date in the past for visualization unfortunately weve set this up only for the tolts stream bed profile not the tributaries the tolts our baby joe webster said we have gravel moving one to two bars downstream wed like a look at those upper bars thats all the highwater mark for the tolt reservoir should give us a fairly reliable benchmark for checking downstream erosion she put the computer to work boldt felt some of the tension leave him finally they were into it on the left of the screen she changed a date at the top of a table of numbers the screen paused before redrawing im going to ask the computer to compare this projection with one a month prior it will colorcode areas of the most severe erosion red to black red being areas of greatest damage as she described all this various images appeared and vanished an arrow raced back and forth across the screen under her direction you must keep in mind that this is all speculation without field reports we cant be sure of any of this a fallen tree a landslide and we would have to start all over this modeling is only as accurate as the data its fed the data is good joe webster said defensively boldt looked on as becky sumatara pinpointed some river bends that were bright red the computer takes soil composition into consideration she explained which is one of the reasons its of value to us in a situation like this you or i could look at a map and circle the tightest switchbacks a river makes but erosion is dependent on composition and its not uncommon for a stream to jump its banks on a straightaway where the soil is soft and relatively uniform stream beds generally make turns because the water encounters some form of natural obstacle whether a rise in elevation or a rock formation a barrier you could run your search party from turn to turn and never find this grave my guess is that with flows like this were going to see a stream bubbleout well away from the turns although joe may be right about the upstream bars id like to see those upstream bars if we could id like to start there joe said one thing to keep in mind boldt advised is road access our experience tells us that she would have been buried within a hundred yards of existing roads thats a grisly thought daphne fiddled with the ungainly topographic map there are logging roads in this area even some old homesteads joe webster said there were hiking trails until they closed them down i remember all that a few years back daphne indicated the logging trails one eye straying to the screen anxiously this will help sumatara said referencing the map and comparing it to the screen she made several small adjustments the screen redrew itself each time boldt caught himself holding his breath again as if from a descending birdseyeview the screen showed an increasingly magnified area with each new redraw she pointed convincingly to the screen here are the two upstream bars youre after joe the upper curve of the river was a deep blue the cutaway of the stream bank showed as a brightalmost neonred clashing with her nail polish its severely undercut to boldt she said thats why the search teams missed it she became distracted then as the screen seemed to call to her again she worked the mouse again the screen redrew several times youre lucky hows that these most recent rains havent yet caused the tolt to reach the highwater level marked last fall which means there hasnt been any additional undercutting now her fingers flew through a volley of commands boldt looked over to see both daphne and joe webster glued to the screen uhoh she added punching keys furiously becky boldt asked sensing from her sudden silence that they had problems you had better get someone out there quick she said pointing once again to the screen the projected flow for the tolt will pass that mark in less than fortyeight hours daphne asked would you mark the area for us please but becky didnt seem to hear still consumed with working the computer and theres something else she said the screen changing colors once again youre wrong about the depth about the grave being shallow she switched to a lateral view that depicted an overhang of brown earth and the animated blue of the river water well below it according to this the undercut is at least six feet below gradebelow the surface those bones were buried deep he knows what hes doing mumbled boldt it is a doctor daphne let slip a look of horror on her face a doctor coughed becky sumatara you never heard that instructed boldt he looked sumatara in the eye then joe webster in fact if its all the same to you for the time being you never heard word one of this we cant afford any rumors any leaks joe webster nodded suddenly a shade paler sumatara didnt seem to hear theres a doctor killing people gasped the woman staring back into the glowing screen with its pulsing colors the red no longer appeared neon to boldt it seemed the color of blood sharon shaffer had a hard time thinking through the drugs it was like trying to write with her left handshe knew the letters that were supposed to appear on the page but they never came out looking right a car had arrived about an hour ago it had left about forty minutes later forty minutes by her way of thinking the man was in the kennel pen next to her he had two fresh bandages seeing this she felt sick to her stomach the keeper was a butcher she didnt remember her neighbor having been returned although there he was and the collapsible wheelchair the keeper used to move them was folded up and leaning against the wall she must have fallen asleep again she kept nodding out this way which was one of the reasons it was so difficult to measure any passage of time she glanced to her right and literally jumped when she saw the keeper in the pen next to hers he had hold of her iv tube and was injecting a drug into the tube using a syringe separating the two of them was only the smallest amount of chainlink wire wire that would bite back if she so much as brushed against it the intense look on the keepers face terrified her felix the biggest dog of the group the alpha male wandered freely in the center aisle pacing panting hungry and anxious he was the sentry the jail guard he was there to prevent any chance of another intruder any chance of escape the keeper said softly to her ive canceled my morning appointments but im in a bit of a hurry with the muzzle she had no chance to respond she was thinking morning appointments when you awaken your right eye will hurt it will be carefully bandaged under no circumstances are you to toy with this bandage do you hear me do you understand nod if you understand good now youre crying why are you crying do i scare you she nodded though somewhat reluctantly me you neednt be scared stop that crying im a doctor she couldnt the more he said the more terrified she was please he said childishly she wrestled with her emotions and brought herself under control she was shaking now the crying turned inside she wanted to see him as insane but she couldnt he seemed so professional in everything he did so calculating it made the chance of escape seem all the more distant you will cause yourself an enormous amount of pain if you cry later hmm the saline in the tears you understand you must not allow yourself to cry you must apply no pressure to this bandage none whatsoever so be careful how you place your head when you sleep he waited a moment and asked are you listening she managed to nod her head yes because of youbecause of your corneasome poor soul will be able to see again hmm you will be giving someone the gift of sight can you imagine such a thing a miracle is what it is and without you none of it would be possible hmm how does that make you feel like escaping she thought now more than ever escape was all she could think of the drugs he injected brought a hazy fuzz to her eyes would she ever see again would she awaken she glanced one last time into the eyes of the keeper perhaps she thought blindness wouldnt be so bad after all boldt had a dozen thoughts crowding his head while staring at his phone following a morning with his father miles had been dropped off with their neighbor emma who was becoming something of a nanny to the boy the phone wasnt exactly his just as the coffee room wasnt exactly his office but until they assigned him a cubicle he used both as if they were his own people now knocked before entering the coffee room in practice boldt had a bigger office than shoswitz z he was sitting in a fiberglass chair under a cloud of cigarette smoke left by a former visitor someone had stolen todays date off the gary larson dayataglance calendar so boldt had to keep checking his watch to remember the date the trash can was filled to overflowing because to save money the offices were being cleaned only every other day and saturdays unable to reach dixie earlier by phone boldt had resorted to the newly installed electronic mailasking a younger more computerliterate uniform for help he dictated a memo detailing his discoveries at both the army corps of engineers and the details of his interview with dr light horse at the university and suggested that dixon follow up on some of light horses recommendations which included examination and study of the surgical techniques used to close cindy chapmans incision with the push of a button his memosupposedlyflew across town bleating like a lamb on some secretarys screen sarge john lamoia called from across the room a phone cradled between neck and chin he waved some papers at boldt lamoia who was heading up the surveillance of connie chi the bloodlines employee was in an office rotation while other detectives watched their suspect he was tall with brown curly hair and wore pressed jeans he was a cocky vibrant womanizer everyone on the force liked him male female uniform or suit the ama printouts lamoia said boldt crossed the room quickly his own expectations increasing with every step it was possiblein fact more than likelythat the name of the harvester was somewhere on this printout he took it from lamoia he scanned it quickly and scanned page after page his heart sank la moia had anticipated his reaction he hung up and explained six hundred seventyfive surgeons discouraging to say the least last page he instructed boldt flipped forward by category its a little better any of them could probably train to do those harveststhats what im toldbut if this guy is sticking with his specialty then weve got thirtyone in thoracic ten in urological in general surgery we have he honed in to read sixtyeight thirtyfour at the udub i wrote a total there one fortythree the job before them was overwhelming though not impossiblegiven a huge task force which shoswitz seemed unlikely to grant them a careful interview would have to be conducted with each quiet inquiries about bank accounts and surgeon credit limits and life styles of schedules phone calls and travel itineraries through this they were to attempt to narrow this enormous list down to the one harvesterall without making him the wiser reading his thoughts lamoia who had reached the office and was still reading over his shoulder suggested are you thinking about bringing them in here one by one thinking about it but not very seriously one doctors can make the kind of noise that finds the ears of the top brass two word would spread too quickly the harvester would shut down shop and that would be the end of any incriminating evidence one of the difficulties here dont forget is that the law is hazy about all of this if were going to bust this guy were going to have to practically catch him in the act we give him a week to clean guaranteed if were right up his act and hell skate about this this guy has been in business at least three years which means hes extremely well organized and knows what hes doing who knows how many harvests hes done he hears that were coming after him and hell clean up so well that well never find so much as a needle out of place we need the operating shears that connect blumenthal to those bones that would be some decent proof so what are you suggesting lamoia asked lamoia could piss him off when he got like this the coffee room phone rang it could have been any number of things besides interviewing cindy chapman and sharon shaffers elderly roommate daphne was working with her contacts at the fbis behavioral science unit to come up with a possible psychological profile of the harvester bernie lofgrin owed boldt more complete lab reports on both chapman and shaffer it might even have been dr light horse at the university or ms dundee at bloodlines both of whom had agreed to call if anything else pertaining to boldts case occurred to them but above and beyond all of these boldt hoped it might be someoneanyonecalling to tell him that sharon shaffer was safe and sound or that some doctor had just turned himself in the call was from the surveillance team assigned to connie chi twice the cellular phone from which the call was being placed went dead and twice boldt waited impatiently for the return call the first news he heard after the team identified itself was we got a problem here the second time the voice asked how much of that did you get boldt could tell by the ambient sound that the car was moving you rolling he asked again the line went dead before he received an answer the third time he answered the phone remained in the clear although he found himself rushing sentences in anticipation of another failure everything were seeing here indicates she wants to lose us the man said referring to connie chi the bloodlines employee she made you boldt asked thats just the thing i dont think so but shes sure as hell acting like she did we called in danny and butch theyre in the jeep weve been trading her off i gotta think she thinks shes lost us way shes acting makes me think someone told her what to do know what i mean all jitterylike constantly checking her mirror and shit like that an amateur it got a little hairy when she tried to ditch us in nordstroms but i gotta tell you this gal is no criminal or if she is shes the kind every cop loves cause shes so damn nervous that she sticks out like a sore thumb i gotta hand it to ya sarge you now how to pick em keep me posted im on my way as he steered through traffic in an attempt to intercept the surveillance teams boldt heard over his radio ive got her butch the voices surfaced only occasionally rising from a sea of electronic hiss okay good were falling off her keep us posted mobile surveillance presented its own special logistical nightmares to be effective it required an enormous number of vehicles a central dispatcher coordinating them and a lot of luck juggling the same two or three cars for an extended period usually failed you either lost or were spotted by the mark boldt wondered what the hell was keeping lamoia when all of a sudden the mans voice crackled over the airwaves lamoia was like that just when you were about to lose faith in him he came through he seemed to constantly push everyone everything right to the limit with him rolling they were up to four cars they had a fighting chance shes turning right on th announced detective john c adams or jc as everyone called him what the hell is she driving lamoia asked a red saturn came the reply but she aint driving it some other woman is lamoia asked for the license number and was given it ive got them he announced turning again th now headed north on greenwood go ahead and pass them boldt ran two stop signs and a light and pulled to within a few lengths of lamoia im with you john if you need me roger whos the saturn registered to boldt said one sulin chi lamoia announced same last name someone said for the sake of the radio boldt announced we call the passenger connie and the driver the sister affirmative came the various voices what about connies car back at nordstroms boldt asked did it occur to any of you goons to have it watched the resulting silence disturbed him this could have been some sort of drop you know did it occur to any of you that maybe someone wanted us to follow her to lead us away from the drop jc offered weve always got a couple of patrol cars hanging around the mall you want me to put dispatch on it well take care of it from here came the voice of phil shoswitz over the radio he had been monitoring the exchanges it caught boldtand the otherscompletely by surprise it was extremely rare for this particular lieutenant to listenin with the dispatcher he didnt like field work the red saturn signaled and changed lanes ive got it john boldt said lamoia pulled past leaving the saturn and boldt to turn off theyre slowing boldt announced he added maybe its only a gas stop im going to pull past his adrenaline rush was immediately replaced by disappointment as he saw the car turn right into a gas station im pulling up short said jc boldt drove around the block and parked with a good view of the station lamoia coordinated his and the remaining cara blue jeep containing butch butler and danny wuto cover either of two cross streets as boldt looked on he sensed that the driver of the saturn was stalling he announced this over the radio the young chinese woman filled up the small cars tank impossibly slowly and only after it was filled while looking around anxiously and consulting connie chi in the passenger seat there was also a kid of about eighteen across the street who was looking on from over by a dumpster boldt assigned butch butler to keep an eye on him so his own attention wouldnt be distracted a selfservice gas station was an easy place to steal a cartoo often drivers neglected to take the keys with them or perhaps the kid was a runnersomeone paid to make an exchange with connie chi whatever his purpose or intentions the kid was a variable that boldt didnt particularly like from down the street a dark blue slightly beat up van approached at a pace uncharacteristically cautious for seattle drivers boldt sat up in his seat one hand grasping the radios mike the driver was nothing but a dark shape behind the silver impulse of the skys reflection on the windshield boldt punched the button on the mike and said quickly butch danny incoming right behind you he watched from a distance as the two detectives turned rubbery and slipped down in their seats so that as the van passed the jeep would appear empty slipping lower in his own seat boldt said i think we may have something here butch you watch the kid lamoia run the vans plates jc if they break quickly you take the saturn with lamoia danny butch and i will take the van donnie maybeck drove past the gas station once to make sure the sisters red car was parked there as it was supposed to be when he confirmed this he drove fully around the block looking for guys eating donuts in the front seat of their car cops seeing none he pulled in and parked next to an unleaded selfservice pump he climbed out and went through the process of filling up in this way he was able to carry on a conversation without ever looking at her all of it had been the docs idea fucking genius on cue connies sister left for the bathroom tell me about the cops he said to connie what is it now when the shit hits the fan he thought it really spreads around fast they asked about a woman named sharon shaffer shes the abnegative i gave you last week involuntarily he squeezed the pump so hard that gas bubbled out before the nozzle shut off and vernas been asking me about my computer time whats going on donnie i dont even know what it is you do with that database some extra money thats all thats what you said i got a feeling i dont want to know she paused then contradicted herself what do you do with it he tried to keep calm when he got uptight he tended to do stupid things same thing all his life his big temptation right now was to lose herto turn the hose on her light a match and watch her fry he had stolen some plates and bolted them on before coming herehe wasnt that stupid he could lose the van if he had to torch it as well burn baby burn if he had ever had a tattoo thats what it would have said nothing he liked quite so much as seeing something burn except of course the sight of money cash or ass he liked that a lot too squeeze goes the handle poof goes the match zoom goes connie her hair would go first then her clothes if she was wearing syntheticsanything stretchy or elasticthey would stick to her skin shed be staring at him screaming bald from the flames eyes beginning to swell in their sockets you dont have to worry about that he said answering her question im scared she replied fifty grand fifty a fucking fortune a harley a trip somewhere who knows what i want you to do he started trying to think like the doc but losing his train of thought to anger his temper was the problem it had always been the problem it ran away from him as a kid on the streetshed been alone on the streets since he was thirteenhe had learned how to play tough tough combined with a bad temper meant violence at fifteen hed killed his first persona junkie looking to roll him he got pissed off and cut the guy with a bottle and then left him to bleed to death at seventeen he killed a prostituteafter the act which had been his first because he didnt have the money to pay her that had been spokane he left because her pimp was out to zoom him in seattle hed been arrested for purse snatching he served six months in a jd reform and the offense was kept off his record he was eighteen when he got out and the state arranged vocational training that eventually led to a job with norwest power and light for nearly two months his life had been real and then that day doing shit work on the top of a newly installed highvoltage towerhe saw the doc digging a grave the secret a chance at some real money things had been different since then can you take sharon shaffers name out of that database what about the police i asked you a question this was how the doc dealt with him and it felt good to pass it on it felt real good can you erase a file erase a file for good he pulled the hose from his tank and replaced it in the pump still wondering if it wouldnt be smarter to hose her down erase a record from data processing you mean i dont know if i can i suppose it must be possible but ive never tried i want you to try the shaffer file its important you understand he gave her a look then charles bronson on a particularly bad day maybe brando how would the big man handle this one she hesitated it pissed him off her sister was hovering around the candy counter looking impatient he decided to pay up he opened the vans door and took the keys he left the door open because she answered just then ill try damn right you will he gave her one last look and walked away looking tough i am tough he convinced himself when he reached the station he looked away as her sister passed because he didnt want her getting a good look at him you had to keep your options open he had to climb a small platform to pay at the cash register the gas cost him over twenty bucks that pissed him off as well when he turned around his added elevation gave him a view of two guys sitting real low in a jeep parked down the street cops connie had fucked up she had led them here or was she in on it the panic hit him as hard as if hed been slugged in the gut out of the corner of his eye he caught some quick movement some punk kid was headed for his van at a sprint e reached it leaned in and came out with donle s laptop computer the fucking laptop the doc had warned him to never let it out of his sight the database the kid took off at a run donnie shouted after him he chased after him one eye on those cops if the cops got hold of that laptop it was all over the doc would see to that trouble jc adams announced over the radio up until that moment boldts full attention had been on the driver of the van but now in his peripheral vision he caught sight of the juvenile crossing the street to the gas station and a few seconds later leaning into the open door of the van when on the end of that kids arm boldt saw a laptop computer he sat up so quickly he hit his head on the downturned visor the professor had found carpet impressions that suggested that one of the two men who had abducted sharon shaffer had been carrying a laptop computer with connie chis connection to bloodlines and bloodlines connection to sharon shaffer this had to be more than coincidence butch danny you grab the kid hes coming right at you boldt radioed immediately jc youve got the saturn john you take the van driver on footill play backup and listen up i want everybody brought in including that laptop okay go as boldt watched his team spring into action shoswitz came on the radio lou how about a couple of radio cars lieutenant were losing this thing he warned as he saw their bust go south butch and danny sprang out of the jeep weapons drawn and took off after the kid displaying lightningquick reactions the kid veered down a driveway and vanished procedure would have had one of them pursue on foot the other in the jeep but procedure didnt matter now in the heat of the moment they had both run after the kid and the likelihood of catching him seemed slim boldt barked into the radio i need those backups now suspect proceeding on foot northbound between th and th if he gets into the park weve lost him the dread of further failure choked his throat as he saw the red saturn drive quickly out of the gas station with none of his own cars following blocked by a recycling truck jc adams was forced to go around the block boldt punched the button on the radio mike to announce he would switch with adams but released it as he saw lamoia going after the van driver on foot misjudging the situation lamoia elected to take a shortcut cutting behind the nearest house but when the driver of the van saw butch and danny guns drawn he pulled an abrupt aboutface leaving lamoia taking a shortcut to nowhere this in turn made boldt responsible for the van which roared off cutting in behind the slowly moving recycling truck and forcing boldt to follow boldt was no fan of highspeed driving he not only didnt care for it he was no good at it and he knew it at the first intersection he braked for the stop sign slowing considerablyout of habit he should have been calling in his position and situation over the radio but he needed both hands on the wheel he was sweating his scalp itched he should have been all but ignoring stop signs but his right foot kept betraying him and tapping the brakes the van remained in sight but just barely it was suddenly making big speed it ran two lights and negotiated a series of quick turns boldt managed to keep it in sight but at this rate he knew he wouldnt keep up for long on a brief moment of straightaway boldt reached for the radio to call in his position just as he grabbed hold of it a skateboard shot out from between parked cars fast on its heels was a boy of about twelve boldt jerked the wheel sharply to the left and slammed on the brakes the car swerved in a squealing of rubber a pencil skidded across the dash and disappeared down the defrost the driverside sun visor slapped boldt in the forehead and forced him to duck beneath it in order to see the front right tire crushed the skateboard the bumper missed the boy by inches boldt kept his foot on the brakes the van continued on up ahead growing smaller it turned right boldt checked the rearview mirror the boy was okay in his right hand he discovered the radio microphone its coiled wire disconnected and dangling like a stretched springhe had ripped it out of the radio housing he had lost all communication with dispatch he took the same right following the vans route three blocks ahead of him he saw it turn north onto aurora state highway a fourlane road with occasional lights the traffic was typically congested and unpredictable boldt slowed at the next red light but ran it getting the hang of this maybe he would attract the attention of a traffic cruiser he craned across the front seat and located the dashmount flasher he tossed it up onto the dash and threw the switch facing the blue pulsating light forward he forced his place into the left lane and put his foot down by switching lanes repeatedly the van continued to pull away from him boldt was no match for such maneuvers he lost sight of it as it followed a long arching turn to the right he stepped on it a police cruiser approached in the opposing lanes boldt rolled down his window and beat on the side of his car signalinghe hopedfor backup his eyes left his lane for only a second but when he looked back the traffic ahead of him had come to a complete stop he slammed on the brakes the car in an immediate skid the remaining distance shrinking impossibly fast he then pumped the brakes as hed been trained to doa half dozen times in quick little jabs he cut his speed in half the unforgiving back bumper of a pickup truck loomed directly ahead thirty yards to go twenty an adrenaline rush choked him his hands tightened on the wheel miles liz bear berenson saying this here is the lou boldt more brakes still too fast too close mentally these last few seconds slowed perceptibly he could feel the shrinking space between his vehicle and the pickup he could somehow measure it precisely in desperation he hit and held the brakes the back tires cried out the car fishtailed the pickup truckthis entire lane of trafficrolled forward as drivers anticipated a green light this added one vehicle length of roadway between boldt and the pickup he skidded to a stop inches behind the pickup the van was sitting four cars up he grabbed for his weapon weapons were not his way this kind of street cop work was not his work but he saw little choice the driver of that van was connected to sharon shaffers abduction the stopped traffic was nothing more than a red traffic light not a traffic jam as he had first believed in a moment the traffic would begin to roll again in a moment boldt would be doing sixty again chasing him he checked his rearview mirror that patrol car was nowhere to be seen all alone he threw the car into park and approached the van in a squat from the passenger side in order to avoid the chance of being seen in the driver door mirror he hurried between waiting cars his back cramping too old for this shit someone behind him honked pissed off no doubt that he had left his car oh great he thought lets attract as much attention as possible the light changed to green engines revved and traffic began moving again he caught up to the van and arm outstretched took hold of the handle to the side door he yanked now pulled along by the vans progress locked he lunged for the front door next the van moving even faster from behind him the volley of protesting horns continued he took hold of the passenger door handle and jerked upward to open it at that very instant a finger appeared and locked it as well the tie didnt go to the runner boldt stumbled and fell the van pulled away by the time he reached his car and was driving again he couldnt see the van for the trucks the hondas for the hatchbacks he stayed with it a while longer but the van was nowhere to be seen without a radio and without backup boldt resigned himself to failure depression overwhelmed himnot for what was coming from shoswitz he could handle shoswitz but because a woman was missing and boldt was convinced the driver of this van was an accomplice in her abduction it was time to start all over he decided time to do things right time to have a little talk with connie chi tegg had never seen maybeck look this desperate otherwise he might have objected to maybecks barging into his office unannounced maybeck was relegated to the back hallway the walkin the disposal of waste he was overstepping his bounds what is it tegg complained the laptops been stolen maybeck announced tegg felt a sharp pain in the very top of his skull and one of his tics hit him hard he felt his shoulder lift and his head strain to meet it he recovered and said tell me about it donald dont call me that start talking donald this instant maybeck suffered through an explanation trying to make himself into some kind of hero in the way he had avoided the police tegg was beginning to see him in terms of a corpsejust exactly how would he dispose of a person that size the laptop he blamed himself for having ever entrusted such an important matter to maybeck it had all been by design trying to distance himself from incriminating evidence wherever possible but now he had to assess his situation to take control the planned date of the heart harvest was inside that laptopthe entire history of their operation if you knew what to look for first you handle connie she must be dealt with hmm nothing violent im not suggesting that just see that shes out of the way out of town now then we get the computer back he said one thing at a time hmm connies first maybeck replied like a magpie echoing his masters voice immediately no problem i know where to find her i set that up like you told me to youll watch for cops i know this punk as you called him tegg said distastefullyhe had no use for such slangis there some way to identify him maybeck said brutishly i could always report it to the police tegg waved a finger at him dont challenge me donald insolence will get you nowhere with me a bonfire tegg was thinking that size body was just made for a bonfire one fire to burn the flesh a second for the bones maybe even a third for those teeth this is your error we are attempting to correct herelets pay particular attention to responsibility shall we weve discussed this all before all before how strangely seductive the lure of violence could be he wanted to hurt this man i can handle it spare me such indulgence would you dream on your own time tegg felt another tic coming he squashed it with anger interesting how that worked he thoughtperhaps anger always heralded as the enemy was indeed a friend we will go to whatever means necessary to obtain that computer a reward a ransom i dont care what you have to do i can put the word out we offer a reward and well be onto this thing like flies on shit its password protected maybeck reminded thats one thing good about it theres nothing good about this tegg announced he cleaned out his walletone hundred and fifty dollarsand practically threw it at maybeck that kind of thinking is poison do you hear me poison we need that computer back immediately that computer is evidence donald get that into your head that laptop is exactly what the police want thats our battle dont you see and its not one we want to fight believe you me no sir but well fight those we must hmm you bet we will i can get it back he waved the money at tegg i have friends this seemed unlikely if not impossibleespecially the latter statement what an idiot you are shut up an idiot do you hear me he leaned toward maybeck you get that laptop back and you destroy that database before the police are any the wiser get rid of the van too if you fail in any of this you will regret it doctor his receptionists voice is everything okay hed been shouting out in a minute tegg replied in a friendly voice to the closed door how much had his employee heard how could everything come down around you so quickly maybeck whispered isay we zoom the girl we kidnapped and take our chances with wong kei is that what you say tegg asked standing and approaching him daring to put his face up against maybecks breath like an open sewer im not terribly interested in what you have to say donald but you had better be interested in what i have to say extremely interested he whispered connie then the laptop the van thats your order of business your priorities if connie wont play along well use your imagination no problem donnie said was he actually condoning such a thing he felt a disturbing pressure in his head like a tire taking too much air he wondered why he couldnt just step away from it all let it go how far would he go in order to make up for that mistake of his he didnt like himself he didnt even know himself he had studied the psychology of cornered animals in college only now that he was experiencing it did he begin to understand only now did he see clearly what exactly was to become of the black man out in the kennel he too was a liability one that at this point they could certainly not afford but not for long lo with the surveillance a complete disaster with no one to be mad at but himself with no appetite boldt left work and headed directly to the back door of the big joke he didnt want liz to see him like thishe wasnt sure what he wanted had he been a drinker he would have gotten drunk but booze only gave him a sour stomach and a bad case of the blues the blues themselves seemed the best way outeighty eight keys of refuge where voices sang in his head and drove out all thought the club was closed to the public by order of the treasury department but since bear berenson lived upstairs access was still available through the back the piano had never been confiscatedjust the financial recordsand only two of the six screws intended to lock it shut had violated it boldt let himself in found the piano in the dark and started playing a while later bear settled himself into a chair at the table farthest from the stage because boldt hated the cigarette smoke and because this table sat immediately under a light which bear needed to read his trade paperback how to beat the irs a gift from boldt he studied it like a preacher with a bible his reading punctuated by grunts of disapproval and sighs of supplication a captain going down with the ship he paused and looked up only to relish a particular phrase from boldts piano or to roll himself another joint it had been several days since boldt had played and he took to it hungrily tuning all else out his pagerswitched offhis holstered weapon his shield and his wallet all occupied a leathery heap by the glass of milk that bear occasionally refreshed on his way back from the bar the investigation would occasionally surface like a prairie dog lifting its head from its lair but boldt would send it into retreat with the stomp of a foot or the stabbing of a dissonant note bear disappeared sometime during the marathon boldt didnt look to see what time it was he heard the phone ring several times glad it wasnt his a while later needing the bathroom and unable to use the clubs because of the dark he found his way upstairs bear was asleep in front of the television with that much pot in him he wouldnt be worth trying to awaken and put to bed so boldt left him he was back at the piano and into one of his better renditions of all the things you are when he detected movement out of the corner of his eye he turned to see liz standing in the darkness like him she had entered through the back door arms crossed she observed him solemnly in quiet contemplation no telling how long she might have been there liz was not one to interrupt his playing bad day he offered they happen she reminded a wind moved through the room carrying the scent of her with it perhaps this was what had stopped him in the first place she smelled gorgeous she explained we need you miles and i we need you even when you feel like thisespecially when you feel like this i worried i was picturing a hotel room something like that not likely but possible anything is possible have i let you down have you let me down can i blame it on your work can i blame it on you i want to i try toi i miss the music thats all i miss you more you and einstein where is he emma is pulling emergency duty their neighbor she pinchhit when they needed her you dont get it do you she asked maybe not i love you when he failed to reply she added i want to be your piano i want to be the one you turn to when you feel like this i want to be the one to help you do its not you its me he said its both of us it always is i screwed up a surveillance this afternoon do you see what this stuff does to you please but do you hes killing you too he is and me and miles what about your son i hate this its as if we never worked any of this out but we did once i love this work i live to stop guys like this but when you dont look at you he glanced at the piano this is the other me no lou this is the same you i wont give you permission to love your work more than your family who said anything about thati did im talking about me you never talk about you thats one of our problems one of our problems things are far from perfect she advised him there was a spider in one of the spotlights searching its web for food seemingly supported by nothing boldt felt like that at times alone hanging by a thread caught at the focal point of all that heat people die you see enough of it it makes you think shit happens she said she was angry do you wish i hadnt signed back up i wish you were happy youre not not with me not with yourself i want to understand that i want to help do you want me to quit do you i will you need an excuse ill give you one if you want sometimes she knew him better than he knew himself boldt shifted on the bench maybe theres a way to balance the two which two was she asking about daphne was she haunted by that music and work friends and family work and family she forced a smile honesty is a good place to start i love you he said i need some evidence sergeant he stood crossed the room and offered his arms she folded into him naturally and wrapped around him like a vine more evidence she said and he hugged her tighter he slipped his hand inside her skirt and cupped a buttock she purred her hair caught in his unshaved face it tickled ill try to be there for you me too its hard she said thats because it hasnt felt you this close in a while that made her laugh which was good we need more laughter we need a lot of things she said softly into his shoulder and giggled selfconsciously it felt fresh wonderfully fresh as if he had never touched her before each movement of hers each probe carried a tingling electricity she pulled out his shirttail her hands felt hot on his skin she was fully off the floor hanging off him her lips smeared him with lipstick her smell invaded him he groped for the door stumbling with her along as baggage she unfastened his belthow he wasnt sureand went for the button to his pants he kicked out the doors stopper she threw the bolt as if they had practiced this she refused to be let down clinging to him like miles giggling playfully his pants fell down around his knees and he staggered no she protested as he tried to lower her onto a bar stool no again when he aimed for a table as he limped around waiting for approval she lifted her skirt into a ruffle and tugged on her underwear but with her legs clasped around him in a straddle they werent going anywhere damn she gasped urgently charging him with excitement the room was dark and strangely hot he felt like a klutz scanning the room for somewhere to satisfy her she felt anxious alive nervous hungry she hung off him head lowered back her lacy chest exposed from an unbuttoned blouse she pointed like a lookout on the bow he leaned his head down took her bra in his teeth and tugged until he freed her breast which he sought with his lips he found her and she gasped as much from surprise as pleasure he felt her heat pressed against him and it drove him to an impatient frenzy he was about to drop her she was so far cantilevered off him her legs gripped him like a vise he found the other breast and went after it with his tongue she cried out her legs gripped even tighter and she worked herself against him in an unmistakable motion oh god she said in a way that called for him down she commanded he lowered her onto the piano bench her head dangling off the far end her skirt gathered at her waist he jumpedfellout of his khakis she struggled free of her last barrier with an ambitious bend of the knee her scent overwhelmed him and he lost any sense of their surroundings it was just them joined athletic and driven toward fulfillment wild she coached with sharp cries of approval and overactive hips an elbow smacked the keys and sounded a dissonant chord red light from an exit sign her hair stretched like spilled water toward the floor he could see darkness down her throat as she laughed a pleasure ridden gutteral laugh he had been a long time waiting to hear that laugh again he warned her and she liked that wait wait she pleaded i cant he cautioned what started as another of those laughs gave way to him and ended with the sharp sounding of satisfaction loud and honest honest as anything she ever said to him honest in a way he lived to hear for a long time her head hung limp her chest rose and fell toward recovery with some effort she managed to look up holding onto him so he wouldnt move wouldnt leave her her face was a glorious red her eyes filled with wonder hope and promise she took him by the hair and pulled him to her she whispered in a husky voice weve gotta get a piano a homicide boldt had been to too many to count but each was different each sickened his stomach it was something you never got used to and if you did then it was time to change departments a human life so precious when you saw it taken away so ugly a sight a murdered human so different from a mere dead body the first dead body he had ever seen had been his grandfathers he wasnt supposed to see it he had been told not to go upstairs but he had sneaked up while his father poured his mother a drink from his grandfathers bar dead on the bathroom floor his pajamas down around his knees eyes open and squinting little lou boldt had dared to touch him and when he did the mans entire body jumped as if he were hooked up to electricity boldt had run from that room blindly screaming hes alive hes alive dead bodies still terrified him he had to park out on the asphalt they had taped off the sandy road hoping the professors boys might lift some tire or shoe impressions but with this rain it was unlikely things washed away pretty quickly boldt crossed a spongy fairway a weird place for a homicide a golf course the guys hadnt touched the body they were still doing photographs when boldt reached them the back of the station wagon was open connie chi was wearing relatively new shoes by the look of the soles her underwear had snagged on the right shoe both ankles were tied to opposite ends of an umbrella spreading her legs sadness washed through him replaced a few seconds later by an intense and unforgiving anger sexual assault for sure the professors sidekick told himboldt had forgotten the mans name though dixie will have to confirm it where is dixie boldt asked on his way be here any minute boldt looked in at her naked from the waist down hands tied with plastic grocery bags spreading her arms open like jesus on the cross tied to the back seat door handles he glanced just once at the head a car flare was thrust deeply into her mouth sticking out like a cigar the phosphorous had burned a white hole through her throat no blood at all just an ugly twoinch hole the other guy said doing her groucho imitation trying to be funny there was always a tendency toward humor around crime scenes boldt got away from there quickly over to the bushes in case he puked hed been away for two yearshis stomach had forgotten about this fifteen years earlier he would have been embarrassed to puke now he wished he would just to make himself feel better he wanted to think that some monster had done this to her all by himself but the inescapable feeling was that he too was responsible he and his crew had blown the surveillance he and his crew had made their interest in connie chi apparent they had marked her over here one of the professors boys hollered boldt and some others joined him at the end of the mans bic pen was a spent condom and a blue wrapper looked pretty fresh one of the others said a place like this the bushes are probably full of one finger gloves you want it sarge he asked boldt inquiring if it should be collected and marked as evidence i want everything boldt replied in a voice that cracked i want her back alive he felt like saying i want a second chance at that gas station surveillance he could picture himself running alongside the van his hand on the door handlehe could feel it he could see that finger lock the door before he got it open he could see the van pull away into traffic were looking for animal hairswhite animal hairs carpet fibers fingerprints prints are out the vehicle is wiped clean one of the technicians called out in an authoritative voice that rang with anger boldt ordered dont forget to check under the back seat he may have folded the back seat down at some point he may not have remembered to wipe it down had this guy thought of everything and get someone from sexual assaults down here i want the rape angle treated just as carefully as if she had survived this is a hell of a lot more than he caught himself the entire group of maybe ten guys including the uniforms were looking at him staring at him only then did he realize he was crying crying buckets only then did he wish he had never come back at all donnie maybeck entered the first avenue storefront that advertised peep show inside behind a black velvet curtain a row of wellused nickelodeons showed endlessloop adult videos loners who smelled bad and couldnt keep their hands from shaking pressed their faces to the viewing lens squinting donnie thought that if someone had been running a camera in the back of his van when he had knocked those runaways or when hed jumped connie that hed be a porno star by now donnie does debbie live healthy eat a vegetable he could see the titles now worthless dirt bags these guys they should all be zoomed the one behind the counter was called bogs he had a tattoo of a skull on his left cheek and he chewed gum so fast he sounded like a dog eating bogs knew everything and everyone when the word had reached donnie that bogs wanted to buzz donnie had made tracks to the shop donnie said hey because that was how bogs said hello you had to know these things bogs said hey though his mouth never stopped chewing i hear you got a cnote for me the laptop donnie shouted it he couldnt control himself what the fuck do you think the man winked slowly at him his right eyelid was tattooed with the word fuck when he winked his left eye donnie read you he repeated the sequence proudly fuck youjust in case donnie had missed it donnie could see this guy doing this into a mirror reading the words backwards smiling chewing his gum probably chewed gum in his sleep you got the scratch he asked donnie donnie dug into his pocket and withdrew teggs money he hated to see it go bogs said i aint promising you its yours you know i got no way to know if its yours donnie realized he should have split the reward into two payments he hated it when he did stupid things like that he said if its not mine im coming back for the scratch a toshiba right donnie answered this with a nod young kid dark hair another nod its yours bogs pocketed the money north side of pine between first and second just up from the market you know the place ill find it youre never going to get it without the stub you know the way it works but thats your problem you got a name for me someone i could grease grease someone at a hock shop what kind of dumb shit are you donnie was sick of taking insults from everyone up yours he said losing his temper ill get it back bogs shook his head at him that really pissed donnie off youll see donnie said childishly bogs offered only the same winking of the eyes that same message flashing back from his darkened eye sockets fuck you boldt was folding laundry when the car pulled up out front the image of connie chis murdered body still lingered in his minds eye liz was on the couch reading a novel miles had fallen asleep in the jonny jumpup effectively guarding the way into the kitchen and preventing anyone from attempting to clean up scott hamilton played sensuous sax from the stereo boldt knew every note every nuance but tonight it all seemed so trivial in his mind lingered another image as well sharon shaffer her chest cut open her heart removed were they too late to stop it the plates on the van had turned out to be stolen no real surprise to boldt but still a disappointment they had alerted area pawn shops to notify them of any hocked laptop computers it was pretty much waitandsee at the moment it was frustrating as hell thats a brown and a blackjust in case you care liz said pointing out the socks boldt was in the process of rolling together she was like that she could split her attention among several things at once not boldthe tended toward obsessive his mind his emotions locked on and wouldnt let go despite the present activity of his hands his attention was not on the socks he was on autopilot stuck with the rookie cop dilemma of reliving his mistakes he broke the pair apart said thanks and started again she caredthat was the point about the socks about him she looked after him and he was thankful for it she didnt nag she observed she didnt force herself on him she re the minded him to shave when he forgot she threw his shirts into the washeven though he did the wash right now she was probably worried sick about his skipping dinner they had a visitor boldt heard the feet trodding up the wooden steps of the front porch and announced its dixie before the man even knocked ill get it you amaze me she said boldt stopped at the door he felt tempted to turn the lock rather than the door knob tempted to crawl up her skirt and make some trouble or another baby hes going to want me to go with him somewhere boldt informed her when he saw the glare of the headlights and realized dixie had left the car running he opened the door be with you in a second he told dixon before the man could utter a word dixon managed to ask but how hes psychic liz interrupted helping boldt to locate his gun and jacket she asked dixon how long will you be a couple hours maybe the befuddled man replied she asked boldt if he had his keys because she would be asleep by eleven she hated the way policework robbed them of their private time tuesday was his night to put miles down now she would have that chore as well she whispered into his car wake me following it with a quick dart of the tongue boldt returned a kiss and heard the door close and lock behind them as he and dixie descended the steps whats up boldt asked across the roof of the car after reaching the passenger door theyve found the remains dixon told him water level in the river is high and rising we excavate tonight or we lose it montys on his wayour forensic archaeologistand ive asked an entomologist from the udub to join us as well we would rather do this by daylight of course but not if we risk losing the remains by waiting boldts depression vanished instantly replaced by an elevated pulse and a tingling sense of curiosity a dozen questions crowded his brain once again when had the body been buried exactly what was the cause of death what could it tell them about the harvester was this his first kill they needed the rest of the remains and the identity of the victim before they could answer any of these questions youre certainly talkative dixon said a few minutes into the ride another fifteen minutes later they were away from the lights and the traffic the density of the darkness increasing around them it rained lightly for a few minutes boldt felt hypnotized by the motion of the wipers dixon asked boldt to pour him a cup of coffee from his thermos knowing better than to offer any to boldt the blood toxicology workup on chapman c me in today dixon baited his friend a am i interestedever heard of a drug called ketarnine no should i have youre about to good its a drug used by veterinarians for a moment boldt actually thought his heart had stopped animal hairs he said recalling that a variety of such hairs had been found on both chapmans clothing and sharon shaffers furniture what asked dixon i recalled dr light horses comments about bo the closure appearing unusual a veterinarian when you looked at the evidence it suddenly seemed so obvious the road ahead of the car was clear but there was plenty of traffic in his head to make up for it talk to me you ever watch minutes dixon asked you know better than that boldt hadnt owned a television since walter cronkite went off the air its a drug used in surgery by vets it paralyzes the patient from the neck down the dog cat whatever remains semiawakethat is doesnt require ventilation or other life support during surgerybut cant feel or move its often used in conjunction with gas its a very serious drug to use on adult humans because of its psychological effects oddly enough some pediatricians are now using it on children minutes did a thing on a guy who evaporated ketamine down to a powder slipped it into the drinks of women he met in bars and then took them to motels and raped them i read about it boldt said i remember the case well apparently youre not the only one the interesting thing about ketamine especially in large doses is its devastating effect on shortterm memory none of the rapists victims ever remembered what happened to them and i mean they remembered nothing it was only because one of them escaped before the drug fully took effect that he was ever caught he was lucky he didnt kill someone in large doses its lethal convulsion asphyxiation death a vet hes using a knockout intravenous dosage of ketamine combined with valium throw in a dash of electroshock for good measure and theres no oneno onewhos ever going to identify him dixon turned off the darkened road onto a muddy dirt road and slowed down to where the rear end of the vehicle wouldnt fishtail a vet boldt was stunned suddenly he was having to rethink his line of investigationit was like starting all over he couldnt manage any other words theres more once i discovered the ketamine in the workup i knew what to look for i told you we saved some tissue samples from the ones we lost to hemorrhaging daffy told me we save those things for a reason reasons like this the car was acting squirrely having a hard time with traction more than once boldt was tempted to reach over and grab the wheel but dixon did a good albeit disturbing job of talking while driving vicryl had been used in two of the three cases its a woven suture made by a company called ethiconits used internally for closures but the vicryl used in both peter blumenthal and glenda sherman was a number two thats huge way too big for human use horses cowsgorillas maybe not humans the point being that oversized woven suture will loosen up on you your knots fail in the case of a kidney lets say youve tied off an artery with it it comes loose and you have fortyfive percent of the bodys blood flow pouring into the back side of your intestines youre dead real fast real fast like walking down the street and keeling over which is how sherman was found by do i have your interest yet there was a red flare burning like a roman candle on the left side of the road up ahead dixon slowed and turned at the flare following a good number of rutted tire tracks they wouldnt be the first on the scene a vet boldt repeated may i use your phone he asked taking the car phone from the cradle before dixie consented it took him three calls to find daphne she was staying at sharons looking after agnes rutherford in sharons absence how do you feel about unpaid overtime he asked rhetorically not waiting for her answer its not a surgeon its a veterinarian dixie has the proof roust lamoia make a list just like the ama list all the local vets capable of this think of ways to narrow it down find out about the distribution of a drug called he looked at dixie ketamine boldt repeated it he added were closing in daffy search and rescue found the bones ill find lamoia well be at the office and i want a psych profile asap boldt reminded though the phone had gone dead out of range boldt said he hung up theres more dixie announced proudly the ethilona suture used for the subcutaneous closurefollowed what we call a continuous interlocking stitch im talking about chapman now about those photos you took to dr light horse i got your memo shes right about the technique used on the closures and it all fits with a vet incidentally they use the interlocking because of its strength the giveaway is the subcutaneous stitch the continuous interlocking stitch it is always done right to left by righthanders and lefttoright by lefthanders this one was lefttoright a leftie boldt asked excitedly that certainly narrows the field although whether a person is right or lefthanded is not the kind of thing we have access to he realized that it would require a hell of a lot of manpower to chase down a lead like that i thought that would interest you boldt nodded but was thinking how difficult it would be to verify or investigate and if they sent out detectives asking questions they would only serve to tip off the harvester to give him time to clean house and shut down shop they needed the cart before the ox they needed the pair of snipping shears that dixie believed connected at least two of the victims they needed a witness even a dead one were here said dixie pulling over the air smelled impossibly good and the sound of the raging river growling from below them in the darkness brought back memories of twenty years earlier when boldt and liz had found time to explore the peninsula the fourwheel drive vehicles were parked below their headlights and search lights revealing a dugup area that looked like the surface of the moon the entire landscape was riddled with deep test holes the work of a yellow backhoe that now sat off to one side as boldts eyes adjusted he saw that they had worked their way up this bank of the riversome sixty yards worth of excavations those lights were now aimed onto the grave an angry black hole that looked like a huge mouth locked open in midscream there were maybe ten peopleall mencrowded around the hole some leaning on shovels some in sheriff uniforms most drinking coffee from plastic thermos cups their attention fixed on this hole in the ground and its contents which remained out of sight for dixon and boldt as they slid down a small incline the sound of the river growing even louder it no longer sounded peaceful the closer they drew to this hole this grave the more menacing that sound two of the fourwheel drives were running the light was a blue sterile wash out of keeping with the natural surroundings like the illumination at a photo shoot or movie set they avoided the other holes as they approached one of the uniforms from the sheriffs office introduced himself this site was well outside of the city limits outside of boldts jurisdiction but still in king county and therefore within the professional domain of dr ronald dixon jurisdictional differences could create tremendous headaches for all concerned if ego and territory became issues boldt kept this in mind and let dixie do all the talking the deputy sheriff was nice enough he asked to be brought uptodate dixie managed to tell him as little as required without reference to sharon shaffers abduction or the harvesting linkage for which boldt was grateful to date they had managed to keep this out of the press the press could be a nightmare a light mist began to fall boldt turned up his collar one of the search and rescue guys offered him rain gear but he declined they had hand dug a series of terraced shelves descending from surface grade to the partially exposed bones below boldt felt impatient this site could be the harvesters first kill perhaps his first harvest and as such might hold clues to both his character and methods criminals made mistakes the first time around that they often eliminated as time wore on and the number of their crimes rose as the depth of the hole increased different strata of soils could be seen remember one of the men warned from overhead this sucker is undercut something fierce theres not enough floor in the very bottom to support you stick to the shelves that last step is as low as you dare go it looked as if a shovel had pierced the tender layer of soil that still supported the skeletal remains causing a hole through which the fevered gray foam of a dark angry river could be seen threatening some water splashed up and into it over the roar of the white water another of the crew shouted its dangerous down there that hole youre looking at was caused by my foot dixie stepped onto the first terraced landing standing about knee deep in the wide mouth of the excavated hole boldt followed the two of them standing side by side dixie reached up and was handed a powerful flashlight the size of a small biefcase he turned it on illuminating the haunting mask of a holloweyed skeleton that stared back at them boldt could clearly make out an arm and part of a leg dixie said shes beautiful if you say so answered boldt dixie ran the light down her extremities and as he did he recited the names of the various bones he saw humerus radius ulna tarsus metatarsus when he reached the proximal phalanx he accidentally directed the bright light into boldts eyes skull and pelvis most of the remaining ribs were lucky boldt reached out and steered the light back to their subject not her he was thinking he said one thing about a murder there are always two witnesses dixon said now if shell only tell us who the other one was the harvester boldt said softly there was no doubt now two of the ribs were cut sharply their ends clearly missing a whole section of her rib cage cut away like an empty box to the search and rescue team whose glowing dirty faces rimmed the enclosure all of them looking down into the grave dixon said lets get to work inside the farmhouse a single light burning in the other room elden tegg sat in the relative darkness he missed pamela she was essential to the team without her this procedure was going to be much more difficult though not impossible by any means even so he remained quite angry with her for wanting no part in this for forcing him to hide it from her tegg accepted his solution to the michael washington problem because he felt justified in blaming it on others the police were a force to be reckoned with he had no desire to be an object of an investigation he also blamed washington himselfa victim of his own foolishness he prepared mentally for the task at hand experiencing a stimulating warmth in his neocortex he felt high he felt ready he headed toward the kennel through the chill night air drawn to the barking like a mother to a babys crying as he unlocked and opened the door felixleft free to defendand the others went silent tegg stood before washingtons cage his doctors case in one hand the collars remote device in the other washingtons hot terrified eyes revealed a man overcome with fear even though excited tegg didnt feel good about this but he accepted it just the same did the man know what fate awaited him sharon looked terrified as well were all in this together tegg thought each inexorably linked to the other he waved the wand you dont want me to use this do you washington replied through the muzzle in words surprisingly clear what right do you have to do this who made you god teggs kneejerk reaction was to light him up with the wand and watch him squirm but he didnt do that he felt compelled to answer this if for no other reason than to hear the explanation himself i am doing what must be done we all are it is not without sacrifice on all our parts no not without sacrifice but youre a fake you arent even a doctor you told me yourself youre a veterinarian an animal doctor how can you pretend like this pretend teggs nostrils flared his eyes flashed hot auspiciously the dogs who had been pacing anxiously inside their cages all stopped at once as if on cue the building went deathly silent tegg depressed the button on washingtons wand the black man repeatedly danced around the cage like a marionette sharon screamed soundlessly the dogs barked tegg stopped enough washington collapsed to the cement a magnificent erection rising from him tegg said to sharon what do you make of that he indicated washingtons erection but she wouldnt look she curled into the fetal position trembling washington was weakened to the point that he couldnt move quicklythe perfect target tegg used the dart gun next administering a strong dose of valium he would hold off on the ketamine until he had him up in the cabin hes going to sleep thats all he told the woman in a blatant lie how many times had he spoken this line to pet owners what a strange euphemism washington did not attempt to remove the dart his will was broken strangely that hurt tegg most of all the first few incisions went beautifully i should be videotaping this he thought his patient lay before him an eightinch incision in his chest again he longed for pamelas assistance and support he had grown to depend on her an uncomfortable feeling a sort of attachment that he couldnt fully accept he thought through the procedure carefully now for this was exactly where he had made his mistake twenty years before he pushed the thought of the police from his mind he pushed away his temporary anger at pamela he tried to transcend it allto establish a quiet place in his mind from which to commence he reviewed each detail he would split the sternum with the sternal saw place and lock the sternal retractor opening the chest cavity open the pericardial sac identify and immobilize all the vessels leading in and out of the heart flush the heart with cold solution place ice around the heart collect and centralize all the vessels cut the heart out and place it immediately in ice he congratulated himself on how effortlessly he recited the various steps not so terribly difficult one step at a time he checked insuring that any and all instruments he might possibly need were within easy reach they were ready now he switched on the sternal saw the ketamine valium and versed paralyzed and relaxed the man but left his eyes open in a vacant stare tegg was distracted by those eyes without pamela by his side whom he normally used as a sounding board describing each detail of the procedure like a pilot running down a checklist tegg found himself looking at those eyes engaging his patient in a monologue the electric saw hummed noisily a sternal saw requires an upward pressure in order to cut the bone and still remain at a safe distance from the tissue beneath itthe heart with the sternum exposed tegg fed the saw under the lower edge of the sternum into the chest cavity slipping the edge into the lot made to accept it this was the very same procedure tegg had failed to execute properly twenty years before seemed like yesterday now that he had this saw in hand seemed so much like yesterday that yesterday came right out of his subconscious his mind played tricks on him it wasnt washington on the operating table it was thomas kent his eyes were open he looked dead already one second washington the next thomas kent back and forth black skin white skin positive negative youre a fake he recalled this mans words clearly but im not he thought ill show you stemum goes in the mouth of the sawhe could remember performing this procedure on cadavers never a hitch he could remember assisting millingsford a dozen times never a hitch stop staring he told his patient he hadnt bothered with conventional anesthesia because washington wouldnt be around after this and it was usually pamelas job anyway the harvest would be over in thirty minutes or sowhat was the worry it was those eyes was he awake stop staring tegg beseeched the man for a second time he flipped on the switch sternum goes in the mouth of the saw only for a fraction of a second did he glance at those eyes a fake too long he neglected to maintain the constant upward pressure required of the saw suddenly the donor s warm blood like water from a burst pipe sprayed into teggs eyes and blinded him at the same time he was flooded by his memories again was this nothing but the same nightmare he had lived with for twenty years for a moment he stepped back believing it was but his surroundingsthe plastic walls and ceilingalerted him that this was for real he jumped back to work literally throwing the saw to the cement floor with a crash he attempted to contain his mistake which was like expecting the dutch boy to hold back the flood like trying to piece a blowout back together from the scraps of a tire found in the breakdown lane he enlarged the chest incision gaining access to the heart by reaching beneath the sternum he quickly packed the wound with cloth applying pressure with his hand he plugged the hole in the mans heart with the cloth and pinched the tough muscle shut but he was all out of hands the hemostatsthe clamps were just off to his left lying there waiting for him staring at him glinting in the light but his hands were fully occupied pamela if only frantically he released the heart and made for the clamps blood erupted like a geyser he began furiously clamping anything he touched the bleeding slowed and stopped for a moment he thought he had contained it but then he looked up at the monitor and realized the patient was dead in abject horror in fear of total failure tegg worked at a frantic pace there was far too much blood on the chest for him to see what he was doing his movements usually smooth and controlled came out of him as small explosions he retrieved the saw opened the chest and let his fingers be his eyes the organ was ruined the saw had inflicted a twoinch incision in the left ventricle had it only been the pulmonary artery tegg ignored the errornot his but the saws he tried to convince himselfand removed the heart properly he cradled it in his hands and sank slowly to the floor exhausted could he never get it right he wondered only one more try and if he failed at that what would wong kei do to him hed have his heart thats what the police wong kei the heart he held in his hands pamelas refusal to help him it felt like some kind of conspiracy he had to rise above this to overcome practice makes perfect he mumbled looking down at the heart still cradled in his hands practice makes perfect sharon shaffer trembled in the center of her cage wrought with fear there was nothing to measure this fear against nothing to compare it to at first the pain had distracted her pain was a matter of tolerance tolerance a matter of attitude attitude a matter of choice she chose to be strong calling on her higher power to see her through thus far it had her wounds were both terrifying and painful she could only see out of her left eye now but maybe that was a blessing for all she saw were the vicious angry eyes of the restless pit bulls boring down onto her she concentrated not on her losses but her strengths in order to regain the confidence required to escape she would need every available faculty her central focus had been and continued to be gaining her freedom people made mistakes even people like him and she was ready to seize the moment fifteen minutes after the keeper had left the building she went to work with a determination she had not allowed him to see she hoped that his impression of her was that she was weakened to the point of total exhaustiona necessary ruse if she was to have any hope of taking him by surprise in fact quite the opposite was true she was much stronger than she looked that morning she had spotted a hypodermic needle covered in dust pushed into the corner of the adjacent cage where the buildings corrugated metal met the chain link of the kennel wall she saw it not as a needle but as a potential weapon given the right moment she could take an eye out with it blind him jump him when he returned with michael he would be distracted if she could only get that needle it might be the perfect time for an attack lure him into the cage by moaning and gripping her side the problem was how to reach clear across the adjacent cage snag the needle and drag it all the way back she had decided to craft a fishing line out of the only two materials available the plastic iv tube hooked up to her arm and string from the burlap sack having spent the last twenty minutes unweaving a portion of the burlap sack and knotting pieces of it together she now had an eightfoot length to use as a fishing line as she disconnected the iv tube from both the needle in her forearm and the overhead iv bag she considered using the needle in her own arm as a weapona needle was a needle after allbut she feared he was too observant for that he always stood there examining her prior to opening her cage if he noticed the needle missing if he sensed her intentions all hope was lost he would shock her into semiconsciousness and her weapon would be lost she would have only one chance to use the needle she couldnt risk his catching on she prevented the iv from leaking by inverting it and reclamping it to the top of the chainlink cage she fashioned a fishing pole from the tubing by doubling it on itself she knotted her burlap line to the end of it her blind eye gave her unexpected problems she felt time slipping away how much longer until he returned michael to his cage the more she tried to hurry the more awkward her motions she quickly realized that above all she had to remain calm steady the door banged she glanced toward it in terror himor just wind rattling its hinges as it often did if he came in on her now she studied the dogs for their pacing and silence had become warning signs of the keepers approach they showed no such signs at the moment sweat trickling down from her temples she went back to work she tied a few pieces of dry dog food onto her line to act as weights they kept breaking apart and falling off her frustration grew to the point where she could hardly use her fingers she had to stop take a deep breath and try again finally she formed a small loopa lassoon the end of her line with enough weights to do the trick the door banged again but the dogs remained complacent dozing for the most part the sweat now trickled down her jaw she fed the tubing and line through the chain link careful not to touch it any contact with the cage would trigger the shock collar she jerked the tubing back and forth driving her wighted line toward the far corner and the needle e she couldnt judge distance well she kept casting toward the needle but the end of her line didnt even come close it took some practice the tubing sagged if she tended it too far the line hit the cement floor if she didnt keep it high enough with each new attempt her lasso inched toward the target the door the wind her imagination all worked against her concentration the harder her heart pounded the more pain she felt in her wounds the loop hooked the needle slowly she pulled it toward her suddenly the dogs sat up in unison their ears perked eyes alert him himn her bad eye screamed with pain as she squinted her good eye blurred with tears from over use the needle was only halfway toward her come on she pulled the line more quickly the dogs paced anxiouslyhe was close her hands shook panic overtook her she tugged on the tubing and lost the needle stranding it in the middle of the adjacent cage to her it looked as big as a coke bottle lying there it called out here i am look shes trying to escape her hand brushed against the chain link her collar sounded a quick warning and then delivered a devastating jolt of electricity she fell back letting go of the tubing it slid through the chain link threatening to fall into the next pen she snatched it back quickly but in doing so made contact with the fence once again the dogs circled their cages frantically he was coming he was certain to see the needle she stuffed everything under the burlap and sat down on top of it and looked up only to see the in bag still clipped to the top of her cage this of all things would give her away then she saw that the in needle in her had leaked blood onto her forearm what to do think with the door coming open with far too many loose ends to tie up with no clear idea what she was doing she pulled the iv bag down its contents leaking out onto the floor she grabbed the plastic tubing from beneath her and slipped the string off its end leaving a knotted tanglea messon the floor now it might look like an accidentit had tangled in her sleep with all these thoughts swirling inside her she dared not look at the needle dont draw his attention to it she looked away as the door opened fully and he stepped inside she vomited drenched in blood he held a human heart in his outstretched hands the heart looked so small so pitiful nothing to worry about he said strongly the door banged shut behind him the barking stopped with the scent of blood in the air all the dogs hurried to the front of their cages tegg moved down the center aisle practice makes perfect he stated sharon caught herself pulling at the shock collara forbidden actionnot because she wanted out of it which she did but because she found it hard to breathe her teeth chattered uncontrollably her hands went numb whos been good he asked the dogs she screamed into the gag but little sound came out what i bring you today my friends he addressed the dogs is an example of the human condition the pursuit of perfection he hoisted the dripping heart aloft as a kind of sacrificial offering whos been good he sounded so normal a father to his children she glanced at the needle it seemed so insignificant now with the heart clutched in his hands he said to her be thankful this wasnt you he tossed the heart up lightly and caught it playfully it slapped into his gloved hands with a sucking sound he did this several times like a child with a ball he marched down the center aisle felix for you he said as he made the dog sit hold he said he dropped the heart in front of the dog not yet he said not yet he walked back to the main door it sang as it opened felixs full attention was on the chunk of meat in front of him okay tegg commanded the dog lunged forward and ate the heart wednesday february okay ive been on the phone all morning consulting some of the best in the business dr christiansen here in seattle shires in denver rantner and mccullough at quanticoand the picture is not a pretty one if this guy has done three hes done thirty he likely views the runaways as street scumbut its unlikely he knows hes killed them he is trying to prove himself as much as help those who need the organs the fact that hes done at least two kidneys and a lung indicates this is not strictly business its a competency test as well hes in his early to middleforties married with children shoswitz buffed she explained thats the demographic on veterinarians lieutenant its my job to play the averages hes probably attempting to overcome some prior grievance with a vet the most obvious is being turned down by medical school hes playing doctor shoswitz said exactly maybe he lost someone close to him either because of a failed organ transplant or more likely because of a lack of organ availability hes now both proving his own abilities and making certain there are plenty of organs to go around so that it doesnt happen to anyone else hes had extensive medical training he may have flunked out of medical schoolthat may be his grievance he or an associate has or has had exposure to the runaway and homeless community he can deal with these kids without raising suspicions so what youre sayin amp shoswitz tested is that these three deaths you turned up are the exception not the rule thats the opinion yes cindy chapman is more likely the rule harvest the organ drug and electroshock the donor and return him or her to the streets a few of the unlucky ones didnt make it thirty shoswitz asked that was dr rantners minimum estimate based on pattern cycles his expertise two of the victims sherman and blumenthal occurred within three weeks of each other suggesting a threeweek cycle but the indication is that this has been going on for at least three yearsif as these bones indicate the harvests are the work of the same person somewhere between twelve and fifteen a year it could be two or three times that and the body count boldt asked is that consistent it fits well yes three deaths that weve uncovered at a tenpercent failure rate that still adds up to thirty or more jesus shoswitz said this guys fucking out of his mind not necessarily lieutenant she corrected taking him literally christiansen profiled him as bright charming even active in the community he sees himself as going a step beyondgoing the extra mileto save lives he feels perfectly justified in what hes doing he feels good about it empowered by it were dealing with a substantial ego here robin hood shoswitz asked incredulously are you telling me this guy believes he is performing some kind of civic duty absolutely thats very well put lieutenant thats it exactly a uniformed patrolman knocked and opened the office door lieutenant were ready for you fifteen people were gathered in the situation room j c adams butch and dannyall working surveillance several nerds from tech services including watson who ran it like it was its own department which it wasnt two women maria romanello and trish leidecher veteran sexual assault detectives currently assigned to special operations boldt lamoia and shoswitz followed in behind daphne shoswitz paced the room rubbing his elbow and spoke in a commanding voice heres where we stand everybody robbery has quite possibly located the laptop computer that was lifted from a van we had under surveillance a pawn shop on pine called in serial numbers to a toshiba laptop yesterday the timing and the description of both the laptop and the kid who hocked it were a good match we sent watson and crew to have a look at it subsequently weve been informed by them that the laptop is password protected watson he said turning it over to a man with thick glasses and wet red lips he spoke with a slight lisp given the existence of an unknown password we are unable to retrieve any file on the hard disk in full we can only grab data a few sectors at a time and copying in any kind of order is out altogether we have programs capable of testing sequences of passwordstrying to break the code if you willbut with this particular hardwaresoftware combination its a terribly time consuming process shoswitz cut him off a couple of the wise guys applauded watson sat down shoswitz said obviously we need that password interestingly enough a different individual approached this same pawn shop late yesterday afternoon claiming he had hocked the laptop which we know is incorrect he wanted the laptop back he was told to return this morning this individual fit the description and through instore video has subsequently been identified as the driver of the van in question we would not only like the driver of that van under surveillance we would also appreciate it if he would give us the password so we could have a looksee at the data i hope youre following this because im not going to repeat it sergeant boldt has decided we will noti repeat will notdetain this individual when he returns this morning to claim the laptop we will place him under surveillance and hope he leads us to bigger fish okay got it but we need this friggin password in order to get at the laptop and sergeant matthews has some ideas on how we might get it sergeant he said turning it over to her daphne scanned the crowd making eye contact with each person what were going to doall of usis trick the suspect into volunteering the password each of you has some role to act out youve already been briefed on that what im going to be talking about applies to how you approach that role how you approach the suspect we know what this guy looks likeyouve all been shown a photocopy of a shot lifted from the stores video well be fully wired watson will be set up in the back of the shop she studied a report ive had the chance to study the instore video of the suspect this guy is the nervous and anxious type she said hes cocky hes used to being in control and is not at all comfortable about his present situation he wants this laptop and thats why he plays into our hands so well hes suspicious which means hell respond best to negative reinforcementreverse psychology we want to play him like a fishlet him run we act like we dont give a damn thats what it amounts to were in no hurry to help him out none whatsoever if he senses our trying to help him itll tip him off hes looking for usremember that too those of you who are going to be on the shop floor as patrons i want you to put him down at every opportunity that shouldnt be too tough for most of you more laughter get in his face call him an asshole call him stupid just dont call him late to dinner someone shouted out cute meyers bet you thought that up all by yourself she said quickly stealing the laughter that meyers had hoped for boosting her confidence she looked boldt in the eye and was gratified to see respect there we want to use his insecurity against him he wants this laptop you must remember that at all times hell do whats necessary to get it back including giving us the password as long as we make him think of it it may take us several times we must be prepared for him to walk we cant be afraid of that let him go hell be back lots of doubting faces on that one this is my territory she reminded trust me hell be back that is if that laptop contains the kind of information we think it does and if our surveillance boys dont tip him off to us she allowed them time to talk among themselves and then interrupted were going to push and pull him toy with him its essential we make this tough for him boldt interrupted his confidence apparent once we have the password were going to copy files from the laptops hard disk that may take a minute she reinterrupted which is when he will grow the most suspicious those of you acting as patronsthats your moment to cause the most confusion we want to make it safe for him to be delayed if he wants to leavefine once we have the password we dont really care o boldt corrected but we do care about his catching on to us the whole reason were letting him skate is the hope hell lead us up the ladder its like a narco bust that waywhich is exactly why those of you from narco were assigned here we need your expertise meyers asked how do we know this guy aint the cutter some heads nodded we have a profile of the harvester this guy doesnt fit boldt answered daphne witnessed the glum faces and felt tempted to defend herself he glanced at her from the side of the room where he was standing we have reason to suspect that the harvester is a veterinarian they both allowed a few seconds for the resulting chatter that always followed such an announcement this was the first time anyone had been told this other than shoswitz lamoia and herself daphne offered theres also some physical evidence we believe the harvester has a harsh voice our pawn shop suspect does not we believe the accomplice wears size thirteen running shoes the suspect in the pawn shop was wearing large running shoes the important thing daphne continued is to use his impatience against him to criticize him his looks his intelligence anything to heighten his anger if we keep him angry he wont be thinking clearly hell stop being observant his focus will be on directing his anger she asked the two women which one of you is the prostitute that caused all the male heads to spin maria romanello raised her hand she was a good choice dark skin sultry attitude with an eyepopping figure but she was a gumchewer and not at all glamorous the guys applauded her maria flipped them the bird daphne explained youll want to turn it up pretty hot not for himjust in general lots of eye shadow some skinas much as you feel comfortable with anything to keep him distracted without going over the top maria nodded one of the men let out a wolf whistle what were looking to do she told them all is pull this guy in as many directions as we can we make the environment busy we make him feel unwanted we piss him off if possible maria keeps his hormones active the more compartments in his brain we can activate the less mental power he has to concentrate on whats being asked of him we make him believe hes offering we make him think this is all his idea we play this right and hell volunteer that password without thinking about it if we blow it boldt said chances are weve sacrificed a nice piece of evidence maybe even the smoking gun daphne looked up at the clock the pawn shop opens at ten that gives us one hour to get into place any questions a single hand raised meyers again daphne nodded anybody thought about what we do if he pulls a piece and demands the laptop boldt said well have an identical laptop on hand if he tries to rob the place well substitute it and give him the wrong one anything else no other hands surfaced daphne felt herself perspiring as she watched for the lieutenants reaction shoswitz looked his crew over he hesitated but finally nodded giving his approval boldt glanced over at her she felt a real connection to him as she passed closely to him on her way out she whispered whatd you think he said softly to her im glad youre on our side she was thinking about sharon againit was all she could think about anymore what had become of her where did this man at the pawn shop fit in and what fate awaited sharon if they failed in the task before them the receptionist left for lunch pamela locked the front door and placed the closed clock in the windowback in an hourbecause they had a surgery to do and they couldnt be disturbed in truth this wasnt the only reason she locked the front door it was for privacy as well for while it trapped the public out it also trapped the two of them inside together they had work to do she had lost two pounds in just three days some kind of miracle she attributed this newfound strength to him she placed the phones on the service unbuttoned the top button of her shirt and headed for his office if she was honest with herself she was worried about him he wasnt himself today he had spent the morning brooding in his office his nose buried in medical journals and textbooks he had outright refused to see several of their patients passing the work along to her not like him at all she knocked enter he called out in a threatening voice that reminded her of her father no he was not himself at all she opened the door he looked worried behind his desk others might not see it in him but she knew him better than anyone he picked at his beard nervously what about that stray he asked whats become of him weve called around no one is claiming him hes headed for the pound later this afternoon the pound but theyll kill him in three days i saved that dogs leg he protested the farm is that what you mean you want him out at the farm are we prepped for surgery he asked a knotted intestine routine its all set up for you prepped and ready to go she added as a hint ive locked up the phones are off she wondered if he noticed her exposed cleavage he didnt seem to she reached up and undid the next button as well very well he said rising from his black leather chair but not the lower gi set up the stray for thoracic excuse me she questioned prep the stray now a few minutes later they were standing alongside one another ready for the first incision he studied the animal for what seemed like an interminable amount of time doctor she said breaking the silence he glared at her he looked down at her breasts and told her to button herself up this isnt a porno movie you know we have work to do correction i have work to do ill handle this alone what she gasped fishing for the buttons he glanced around the room get me some ice he said ice now she left the room and headed into the small kitchenette she collected ice from a freezer there she heard a buzzing from the surgical suite the saw saline he called out loudly she had to go to the back room to find it it took her longer than she wanted she hurried back into the operating room because he blamed her for any problems even if she was off doing something he told her to wheres that saline penicillin wheres the ice he repeated sternly when she rounded the corner and saw him standing there she stopped abruptly my god she exclaimed seeing the chest cavity splayed open a perfect job he proclaimed proudly and fast at that he turned to face her his outstretched hands cupped firmly together there still beating was the dogs harvested heart when donnie maybeck entered the pawn shop he had no way of knowing that his every word his every movement was being monitored and recorded by the police no idea that everyone in the placethe cheap smelling skirt with the cleivage the lame jim hendrix impersonator and the halfdozen others who crowded the counterswere all undercover cops no clue that the big hairy bastard in the undershirt who was giving him such a hard time was a homicide cop named lou boldt the man behind the counter was supposed to have been hymie monros but hyrnie had missed the briefing because of an asthma attack that had later sent him to the emergency room daphne through shoswitz had tapped boldt for the job boldt notorious for avoiding an active role in setups or stings had argued he might be recognized from his pursuit of the van shoswitz had been carefully coached to convince boldt to play the part he said it was late afternoon dusk if not dark it was raining you were runnin amp which means you had your head down it was a panel van which means it had no windows on the back or on the side except the passenger door and you never made it that far by your own admission boldt had smelled a conspiracy the side mirror boldt had argued that was when he knew it was a conspiracy and that daphne had coached the lieutenant who immediately produced a still photograph of the gas station surveillance taken by jc adams it clearly showed that the van was missing its passengerside mirror in fact there was no way the driver might have seen him and it even helped to explain why the man had reached to lock the passenger door so lateblind on that side he had not reacted until he had heard boldt try the cargo door boldt his skin going itchy from nerves told the suspect once again what im telling you asshole is that any sleazeball could come in here off the street ask if we had a toshiba laptop and then claim it was his boldt carried a huge wad of pink gum in his cheeks it looked like a pitchers abscess it had been shoswitzs idea read the fucking sign just let me see the thing show me the receipt boldt repeated finding it difficult to stay with daphnes script but doing so what if she were wrong what if they pushed too hard and this guy went south on them show me the ticket then youll get the laptop providing youve got the money got the money the man complained anxiously producing a hefty roll of bills thats blood money boldt thought sight of it made him sick he wanted to arrest this guy now why wait money wont help you without the ticket he warned the sign pal read the fucking sign but i lost the ticket the guy protested color rising into his pale face he had horrible breath the blind woman agnes had mentioned that he kept his hand loosely over his mouth half covering a set of the worst teeth boldt had ever seen i suppose im the first fucking guy to lose a receipt right maybe you cant read boldt pointed to the sign you blind or just plain stupid boldt ill painted was beginning to enjoy this it gave him a vent for his anger the woman edged over to them and said to boldt in a sexy voice hey sweetheart you gonna jerk off all day or what i got some rocks i wanna hock get lost maybeck barked at her get fucked she said to him wasnt tawkin it to you in a minute boldt told her those really your teeth she asked maybeck he popped her shoulder with the butt of his hand she stumbled back and flipped him the bird i dont need your business pal boldt said take it somewhere else now he felt terrified to say such a thing and yet he went with daffys assessment hey hey the guy said raising his hands as if the woman had stumbled all by herself im cool man you hit her again im gonna see you through the front doorwithout opening it you and who else the guy asked whos next boldt called over the guys head ignoring him completely now he looked over at maria romanello her skirt was about as big as a fly swatter her legs in black tights a mile long what kind of stones he asked her the guy was looking at her too damn near drooling meyers let loose on electric guitar so loudly that boldt couldnt hear himself think boldt hollered for him to knock it off come on man the suspect tried once more boldt felt relieved that daphnes ideas seemed to be working he never would have played it this way not in a million years he said stronglya teacher losing patience my floor manager told you yesterday you lose the ticket you come back after the grace period you buy it back at floor value if no one has bought it by then its yours those are the rules pal and i gotta tell you a laptop computer is not going to be around that long no way so give it up get a fucking job for all i care you got to make an exception he offered boldt two twenties he had cupped in his hand what do you think put the fucking cab fare in your pocket pal youre going to need it wrong guy listen he said conceding a point the only exception i ever make on something like this is if the customer can describe the item in such a way as to convince me theyre the rightful owner but with something like thiswith a laptop computertheyre all the fucking same to me i dont know shit about computersso youre plum out of luck but theyre not the same to me they are diamonds maria interrupted leaning in so the man could see down her blouse diamond earrings the guy was staring right along with boldt get outta here the suspect said to her but he didnt seem to mean it she adjusted her blouse keep your fucking eyes to yourself she said in a minute darling boldt told her she pumped her way over to a stool and sat down on it with her legs set wide apart meyers broke a string on the guitar who could blame him the suspect was still staring at maria when he said softly jesus what a package i hear ya boldt agreed it brought them together it allowed boldt to soften but what if i could prove its mine he asked boldt you mean a serial number something like that maybe weve done weirder things before it was an awful chance to take if the guy produced the serial number then boldt would have to change his mind or he could pretend to check in the back and discover that the serial number indicated the computer was hot something but this was clearly the turning point he felt warm again he wondered if the guy could see him sweating you got the serial number better than the serial number a password who else besides the owner is going to know the fucking password a password what the fuck are you talking about the thing wont work without the password you kidding me boldt shouted over to lamoia who was also in a grungy undershirt hey benny know anything about computer passwords password i thought that was a tv game show he laughed check deloris in the back shes the only one around here with any brains maria shouted over to lamoia hey buddy yeah you interested in my diamonds cant keep my eyes off em honey he shouted back she strained up off the stool and sauntered over to him brushing past the suspect on her way keeping his attention off the fact that boldt had gone into the back room meyers managed to get the rock guitar sounding like a jet airplane lamoia swore a blue streak at him until he turned it back down boldt mopped his forehead when he reached the back room there were a couple techies waiting with the laptop some expensive looking cameras were locked away in woodframed chicken wire cabinets a belt of cigarette smoke hung in the air like a layer of cloud it came from the real owner who was chainsmoking from a corner seat he looked nervous the techies had the laptop up and running the cursor blinking on a line that awaited the necessary password daphne rushed up to boldt youre doing great she said tell him to write down exactly what steps to take and that deloris will try to get it running youre going to have to convince him that under no conditions will you allow him or any client to work the machine no exceptions no exceptions bolt repeated his system feeling overloaded now i know why people smoke boldt said looking over at the nervous owner he walked back into the main room one of the guys working undercover shouted you guys all on fucking vacation or what i want some fucking service maria turned to him i got some friends who are in the fucking service honey if youre serious but they aint cheap up yours he said thats the general idea in case youre new to it she returned her attention to lamoia and went through the act of selling him her stones boldt was so entertained by thisso surprised at how convincing his people werethat the suspect had to shout over at him to get his attention so it worked in boldts favor meyers launched into a dreadful rendition of purple haze badly out of tune a woman with kitchen brooms for eyelashes entered through the front door inspecting her nails her facial skin looked like old boot leather boldt worried about her he didnt want any civilians in here just now she might realize that he and lamoia were new faces boldt went into the back room again and told the owner to put one of his people out front the owner agreed the new person handled the woman boldt hurried back to the suspect who was clearly losing patience to meyers the wouldbe jim hendrix he shouted you gonna buy that thing this aint rehearsal space to the suspect he said impatiently i gotta have two forms of picture id from you and you gotta write down how i do this password thing i can do it for you no fuckin way do you read do you listen we got state rules and we got our own rules here you understand and i dont got all day neither so move it or lose it he pushed a piece of paper in front of him to one of the undercovers he shouted how can i help you in no mood to wait around for the suspect as he stepped over to help this customer the suspect said im with you he fished for his wallet but i only have one picture id boldt wanted that wallet so badly wanted this mans name so badly that he felt like diving across the counter to get at it instead he had to sound uninterested im not gonna do this computer shit twice pal so make the directions simple understand far as im concerned you can come back after the grace period guys like you are a real pain in the ass the suspect slid him his open wallet boldt hadnt realized how hard it would be to suppress his exhilaration he felt high donald maybeck he scribbled out taking down the name address and pertinent data this had to be the rush that poker players felt i gotta have a second id of some sort mr maybeck he said you got a credit card something like that boldt had to bite his lip so he wouldnt smile by the end of the day he felt like telling the man ill know more about you than your mother does he owned a shell oil credit card name donald monroe maybeck ill have your full credit history taxes debts income you just became public property it took everything in his cops brain to slide the wallet back across the counter without searching the rest of its contents he couldnt allow even the slightest indication of pleasure to cross his face he drummed up annoyancethis asshole was keeping him from his wife and kidand moved down the counter to the waiting customer while maybeck wrote out the computer instructions the temptation to burst into a victory smile proved incredibly difficult to resist finally he faked a sneeze in order to look away he took a deep breath regained some composure and returned his attention to the undercover cop meyers shouted from the floor hey fatman ill give you two bills for the guitar and the amp boldt shouted back wait your turn lamoia called out hey dickforbrains watch who youre calling fat put the guitar down and get the fuck out of this store now eat shit meyers called back he turned the thing up loud and hit an earblistering chord maria marched over to him he stood up bravely she planted her hand into his crotch and squeezed strongly youre hurting my ears beethoven you want to trade hurts she squeezed again boldt was distracted as well the entire store was distracted out lamoia shouted meyers left red in the facewhich wasnt all an act okay maybeck called out to boldt waving the instructions at him boldt was thinking that had they brought this guy into interrogation and requested the password he never would have volunteered it now here he was waving it at boldt like granny with her flag at a fourth of july parade take it he seemed to be saying each step closer boldt drew to that piece of paper his heart beat a little quicker finally his fingers took hold to his surprise maybeck refused to let go they stood face to face eye to eye there was nothing in this guys eyeslike looking down into a dark cellar maybecks breath was foul again boldt recalled the comments of sharons housemate it was the same guy the one who had dragged sharon from the room boldt felt certain of it he wanted to take the guy by the neck and choke him down he wanted to hurt him still holding the instructionsthe password maybeck said you get the thing running then i can buy it back for what you paid me right right youll look that up youre being square with me right could he sense boldts anger no it was the silence the room had gone still boldt looked up a fraction of a second before the suspect he saw lamoia first whose panicked eyes gave boldt a sinking feeling in his gut and then he saw the uniform a patrolmana beat cop doing his jobhad wandered into the pawn shop chances are he knew at least some of these undercover people by name it had shut everybody up instantly maybeck went white as a sheet seeing this boldt improvised he said strongly but not loudly youve got no problem with the police do you we dont do business with people involved with the cops he wanted to sound as if he were protecting himself being selfish allamerican not me maybeck replied im cool he looked terrified lamoia crossed through the counter officer barnes were all out of uzis this week maria romanello laughed and started mouthing off at the cop who looking around stood dumbstruck he must have realized that he had walked into a sting and now he wasnt sure how to act boldt kept one eye on the cop maybeck kept one eye on the cop lamoia said to barnes i got a hell of a nice car stereo you might like he led him over to the counter smooth as silk he leaned in and whispered something when maybecks head was turned in a frightened but contained voice maybeck said to boldt ill be back later to pick it up he turned boldt caught him by the arm he held on tightly suit yourself asshole but im not wasting anybodys time on this unless youre here maybeck glanced down at the way boldt was holding onto him only then did boldt realize that he was wearing his police academy ring he never did this kind of undercover work had never even considered taking his ring off but now it glared back at him like a neon sign he released the man immediately had he seen the ring had boldt blown the entire setup had he sacrificed sharon shaffer the patrolman said goodbye to lamoia and left the building maybeck still watching the front door said over his shoulder im hanging just hurry it up boldt could hear daphnes coaching against his better judgment he said to the man you sure youre clean with the cops im clean okay you gonna do this or not wait here as boldt entered the back room for a second time all eyes were trained on himterror in most of them one of the techies snatched maybecks instructions from him and hurried to the computer boldt felt stunned he was tugging at his ring when daphne caught up to him she looked a few years older than just a couple of minutes before she stared at him you all right she asked im taking grecian formula into the shower with me tonight you did good she said intentional in her cop talk boldt glanced over at the techies any luck he asked one of them signaled a thumbsup were copying now he said adding database software a couple of big files sergeant thats good news i think boldt studied maybeck on watsons television screen the entire ordeal had been captured on timecoded videotape they would relive his every move study every word for significance the prosecuting attorneys office would examine the tape for signs of entrapment and rule as to its admissibility in court a process would begin maybeck was in their file as of now boldt handed watson the slip of paper that contained maybecks name address and credit card number fax this back to the office and have them run him through the computer do the same with the bureau i want to know this guys birthmarks if he has any id like a copy of that daphne said explaining to boldt for the handwriting sample the instructions as well boldt looked at her skeptically he didnt put much faith in handwriting analysis she said defensively ill make a believer out of you yet dont count on it hes looking for you watson warned boldt faced the television screen maybeck looked restless boldt looked to daphne for advice make him wait she said weve got the password watson added his two cents youre going to lose him he knows it shouldnt have taken this long we need him boldt reminded to the techies manning the laptop he said how long there are a couple big files were doing everything we how long he reemphasized not long stall him daphne said she ran over to the computer table snatched up the instructions tell him to step you through it hes leaving watson said to boldt to daphne he added i told you as boldt reentered the pawn shops show floor maybeck was on his way out the front door hey asshole mr toshiba where the hell are you going he asked fuck you maybeck stopped he didnt answer he looked scared maybe hed figured it for the setup it was lamoia shouted to maybeck hey what do you want a computer for anyway mr toshiba i got a hell of a car stereo system over here it broke the ice maybeck allowed the door to shut remaining inside boldt argued you crush my stones about how important this is and now youre gonna blow on me get goneand dont show your face in here again another agonizing silence as everyone looked at maybeck the amplifier spit static it was the only sound except for traffic noise why so long maybeck asked what you think im einstein boldt asked wondering how miles was doing you got the handwriting of a moron you know that he waved the sheet of instructions at him my firstgraders got better lettering than this get out of here get gone but dont come back here not ever whatyou cant read my handwriting what did i just tell you you gonna leave go ahead leave you got a lotta nerve wasting my time yanking my chain what cant you read maybeck asked taking his first step back toward the counter boldt felt a huge sigh of relief pass through him how about you explain it to me they worked it out between them maybeck talked boldt through the whole thing it took several minutes boldt watching the wall clock when he finally returned to the back room the techies were standing there anxiously awaiting him the laptop was all ready to go we got it one of them said excitedly we got every file in the thing boldt took the laptop one of them said better give it another minute that minute stretched on indefinitely okay he finally said boldt asked what the hell was the password anyway i forgot to even look donnie maybeck stood less than fifteen feet away on the other side of the closed door to this back room zoom the man answered whatever the hell that means off inside the chilled damp confines of elden teggs wilderness kennel sharon shaffer sat bare bottomed her arms hugging her knees her weak grip clutching the discarded needle she had recovered her mind off in an imagined fantasyland where the cement she now sat on was a hot fine mexican sand and that god awful smell in the air was the sweet perfume of a trade wind each day she challenged herself to come up with another image for without them her mind would decay into the depths of selfpity and her body surrender to disease no one needed to tell hershe knew she had seen it on the streets usually at the receiving end of a bottle or a needle similar to the one she now cherished as if it were a key to the lock on the door that impounded her she assumed from her diarrhea that he had her on a powerful course of antibiotics weakness was her biggest enemy he was both feeding and drugging her through the iv she didnt know how much longer she had in her strength was everything she knew that her will carried her hour to hour but for how much longer she continued to remind herself that as terrible as this was she had seen worse had lived worse for she had lived without faith faith alone now carried her forward perhaps this suffering was her punishment for years of recklessness his words haunted her practice makes perfect this said while he held michaels heart did that mean what she thought it meant was her heart next her life her years on the street had taught her some things she had learned how to fight how to survive how to lie how to deceive cunning she had found could get you out of more problems than any amount of reason or talk the needle remained coiled in her fingers an eye for an eye she thought the obstacles she faced seemed overwhelming the do ctor the vetshe still thought of him as the keeperwas using felix to patrol the building the dog would tear apart any intruder or her should she manage to escape she needed more of a plan on how to deal with that as part of an incentive program the keeper had also left the dog without food felix used the automatic waterer from the cage to her right its door wired open for him but as each day wore on into the afternoon in anticipation of the keepers arrival of food the dogs restless pacing increased he would enter the cage adjacent to her sit there and drool while staring at her it often went on for hours it frightened her she would motion at him scold him through her gag but the guard dog just sat there impassively smelling her wanting her what worried her most about her planned escape was the way the keeper used the shock collar to subdue her the collar could be triggered either of two ways if she touched the chain link or if the keeper used the button on the remote wand that corresponded to her collar his routine was to deliver a few devastating blasts to her collar weakening her before his entry into the cage to change her dressings by the end of those blasts she was feeble and in immense painshe was putty in his hands he knew exactly what he was doing he was taking no chances it would require all her strength if she were to use the needle on him she had it all worked out needle to the eye out the cage out the door lock it into the car gone but his liberal use of the shock collar warned her that she would not have all her strength when the moment arrived after hours days of contemplation the only solution to this problem that she could arrive at was to condition herself against the effects of the collar she had to beat him at his own gameto take more than he could deliver getting started was not easy knowledge was one thing execution another for hours now while felix stared at her she had been staring at the chain link daring herself to willingly reach out and touch it it required a morbid perversitya masochismthat she found impossible to summon nothing she reminded herself is impossible she closed her eyes bracing herself for the power of that shock reached out and took hold of the fence the collar sounded its warningan electronic buzzand then delivered its full voltage the kick snapped her spine straight lifted her chin and filled her with a savage heat it felt as if her neck were burning she released the fence and tumbled heavily to the cement at first unable to catch her breathnumb her joints welded her muscles locked tight in an impossible unforgiving cramp she only realized it had temporarily blinded her when her vision returned and she saw felix up on all fours his stub wagging his eyes locked onto her she sat up prepared herself and took hold again she held on a few milliseconds longer this time endured the seizure the spasms the whitehot fire at her neck finally surrendering and letting go again she collapsed to the cement again her vision failed her briefly again she was met by the hungry eyes of her sentry watching from the other side of the wire wall escape was all that mattered since this pain was a means to freedom she would gladly repeat this routine a dozen times a hundred he would shock her she would act the part and she would be free perhaps given enough times she might drain the collars battery and render it useless she repeatedly reminded herself that there was no easy way out of here that sacrifice was the only means to this end her mouth was dry she felt as if her insides were shaking involuntarily she denied her fears she combated the pain with desire she reached out and took hold of the fence again it sang through her like music it made her dizzy and lightheaded it challenged her to let go but she fought it refusing noooo she screamed into the gag that rubbed her mouth raw nooo as she gripped her fingers more tightly felix looked on with the whiterimmed eyes of disbelief awe he was her audience respectful he sat back on his haunches and cocked his head in question and then she realized she could see her vision had overcome the shock from the collar no more blind moments a small victory but for sharon a milestone encouraged she grabbed the fence again and again her collar sounding its warning buzz each time before the voltage surged through her one step at a time she told herself one step at a time with daphne looking on bolt struggled at the coffee machine trying to turn it on so he could make hot water for some tea lamoia entered the office bumped boldt out of the way flipped the onoff switch twice rapidly tapped the machine on the side and proclaimed no problemo sure enough the light came on and a moment later the water started dripping lamoia bought himself a coke the three of them took seats around boldts table boldt asked lamoia we get anything from watson anything in that database hes on his way what i have is maybeck im more interested in the database i know that lamoia said we all are daphne added go ahead boldt instructed attempting to contain his impatience donald monroe maybeck has no priors no outstanding warrants and only a couple of delinquent parking citations as far as were concerned hes clean shit boldt hissed he opened a file folder just to occupy his hands to keep busy he had been hopingprayingthat maybecks record might tell them something about the man dmv recordsall j lamoia had to go onoffered you precious little information viidiill lamoia continued he owns a blue ford panel van other than that officially we dont have squat on this guy i did however put in a call to a buddy of mine who is able to pull credit records no questions please he said to daphne i supplied him with the gasoline credit card number hes going to poke around for us no promises he sipped from the soda can you hear about the laptop boldt shook his head lamoia was one of those cops who knew anything of importance before anyone else he prided himself on it lamoia said jc whos working the first shift of surveillance along with butch just called in that maybeck already deepsixed the laptop he got a photo of him tossing it into lake union i suppose we could pick him up for littering well boldt said trying to see the positive no matter how small the victory if we ever get as far as trial his tossing a perfectly good computer in the drink may help reinforce the possible criminal nature of the data he had in there we can assume he erased the data so chances are that he also knew that the laptop was hotmaybe he even stole it himself hes protecting himself its not much but its something theres a down side to that lamoia reminded if hes trashing evidence there has to be a reason daphne said hes already onto us boldt felt an added pang of urgency bile stung the back of his throat his stomach had turned on him welcome back he could hear it saying if maybeck and the harvester knew about the investigation then the laptop wouldnt be the only evidence being destroyed they would have to move quickly now every day every hour gave the harvester more opportunity to distance himself from his work he scanned his current checklist addressing daphne who was still glowing with their success at the pawn shop an hour earlier he asked do we have the count on the number of vets in king county he had asked her for this the night before on the way to the gravesite it felt like a week ago not officially but we have a bare minimum she hesitated boldt knew that disappointed look of hers knew that he didnt want to hear her answer she told him three hundred and seventy the number hit boldt like a truck thats a joke right thats only the veterinarians who advertise in the us west yellow pages theres probably a third again as many who dont elect to advertise seriously a number that size seemed impossible it was impossible in terms of the investigation boldt instructed weve got to narrow that down fast thats way too big a list to even begin y i thinking about there were background checks to make bank records to scrutinize interviews to be conducted a number like that would take a team of twenty investigators over six months to whittle down she added some of those are clinics a clinic can have one or as many as ten or more vets were going to need an army if were going to go after these guys one by one she suggested having come to the same conclusion as boldt boldt fought to maintain some optimism given his fatigue it wasnt easy ill hit shoswitz up for the armyfor task force status you try to narrow that list down to surgeons or maybe tighterinternal surgeons transplant surgeons i dont know see whats possible weve got to cut that list in half at the very least half of that if were lucky ill do this during all my free time right she asked sarcastically he wasnt the only one showing fatigue listen i know its hard its impossible lamoia interrupted supporting daphne im not laying this on you sarge but we gotta have a bigger team ive been pulling office hours and surveillance duty not only is the lieutenant gonna shit when he sees my overtime but im a walking zombie a guy makes mistakes when he gets this tired even me we could be overlooking something heresomething majorand we wouldnt even fuckin know it any suggestions boldt asked hed been up all night with dixie at the bone dig he could hardly keep a thought straight in his head lamoia said like you said a task force would sure help we could pull guys from county police the fbi boys would be able to help out maybe weve got to have more manpower and womanpower daphne corrected i said ill try boldt snapped irritably sorry he apologized lamoia drained half the coke daphne wrote herself a note she said ill do what i can to narrow down the vet list maybe maria can help me out lamoia offered tentatively im overseeing the maybeck surveillance but jcs got it pretty well handled ill still be putting in a lot of office time im available it was times like this wheneveryone reached deep and suddenly rallied around each other in the crunch that boldt remembered what it was like to be a team what he had missed about this job just yesterday he had wondered why he had come back now he wondered why he had ever left god was he tired he consulted his list again and said to lamoia theres more always is now that weve located these bones i want a followup granted anybody and their brother with a fourwheeldrive has access to that area of the tolt river but i want to search county records for any landowners out there forestry anything we can think of we crosscheck anything we get both with the amas list of surgeons and with the list of vets that you put together he said to daphne sometimes people bury bodies a million miles from homejust as often in their own backyard lets check that out im on it lamoia said writing it down trying his best to mask his discouragement i know that its a long shot and a hell of a lot of work boldt admitted he also knew that lamoia didnt like this kind of paper research he preferred street work but these bones are part of this thing dixie proved that with the tool markings we cant let this slide he encouraged if we go to task force status we may be able to wrestle loose a chopper to do an aerial search of the tolt region maybe that would speed it up daphne suggested us geological might have satellite maps of the area we could look for structures identify locations and check county records kind of work it backwards our friends at the army corps might be able to help us with the maps ill call them boldt said making a note what else watson entered and took a seat in a chair over by daphne his glasses were filthy he needed new blades in his electric razor his face looked like an old weed patch he adjusted his glasses and said i wont bore you with the details good lamoia said intimidating the man watson looked a nervous wreck his domain was wires and cathoderay tubes he didnt take to a meeting like this daphne advised him dont worry about john he has a testosterone problem to every problem a solution lamoia chimed in trying to stare her down not in your wildest fantasies she stared back watson boldt asked when people came under too much stress it found strange ways of manifesting itself thats not my name you know he complained with a name like clarence you should be grateful lamoia advised him the database boldt reminded the laptop did you print up the database for us he handed boldt a sheet of paper the database looked like a spreadsheet a grid of rows and columns there were seven columns and had they been titled across the top which they were not boldt guessed they might have been labeled date name file number address phone number bloodtype the rows were created by the names of the donors listed alphabetically the minute we had this list we faxed it down to bloodlines for comparison according to them what distinguishes ours from theirsin terms of layoutis the addition of a new columnthe last column overwhich contains as yet unexplained fourdigit numbers this column is unique to this laptop database that is there is no such column in the bloodlines database the other distinguishing feature is that the date columnfar left has also been modified so that only a small percentage of the records now contain a date they should all be dated it is sorted alphabetically by the donors name he continued whats interesting is that if a name has a date it also has an entry in this new column there are twentyeight such dated fields twentyeight boldt asked flipping forward its the donor list daphne speculated a silence hung over the room daphne broke it is sharon on there twentyeight donors boldt repeated looking ahead on the list how many dead how many victims of electroshock he spotted the name shes on here he confirmed daphne went a sickly pale and excused herself from the room boldt fought his stomach lamoia killed the coke watson toyed with his glasses nervously boldt waited for daphnes return she didnt look much better he ran down the column of names calling out blumenthal chapman shaffer sherman walker theyre all here he felt it as both a nauseating moment of reality and a major moment of triumph the extra care they had taken with maybeck had proved worth it he noticed for the first time that the date alongside sharon shaffers name was not a date in the past but was for two days from now friday february lou did it show that easily or was it her she always seemed to know his thoughts in less than fortyeight hours sharon shaffer would be cut open according to dr light horse it was likely to be a major organ there would be no time to organize a task force no time to sort through a list of threehundredseventy veterinarians they would have to force every lead they had every suspect sharon shaffers life had a burning fuse attached to it now look for the good he reminded himselfthey were too tired to take a setback like this accentuate the positiveit was one of those songs occasionally requested in a piano bar he missed the big joke he wondered how bear was doing with the irs shes alive he said sharon shaffers alive lou she asked again sensing something wrong he slid the printout over to her pointing to the date he watched as her eyes glassed up a confused lamoia asked but thats good right daphne slid the sheet to him and he too fell silent what did i miss watson asked boldt inquired what do these fourdigit numbers mean i can tell you what we ruled out watson explained we know its not phone numbers not social security numbers not zip codes but what is it boldt asked angrily what are they watson leaned away from him sheepishly the coffee rooms phone rang boldt answered it he listened he said to the receiver cant you just tell me he paused im on my way he hung up whats up daphne asked dixies got something boldt turned the car into the back of the harbor view medical center and started hunting for a parking place five minutes later two blocks away he found one across from the lucky day grocery he climbed out of the car a student cycled past him on a mountain bike the tires splashed street water onto boldts shoes and onto a section of newspaper that was stuck to the pavement a display ad for an american airlines special to hawaii looked up at him this meant something he studied it more closely it was the airplane in particular and then it occurred to him he unlocked the car so nervous with the keys that he dropped them when he finally got inside he shoved the key into the ignition turned it to battery power and punched in the cellulars security code he dialed the downtown office and asked to speak to daphne she had to be paged boldt was losing patience when he finally heard her voice he said immediately theyre flight numbers the extra numbers in the database are flight numbers there was a long pause as she processed this a woman bought a newspaper outside the lucky day grocery he added they had to connect these organs to specific flights in order to get them to their destination in the allowable time it all had to be arranged in advancethe timing just right a courier she said track down those flight numbers see if were right move it to the top of your list dont spend all day over there she cautioned you know dixie he said when he makes a discovery he tends to drag it out a little a little she did know dixie ill try to hurry it along the medical examiners offices are in the basement of the harbor view medical center the ceilings are low the windows rareand then just half windows looking out at the sidewalk the hum of computers the active ventilation and fluorescent lights the percussion of typewriters and the electronic purring of telephones were the only sounds as dixon led boldt into a back room where the excavated skeleton was now laid out on a stainless steel slab its a damn good set of remains dixon announced all but the teeth were missing the lower mandible several teeth in the upper jaw were chiseled out he used a screwdriver maybe he didnt want us identifying her i like that dixon said that means he had something to hide that kind of effort always makes me all the more determined he pointed to what remained of the rib cage he cut ribs six and seven he leaned closer here and here immediately above the abdominal cavity we got a nice set of tool markings off the butt end of number six he handed boldt a set of blackandwhite lab photos just like those he had showed him at jazz alley only with todays date february photographed into the upper right corner the upper set of magnified tool markings was labeled peter blumenthal the bottom set jane doe the tool markings matched dixie continued a liver procurement a liver harvest is one of the most difficult surgeries there is extremely technical its not uncommon for the procuring surgeon to do whats called a radical harvest he demonstrated using the skeleton you take far more tissue than you need leaving all the connecting vessels intact the transplant surgeon then does the actual harvest dead or alive boldt asked in a whisper would the victim have been dead or alive prior to surgery i cant say dixon looked at the gaping hole in the rib cage but after this technique he said definitely dead dixon crossed the room returning with several jars that he placed under the harsh light he talked quickly the next piece of the puzzle we went after was timing in order to identify her we need to know as precisely as possible when she diedwhen she was buried he corrected himself in order to match her with missing persons for the same period he asked boldt how are you with bugs larvae maggots that sort of thing before boldt answered dixon said i hate it when people toss their cookies in these little rooms ive never been a real fan of maggots and i hate things with lots of legs can we speed this up youll live dixon frowned and pointed to the jars these are courtesy of our entomologist who helped out each was labeled but boldt wasnt wearing his reading glasses forensic entomology is an exploratory field he warned the courts have not made it clear exactly where they stand but thankfully thats bob proctors problem tissue decomposition is the first thing you look for when trying to date remains lacking any tissue as in this case we turn to bugsinsects living and dead graves within graves dixie drummed on the lid of the first jar we found a breeding colony of woodlice on the bones they feed off a fungus that grows only on bone it takes woodlice two years to establish a breeding colony two years boldt asked thinking he had a date pushing dixon raised a finger he tapped the second jar we alsodiscovered a past infestation of phorid fly maggots a close relative of the coffin fly the phorid fly consumes decaying flesh were estimating the weight of the deceased judging by skeletal size at between onehundredten and onehundredforty pounds at that weight it would take the phorid flies no less than two years no more than three to consume her boldt felt himself blanch woodlice will not coexist with phorid flies so we add the times together two plus twofour to five years minimum to further substantiate this estimate we have evidence of a beetle that would not attack the body for at least three to four years after burial so we can safely say that she was in the ground at least four years maybe as long as five correct dixie hoisted the third jar to eye level and said meet the blue bottle fly the blue bottle lives above ground and lays eggs in decaying flesh these eggs form larval cases that house pupae that grow to adult blue bottles i discovered ten such cases blowfly pupariain the soil samples no colony of blue bottle just ten such larval cases lack of a colony is important the body was exposed to air long enough for the blue bottle to deposit its eggs but not long enough to form a colony that means her body remained above ground for three to four days prior to burial whoever buried her has a strong stomach thats consistent with a veterinarianand he had to have someplace to keep a decaying body for at least four days that didnt raise suspicion he added and thats not easy she wasnt pretty by the time she went in the ground dixon asked you okay boldt said a fouryearold homicide with an unidentified victim its interesting stuff dixie dont get me wrong but its an investigators nightmare and like i said im pressed for time dixon encouraged would i drag you over here for bad news i can give you bad news over the phone would i waste your time he waved boldt out of the room and led him through the offices to a distant storeroom that had recently been converted into an office a video camera atop a tripod was aimed at a skeletal skull that sat on a pedestal in front of a backdrop of white oaktag to the left within range of the camera photographs of women had been tacked to the wall boldt said missing persons yes dixie acknowledged dixie switched on the computer screen caucasian women aged eighteen to twentysix all nearly the same height all went missing not less than four not more than five years ago all remain missing to this day he added as a caveat all but one that awakened boldt gooseflesh raced up an arm and tingled his scalp the screen was divided in half to the left was a freezeframe of this same skull its a new technology developed by the brits were calling cranial imaging it isnt infallible it may not even hold up in our courts but it knocks months off of clay reconstruction we superimpose properly sized images of the missing persons photographs on top of the skull and look for a perfect fit remember all eleven went missing during a sixmonth period four years ago thats where the entomology helped us dixon took control of the computers mouse on the left is a frontal of the skull recovered from the river site on the right a frontal of one peggy shulte she was an averagelooking woman not glamorous not taken to fussing over her looks miss shulte went missing in the tolt river area two years ago not four the county police suspected these were shultes remains but voila the photograph of peggy shulte overlapped with the skull but the fit was bad the shape of the head all wrong dixon made several adjustments attempting to improve the fit no matter how we work this he explained in an excited voice we just cant make them fit see theres no way that this skull we dug up belonged to peggy shulte boldt inched his way up to the edge of his chair we tear peoples lives apart right down to the bone he thought all in an effort to explain their deaths who is she he asked impatiently dixon snapped his head away from the screen light flashed from his excited eyes once again he worked with the keyboard and mouse the photograph of shulte disappeared replaced by a different even more innocentface she had a number below her face how many missing each year boldt wondered knowing that it was so many that the police and fbi flushed their active files after twelve months to make room for the new too many for milk cartons you counted these peoplemostly young women in graves sliding the color photo over the skull dixon said she was number eight of eleven remarkably the two imagesthe face and the skulljoined like a hand inside a glove dixon described the fit in technical detail his finger spitting static sparks as he touched the screen boldt wasnt listening this picture was indeed worth a thousand words one and the same woman dixon concluded proudly this woman went missing while working in the seattle area fiftyone months agowhich fits our window of time furthermore her dental records faxed to us this morning show fillings in the exact same uppers that had been chiseled out from our victims remains this guy would have been smarter to knock out a few other teeth as well as it is in a roundabout way hes actually helped us to identify her by knocking out a few teeth how so by knocking out the same nine teeth dixon pointed at him i knew you would ask me about this picky picky but im prepared for you he fished a piece of notepaper out of his chest pocket i called a mathematician friend at the udubasked him the probability of the same nine teeth and only nine teeth having had dental work you ready for this he slipped on some glasses and read one in twentyeight million fortyeight thousand eight hundred ergo odds are theres only one of her in this city he added lou boldt meet anna ferragot anna boldt said leaning forward he placed a hand on dixons back always a thorough bastard arent you goes with the turf dixon pressed his face close to the screen in a tired but proud voice he said the harvester kept you around for four days and then buried youwhy he harvested your liverfor whom can you help us did you know your killer was he a stranger anna ferragots photo showed her to be an attractive young woman with sandy hair and gentle eyes boldt said i bet you thought we had forgotten all about you guess again said dr ronald dixon elden tegg hugged his wife and kissed her hello despite his ongoing concerns he felt calm he would not allow himself to lose control that was for the little people when he began to feel unstable he fought against it and overcame it strength was everything i like your haircut peggy told him its better for the party her eyes sparkled he knew what this party meant to her even a few days earlier it had still seemed important to him on some level but now for the past few years every cent of his share of the harvest money had been donated to the city artsdance and music mostly large sums of money it made him feel even better about the work save lives and give something back to society what could be better this money from the heart harvest was something altogether different he was at a crossroads now an intersection of past and future where the present took on a dreamlike transitional quality there was so much money at stake hundreds of thousands of dollars enough to buy him a practice if placed in the proper hands his past and present the interdiction of the policepushed him toward this future now as surely as the wind pushed a sailboat toward untraveled waters there were calls to be made plans to be finalized a future set in motion with each step forward his present identity slipped further behind as if he had divided into two people and could actually see his former self receding in the distance growth is change he reminded steeling himself for the immediate challenges that lay ahead this woman this house this existence belonged to that other man now a person he hardly knew at all she said something to him but he missed it he was thinking maybeck had called the office with the message that the truck was fixed it meant that the laptop was taken care of good news in itself but not enough to convince him that things would work out change was in the wind a quick exit was called for all predicated on the harvest taking place he snagged a few pieces of leftover new york steak and tore off bites with his teeth carefully brushing at his beard for errant food particles beards could be dirty and foul if you did not groom properly have you decided a menu he asked attempting to be that other man the other elden tegg he planned to leave behind he didnt care about the menu he cared about the disposal of michael washingtons body but he had a role to playcertain attitudes were expected of him its being catered remember same people as the animal benefit nothing to worry about she informed him im handling the flowers thats all theyre taking care of everything else and the kids what about them she asked she was a nervous creature he found it irritating theyll be introduced of course after drinks but before dinner allow a few minutes in the schedule for thatdo they have to she asked theyre your children theyre a reflection on us both you want this seat on the board dont you he stood there impassively of course they have to she said what am i saying of course they do he agreed you look so tired she said studying him the color of that tie is all wrong youve been working too hard you might want a new pair of shoes at the very least youd better have those shined are you getting enough sleep all those trips out to the farm i feel as if i havent seen you in weeks what are you working on anyway nothing much he mumbled that body had to be dealt with no question about it but how to do it whats that she never seemed to hear anything he said always making him repeat himself he felt it coming thenone of his tics he didnt want it to happen in front of her because it was worse lately and even the small ones terrified her but there it was his head snapped toward his shoulder he recovered quickly but not without an ungainly effort she had the frightened eyes of a stranger would she dare mention it he gained an unusual sense of power from this tic because no one mentioned it have you seen a doctor she asked i am a doctor he was thinking i could burn it i could bury it if you do that at the party of course i wont dismember itbring it to the incinerator as contaminated waste as if you can control it you really should see i am a doctor its nothing a little nervosa is allfatigue besides its not so bad it should be done soon tonight if possible you should stay home tonight you should rest she recommended warmly touching him we could you know its been a long time tonight he gasped other plans oh god here came another one worse than the last triggered by her suggestion no doubt her fault he charged himself with a manufactured anger dont look at me like that he shouted the tic never came he had overpowered it he straightened himself out she was crying she looked pitiful with bloodshot eyes and tearstreaked cheeks ill see someone he lied bury it he thought he believed it best to comfort her before going he might not be back until morning the party will be just fine were both just under some undue pressures thats all nothing we cant handle if you do that at the party cant you take something for it she asked she fueled his anger with such talk drugs he asked medication oddly enough he hadnt considered such a thing its a fine suggestion dear very well i agree you talk to the caterers ill investigate the drugs dont wait up he said he left his house feeling very good indeed in control he had work to do he had a grave to dig sharon shaffer sat in the middle of her kennel pen clutching the recovered needle like a worry bead she kept staring at the stain on the cement where the heart had been for the few seconds before felix consumed it she had been forced to stop conditioning herself to the effects of the shock collar when her neck had swelled up to the point where it nearly cut off her air for a moment about an hour earlier when she had first realized what was happening she had actually debated going on with itsuffocating herself by swelling her neck beyond the tolerance of the collar committing suicide but she had put that consideration behind her by reminding herself of her life on the streets by studying the old scars on both her wrists she had been through the worst and had lived to see another day she looked around her this too shall pass she thought warming the needle awaiting her chance to use it on the keeper she said a series of prayers some for herself some for those she loved she looked at that stain again and said a prayer for the man who had belonged to that heart felix wandered the aisle and occasionally used the waterer in the kennel cage next to her the dog was hungry and tense how would she deal with him even if she managed to blind the keeper and make her break he wore a collar one of the remote devices would control that collar though she wasnt sure where the keeper kept it she was considering all of this when the heater kicked on and warmed her it roared loudly blowing a strong wind into the building as always a few of the dogs one in particular barked at it this only served to make felix more restless his pacing increased she thought it strange that she hardly heard the barking any longer it had become a part of her like the drip of the nourishing iv and the pain in her side that worsened by the hour she was sicker than even he knew practice makes perfect echoed through her mind like a disturbed mantra more than once she found herself with her hands pressing firmly on her chesthiding her heart she knew what he had planned for her the only question remaining was whether or not she could stop him the ground shook the dogs who werent barking came to their feet and began to pace they knew the sound of his car engine even at an incredible distance shuddering from fear she turned to face the door and like the others in this building waited for it to open tegg was running late delayed by his wife and her plans for tomorrow nights party he wanted to get started with this well before dark and that meant he would have to hurry deep in the trees there was a ninetyminute dusk leading up to sunset when the grayness of the air blended images making it difficult to see he intended to capitalize on that time period he intended to dig a grave there were other ways to dispose of a body he might have dismembered washington sealed the various pieces in the red contaminated waste bags and left them for maybeck or one of the other chuck wagons to incinerate but that would have required transporting the five or six bags back to the clinic offloading them storing them in the walkinall elements that afforded too much risk he might have built a large bonfire and incinerated it himself in fact he had given a great deal of thought to this possibility but had decided against it on the off chance that such a large fire might attract the attention of someone beyond teggs controloverflying aircraft another hikeragain too much risk in the end he had decided to repeat himself the banks of the tolt had kept anna ferragot cozy these last four years the soil there dug easilythough not without effortand what was good for one was certainly good for another he backed the isuzu up to the cabins cellar door and spent fifteen minutes struggling with michael washingtons rigid cadaver finally depositing him in the back where he covered him with a blanket he was losing light given the time restraints it wouldnt be nearly as deep a grave as it had been four years agotwo feet three at the most wearing a handkerchief across his mouth and nose he set off all windows down as fast as he dared to drive three roads six turns and two logging roads later he was driving alongside the south bank of the north fork of the tolt river trying to remember where it was that the road fell away toward the river steeply enough that he could launch the cadaver in order to get it near the bank right along here somewhere suddenly he noticed the enormous number of tracks in this roada deepwoods logging road that only saw a minor amount of traffic even in the peak of octobers hunting season it struck him as strangely curious then just as quickly he realized he had reached the perfect spot the tire tracks widened here spreading all over the road and it took another second or two for him to realize that there had been dozens of vehicles parked here and by the look of those tracks quite recently then he saw the bright orange tape stretched between several consecutive trees with the boldly printed warning king county police deptdo not cross instinctively he slammed on the brakes the troopers wheels locked and the back end skidded out of control his heart pounded ferociously in his chest the vehicle drifted toward the edge of the road toward the trees and the steep incline he could just imagine himself getting the car stuck right here a dead man in the back once again his reactions were well behind his thoughts he released the brakes overcorrected the wheel applied some gas and lost the tail end once again it slid so far to the left that it smacked into and bounced off of one of the trees actually breaking the police tape from this tree he saw the tape flapping like a flag in the rearview mirror his only saving grace was that there was no one here they had packed up and left he did manage one quick glimpse of the area below just enough to confirm his fearsthe entire area was excavated including one massive hole the location of which he recognized all this brought back memories rushing as quickly as the dangerous waters of the river below this grave was the secret that maybeck had held over him these last four years tegg could recall the day with an alarming vividness anna unaware of her mistake had neglected to latch one of the dog pens unlike pamela who had all the right instincts anna could never get close to the dogs could never speak their language could not control them by tone of voice and attitude she had been attacked from the back while tegg was out of earshot and by the time he did hear it was too late or was it he remembered thinking at the time the most important part of her had survived could he waste that after the harvest he had to dispose of what was left of her or face unanswerable questions he had driven out here with her body selecting a burial site that assured him what he thought was complete privacy and being near the water promised a quick and thorough decay what he had mistakenly overlooked on that day was the construction of a highvoltage power line nearly a mile away a young man named donald maybeck had been atop one of those tall towers performing labor for norwest light and power looking out over this most secluded of spots a streetwise maybeck sensing easy money quickly drove to this site rather than to the police and confronted tegg offering to remain silent for a price that uneasy partnership had continued to this very day and now the secret had been dug up by the police maybecks doing had he cut a deal with the police for the next few minutes tegg drove fast putting as much distance between himself and that site as he could manage as if hoping to drive away from his past later he didnt remember the driving or the turns he had made just that gaping hole in the riverbank he refused to backtrack he didnt know the area well enough and he got himself lost several times trying to find an alternative route there were so many thoughts banging around his brain so many internal voices arguing that he couldnt hear himself think couldnt sort them out every thought an explosion every conceivable explanation terrifying somewhere along the way he had rolled all the windows up leaving himself enveloped in the nauseating smell of the decaying body he pulled off the road hurried into the bushes and vomited from the odor or from nerves he couldnt remember vomiting in the last twenty years what was happening to him he didnt know himself anymore and what about that thing in the back he asked himself maybe a bonfire was the answer after all boldt carrying miles in the sling found shoswitz on the third floor of an old brick icehouse that had been converted into the body shop a fitness center that provided everything from a lap pool to hightech game rooms it was located only a few blocks away from bloodlines and boldt couldnt help but think about the donor agency and the parade of twentyeight young victims who had passed through its doors spd had a contractual agreement with the body shop that allowed cops and civilian employees a discounted rate to use the facilities boldt passed a weight room crowded with the afterwork set grunting and sweating young finely tuned women wearing dayglo lycra like a second skin he passed a stepaerobics class voyeuristically pausing to watch these people looked too good to be working out he was the one who needed the aerobics but he wouldnt be caught dead in a tshirt and gym shorts in the company of people in this kind of shape he came here armed with the most recent information and evidence to seek shoswitzs help the lieutenant ever skeptical of the harvester investigation and always politically sensitive to his own position in the department would not be an easy sell all that boldt needed was for the man to place a single phone call it had to be made by shoswitz because only he had the necessary contact inside us immigration but to ask him outright to make that call was certain to fail boldt had to trick him he had to lead him into it he had to make shoswitz offer to make the call on the third floor alongside an office door marked private were three doors each individually marked in computer graphics golf tennis and baseball he didnt have to guess behind which one he would find phil shoswitz he knocked and entered stopping abruptly the room was small and dark he was standing on the playing field at yankee stadium the yankee stadium a series of surround screens filled his vision the rich green playing field seemingly stretching for acres the spectator stands rising into the imaginary sky the player shoswitz stood inside a chainlink wire box that had been painted black so you couldnt see it well in the relative darkness a pitcher surprisingly realstood out on the mound oh its you the helmeted shoswitz said looking impossibly foolish whatsamatter never seen this before the japs are geniuses they call it virtual reality thats tommy john out there or at least his stats and thats the real yankee stadium he tripped a button on the floor the pitcher on the mound wound up and delivered the pitch a hardball came flying through an unseen hole in the projection screen boldt jumped aside not realizing the chainlink fence would have stopped the ball if shoswitz hadnt connected well the sound of bat against ball made miles jump but surprisingly he didnt cry a born fan the ball flew toward the screens projections hit a net and fell to the floor with a thud simultaneously the image of a baseball in the same trajectory was picked up in the screen it flew in an arc into shallow left field where it dropped and rolled base hit shoswitz announced proudly the roar of approval from fifty thousand electronic fans filled unseen speakers a scoreboard far in the distance registered the hit as a baserunner reached first base and removed his batting gloves japs are incredible arent they you ever seen the golf saw it in a movie once fuckin incredible you can field too you know play a position like shortstop genius you dont catch any hits but when you throw the ball the screen registers how accurate you were this time of year the weather like it is this thing keeps you polishedknow what i mean can we put it on pause or something miles caught boldt by the lip and tugged you kidding you know what they hit me up for thisabove and beyond my regular fees a good chunk of change kiddo no way ill keep hitting you talk if thats what you came for please no fucking way talk he tripped the button on the floor and hit a foul ball you can change pitchers if you like stadiums too but i love the old yankee stadium dont you no thanks boldt said misunderstanding this as an invitation and not knowing the names of more than two or three pitchers most of them hopelessly out of date the bones we dug up alongside the tolt river have been positively identified as those of a woman named anna ferragot old news lou whats your point im busy here he turned and eyed miles like an unwelcome guest lamoia just got a peek at anna ferragots state tax records that caused shoswitz to turn his headsuch records were not easy to come by boldt continued for the two years prior to her disappearance anna ferragot was employed by the tender care animal clinic shoswitz swung and missed the ball crashed loudly into the protective cage shoswitz gave boldt an angry look boldt didnt like competing with a batting machine but this couldnt wait until morning sharon shaffer had less than fortyeight hours her chances of survival diminished with every passing hour boldt reminded the suture dixies pathology report did you happen to read that miles leaned forward groping for the cage where are you going with this going veterinarians tender care animal clinic the suture used in the harvests points to a veterinarian so does the use of ketamine this same suture is used in every hospital in this county animal and human do you read your own reports but the size of the suture indicates a vet and ketamine is never used on adults the effects of ketamine were broadcast into the homes of thirtyfive million americans listen its good police work lou im not knocking that i think we put a vet at the top of our list but none of this proves anything you want to talk to the people at this tender care animal clinic about anna ferragot i got no problem with that but talk is all until and unless you have something more were not going to get a searchandseizure based on this he swung and missed again youre fucking with my average here damn it all are we through here if not get to the point he couldnt get to the point that was the point he had to take it stepbystep leading the lieutenant into his trap shoswitz tripped the pitching switch a ball flew at him he fouled into the stands boldt and his son waited him out some guy in the stands to the far left was wandering the aisles selling either hot dogs or popcorn it made boldt hungry he couldnt remember the last time he had eaten a real meal he hadnt seen lizawakesince their encounter at the big joke although a mostly form letter about her meeting with the irs a meeting he had missed had been left for him on the kitchen table between back taxes and penalties they owed the irs seventythree hundred dollars for them in their present financial condition it might as well have been a million he intended to talk to the credit union as soon as possible shoswitz struck out he flashed boldt an angry look and asked how many vets in this tender care clinic four years ago note that the date coincides exactly with the disappearance of anna ferragot there were three partners in the practice they broke it up two of them went their separate ways three clinics now tender care lakeview animal clinic and north main animal center so if youre right about thisand theres no saying you arethe cutter could be one of those three vets so you and lamoia nose around a little you shake them up i just told you i have no problem with that asking questions isnt going to do any good i need to kick the place i need to locate a pair of snippers that did both anna ferragot and peter blumenthal thats our hard evidence phil thats our way to lock this guy up to stop him while sharon shaffer is still alive shoswitz stopped batting he asked were ferragots tax records obtained legally you know they werent a formal request to the irs can take weeks we dont have weeks theyre your only link to this animal clinic i take it so in point of fact youve got zilch shoswitz tripped the pitching switch again high and inside he swung and missed for no reason at all miles shrieked at the top of his lungs shoswitz scowled look at it this way boldt said amiably you can blame all your strikes on miles and me dont think i wont shoswitz hit a grounder past third and seemed pleased with it boldt played with his sons fingers attempting to distract him shoswitz wanted them out of there good he took his foot off the pitchers switch turned to boldt and said youve been away from this too long lou youve gone soft whats the next step think about it the lecture mode perfect you need warrants right either that or youre talking about bringing these vets in and chatting them up and we both agree thats no good am i right so if youre going to get paper on this youve got to have probable cause youve got to have a nice clean chain of evidence and what have you got youve got squat some suture some drug thats been on minutes come on fouryearold skeletal remains what exactly which judge were you going to take this to or maybe you intended to run it by bob proctor our broomuptheass prosecuting attorney you know what bob would do hed laugh you right out of that office swear to god as soswitz turned to face the plate boldt smiled behind his back daphne had coached him on how to handle the lieutenant let him be right let him tell you what you need boldt said we have those tool markings linking the victims if we could only raid all three vet clinics at the same time if we come up with the surgical shears responsible for those tool markings weve got a conviction youre ahead of yourself shoswitz advised its a catch lou you need those shears in order to obtain the necessary warrants to find those shears come on you cant conduct searchandseizures based on hunches i shouldnt have to be telling you this we shouldnt be having this conversation im saving you from eating a lot of crow you know that he swung again cracked one way the hell out there the automated crowd let out a deafening cheer but you see how close we are boldt encouraged what more do we need youre close yes but youre not there you need a witnessan employee maybe boldt heaved a sigh of relief he was so close now a little more what about those numbers in the database shoswitz asked were they flight numbers as you suggested maybeck and that databasenow there is some good evidence fuckin judges and juries just love anything to do with computers can you link that to any of these vets you do that youre one step closer this was the reason for boldts being here without knowing it shoswitz had stepped into the trap each of the fourdigit numbers that are unique to the laptop database corresponds to a northwest airlines international flight that originates in vancouver bc over a dozen flights but to only two countries argentina and brazil both are known markets for donor kidneys the fact that all the flights are with the same two carriers indicates a courier the lieutenant answered a flight attendant a pilot someone handcarrying the organs for them shoswitz lost interest in the baseball boldt felt his skin prickle so close now exactly they arranged and kept track of the flights well ahead of schedule because time is an issue with these organs if we identify this courier youve got your witness we just might bust this thing boldt could hear the door of his trap slamming shut shoswitz was starting to see frontpage headlines close but no cigar boldt said shoswitz considered this challenge he said there may be two couriers one transporting the organs between here and vancouver and then passing the thing off to a second who carries it onto an international flight the international courier would never know the harvesters identity the harvester remains insulated boldt agreed but more importantly they get the organ to someone who is acceptable for bringing in an organ flight crew personnel courier unos organs all the time passengers never do which means we need this other courier the one making the trips between seattle and vancouver it would be a courier wouldnt it if they shipped the organs theyd leave a paper trail agreed abandoning the bat shoswitz tripped some buttons the screen died and the lights came on compared to yankee stadium this room was tiny shoswitz looked foolish in his batting helmet and scuffed wing tips boldt explained quickly we need to identify any passenger who is making roundtrips to vancouver on the dates of the harvests were lucky there because the dates are in the database shoswitz was catching on he said youve already done this havent you we ran maybecks name firsti was all but positive that he was the courier he was the one with the laptop with the database but i was wrong we came up blank its not maybeck we ran the names of the three vetsalso blank i want to run the names of the employees at all three clinics next past and presentthrough the air carrier manifest lists but its an enormous job dozens of carriers dozens of dates its a logistical nightmare is it even possible the courier would travel under a different name each time wouldnt he pay cash travel light not different names were lucky there seatac to vancouver is internationalyou have to show legal identification that helps massaging his elbow shoswitz asked what about driving it takes too long every hour counts with these organs youre warm boldt wanted to say checking flight manifests for a name common between them how many carriers between here and vancouver a dozen more how many flights a day fifty sixty how long to crosscheck them all jesus a week a month id say anna ferragot died for nothing were no fucking closer shoswitz displayed the same frustrations that boldt had felt daphne had anticipated this according to her this was the turning point impossible shoswitz mumbled but if we were to narrow the field boldt suggested he actually crossed his fingers he couldnt remember the last time he had done that miles started kicking why are you looking at me like that shoswitz asked sensing he was missing something give me a second just give me a fucking second seattle to vancouver boldt hinted shoswitz didnt want any hints he glared at boldt then snapped his fingers in realization immigration we can search the feds immigration computersits a single database we can search by date by the names of the clinic employees we dont have to deal with a dozen different carriers how hard can that be how long could that take a matter of minutes if we go in the back door this was boldts moment of glory shoswitz had arrived boldt said its the federal government its red tape a mile long if we go after it legally it could take weeks months even why not an end run shoswitz asked boldt thought why not such tactics were fairly common practice you asked a contact at a credit agency or the phone companyor immigrationto do a search for you if something useful was discovered you were told to make it a formal request knowing in advance that the formal request would net what you were after it saved you from jumping through all the legal hoops only to come up dry shoswitz finally understood finally saw his role in all of this you want me to make the call is that it for boldt it was like fireworks going off a home run youre the only one with the necessary contacts at immigration i dont have them lamoia doesnt but you do i know you dont like this kind of thing phil but we need some help here boldt had daphne to thank for this this technique had been all her doing shoswitz said you could have just asked you know boldt offered an inquisitive expression the lieutenant considered this a moment no he conceded i suppose not miles squirmed he clapped his hands against boldts chest boldt said lamoias working on getting the employee lists three clinics in all tender care north main and lakeview with any luck we should have those names by morning thursday february am with one day in which to find sharon alive daphne having slept for only three hours marched into boldts office at seven oclock thursday morning and announced we overlooked something wearing the same clothes as the day before boldt looked up from his desk with glassy eyes and replied i wouldnt doubt it i know how to identify the harvester he sat up suddenly more alert and watched as she passed by him heading directly to one of several large stacks of paperwork didnt you pull the drivers licenses on the three tender care vets other stack he directed but its no good shoswitz agrees that wed be tipping our hand that wed give the harvester a chance to close up shop to destroy evidence if we interview them although the way maybeck behaved with the laptop im starting to think were already too late its not an interview im after she dug through the next pile over and extricated three sheets of paper he can tell us who he is without our ever asking a question she added the thing is dixie told us the harvester is lefthanded remember we werent thinking but how his signature dummy she placed the first sheet in front of him it showed a poorquality photocopy of a drivers license complete with name address height weight eye color and identification number her fingernail ran across the signature righthanded she stated see the slant to the characters and the way the dot on the t trails to the right she placed the next sheet in front of boldt she was leaning in close to him and he could smell the shampoo in her hair another rightie she declared hes the one who retained the tender care name isnt he yeah but i dont see how she interrupted again this is my training lou not yours she delivered the last sheet to the table her finger traced along the signature a leftie see the posture of the t and the v its him reading the name from the license boldt asked elden tegg how sure are you about this rightie leftie business put him under surveillance she instructed taking charge i am going to find out who the hell this bastard is at eight fortyfive she reentered boldts office and took a seat across from him dr elden tegg is canadian by birtha us citizen now you want to guess what city in canada hes from when he failed to answer her she said vancouver and left it hanging in the air like a bomb how do you know any of this he asked skeptically she slid the faxes over to him her heart beating quickly just got these she could feel boldts anticipation hes a boardcertified veterinarian i obtained his curriculum vitae from the seattle veterinary medical association it gets real interesting on page two prior to veterinarian school here in washington elden tegg attended medical school in vancouver as in humans boldts eyes were as wide as saucers as in he didnt make it through his residency which is not unusual in itself the dropout rate being what it is he came down here to seattle and studied to be a veterinarianalso not that unusual but it sure as hell fits the profile page three theres a doctor listed as an attending physician dr stanley millingsford lives outside vancouver i called him what is unusual about elden tegg is that he was at the very top of his class he didnt leave his residency he was asked to leave dr millingsford was reluctant to give me that in fact dr millingsford is an ardent supporter of elden tegg or was until i told him about the nature of our investigation she added would you like to guess elden teggs special interest in residency boldt answered transplants she nodded transplantation surgery millingsford is willing to talk but not over the phone he has a dislike of phones understanding her situation boldt stated you need a travel voucher signed by shoswitz youre such a good cop she said weve established surveillance of the clinic and teggs residence youre on your way now she jumped up they stood only inches apart it seemed he might try to kiss her something inside her hoped that he might at least hug her but the moment passed he hurried out the door running toward the lieutenants office lieutenant she heard him shout weve got him nestled in a shoreline forest of giant cedar madronas and pine dr stanley millingsfords gray clapboard home was surrounded by a wroughtiron fence with a stone pillar gate it had a horseshoe driveway made of crushed stone and gave daphne the impression of an english manor house as the taxi dropped her off she faced a ninefoothigh black lacquer door with a polished brass knocker in the shape of a half moon the sun shone brightly but was not hot she tapped the moon gently against a polished brass star mrs stanley millingsford who introduced herself as marion was in her late sixties with pale blue eyes she wore a riding outfit complete with high black boots she led daphne into the cozy living room where a fire burned in the large fireplace she seemed upset with daphne coming here bothering her husband and she communicated this in a single intense expression she offered tea an went o to prepare it before daphne had a chance to answer dr millingsford walked with a cane he wore a blue blazer khakis white socks and corduroy slippers a pair of bifocals protruded from the pocket of his stewart plaid shirt he had silvergray hair and eyes the same color as his wifes he motioned daphne to the couch and took the leather wingback chair by the fire for himself he placed his bad leg on a footstool and leaned the cane within reach sorry to make you come all this way she didnt say anything he had that air about him you didnt interrupt his thoughts your generation is more comfortable with the telephone than mine he sounded american not canadian but she wasnt going to ask elden tegg he said yes organ harvesting he glanced at the fire which organs he asked kidneys lungs we think it is mostly kidneys two of the victims are missing a kidney victims at least three of the donors hemorrhaged and died he lost some of his color and looked at her gravely he was asked to leave his residency she reminded him yes he collected his thoughts you dont forget a man like elden tegg there arent many that good which makes them stand out all the more i dont mean just talent talent and intelligence abound in the residency programs but rare is the individual who rolls the two together and achieves something of a higher level from this combination call it creativity call it confidencewhen you see it you know elden tegg has as sure a pair of hands as i have ever seen brilliant control he had the eyethats the thing so many lack oh theyve read all the texts they are founts of technical information but they cant see a surgeon must be able to see that which is there not just that problem for which he operates but everything elden tegg has such an eye and the hands to go along with it but while he was with us he had something else ambition the wheels of education moved too slowly for him he sensed his greatness he wanted everything wanted it all more than anything he wanted acceptance from his peers he wanted to belong it wasnt difficult to see that he was the freak the whiz kid and he suffered for it millingsfords wife entered with a rolling tray containing a cozied teapot cups and saucers a lemon poppyseed cake and small plates youll have to fend for yourselves im afraid im awfully sorry we have a sick foal i must attend she explained she left daphne poured them both tea and cut some cake for him he chewed some cake looking into the fire have you met him tegg no his problemand this is a problem with nearly every surgeon including this oneis his ego he keeps his nose high he was quick to put people down he intimidated most everyone around him that had its plusseshe effectively controlled everyone and that sense of leadership is important for any surgeon the surgeon must be in control everyone must know it must feel it he glanced at her here he was in control the incident that led to his expulsion is what i wanted to talk to you about we had an open heart to do tegg was to assist i was delayed by another surgery across town the patient was submariningwe were losing him quickly i was nowhere to be found tegg informed the nursing staff that i had okayed his beginning the procedure without me he lied no such conversation had ever taken place as i have said he controlled the nurses they went along with it tegg accepted full responsibility taking charge was one of his long suits when you perform open heart or any invasive thoracic surgery he continued you open the chest cavity with something called a sternal saw its a very useful toolthe sawing used to be done by hand its tricky however you must maintain an upward pressure at all timesthats the way the blade works his hands flexed as he spoke in my absence tegg mishandled the sternal saw he severed the left ventricle killing the patient naturally tegg was asked to leave and was told in no uncertain terms that he would never be accepted in any residency program if he applied all would be revealed he went on to veterinarian schooli wrote a recommendation for him was he ever charged for that killing this is medicine miss matthews it wasnt murder it was a mistake mistakes happen there were no lawsuits yes there was a lawsuit thats one of the reasons he was dismissed the school had to dismiss him immediately in an attempt to defend its position on this to clarify it that is precisely why no other program would have ever taken him she took some notes while her thoughts were still fresh she looked up and asked do you remember the patients name the one who was killed you dont forget an incident like that he explained his name was thomas kent she wrote this down as well she underlined it thomas kent p m when daphne cleared the jetway at seatac airport she saw lou boldt and an airport security patrolman anxiously awaiting her standing away from the steady stream of departing passengers boldt reached out took her briefcase in one hand and her upper arm in another they walked fast he steered her over to a shuttle cart that was waiting for them the air was electric with urgency sharons time was running out boldt said maybecks cooling his heels in interrogation shoswitz wants you part of it before she had a chance to ask he answered he was busted at a dog fight by the county police who werent aware of our investigation or our surveillance its a mess theres a lot of screaming going on they climbed onto the cart and it hurried off almost before she sat down throwing her into the seat she said were running out of time you know that dont you were taking an amphibian to lake union to save time tractor trailer carrying chemicals overturned on traffics been diverted to nothing is moving theres an hour delay at least dont look at me it was phils idea the lieutenant spending money she said over the repetitious beeping of the carts pedestrian warning system theres a rumor going around that one of the church groups pressured the mayor about sharons whereabouts whatever happened the lid is coming off this thing king radio ran a story about our finding remains along the tolt theyre trying to draw green river comparisons were sitting on the rest of it but phil suddenlywants results its about time boldt said yes that is what its about the cart pulled up at gate a where a charter pilot awaited them daphne handed her keys over to the airport security man who was going to return her car to the department boldt and the pilot shook hands the three of them hurried down a flight of stairs and out to the waiting plane with its overhead engine wheels and short pontoons the plane looked so tiny compared with the huge jetliners daphne shut her eyes in terror as they landed on lake union seven minutes later from the plane they were chauffeured in a patrolcar sitting in the back contained by a cage the doors without handles you know in seven years ive never ridden back here she said it had been too loud to talk on the plane in a strained voice boldt informed her immigrations computers kicked dozens of names we failed to realize how many commuters travel between the two cities on a daily basis its a long list and its going to be a bitch sorting it out to make matters worse weve been unable to get a list of the various employees and thats the first list we wanted to check immigration against one step forward two steps back doin the policemans polka he said making her smile the car braked severely she looked up to see they were already at the public safety building the driver let them out boldt was still carrying her briefcase the frantic pace lent an urgency that she now felt physically as well she was taking short quick breaths her heart was racing shoswitz met them on the ground floor the driver must have called in their position this kind of treatment was heady shoswitz wouldnt allow anyone else on the elevator with them as the three of them ascended the lieutenant asked boldt well shes pretty much up to date what can you tell us about tegg the lieutenant asked her and i want it all guesses hunches anything ive got a meeting with the captain in he checked his watch ten minutes go she had tried to bring her thoughts together on the flight down from vancouver these last few minutes had rattled her the elevator car reached the fourth floor shoswitz hit the stop button preventing the doors from opening he was waiting for her to brief him she said quickly tegg is a paranoid hes running from his past trying to prove himself in his mind hes better than everyone yet everyones against him outwardly he could very well be joe normal a good doctor a good husband a good father but inside hes paranoid he thinks of everyone as inferior to him he tolerates them but thats all hes quick to blame and he has an explanation for everything hes mr right mr perfect by now hes found some way to put a twist on his killing a man named thomas kentkilled him in surgerybut half of him knows that this twist is a lie that hes lying to himself and thats been eating away at him a long long time how dangerous shoswitz asked to our people violent i doubt it but hes worth being afraid of he was at the top of his class so hes plenty brainy he has a scientific mind which means hell think in patterns and subsets very linear and logical hes always two or three steps aheadin his thoughts in his surgery in his life hes likely to be obsessivevery few hobbies or distractions to take him away from his work hes a control freak millingsford said he used to intimidate the nurses that they were afraid of him and that fits with what im thinking he still intimidates his coworkers hes likely to be exceptionally strongminded strongwilled but psychologically speaking his strengths are his weaknesses they can be exploited the lieutenant nodded and looked up at boldt okay he asked any questions okay with me she grabbed shoswitz by the arm it was the wrong thing to do we have to bypass the red tape lieutenant we have to go straight at this guy and fast shoswitz pulled his arm free reached down and punched the emergency stop button the doors slid open unexpectedly they were showered in a blinding array of camera flashes and a dozen questions being shouted at them simultaneously shoswitz and boldt contained daphne between them and the three of them arms raised fending off the lights surged through the throng of reporters no comment shoswitz kept shouting back as they pushed into homicide the press was kept at bay shoswitz issued orders to the first patrolman he encountered i want them kept in the press room understand not up here to boldt he said i gotta leave you two now to daphne he said this is where you earn your meal ticket matthews we need to break this guy we need for him to give us tegg in a handbasket youre the one who said it your friend sharon is running out of time she wanted to hit him for saying that where had he been this last week dont worry about him boldt said as shoswitz hurried out of earshot im not worried about him she said they reached the oneway glass that looked in on interrogation room a its him im wondering about on the other side of the glass sat donald monroe maybeck boldt had never seen teeth like that he and daphne studied maybeck through the oneway glass boldt said as far as he knows all we have him on is the gaming charge the pit bulls but the other arrests were allowed to post bail immediately so hes got to be wondering why hes still here teeth like a junkyard dog a grotesque gray brown despite the nosmoking sign he smoked a nonfilter cigarette holding the smoke in so long that when he finally exhaled it left as a thin gray ghost we can book him on a list of charges but none of them except this pit bull fight is going to stick and its a misdemeanor the laptop was out of his possessionwe a bunch of cops witnessed it being stolen he or an attorney can use that to his advantage even with the password he can claim someone put that database onto the laptop while it was out of his possession things like that are tricky to prove proctor wont go for it i promise you im betting he killed connie chi but we have yet to connect him to it id has that condom has the sperm we can make like were going to run a dna typing we can humiliate him make him jackoff for the lab boys but proof a match maybe maybe not what id like to do is wear him down crack him open and get a full confession on his involvement with tegg and his murdering connie chi slamdunk him and we both do the questioning she asked he nodded a vague smile flickered across her lips what do you say i get to play tough she unbuttoned the top button of her blouse boldt thought so shes breaking out the serious hardware sounds good to me she waited for him to open the door for her he did so and said after you put out the cigarette she ordered as she and boldt came through the door you maybeck let slip recognizing boldt from the pawn shop encounter this was the fun part for her this was where it became interesting it wasnt quite a game but it was close maybeck looked up at her drank in every curve of her body and left his eyes boring a hole in her crotch so she would feel it so he knew how to play the game too so what he smiled his teeth looked like a rusted garden rake you hit guys like this you hit them head on nice teeth she said she turned to set her case down turned to prevent him from trying to vent his anger by communicating with his eyes turned as she did unbuttoned two more buttons so that by the time she swung back around her blouse sagged open revealing enough cleavage to get lost in she knew the maybecks of this world she worked with them if men wanted to use her sex against her then she would use it right back when lous eyes fell for the trick as well producing a momentary flash of embarrassment in him when their eyes met she knew she had scored a direct hit maybeck wouldnt be able to resist the distraction it was a cheap stunt nothing more who cared maybeck was punk trash shed seen a photo of connie chi taken on her last day on earth it was enough motivation one thing good about correctional institutions she said looking him directly in the eye they have free dental service he didnt flinch stronger than she had expected test and probe he kept his lips pinched tightly shut goodembarrassed ashamed even nothing as strong as shame to turn the vise his eyes strayed to her chest again so she leaned forward to allow her blouse to hang open giving him a nice long look nice tits for a cop he said striking back you fuck your way to the top or what it knocked her back a step when her eyes met his again she introduced boldt with you guys never officially met i dont think this is sergeant lou boldt homicide leaning on the word as well as the table then she saw in him what she had wanted to see more than a flicker of panic she buttoned herself back up you want to tell us about bloodlines boldt asked clearly knocking the wind out of maybeck or do you want to do the dance you look a little old for dancing maybeck said her shes okay have you fucked her yet boldt raised his hand to strike the man but caught himself that was what maybeck wanted a way to beat the legal system she said quickly yeah the dental work is free in the big house but so are the condoms its kind of a tradeoff depends how keen you are on hiv some people say aids was invented just to keep the prison populations down come on man hit me he baited boldt warned him were the front line pal were the ones who will listen the next line of defense is the attorneys then come the judges and the jurors the witnesses maybe connie chis sister would make a good witness she threw in just to catch his reaction real shame about connie boldt edged closer inmate nice ring to it daphne said worried boldt might hit him anyway boldt was supposed to play nice guy she would play toughthe exact opposite of what maybeck might expect toy with his sensibilities turn him upside down and shake boldt looked over at her and rolled his eyes he was back in control now she hoped he was good at this better than most because he didnt believe he was any good at it and that made him work harder something daphne appreciated he listened he learned he knew to meet the suspect in the middle to establish a rapport to mimic body language and avoid any outward display of judgment you face a very important decision boldt cautioned him because the way you play this can mean a difference of years for you years maybeck got it you may want to think about that maybe i want to call me an attorney you were given your phone call dont hose me friend im telling you were the best chance youre going to get maybeck said to her you sure dont look like no cop if daphne answered and you dont look very smart mr maybeck but i hope im wrong about that we can connect you to bloodlines we can connect you to connie chi we can connect you to that database twentyseven harvests three of them are deaddid you know that chew on that with those pretty teeth of yours i think im through talking he said suddenly restless a good sign his veneer was cracking you stop talking and youre through all right she said quickly boldt repeated once the attorneys get into this its out of our hands you understand when have attorneys ever made things simple if you play dumb daphne said you are dumb talk to us boldt encouraged tell us about tegg you give us tegg you may just walk away from this maybeck glanced back and forth between the two of them this was the best sign yet indecision filled his eyes which to daphne indicated a vulnerability and dictated different tactics are you prepared to take the heat for teggs crimes she asked to boldt she said i dont know maybe he should wait for his attorney because if thats the way he plays this hes certainly going to need one boldt said were not running a tape recorder have you noticed that daphne cautioned boldt hes not smart enough to understand any of this i told you he was a dumb shit i can spot em lou youre gonna have to cough up that twenty youre betting on me maybeck asked incredulously betting is for vice she advised him sergeant boldt is homicide maybe you missed that the first time around you think hes here to discuss a pit bull fight christ all friday get a clue tell us about bloodlines you got the donors for tegg you offered them cash for their kidneys and they bit you delivered them to tegg is that about right because if it is then youve got to think this through donnie can i call you donnie you dont mind because you can trade that down to bullshit even a firstyear pd can get you out of that see but kidnapping interstate transportation of stolen goodsthose are federal charges thats fbi shit thats threepiece suits and wingtip shoes you know what youre getting yourself into for what talk to me use your head donnie and talk to me please not this one daphne said hes too stupid look at those teeth would you that ought to tell you something shit for brains the next thing hes going to hear is metal on metal boom that doors going to shut for a long long time up yours he said oh no not in the big house not up mine though theyll tell you its just as nice its up yours gatemouth and its not very pleasant that shut him up boldt was blushing maybeck had allowed his mouth to hang open and his teeth to show i bet you like it he said she struck him she openhanded him right across the cheek he smiled dont forget asshole she said angrily this is all off the record his smile faded boldt said in the eyes of the law teggs crimes are your crimes it is important that you understand that do you see any tape recorder donnie it is off the record were giving you the benefit of the doubt were giving you a chance all we want right now is a little cooperation we want tegg she explained not you maybeck said through his gray teeth i can smell you from here daphne reached down and found some control teggs using you he uses everybody doesnt he she tried a different tack how much does he pay you whats he told you a kidney is worth you know what they pay for them in argentina egypt india between five and fifteen thousand she saw the devastating effect this had on him when all else fails play to a persons greed how much of that did you see what do you owe him the remaining years of your natural life because thats what youre looking at boldt advised how do you think the law reads when it comes to performing surgery without a license tegg knows exactly how it reads were not even sure we can hold him for that get it why do you think he has you and the others doing his dirty work who do you think is going down now that weve busted this thing him no way why do you think we were interested in talking to you first before the serious charges let me tell you something she said the smart ones talk you may not think so but thats the way it works the dumb shits end up investing in a couple cases of condoms and praying like hell they can convince the gorillas inside to use one once in a while she added you havent done time in this state donald we know that we pulled your prints off the laptop we know that four years ago you worked for norwest power and light we know you havent filed a tax return but she caught herself and stopped maybeck had lost a full shade of color was it the mention of doing time or the mention of the power company that had that effect on him you got me mixed up with someone else he said she fired right back what is it donnie what is it youre hiding i got a right to an attorney dont i so give me one i got nothing to say to you boldt said whos running the organs up to vancouver for tegg a sharp knock on the door caught all three of them by surprise the door opened the man standing there was all brooks brothersall business all attorney he stretched his arm to boldt first and then to daphne she resented that howard chamberland he introduced himself daphne was thinking the howard chamberland where did scum like maybeck get money for those kinds of fees she couldnt believe it a moment earlier maybeck had been asking to be assigned an attorney what was going on here chamberland chided boldt i had heard such good things about you i hadnt expected something as cheap as this a little gaming some dog fighting youa homicide lieutenant sergeant boldt corrected youve been speaking with him i presume he shook his head in disgust you can forget all that now of course you would be wise to forget the charges pit bulls what are we talking here a hundred dollars and animal confiscation what are you the aspca come on whatever your intentions you had better speak to bob proctor i certainly am going to as soon as i am done here are you bringing additional charges against my client your client boldt asked at your fee or are you doing charity work now my relationship with donald is confidential daphne said it must be he doesnt like that name has anyone even introduced you two to maybeck she said you called tegg didnt you but she watched chamberland for a reaction he was expressionlessworth every penny daphne felt the frustration as a knot in her throat so close what were sharons chances now boldt said a few minutes ago your client was requesting to see a public defender mr chamberland are you sure you have the right man are you asked the attorney holding the door open for them waiting for them to leave as boldt and daphne headed down the narrow hallway leading from interrogation lamoia rushed toward them waving a pink telephone memo his face a youthful combination of fatigue and exhilaration before the detective reached them shoswitz appeared behind him at the main door and shouted loudly everybodyand i mean everybody but uniformsin the situation room now no tears he emphasized meaning he would take no excuses i dont like the sound of that boldt warned i dont like a sharpshooter with chamberlands reputation representing maybeck she added hes a heavy hitter agreed weve lost maybeck im about to scream better not boldt happened to catch the lieutenants eye just a fleeting glimpse that caused him to make an aside to daphne were baked he had worked with shoswitz for over eleven of his seventeen years with the department and had learned to measure even the slightest nuance in his expression such a sixth sense was a prerequisite to a successful career in homicide it told you when to shut up and when to push hard this was one of the times to shut up i think youre right the last time he called for all of us she reminded was that neonazi thing three years ago lamoia shoswitz chastised stopping the man the situation room is the other way i said nowill lamoia switched directions abruptly he shoved the memo into his pocket the two sergeants increased their strides attempting to catch up with lamoia they entered the large open room with its folding chairs and tables daphne rushed to a spot along the wall closest to the rooms only other door hoping to sneak out if necessary shoswitz could be longwinded sharon couldnt afford longwinded the room was in a temporary state of chaos as investigators of all ranks flooded the seats and established leaning zones there were two other women in the room besides daphne both detectives bobbie gaynes and anita desilva the two women on loan from sexual assault for the pawn shop sting were back on their regular assignments sit down and put a lid on it shoswitz ordered lamoia reached them and stood behind daphne leaning against the door facing shoswitz along with the two men she said what have you got john the name of the courier he whispered he pulled out the memo again and daphne snatched it from him without looking stunning him the employee lists arrived on my email while you two were in interrogation i called over to port of seattle police and they started running the names through the airliner computers we got luck on two counts one she used an airline early in the alphabet which was how we started our searchalaska air two she was greedyshe credited every single flight to her mileage program it was my buddys idea the first place he tried because the data is essentially already sorted for you and barn twentysomeodd flights stacked right in a row all to vancouver international all on the dates of the previous harvests whats the name boldt asked anxiously cocking his head just slightly over his shoulder listen up people and listen up good come on quiet shoswitz roared meyers put a sock in it boldt you done having your meeting id like to get on with mine daphne who was just about to read the name to boldt slipped the memo back into her pocket she felt her face burn shoswitz became intensely serious listen up five minutes ago a little after pm a male caucasian entered the stoneway safeway and opened fire with a semiautomatic weapon as yet unidentified the guy or the gun an anonymous disguised voice shouted out it won some limited laughter shoswitz wasnt having any of it his face remained rigid and impassive as he continued eleven known dead a hush swept the room maybe no one was breathing including two children an infant and seven women one of those women was the daughter of state senator baker spd and county police vehicles are presently in pursuit of the suspectfivefooteight inches brown hair camo clothing jump bootsbelieved to be headed north on aurora around the eightyfifth street crossing youre all assigned to this one people there was a major grumbling of protest throughout the room all other investigations except he pulled out a cheat sheet the docklands bombing the toyland rapeassault and the harvester kidnapping take backseat to this on those cases just mentioned only i repeatonly the lead detective remains active more grumbling from his audience all support activities including surveillance are terminated until notified that really stirred up the crowd listen listen this is from the top down okay dont kill the fucking messengerexcuse the french i want you all to roll to the crime scene immediately but watch your driving especially you lamoiano stunts we want witness reports a full id workup you know the drill were going to be under a microscope on this one people national news affiliates are already working with public information this has got to be firstclass police work lets see that it is lets zip it up i will be coordinating along with the bureaus boysthose experts in homicide this finally won him some sympathy a ripple of laughter swept the room the fbi who taught homicide investigative techniques annually conducted fewer homicide investigations on a national basis that a even a small experience they occasionally caused bad blood by exerting that authority matthews well want you to interface with the fbi on a psych he paused where the hell is matthews matthews pipe up raise your hand or something boldt he hollered wasnt she standing right behind you im not sure lieutenant boldt lied cautiously his hand curled around the note she had slipped there he had felt her writing against him using his back as a desk just before she slipped out maybe the little girls room lamoia offered he knew better gaynes find her shoswitz ordered the detective hurried from the room dont look too hard boldt advised from the corner of his mouth as gaynes passed she turned and winked at him wherever daphne was headed she would make it he opened his hand and read the crumpled note written in mascara on the back of lamoias pink memo it read you take maybeck ive got her an arrow lead around the note to the other side where the name was boldly circled pamela chase boldt aimed his back squarely at lamoia and asked hey did she get any of that stuff on my coat situated in the northern reaches of the university district pamela chases apartment building was around the corner from a greek restaurant a stationery store and a sewing shop it looked more like a doubledecker motel daphne was driving her own honda prelude because her assigned vehicle had yet to be returned by the airport security personnel she would probably never see the car again as she was checking to make sure her beretta semiautomatic was secured in its holster up under her jacket her pager began beeping she unclipped it from her waist studied it a moment and dropped it casually between the seats muting its tones and distancing herself from it shoswitz wasnt reassigning her that was all there was to it for several years of her life she had never gone more than thirty days without a trip to the firing range ever since that scar more often than that only now as she faced the possibility of actually using the weapon on a human did she worry whether or not she could go through with it she climbed a flight of cement stairs a dozen thoughts crowding her brain paused at the top to catch her breath and clear her head and approached number six the mail slot to number six had pamela chases name on it daphne felt like a detective now not just a desk jock her stomach was nauseated her eyes burning her fingers cold she had two bold lines of tension running up the back of her neck as if an eagle had sunk its talons there her mouth tasted salty and dry and she couldnt hear because of the humming in her ears everything seemed to be riding on this moment if pamela chase would go against tegg then sharon might still have a chance she knocked on the door the woman who answered it was overweight in hertwenties she carried a surprised innocence in her eyes a piece of jellied toast in her right hand pamela chase daphne asked although she looked like a pushoversomeone easily broken daphne put herself on guard maybecks strength had surprised her with only hours to go until friday february pamela chase seemed the last link to elden tegg there was no time to play sweet no time to nibble at the edges daphne had to take a big bite right away and make this woman hurt make her panic im with the police miss chase she offered her a look at her identification im investigating a kidnapping four homicides and a series of organ harvests that date back at least three years the toast slapped onto the forestgreen shag carpet in a wet landing she had pinched it too hard there was still a piece lodged between index finger and thumb she was far from tan to begin with but she was paler now she had locked into a squint as if the sun were shining brightly over daphnes shoulder the sun was down the sky a kind of glowing charcoal gray like a colorless stainedglass window backlit by a lowwatt bulb twice chase started to say something tried to get a word out but something was lodged in her throat something like guilt thought daphne the kind of thing try as you might you can never swallow away what do you say we give your furnace a rest the girl didnt get it may i come inside what do you want she felt like saying i want sharon back alive i want more time in which to operate i want our surveillance people back a fighting chance she said i want elden tegg behind bars the door swung open the girl staggered into the center of the dormitorydecorated room dizzy and disoriented it wasnt exactly an invitation but daphne followed closing the door behind her as it thumped shut the girl glanced over at her still in that painful squint i dont i dont know anything she said daphne replied it would be nice if we had time to talk about it wouldnt it you could lie to me i could lie to you we call that the dance in my business i make promises i cant keep you repeatedly tell me that you have no idea what im talking about but youre small potatoes to me pamela chase you hardly count i havent got time for you neither does my friendthe one you kidnapped time is the one im chasing now and youre in the way and i dont much care what happens to you as long as you pay for what youve done and i get my friend back this really isnt like me but its the way i feel and ill be damned if i can be any different right at the moment the girls mouth sagged open dumbfounded she again tried say something again she failed daphne smelled success brewing what it boils down to is whether or not youre willing to go to jail for the crimes he committed maybeck hadnt responded well to this line of reasoning but daphne sensed more chance in a girl like this have you ever seen the inside of a womens prison you know what they do to each other in there all we ever hear about are the abuses in the mens prison system but thats because were in a maledominated society you know what the guards do to the women prisoners they sell them goodsdrugs and cigarettes mostly and do you know what the women pay with why dont you sit down pamela youre going to faint if you dont watch it thats better you feel okay no you shouldnt youre not okay youre in the deep stuff youre in the stuff that hardens and turns to cement and never lets you go and you know that all i need from you is a little talk thats all how you got into it what hes done just tell me that elden tegg is the harvester and tell me youll sign a warrant to that effect you do this for me and you may walk away from it i dont much like that if it were left to me id make you suffer for what youve done but the law acts in strange ways ill play along if you will you buy yourself a big chunk of freedom by cooperating you buy yourself nothing but trouble if you play it any other way she took off a shoe and rubbed the sole of her foot tell me about it pam tell me how it works tell me where maybeck fits in and connie chi did you read in the paper about connie shes dead you know we think it was maybeck but it might have been tegg someone killed her that could have been you girl it may yet be you thats something else i would think about if i were you life expectancy in this business of yours is on the backside of the curve that kind of talk was going to lose her she looked confused daphne didnt want her confused she wanted her terrified as terrified as she was what if she failed with pamela as well what then she spread her fingers into a church steeple as if she were prayingmaybe she wasand stared over nails that needed attention all of her needed attention sit down she shouted pamela stumbled backward and fell to a sitting position on the couch she was crying better daphne said she felt about as bad as she had ever felt i dont know what youre talking about pamela mumbled again tell me about your flights to vancouver who asked you to make those deliveries am i under arrest daphne sensed this wasnt pamela chase speaking but elden tegg the girl had been coached she couldnt arrest her for taking plane flights to vancouver and she couldnt very well bring her downtown for further questioning not given shoswitzs edict the policewoman daphne matthews couldnt lie but she didnt have to answer pamela stood quickly daphne instinctively reached for her weapon as pamela trundled off toward the kitchen where are you going daphne asked just a minute pamela muttered the carpet was wom in a straight line between that couch and the kitchen alcove daphne pulled the weapon now for pamela had moved so quickly she was already out of sight and around the corner her heart suddenly in her throat daphne edged toward the kitchen noises a cabinet door a weapon with the beretta gripped tightly in both hands its barrel trained at the floor daphne began to level it as she rolled gently around the edge of the corner pamela attempted to hide the large jar of peanut butter but her cheeks were bulging with it she swallowed it away gaping eyes glued to daphnes gun did tegg ask you to make those trips for him she returned the gun to her holster i go there for study and research did he tell you to say that we know why you go there we know the flights you connect with there its only a matter of time before we uncover the other courier the one making the international flights tegg is going to be mad at you when he finds out how we caught you it was your frequent flyer miles pam every trip you took to deliver those organs is listed on your frequent flyer records and why shouldnt they be i go there for research kidnapping is a federal offense a capital offense you understand that prosecuting attorneys will often trade with one of the suspects but only one the others get the full charges we already have maybeck in custody this shocked pamela she reached for the peanut butter and scooped out some with a spoon daphne said tell me about elden tegg when pamela spoke her lips smacked with peanut butter hes the best vet in the city ninety percent of our new business is based on referralscases other vets couldnt solve this seemed more recited than spoken daphne could picture tegg proudly arrogantly announcing these statistics to his assistant and staff pamela chase had been carefully indoctrinated such people couldnt easily be broken they had to be worn down over repeated sessions and daphne didnt have the time for that panic seeped through the cracks pamela chase had to talk people on the fringes of criminal activity could often be compromised but those at the heart proved far more stubborn those who stood directly in the shadow of the power were the most difficult of all to break a dangerous combination of too loyal and too naive pamela chase seemed to fit this latter category daphne quickly adjusted to her new role her only hope now was to use pamela as a conduit to manipulate her into doing daphnes work for her pamela was anything but cool calm and collected she was panicked inside they both were daphne could see it in the womans frantic consumption of peanut butter the perspiration on her upper lip and her nervous eyes if daphne pushed her hard enough if she pushed her over pamela would go running to tegg whether physically or by telephone and that would lay the groundwork for an appearance by daphne at teggs home she reminded herself that people who served as other peoples assistants were accustomed to taking orders she needed to be more authoritative with this girl leave that on the counter and come into the other room youre disgusting me pamelas face flushed red she hesitated now daphne pronounced down went the jar of chunky daphne didnt carry a purse during working hours she kept as little on her as possible divided among several pockets her wallet her id and shield lip gloss a small comb the picture of sharon shaffer was in the left pocket of her coat along with some notes phone messages and her car keys she handed the photograph to pamela chase and watched as those eyes squinted tightly and the girls neck flashed crimson it was daphne who felt lightheaded now strangely until this moment she had clung to the hope that sharons disappearance might be explained some other wayany other waythat they had it wrong but there was no mistaking the recognition in pamelas reaction although she also seemed surprised and this confused daphne who stated her harvest is scheduled for tomorrow isnt it tomorrow pamela questioned still puzzled then she thought better of it i ddont she stumbled on her words i dont know this person thats a lie pamela lying to the police is a serious crime you can go to jail just for lying to me tell me about sharon where is tegg keeping her why has he kept her for so long when cindy chapman was kept less than thirtysix hours there was recognition of that name as well daphnes palms were damp the muscles in her upper back and neck had frozen into an unforgiving knot so close now she rotated her head trying to free them pamela chase continued to stare at the photograph daphne said you think hes wonderful dont you you probably even think that what youve been doing is right at least on some level you dont strike me as a criminal now youre protecting him why he uses you dont you see that pamelas head snapped up from the photo hes using you and maybeck to do the criminal work while he takes all the money do you know the kind of money were talking about shut up hundreds of thousands of dollars quiet she dropped the photo and pressed her hands to her ears the photo glided to the carpet and landed face up sharon looked up to daphne for help daphne asked is she at the clinic is that where hes keeping her if you take me to her if you helped me to find her youll get off scotfree i promise you pamela shook her head no but daphne pressed on think youre a smart woman you can see tegg has used you what laws has he broken but you can take me to sharon cant you you can save her take me to her now what do you owe him a look of defiance came over the suspect her eyes flashed hatred and she said strongly i owe him everything what do you know about it nothing its all lies youre the police you tell nothing but lies little people is what you are public servants nothing more you get out of my house you get out of my house now i can bring you downtown for questioning then do it youre not going to do it are you if you were you would have done it right away wouldnt you have pamela stepped toward her daphne challenged she too stepped forward preventing pamela from stepping on sharons photograph shes abnegative she said displaying the photograph once again not o our experts tell us that her rare blood type indicates the harvester is after a major organsomething that will kill her a liver maybe a liver like anna ferragot were you part of that pamela stopped cold her eyes filled with tears her hurt and horror were palpable sensing a nerve daphne pushed harder tell me about anna we found her bones you know we found them buried by the tolt river you cant run away from any of this theres no running away from this kind of thing this is murder at least three others besides anna ferragot you think elden tegg is the best well not on humans hes not these three died of incompetenceof hemorrhages they bled internally bled to death on the streets runaways no one cares right is that what he told you well he was wrong we care i care little people is that what you called me where does that leave you pamela where in the hell does that leave you and dr elden tegg out get out of my house she stepped forward and the two of them were face to face though daphne stood taller the girl smelled like a combination of department store perfume and peanut butter given daphnes present situation there was nothing more to be done she ached with this realization was pamela strong enough to act on her own daphne decided she wasnt with boldt keeping an eye on maybeck that left only elden tegg pamela would have to turn to one or the other you can still save yourself pamela get out daphne slid the photograph into her pocket as she stood in the open door the sun now fully set she said if you let her die if you help him what kind of person does that make you she added youre the only one who can save her tell me where she is tell me about tegg tell me something think pamela think go away pamela pushed the door closed daphne kept her foot wedged in it briefly and the two met eyes then the door pushed shut completely she heard crying on the other side of that door she lifted her hand to knockto try one last time but thought better of it the phone was quicker than the car she had to get to teggs as quickly as possible j when donnie maybeck returned from his ordeal with the police he found an unusual delivery awaiting him outside his apartment door in the drearily lighted hallway sat a dog cage containing a pit bull his name and address were written on an envelope taped to the outside of the cage this cage helped explain a smaller parcel that had arrived earlier a parcel he had received just prior to heading off to the pit bull fight that had ended in such complete and total disaster in that earlier package he had found a padlock key and a remote device for a shock collar the accompanying note printed by a computer printer read more to come had to be from the doc it was just like him to it do something this anonymous the doc didnt trust anyone didnt trust the phones didnt trust nothing did he intend for him to use the dog on pamela something like that no one needed to warn donnie maybeck about the danger that these dogs represented donnie lugged the cage inside and shut the door taking a second to lock it as well he tore the envelope off the outside of the cage and ripped it open the note inside read travel money his heart beat a little quicker cash the payoff the doc was telling him to get the hell out of dodge and do it now maybeck practically dove at the cage he peered into the dark hole the dog growling at him and spotted a manila envelope taped to the back wall then he understood if you tried to open the cage without the key without the remote wand to this shock collar you were toastyou were never going to see that money genius leave it to the doc maybeck was beside himself with excitement he had never been long on patience and now he found himself moving so quickly he was bumping into things fifty would the doc pay him the full fifty half would suit him fine even ten grand would make him happy for a long time why be greedy but it was greed that drove him to act with such haste he found the key and the remote device by the telephone where hed left them he rushed to the cage the electronic wand at his ready and frantically went about unlocking the wire door he was so excited that he forced the key and damned near broke it off he tried again and the lock came unsprung he kept one hand firmly against the cage to hold the dog inside and readied the shock collars wand how was he going to do this he needed to get the dog out the money out and then the dog back inside he hit the button just to make sure it worked the collar buzzed the dog looked terrified in there it looked mad as all hell istay maybeck commanded he showed the dog the remote device believing this would serve as a warning the dog growled maybeck swung open the cage door the dog sprang out of the cage like a thirtypound bullet maybeck triggered the wand he heard the collar buzz but the dog was on him now and had him by the forearm maybeck let out a roar and hit the button again again the collar buzzed but there was clearly no shock delivered as a training device the remote could be set either wayto deliver just the sound of the warning buzz or the sound and the shock the doc never set the remote to buzz the collar without delivering a shock because the dogs werent that well trained but he had this time maybeck knew how a pit bull worked its opponent fast and dirty it went for your arm if you were holding an object once that object was dropped it went for your heels and calves once you were down it went for your throat it was for this reason he seized the dog by the collar and pulled struggling with his wounded hand to maintain hold of the wand the dogs jaws were gripped onto him like a bear trap how many times had he witnessed this death grip in their backwoods contests how many times had he wondered what it must feel like to have one of these things locked onto you and now he knew if he let go of the wand if he dropped it would he have time to get out that door if not then what were his choices the teeth were through the muscle now and into the bone and nerve like two saw blades heading for each other on his knees maybeck continued pulling against that collar trying to choke his adversary to pull him off but it was useless the thing was like a pain machine instinctively maybeck sounded the collar repeatedly until his fingers stopped working the remote tumbled out of his hand before the wand reached the floor the pit bull was already going at the rest of him it got a good piece of his front thigh maybeck deflected its next attempt and made it to his feet he completed two full steps before the dog severed his right achilles tendon maybeck cried out again but fear stole his voice no sound came out his right foot flopped uselessly like it didnt belong there the leg dragged behind him he stumbled but bounced back up if he went down it was all over he danced his way toward the window trying to give his adversary a moving target but the dogs reactions were ten times as quick as his when he swung his leg left he felt a bite the calf muscle kicked it right calf muscle again he fell to his knees the fucking dog bit him right square in the ass and held on tight he rolled hard to his left right on top of the thing it yipped and briefly let go free maybeck used every last bit of his strength to come to his feet he aimed his head low and dove throwing himself out of the secondstory window nothing out there but sidewalk parked cars and pavement the last thing he heard was breaking glass it lou boldt was watching maybecks apartment when the guy came out of the window doing a swan dive he was followed by some kind of dog it seemed to him to happen in a kind of eerie slow motion the guy was waving his arms as if it might slow him down good luck he looked bloody he looked bad even before he hit the fire hydrant boldt didnt have the kind of reactions necessary for field work he didnt have any business being out here on surveillance he sprung open his car door pivoted and was going for his gun when it occurred to him that maybe it was a bomb that had made the guy jump maybe the place was about to blow boldt ducked behind the shield of his car door waited a beat and trained the gun on the window from which maybeck had just exited maybe someone had thrown him out that was more how it looked now that he thought about it in situations like this there was no explaining the way he thought fragments of ideas attached themselves and then let go replaced by another consideration this by another and another he considered his own selfdefense he considered the welfare of the innocent people on the street around him the dog flew out the window like a smart bomb straight down it it literally bounced off the sidewalk came to its feeta front leg bent sideways and brokenand attacked maybeck it was like nothing boldt had ever seen there were shrieks of hysteria there was the sickening sound of the dog at work of car motors nearby and a motorcycle in the distanceboldt was aware of all the sounds there was this nauseating moment when an active imagination couldnt help but fill in what was happening to the fallen man and a terrifying moment as boldt raced across the street weapon drawn debating whether or not to shoot the dog the decision was made for him as he cleared a parked car the dog looked overactually seemed to focus on the gun not himand charged he came on low to the ground and he came fast as if that broken leg attached to him was nothing but a prosthesis boldt fired once and missed fired again and missed the dog closed the distance faster than boldt could calculate his next shot he fired again wildly missed again there was blood on its whiskershe could see that clearlyand a spirited determination in its eyes that pushed boldt to turn and run but boldt held his ground his training kicking in a man with a gun could beat an attacking dog but not two dogs the rule was two screw one use the gun boldt steadied his weaponwaiting this time waitingpreparing to fire the blast hit the dog sideways one minute the dog was there the next gonejust like that dead under the car if the trail of blood was any indication boldt had not fired the boy was no more than seventeen asian wearing a winter overcoat the brief look boldt got of the gun convinced him it was a largebore semiautomaticthe gangs called them cop killers after a hit record the gun was there then it wasntjust like the dog the boy stuffed it out of sight and went off at a run boldt knew the kids in gangs carried guns sometimes serious guns but it had never occurred to him that they knew how to shoot at anything but each other hitting that dog even from the side was no easy shot but maybejust maybethe kid had saved boldts life hey boldt called after him he wasnt sure whether he intended to arrest him or thank him the kids pace increased boldt ran half a block on instinct but stopped himself when his thoughts caught up to him what was he going to do shoot the kid a siren wailed in the distance someone had called the cops i am a cop boldt thought then he took a look at maybeck he didnt feel anything no nausea no remorse no sympathy nothing like he had felt at the sight of connie chis body his brain registered that this too was probably a homicide though it would be one hell of a kill to prove this mess before him was also a victim but justice had been served here at least in the eyes of lou boldt and nobody was going to make him feel wrong about feeling good nobody it was later now maybe fortyfive minutes had passed he wasnt sure he had lost track it was dark the neighborhood wasnt interested in the killing any longer hed been upstairs had taken some notes he had bought a disposable camera at a local quikmart and had tried to photograph the scene himself because spd was so focused on the safeway killing that only a single patrol car and a body bag team from dixies office arrived to help out in this light he wasnt likely to get any decent shots he took a picture of the fire hydrant it was a gravestone now as well how appropriate that maybeck had hit a fire hydrant boldt thought taking one last shot where this guy was going maybe he was there alreadyhed be putting out fires day and nigt for the rest of eternity his pager rang he hoped it was daphne with news of pamela chase or tegg he had a hell of a time shutting the thing off but he finally hit the right button he called in on his cellular the message was from lamoia who had obviously abandoned the safeway investigation at some point lamoia had a way of getting away with things like that he was slippery without being sleazy nothing from daphne that worried him the message was read to him by the dispatcher administration building pm boldt checked his watch he jumped in his car and took off the body bag boys were screaming something at him but lou boldt wasnt listening donnie maybeck was yesterdays news dressed in a navy blue cashmere blazer a white pinpoint oxford and a multicolored italian silk tie elden tegg warmed with the sight of his guests enjoying themselves he loved the role of host of provider although secretly in his innermost thoughts he despised the pretensions of these people tonight was peggys opera dinner five of their twelve guests were voting members of the opera board including its chairman byron endicott despite maybecks earlier problem with the police and his own discovery that the county police had dug up anna ferragots grave tegg attended his wifes dinner clinging to a plan set in motion earlier in the day with a call to vancouver the harvest would take place tomorrow morning as planned tegg would deliver the organ himself he had a noon flight booked out of vancouver for rio via mexico city his life as a veterinarian was finished when he hit rio he would be carrying wong keis money and would have access to several accounts here in the city if he worked quickly enough that money could be electronically transferred before the little people had figured out how to even spell his name that money was his ticket to buying his way in as a transplant surgeon a new life a part of him recognized this as delusion fantasy it all seemed too simple it all worked out too easily too perfectly and yet he convinced himself that people did this kind of thing all the time he read about them in the paper executives vanishing with the entire corporate pension secretaries disappearing with their bosses housewives cleaning out the joint accounts never to be heard of again all it took was a little courage a little planning and a lot of quick decisions he was focused on the upcoming harvest and his own escape all he had to do was maintain a certain pretense of normality for the next few hoursfool everyoneand by tomorrow noon he would be gone off to his new life this was the way it was done wasnt it the way what is done the woman in front of him asked had he said something to her was he thinking aloud speaking his thoughts for everyone to hear sorry he asked trying to remember her name distracted by a piece of mushroom at the corner of her lips whats that she asked her napkin finding the mushroom teggs eyes found her breasts right out there for everyone to enjoy there was more silicon in this room than hors doeuvres more tucks than in a scottish kilt his wife signaled him so that this guest could see what a lifesaver he excused himself and dashed off to her side peggy looked radiant though somewhat awkward in a japanese tea dress cut so tightly around her hips and knees that she moved from guest to guest like a hobbled horse most of the other women in the room fell noticeably short of peggys high standards for presentation though not for lack of trying his wife mousestepped past him and whispered tjs having trouble with the company but he won a proam in scottsdale last month she scooted over to the champagne and had a word with one of their whitegloved servers tegg wasnt up to this pandering and politicking for years he and peggy had worked so hard to acquire this kind of social acceptance but now that it was here especially at a time of such nerveracking decisions and potentially catastrophic problems it all seemed so fake to him they had bought this acceptance by throwing his harvesting money at the artsballet summer dance the operaby being seen by blending in ridiculous nonsense what would peggy say if she found out her substantial contributions to the arts came not from his work at the clinic but from the harvested kidneys of degenerate runaways wonderful to see you again elden hows the practice thomastjharper owned the secondlargest retail department store in the northwest he had white hair white teeth and wore a tailored suit from london keeps me in stitches tegg answered waiting for the rag merchant to see the humor the man responded with a slight grin though it seemed forced everything was forced at occasions like these tegg wasnt sure what to say next he drank some champagne you did a fine job on gingers leg harper said ginger was the harpers terrier mutt tegg felt his face flush these kinds of comments made him feel like cheap labor a gardener or a house cleaner a little person tegg felt he was groveling and he hated himself for it he forced kind words from his mouth for peggys sake i understand your golf game is in top form congratulations on scottsdale the man glowed we ought to go out sometime id love to tegg replied he wasnt much for golf although they belonged to the clubmore for appearances and for peggys sake than his own tegg excused himself and headed straight for tina endicott whose eyes betrayed a restlessness that tegg interpreted as sexual urgency byron endicott had incited a great deal of envy in the hearts of the males in his social set by marrying this twentyeightyearold stunner fortyodd years his junior it was anybodys guess as to how long it would hold together how much loose play byron was willing to tolerate endicott had asked for a telephone twenty minutes earlier and had yet to reemerge from the study tina had legs that didnt stop and lush auburn hair as he was revving himself up for his conversation with tina his wife again caught his eye and offered a glance at the diminishing caviar that told him his guests had gone through twentyfive hundred dollars worth of fish eggs in half the allotted time message received the soup course would be advanced and served any minute he and peggy could work a party the same way he and pamela could handle a harvest it just wasnt as much fun tegg nodded toward the study indicating he would fetch byron endicott peggy acknowledged and tottered off toward the kitchen as tegg crossed the foyer a waitress answered the front door facing him her features twisted in anxiety and her swollen limbs trembling with trepidation stood the piggish pamela chase what was she doing here more problems tegg felt a tic coming on and reacted quickly as his shoulder and head attempted to meet by hurrying to greet pamela the young waitress flinched with his tic and glanced quickly away as if she hadnt seen it he saw a fear in pamelas squinty little eyes that he didnt care for one bit pamela problems he questioned its important she said maintaining her cool surprisingly well glancing sideways at the uniformed caterer an emergency at the office the electricity in her eyes told him this required immediate action he motioned her toward the study well aware he would have to evict byron endicott if he didnt handle this carefully rumors of a scandal would be started before the fish course as he ushered pamela into his study his mind sorting through possible explanations for her arrivalhad maybeck opened his little package he tried to see this young woman through the eyes of byron endicott he knew damn well the kinds of things that would be said about them if he failed to handle this correctly but he didnt care let them talk by tomorrow a new life control he reminded himself feeling another tic coming on but refusing it as if slamming a door in its face unknowingly he slammed the door to his study it made a tremendous crash pamela jumped old man endicott mumbled into the receiver and hung up he rose to his feet and came around the desk with a suspicious irreverent expression and who is this lovely creature he asked pamela tegg experienced a flash of embarrassment he said this is my surgical assistant pamela chase byron endicott he said indicating the old man im afraid something has come up at the clinic byron well need the study for a moment if you dont mind enchanted endicott said taking her hand not douglas chases little girl yes pamela said looking to tegg nervously an such a lovely young woman he lied last time i saw you but just look at you he said leering artificially she blushed endicott grinned at tegg ill leave you two he said his implication obvious but you must introduce her around elden or ill raise a stink i promise to pamela he said we are all very close friends of your parents you really must say hello before you leave endicott smirked gave tegg a teasing nasty look and let himself out of the room im sorry for coming she said not to worry tegg replied you look awful what is it he closed the door tightly a dozen thoughts crowding his brain the police came to my apartment asking about my trips to vancouver at first he couldnt be sure he had heard her right but from her grave expression from the constriction in his own chest he knew that indeed he had he felt the betraying savagery of two tics overcome himlike two sharp bolts of electricity he fell into a chair his blood banged so loudly in his ears he couldnt hear what she said next first maybeck now pamela too close much too close there was no time to waste he began plotting immediately they know about everything she said they offered me a deal if i gave them you had maybeck talked his attorney howard chamberland had assured him everything was finemaybeck had been released on a misdemeanor charge his palms went clammy control he reminded himself again answering her perplexed and ghostly gaze with a squaring of his shoulders and a lifting of his chin the police moved about as fast as languishing sea lions certainly no match for his latest plans no reason to panic evaluate the situation analyze indecision was anyones biggest enemy he had contingencies he looked into her dark squinting eyes and thought about telling her of his plan to escape but that would include the harvesting of the heart and she didnt approve of thatshe might even betray him if she knew about the heart no better to calm her and be rid of her tomorrow morning would come soon enough sit down he told her good can i get you something to drink a pop i want you to relax calm down youre with me now youre all right shes pretty more than pretty dark hair taller than me beautiful eyes a woman he asked stupidly the idea that a woman had questioned her seemed so much less threatening to him than had it been a man why he wasnt sure he knew how she hated pretty women she felt betrayed by her weight problem failing to see it as a disease but instead as a weakness of character an attitude that had been drummed into her by her inept parents i have to interrupt here he said doing so forgive me please but the details are quite unimportant to me they didnt arrest you did they and theres a reason for that they havent got anything of any value on us suspicions is all weve talked about this before but whats important to remember with the police is that if you dont talk to them theres nothing they can learn from you its hard i know he said reaching over and touching her knee terribly difficult but true she mentioned the harvests she said three of the donors had died from hemorrhaging he couldnt catch his breath failure footsteps in the foyer drawing closer they wanted him at the table no doubt it suddenly felt as if the room were smaller the walls closing in yes he could feel the walls moving closer control a knock like a knife in his chest not now he glanced toward the door tried to lift himself from his chair but couldnt move such helplessness was foreign to him it was always the patient that was paralyzed never him pamela rose effortlessly to answer the door and this inspired teggs limbs to obey he reached out and stopped her as he came to his feet reminding himself that the sure sign of superiority is the ability to overcome performanceappearancewas everything when he opened the door he felt relief to find one of the waitresses staring back at him he had somehow expected his wife and had no desire to face her at this particular moment he could picture her at the end of the dining table facing his empty place crazed with rage and yet politely fielding conversation and graciously offering the bread basket to her guests the soup is served dr tegg mrs tegg asked me to tell you please have them start without me would you just a little business matter to clear up i wont be but a minute it was an easy absence to explain as the only vet in the clinic he was constantly oncall he responded at all hours to emergencies of every sort it was perfectly normal for him to be summoned in the evening hours to handle an emergency tonight rather than drag him downtown when he was in the midst of an important dinner party his assistant had had the good sense to seek his advice in person so as to occupy as little of his time as possible he shut the door and asked pamela hemorrhaging thats impossible must be some sort of trick saying such a thing trying to rattle you i dont think so she sounded serious she said the investigation is being run by homicide the word reminded him of maybeck of sending that package to the man he regretted that now he had regretted that only a moment after he had turned it over to the delivery boy but it was done maybecks fault he said the idea taking hold and coming as a great relief if he mistreated the donors in any way once the patient is out of our control out of our care we cant be expected to monitor his or her every move can we of course not the wrong activity too soon and something is bound to come loose they were told how to take care of themselves we cant babysit every last patient now can we pamela said flatly she showed me a picture of a woman sharon the same woman we did the kidney on last saturday i remember her name i remember that night verywell very clearly as you can imagine i would and i remember seeing a sponge and her chest being damp and now i have to wonder with betadyne was that why her kidney wasnt prepped was that why you did what you did to me what we did to distract me she said that sharon had disappeared and thats not right for a kidney its a heart isnt it elden anegative she said and all i could think of was a heart his own heart responded like a chorus of timpani you dont need to answer because i know how many times have you tried to convince me to do a heart and just yesterday you took that dogs heart whats happening have you done it already have you this doesnt involve you he warned doesnt involve me she questioned where is that coming from get a clue his anger surfaced but he contained it she was just a child we have talked about this i dont accept your arguments you know that i have heard them a dozen times what you cant face is that i might be right admit it i wont tell them anything you know i wont i owe you that but im scared for you for me im not sure what to do they know about the trips to vancouver they know about all of it we have to do something theyre not just going to go away youre missing the central point which is which is that if they had anything you wouldnt be sitting here talking to me panic struck him what if she had already cut a deal with them what if she were wearing a microphone the police standing ready outside his door he stood and edged around his desk taking a quick but useless look outside it was rainy and dark he couldnt see anything but a driveway full of cars he approached her from behind then and stroked her hair she liked it she leaned her head back and looked up at him he bent over feigning a kiss and ran his hand over her chest and abdomen secretly searching for an unwarranted bump that might alert him to a wire or a microphone he leaned her forward and massaged her neck and back searching here as well nothing perhaps she was loyal to him after all he continued if they had anything at all they would be doing more than asking questions theyre nosing around is all they earn their living nosing around our tax dollars mind you he was losing focus granted theyre obviously on the right track ill give you that ill concede that much but where are the charges why havent they questioned me you see theyre tiptoeing around is all we mustnt give in to that and besides weve talked about this before havent we of course we have we have even anticipated such a moment hmm the lab at the farm can be dismantled in a matter of a few hours were prepared for that no problem wheres the evidence to come from it was true if he dismantled the farms surgical facility if pam remained loyal what was left for the police he said i dont think this is nearly as bad as it looks my dear hmm not nearly as bad as it looks the important thing is to stay calm with that in mind stay where you are ill be right back no matter what his plans he needed pamela sedated for the rest of the night out of the way incapable of fouling the waters he hurried out into the garage and rummaged through the veterinarian supplies he kept in the refrigerated insert in back of the isuzu the only sedatives he had on hand were for intravenous use but he located an oral supply of valium in dosages strong enough for a mastiff he grabbed two capsules and hurried back to the study carefully avoiding the dining room and his guests theres nothing to worry about i promise he said upon returning he extended the pills to her take these theyll help you relax no thanks take them go on he handed her his champagne glass theyll put your mind at rest there is a course through every storm go home put your feet up she studied the pills thats a lot of valium trust me id rather pamela take the medicine she tossed the pills into her mouth and chased them down with the champagne drive directly home have you eaten anything she nodded good drive straight home for safetys sake though youre unlikely to feel them for fortyfive minutes or so take a hot bath relax well talk in the morning okay he lifted her chin with his finger and looked her in the eye it was smart of you to come here im not mad at you at all but its important to keep perspective hmm you must not speak with the police again not for any reason they will only attempt to unsettle you you mustnt allow that do you hear me pamela she nodded again good any problems she shook her head she looked a little angry a little sad she hadnt wanted to take the pillsthat was it or was it he couldnt tell off you go he said offering her his hand she said nothing he had wounded her oh well the valium would improve things shortly he saw her to the front door she hurried through the rain toward her car tegg heard the idle chatter of his guests from behind him could he endure a meal with these people given his present state of anxiety did he have any choice sitting behind the wheel of her honda prelude taking notes by the limited light of a shore drive streetlamp in the broadmoor estates daphne heard a mans voice call out she looked up in time to see pamela chase hurry through the rain and climb into her car daphne felt impatient isolated angry and even a little afraid shoswitzs cut in manpower was going to cost sharon her life that was the way it now seemed the political pressures and responsibilities resulting from the safeway killings had proved too much for him to bear the one loser in all of this was sharon the frustration of being confined to a front seat taking notes drove daphne into a rage it was time to do something pamelas car started the lights went on illuminating the thick landscape vegetation that separated the large waterview homes from their neighbors teggs house was rich with arched leadedglass windows a full turret and a section of battlement along the roof to complete the look of a castle it had a red slate roof two chimneys and a weather vane this wasnt the volvo and cherokee set but the beamers and jags second homes on decatur northwest twentyyear anniversaries ralph lauren to wear for the saturday chores private clubs and political contributions these were the people that as a cop you were careful with the kind who knew how to make trouble daphne faced a difficult decision pursue pamela chase or stay with tegg when pamela had arrived here only minutes after she had daphne had felt an initial sense of accomplishment and success in her interrogation of the woman this was the exact pressure she had hoped to effect to send pamela running to tegg her notes carefully marked the time of the girls arrival duration of stay and time of departure the courts werent going to catch daphne on any technicalities she intended to cover herself well but now what her impatience urged her to follow to do something she ignored it staying with her earlier belief that not pamela chase but either tegg or maybeck would be responsible for holding sharon hostage her hunch was that tegg would insulate himself by using maybeck boldt had that assignment and she had every confidence in him pamela had alerted tegg now perhaps tegg would alert maybeck who in turn would lead boldt to sharon maybe they would get lucky maybe it was just too much of a long shot to hope for she checked her watch in four hours at midnight it would be february the day listed in the database for sharons harvest sometime in the morning seemed a more likely time for tegg to do the harvest given that a party was now under way in his house she would fight to keep herself awake she wished like hell she had either her police radio or cellular phonebeing out of communication was the hardest thing of all the taillights of pamela chases car receded and then disappeared from view daphne longingly watched them go wondering whether along with them went sharon shaffers only chance of survival please pass the butter tegg handed the butter dish to the woman with the showy breasts still unable to recall her name he had no idea what the tables present topic was and didnt care planning his escape occupied him fully peggy was happily yukking it up with byron endicott she would do anything for this opera board seat strange how petty it all seemed to tegg now why on earth had he ever given that kind of money away what had possessed him to try to be the philanthropic veterinarian of king county what an absurdity all so that his wife would play in the right bridge circles what did any of it matter there was life and death at stake here there was that package he had sent to maybeck the police homicide had they traced the pit bull back to tegg that quickly he refused to believe it he had taken such care to wipe down the cage wear gloves print everything on the hp printer write nothing by hand neither the collar its batteries or the wand had any kind of serial number there was no paperwork with the delivery company he had used one of those flybynight outfits in the international district dropping it off with them to avoid a pickup he has thought it through so carefully salt please the salt was about six inches from this fools hand what did he want someone to shake it for him losing his temper tegg did just that he seized the shaker and sent salt flying all over this mans food he caught himself but too late he apologized poured the man some pine ridge merlot and empty bottle in hand excused himself from the table he didnt dare look at peggy on his way into the kitchen he sorted back through his brief but intense encounter with pamela searching for any possible mistakes he might have made he sat down at a stool in the kitchen one of the kitchen help said something to him but he waved him away then he thought better of it and asked for some more wine and the tables out too he told no one in particular the valiums were a hell of a good idea he congratulated himself that dosage would knock her sideways he decided that it might be a good idea to check up on herto make sure she got home okay to calm her down if the pills hadnt already done so she wouldnt be feeling them for another few minutes maybe she needed someone to talk to he took his wine with him into the garage electing to use the cellular in the isuzu because of his belief in the difficulty the police had listening in on such lines he eased the seat back dialed the number and pushed snd god it felt good to be away from those hypocrites in there he took a big swig of wine and felt his first sense of real relief in hours her answering machine answeredthis troubled him his heart quickened he thought himself stupid for forcing the valium on her while she still had to drive home he should have just given them to her for her to take once there but he recalled he had wanted to ensure she had taken them he didnt want her mucking about tonight messing things up had the cops gotten hold of her he sat up and spilled some wine into his lap in that condition she might tell them everything what had he been thinking by giving her valium another thirty minutes shed be a tonguewagging wreck he should have stuck with his plan to sedate her he had wanted her out not brainimpaired a voice from within told him to calm down control she was probably just on the can and couldnt make it to the phone he dialed her number again it rang four times and the machine answered shit he said into the receiver maybe his voice of reason argued she was high already and had simply turned the phone off yes that made some sense lying back with headphones on or watching a movie on the tube valium behavior he sipped what was left of the wine not feeling good about any of this slowly his mind reconstructed a vivid memory of their final few minutes together he could see her could hear the conversation like a videotape playing inside his head had she ever spoken ever opened her mouth after he had fed her those pills had she in fact swallowed them what if she had not taken the valium but tricked him into believing she had where would she go what would she do the police the farm a tic hit him so hard he heard his neck crack the wineglass jumped from his hand struck the gear shift and shattered the farm he tripped the garage door automatic opener it groaned open slowly he couldnt believe how slowly this thing had never run this slowly what would he need had he forgotten anything the party the garage door opened far enough to reveal four cars parked in the drive more out on the road trapped the door to the kitchen opened peggy in her red japanese tea dress and her scarlet red face what could he say at this point what could he do take control there was a pretty good gap between the first parked car and the garage maybe just enough tegg backed slowly across the wet lawn the tires cutting deep ruts in the grass his guests observing him through the window the fourwheeldrive banged out onto the street and he was off to pamelas no he decided priorities he would keep calling the farm was far more important indeed the farm was everything lto the isuzu backed across the lawn its tires spraying mud in all directions daphne could barely make out a bearded mans face behind the wheel elden tegg she slumped in her seat dropping low placed her fingers on the key and waited his headlights washed the interior of her car hurting her eyes she remained absolutely still she thought her heart might explode he passed she counted to three and started the car lifting just high enough to watch his departure in her door mirror the second he passed out of sight she dropped the honda into gear and pulled one of the quickest threepoint turns she had ever made only a few seconds later she was following instinctively she reached for her police radio and came up empty once again the impact of her isolation from the department bore down on her she needed to get to a pay phone she needed a way to alert boldt or the department that it was going down it was going down she could feel it sharon was at the end of this ride it wasnt going to be maybeck it was going to be tegg it wasnt going to be boldt it was going to be her i appreciate this loraine lamoia said to the attractive black woman opening the james street entrance to the administration building boldt guessed her to be in her midthirties and just shy of six feet tall she had beautiful almond eyes and a dancers figure she wore jeans and a khaki windbreaker boldt knew her face from somewheremaybe she had worked at one of the civilian jobs for the department a few years back i could get screwed for doing this you know that john yeah i know dont ask me why im doing this cause ill be damned if i know and i thought it was because you loved me lamoia teased dont get me thinking about it lover or ill march your ass right out of here we are the police after all lamoia reminded its not as if were a couple of crooks or something yeah yeah hey ernie she greeted the security guard coming down the hall to intercept them boldt and lamoia took out their shields before the man even asked hey lori the former weightlifter answered his arms were too big for the uniform he was required to wear hed gone a little soft around the middle these here are a couple of seattles finest homicide dicks she introduced everyone all around he checked their identification carefully they need a looksee at some of the records in the assessors office and cant wait for nothing homicide sure thing ernie said he kept looking at boldt as if he recognized him they got the elevators off for inspection youll have to take the stairs on the way up the steep stairs she said this place gives me heebeejies with no one in it know what i mean a few steps later she added nah you guys probably dont know what i mean the deal is lamoia said down to boldt who was slower going up the stairs than the other two it occured to me that the first time i asked loraine to run a few names into the computerwhat was that yesterday i was a little sexist in my approach you she said sarcastically i cant imagine such a thing im talking to him if you dont mind lamoia complained you boldt asked mimicking the womans sarcastic tone lamoia continued undaunted i didnt have the time to do the job right i did check to see if either of the three vets owned land out near where dixie dug up farragot but this was before we were tuned in to tegg when i got the employee lists i had loraine try those names as well and that was a bunch of names she complained as if he owed her something for it boldt was out of shape thats all there was to it his legs seemed to weigh a few hundred pounds how much farther seventh floor sugar two more to go one way to do this lamoia explained is to use the county maps because they identify each parcel of private land by name of the taxpayer but thats a huge job loraine said and its random theres so much land out there by the tolt private public private usage timber lease water district you name it she seemed to be floating up the stairs barely noticing them boldt was beginning to wonder whether he would make it she reached the door first she held it open for lamoia and waited for boldt you all right she asked boldt nodded too winded to speak embarrassed when matthews nailed it down that it was tegg for sure it occurred to me we should try his wife boldt answered interrupting it annoyed lamoia boldt explained his reasoning as they turned right then left and loraine unlocked the door to room a for them we know tegg is originally from vancouver he later studied here married here and stayed here if he didnt buy the land then maybe his wife bought it or inherited it exactly lamoia agreed one name loraine asked she switched on the lights the room had a long counter and several oversized signs explaining who was properly served by the assessors office in the center of the space allotted to the public was a long table against the near wall was a slanted shelf holding threefootbytwofoot leatherbound tax maps of the city and king county according to the gold lettering they were made by the kroll map co along the far wall were a halfdozen computer terminals and more signs explaining how to use them the computer screen warmed loraine stood ready at the keyboard i did this for one name she hit several function keys changing the menu okay okay lay it on me and lets get out of here before i get a permanent case of the creeps you did this to save a womans life boldt wanted to say you did this to stop a man who has gone mad with a scalpel lamoia handed her a piece of napkin with some writing on it peggy schmidt tegg loraine read off typing it in just schmidt lamoia corrected peggy schmidt this is the info off of her dmv slugher drivers license were hoping like hell she uses her maiden name as her middle name otherwise weve got to dig up a marriage license loraine protested i dont have access to any marriage licenses john lamoia dont go asking me to get that as well cause thats the second floor and ive got nothing to do with those people you want that youre just gonna have to come back tomorrow tomorrows too late lamoia said meeting eyes with boldt no kidding loraine asked looking up at lamoia the seriousness of the situation sinking in schmidt he directed her pointing to the keyboard what else could that be but a maiden name some other kind of family name boldt suggested hoping he was wrong lamoias face tightened they both looked on as the woman typed in the name and issued several menudriven commands here goes she said the screen went blank boldt felt a sickening depression overtake him he was exhausted hungry and now he was stuck in a dead end dont get all stinky lover she said to boldt this thing can be slow the screen filled with a long list of schmidts starting with alfred next page lamoia instructed i know screen after screen of schmidts dozens of names there lamoia said he pointed to schmidt priscilla that could be her loraines painted nail ran across a line to a box that was a jumble of dozens of capital letters and numbers legal description of the property she said john read it off for me will you she jumped out of her chair boldt followed her over to the row of bound maps she selected the one for king countynorth read slow now lover she said lamoia read the first coordinates loraine found the corresponding latitude number on the edge of the map she turned to page fortytwo she located the same number here next she said lamoia read off the next number spreading her fingers like the points of a drafting compass loraine found this number as well her fingers closed in on each other each representing a grid coordinate there were dozens hundreds of boxes representing land parcels each with a name inside most read hollybrookone of the largest timberpaper companies in the northwest boldt heard himself say come on come on as he watched her fingers come together she moved her finger out of the way and there was the name schmidt skykomish river quadrangle she announced snoqualmie national forest tolt reservior bingowere there lamoia asked incredulously were there he repeated excitedly she answered ill make you a photocopy lover ill put you in her backyard pamela chase drove as if she were on her way to a fire she reached the unpaved county road that accessed teggs farm lost the back end of the car in a skid and nearly put the car in the trees he had tried to drug her she couldnt get over that she had swallowed one of the valiums but had managed to snag the other in her teeth it was in his front yard now she was driving fast not only to reach the farm quickly but to beat the valium it was already taking effect her anxiety level had lessened noticeably in the last few minutesher fingers were no longer welded to the steering wheel she was no longer grinding her teeth the more relaxed she felt the more terrified she became he had said that he would call her in the morning but what for he acted like he owned her as if she were one of his trained dogs she felt dirty she felt foolish how had she allowed herself to be carried along by him for so long what kind of person was she not the kind of person to condone a heart harvest she answered herself she intended to put an end to that but quick she pulled in to the farm and shut off her car from the quonset hut came the ferocious barking of the dogs sight of the small turnofthecentury cabin and its accompanying sheetmetal quonset hut gave her a renewed sense of the extreme seclusion of this place she was glad for his dinner party she wouldnt want him to catch her out here she left the car and approached the cabin slowly despite the urgency she felt her feet floated along the valium subtle in its approach was difficult to resist confusion reigned for she still wanted to believe in him that belief had given her several years of happiness by coming here she hoped as much to disprove her suspicions as prove them she couldnt get him out of her mindit was as if he were right here with her disapproving of each step she took toward betrayal she could hear his arguments he could be so convincing she glanced over her shoulder nervously the clouds were breaking up there was a moon out tonight a blackandwhite patchquilt played over the meadow she caught herself staring she was feeling impossibly good the spare key was missing why would he remove it unless she found a rock and smashed it through the window she had to hurry the valium was taking hold things work out for the best a voice inside her called relax she tried her best to ignore it the glass shattered into the kitchen she reached through the hole knowing where to find the release but nicked her forearm in the process it hurt but it didnt bother her the door swung open to a stranger the cabin might appear abandoned the spare amount of leftover furniture from another era a former hunting cabin perhaps tegg had kept it looking this way intentionally to discourage trespassers from breaking in he was paranoid about trespassers discovering the basement labthe ad hoc surgical suitethough she didnt know why she had never seen another soul anywhere around here although the recovery room they used was in the cellar next to the surgical suite he could be keeping this woman in any of the bedrooms she decided to search the cabin top to bottom unless he had fixed them the upstairs lights didnt work she tried them he hadnt fixed them he kept a flashlight at the top of the cellar stairs she banged her way through the kitchen and found it switched it on she moved quickly through the rooms on the first floor nothing no one she climbed the stairs feeling strangely light and disconnected from her body happy on the top landing she faced two small bedrooms and a tiny bathroom the floor of which was an old chipped linoleum burgundy red with black fleurdelis prints the sink and toilet were discolored and mineralstained the flashlights yellow beam wandered the walls the cold faucet dripped into a patinated teardrop she twisted the handle and it stopped dripping something stirred within hershe could feel the danger here like an animal lifting its head in the forest she sniffed the air it smelled metallic tangy worse she knew that smell blood she felt lightheaded as she stepped toward the wicker hamper the source of that smell she had never known him to use the hamper and this added to her confusion and anxiety typically she brought the surgical laundry back to the clinic from here it then went out with the regular service standing alongside the hamper now towering over it she stopped herself she didnt want to know what was inside it frightened her to imagine what she might find she reached out tentatively took hold of the hampers lid hesitated and then yanked it open suddenly she aimed the flashlight inside at the sight of its contents she shrieked at the top of her lungs and jumped back there in a heap covered in an unbelievable amount of dried blood lay his surgical smock she felt instinctively that this was human bloodsharons blood he had already done the heart something had gonehorribly wrong with the procedure the hamper lid thumped shut pamela felt half crazy the panic and terror rising from inside her attempting to supersede the everincreasing medicated bliss of the valium as she raced downstairs to confirm her suspicions she wondered was he the only one to blame couldnt he blame her as well for refusing to assist her head swam she hurried down the narrow steps that led to the cellar when she reached the bottom she aimed the flashlight at the wall switch as she reached to turn on the lights dried blood the operating room was unlocked impossible suddenly the various evidence she was collecting added up to something else entirely the bloody clothes left in the hamper the unlocked door not like elden someone else must have broken in here and vandalized the place she was afraid to look any farther what was on the other side of the operating room door tentatively using the toe of her shoe she encouraged it to open slowly prepared for a quick retreat light poured into the room from the bare bulb over her head a mess a nightmare a bloody terror it looked like a city hospital emergency room after a gang war she switched on the lights the instruments had not been cleaned up the sternal retractor the scalpels the hemostats the table the floor all covered in an unbelievable amount of dried blood the policewoman had used the term victim pamela had resented it had misunderstood it at the time but now it rang true panic stormed her system contained in part by the drug coursing through her veins she felt pulled in two directions by everything around her on one level she loved elden tegg but now she feared him she felt a loyalty to him but knew she would betray him she wanted to blame him but in part she blamed herself she felt frightened and terrified she felt impossibly at peace a massacre a murder a shock collar it was resting alongside the hemostats she felt a bubble of nervous laughter escape her a shock collar it could mean only one thing a dog not a human not murder no human victim a dog part of his research she had mistrusted him she had doubted his intentions she had allowed the police to sway her just as he had warned how could she have made such assumptions how could she have lost her faith in him so quickly she hated herself for it excited by her discovery thrilled to prove her earlier suspicions incorrect she hurried into the recovery room its walls and ceilings were also encased in plastic the flashlight caught the narrow cot pushed up against the wall and then the window to the outside even at this distance the barking of the dogs from the kennel sounded unnaturally loud she had never noticed this before perhaps it was the valium hearing that barking perhaps she had never listened why wasnt sharon here as she half expected the flashlight illuminated the painted window again and she had her answer then the barking of the dogs registered fully there were no windows in the kennel no chance at escape out the cellar door up the steps across the field toward the quonset hut she clung to the hope that the presence of the shock collar meant something a dog not a human not sharon one less dog in the kennel would prove it and she for one would not feel too sad about that these pit bulls of his were terrorsmany of them trained that way well before he had saved them from death his surgical experiments on them did nothing to improve their disposition having forgotten the key to the kennel she had to run back to the operating room to get it in the process she grew more elated at her discovery of the shock collar she no longer attributed her bliss to the drug she had taken she had forgotten all about it losing her awareness of the fact she crossed a threshold the valium owned her for now elden had done no wrong everything was going to be fine in fact the way she felt things were really looking up the isuzu rode high in the traffic making it an easy target for daphne to follow wherever possible daphne kept at least one car between herself and tegg though by his hurried nearly reckless driving she doubted he was paying much attention to what was behind him he seemed hellbent on getting to where he was going he took north but stayed on it only briefly heading east on he stayed on the interstate through bellevue continuing on toward the she had followed him out of the city limits had driven right out of her legal authority as a policewoman she was a seattle cop out here police authority was divided between king county police and the police departments of the incorporated townships she was technically a civilian now he drove seventy wherever possible the farther away from the city the more isolated she felt if he would only stop for gasif he would only give her a minute or so to make a phone call to call in some backup but he barreled along into the night and she followed a hundred yards back at preston he left the interstate and took the north toward fall city the farther they went the more nervous she became she was in over her head and she knew it what if he did lead her to sharon what then the gun a confrontation in the last six years she had negotiated eleven hostage situations for the department and had a perfect record but those had been team efforts team pressures team resources the only hostage situation she had failed atone that wasnt counted on the department recordshad been her own boldt had solved that one with his weapon but only after the abductor had drawn his knife across her throat was she capable of using the gun as it was made to be used cardboard silhouettes were one thing a human life another thing entirely only minutes later she followed tegg into the small town of fall city and shortly thereafter he turned south on she was alone with him now and she worried he would spot her she fell well behind but with the increased distance she risked losing him they passed spring glen crossed over the dark and sullen tokul river and turned left toward snoqualmie falls they drove through town crossed the railroad tracks and headed south following the tracks less than a mile later his blinker signaled a left turn and the trooper disappeared from sight had he taken this turn with the sole intention of losing her of trapping her was he waiting to see whether she followed or was he oblivious to her presence there were glimpses of moonlight tonight the sky a grid of broken clouds she couldnt continue to follow him as she had been they were too far off the beaten track for that what to do they had passed a tavern on the outskirts of town should she go back and telephone for help risk losing him she slowed a headache beating unmercifully at her temples she switched off her headlights and turned down the darkened lane following his taillights just barely visible a halfmile in front of her it was a macadam road tar mixed with crushed stone when the moon passed behind the clouds it forced her to slow to a crawl when it reappeared she drove quickly closing the distance between them cat and mouse she caught him and lost him caught him and lost him her headache drove spikes down into her neck her calf muscle cramped from carrying the tension there as well the road turned to mud twice she drove past side roads where his taillights and his tracks said hed gone she backed up worried he might spot the backup lights made the turn and followed it was a spiderweb of dirt roads out here mud sprayed loudly onto the undercarriage the frontwheel drive held the car close to the road a left a right she would never find her way out of here if this was a spiderweb she thought then he was the spider and she was the prey perhaps he had her exactly where he wanted her perhaps he had known she was back here all along pamela chase fumbled awkwardly nervouslywith the oversized brass padlock finally inserting and turning the key the dogs were going crazy in there the lock came open with a loud pop she leapt away as a dogs nose and teeth jammed through the crack in the door surprising her biting at her she placed her hand out for the dog to smell it whined it tried for her again and she recognized that nose felix she said did you get out of your cage boy she eased the door open her handher scentleading her felix approached and nuzzled her a few of the other dogs stopped barking she closed the door behind her it smelled horrible in here he hadnt been keeping it clean it smelled wrong not exactly like dogs it was dark and she could not see clearly she switched on the lights the very first pen she looked at was unoccupied and her mind jumped to the immediate conclusion that this dog had been the one to receive the surgery finding an empty pen was exactly what she had hoped forit exonerated elden another warm wave of tranquility passed through her at the sight of it behind her and farther into the structure she heard a collar sound its warning beep and one of the dogs smash into the cage wall she turned to see who was being so rambunctious a woman her hair tangled and matted one eye bandaged her mouth gagged lips worn raw a shock collar locked around her neck pamela screamed the woman screamed soundlessly the dogs began barking ferociously again a bandage covering a kidney scar badly infected by the color sharon pamela asked tentatively the womans one good eye cocked toward her suspiciously untrusting pamela felt weak unable to move without strength this roller coaster between euphoria and horror was nearly intolerable only a moment before the kidney bandage cried out to her how could she have done such a thing was she to be party to a murder and what did that mean about elden had he ever told her the truth about anything she felt sick to her stomachthe smell the pleading expression on this poor womans face and then another wave of calm swept through her and she felt much less upset she could handle this everything was okay and then it struck her again that she was at least partly responsible where did her own involvement stop and teggs begin the woman in the cagesharonlaced her fingers through the wire cage and shook deliberately ignoring the punishment of the shock collar that beeped its warning no apparent pain the dogs were wild with excitement but pamela was used to the dogs she hardly heard them it was this womans exceptional behavior that impressed her and held her interest pamela took several steps closer how could she inflict that kind of punishment on herself and endure it im coming she announced wondering why she was walking not running wondering how she could feel this comfortable pamela seized hold of the lock attempting to communicate to sharon that she intended to get her out of here sharon pointed and nodded violently the key pamela asked is there a key in this building the woman shook her head im going to get you out pamela said confidently unsure where such confidence came from the captive nodded enthusiastically she looked around without a key then what the shovel could she beat the lock apart she walked over to the shovel knowing she should hurry but strangely in no hurry it was okay everything was okay sharon became frantic shouting waving her arms slapping the cement floor hopping up and down god she looked like one of the animals what was this several of the dogs quieted they all began pacing their cages at once sharon kept slapping the cement in an ungainly primitive dance pamela struck the lock with the end of the shovel nothing she tried again im trying she told the frantic woman inside this womans behavior was making her nervous stop it she said only when she identified this fleeting nervousness did she realize what a huge dose of valium it must have beenthere was a gulf between how she should have been and what she actually was feeling she struck the lock with the shovel again nothingnow sharon was shaking her wrist toward the main door pounding the cement again and pointing hysterically toward the door finally pamela understood as she felt a rumble under her feet the dogs barking had covered the approaching sounds but now pamela heard them distinctly a car but if a car it could only be one of two people maybeck or elden and if either of them caught her in here doing this sharon grabbed hold of the cage again her collar sounded and pamela watched as the collar punished her she held on an impossibly long time she pointed emphatically toward the door close the door of course pamela moved quite quickly now surprising herself first toward the door then stopping she returned to the cage and started in with the shovel again she should have never come here she thought all a mistake she glanced toward the door sharon pointed furiously i know pamela said i know what sharon didnt understand was that there was no way to lock that door from the inside the only hope now was to get her free of the cage she never should have gone against him she realized he was too powerful for her she dropped the shovel abandoning her efforts it clanked to the floor she felt terrified of him before she ever saw him the valium did little to help with this fear sharon let out a muffled anguished cry the dogs went completely hysterical pamela wanted to disappear to vanish anything but face his wrath she had glimpsed his anger before she shook with fear unable to imagine how he might react to this the door creaked sharon retreated curling back into a ball in the center of her cage pamela felt like hiding too she watched as a hand pushed open the door she knew that hand daphne had the prelude up to forty which in the dim light of an inconsistent moon seemed more like twice that she careened through puddles sending water up in a torrential spray blurring her windshield and demanding the wipers she had lost him a few seconds earlier his taillights had been distant but visible she had slowed to avoid pressing herself on him when she caught herself giving him too much leeway she had sped back up now he was nowhere to be seen she pushed the car a little harder a little faster dangerous at best given the slippery conditions and the lack of visibility they had been on these backroads for the better part of fifteen minutesit seemed more like an hour there she just caught a glimpse of some lights out of the corner of her eye she craned her neck to look out the mudsplattered side window was that a road a painful cramp stabbed into her neck and locked she cried out her hand just barely tugged the wheel she forced her head back around as the car began a weightless crabbing to the right drifting slowly on all four tires the front end surrendering to momentum and releasing its careful grip like a rock tossed out onto a frozen pond she corrected the wheel to the right waited nothing cut it back nothing drifting like a chain was pulling her off the road she tapped the brakes tentatively and that did it the car seemed to snap the back end swung completely around on hershe was looking back from where she had just come flying backwards now pitch black vertigo perilously close to the ditch mud flying everywhere the horrible sound of machinery doing what it wasnt designed to do she jerked the wheel to the right with authority and bounced her foot off the brake again a rear tire caught on something the front end of the car jumped so fast so hard that it stole the wheel from her hands the front end bounced into the shallow drainage ditch her head slammed hard against the side glass the car came to a grinding halt its engine still running she just sat there for a moment collecting herself checking herself with small movements the flexing of a muscle the movement of a joint she got control of her breathing though her heart was lost to adrenaline it took the better part of a minute to get her vision down to one image no time it suddenly occurred to her in the heat of the moment she had forgotten what she was even doing out here she forced the car into first gearit didnt want to goand let out the clutch there was a bad noise but then the front tires suddenly spun she felt the tire dig a hole in what seemed like a fraction of a second the front end sank perceptibly she tried to back up tried to go forward mired the car rocked once and then dug in deeply one final time she climbed out the car was beached high centered on the lip of the ditch both front tires rutted in up to their hubs she grabbed the keys she kept jumper cables snow chains and a heavyduty black rubber flashlight in the trunk she grabbed the flashlight pocketed the keys and took off at a run through the sloppy mud the flashlight showed her the path of her car an improbable tangle of deep ruts crisscrossed and pretzled that led back to two perfectly straight tire tracks and the arching curve of teggs tires where the fourwheel drive had turned she followed teggs tracks up a road that quickly narrowed she found the edge of the road easier for running though her topsiders became heavy with mud after about fifty yards it narrowed again and the texture became more gravel than mud although it remained spongy the flashlight caught an occasional boot print washed by the recent rains but clearly distinguishable now that she caught onto it it was one long line of boot tracks coming right at hersomeone either exceptionally tall or running fast it was then that for some reason it occurred to her that this was in fact not a road at all it was a driveway the keeper stood in the doorway backlit by moonlight and a finger of fog that reached to the ground sharon had witnessed his entry several times but only once before had he paused there like that emanating a menace that even the dogs seemed to feel sharons eye stung badly a hot shooting pain bit into her side where the bandage covered her scar her neck was hot from the collar her ears were ringing only a few short minutes ago she had been on the verge of being rescued but she shrank from that hope now the keeper was too powerful this young woman was no match for him even though by the way they looked at each other there seemed to be a strong connection between them the dogs remained silent though they continued to pace anxiously the keeper stepped inside and closed the door firmly behind him he called heel the guard dog obeyed circling behind the man and sitting quickly by his side sharon who had lived through hundreds of dangerous incidents while out on the street felt the impending threat that dog represented im sorry the young woman mumbled head down subservient but this isnt right she dared voice i expected so much more of you he said his voice reverberating eerily in the steel building sharon felt invisible he had yet to even glance in her direction instead his full concentration remained focused on this other woman the keeper continued you didnt do as i said you have failed me this is wrong elden she countered for the first time sharon could attach a name to this man this monster it was a strange name and somehow fitting strange to be fully prepared to kill a man whose name you dont even know the needle warmed in her palm you could help me you know you could prove yourself theres work to be done youve gone way too far she said to the cement its over she wouldnt look at him she knew better than to look at him sharon couldnt keep her eyes off him he drew her into himself like a hypnotist pamela he saidand now this young woman had a name as wellsince when do you refuse me the woman looked up at him pamelas face felt hot her brain was like jelly she wanted to resist him but it was so difficult she had worshipped him for so long and now her anger mingled with shame and fear felt like spikes in the middle of her chest her emotions wouldnt stay focused for long another wave of warmth would drive them away who do you think you are she asked clinging to a shard of righteousness a womans life is at stake his face and neck reddened felix panted impatiently how can you say such things hmm i suggest you consider your situation more carefully he said gripping the dogs collar are you frightened the police frightened you didnt they the police sharon thought was it possible pamela stepped up to sharons cage and took hold of the lock open it she said to him get away from there tegg warned in that sharp voice he gave the dogs heavy collar a tug and it came to its feet give me the key ill do it pamela said her voice shaking we can give her the electroshock cant we some ketamine and electroshock we can leave her at a hospital no one the wiser we dismantle everything here and whats there to find it took every bit of her strength to address him like this you said it yourself the police dont have anything theyre fishing is all we can still do this elden we can still get out of this we most certainly cannot i told you theres a contract there are things of which you have no idea i have a plan its all settled settled it cant be settled give me the key of course i wont use your head pamela picked up the shovel we can still save her elden contracts can be broken she felt as if she were dealing with a child this wasnt the same man of even a week ago youre not well she told him away from there he roared she had chosen the wrong words her knees trembled his strength was overwhelming almost like a bright light you cant look at she wanted to please him to help him he stepped toward her felix followed stand back he ordered her heart sank but she felt her feet refuse to obey what was happening to her she raised the shovel and delivered another blow to her joy although the lock remained closed the latch broke a rivet and the door came partially open sharon felt the hair on her arms stand at attention freedom was it possible the keeper mechanically jerked his head toward her and shouted stay right where you are sharon thought of the needle in her hand shed never managed to come up with a plan for the dog but one step at a time she reminded herself pamela said how can you justify taking one life in order to save another what sense is there in that the keepers expression hardened what sense his shoulders went military and he shook his head lift your shirt pamela he repeated remove your shirt now dont question me pamela show it to me his tone was that of a doctorclinical and authoritative pamela stunned sharon by removing her jacket and unbuttoning her shirt allowing it to hang open from that moment on sharon knew it was over pamela had given in she was his below her ribs was a fiveinch scar touch it for me he instructed pamela shook her head in one last try at defiance no i wont do it he thundered tears came to her eyes she reached down and traced the long scar with a quivering fingertip he nodded i saved you hmm i delivered when no one else was able let me tell you this when one faces losing a young friend as precious as individual as you one becomes capable of things he never dreamed possible he experienced one of those tics thenhis head jerking his shoulder lifting his eyes squinting shut sharon had witnessed this once before he straightened himself like a man adjusting his tie and continued as if nothing had happened i told you a little white lie a little fib back then because to do otherwise would have caused you undue anxiety and might have interfered with your recovery hmm do you remember asking me about where i had located your liver hmm i may not have done the actual transplant but i saved your lifeyou know thats true the truth is inescapable is it not it is the biggest burden of all hmm did you sense the truth i suspect you did you must have thought at some point that it hadnt really come from a trauma patient no of course it didnt but i protected you from the truth because i knew how it would hurt you pamela sobbed and sank to her knees she was mumbling to herself but sharon couldnt understand a word thats what im offering you now you know protection but you dont seem to see that protection from them the police your parents your fears but you must join me hmm not go against me i can protect you believe me you lied to me she asked incredulously what did you think happened to anna he asked pamela covered her ears the man raised his voice to her ear did it ever strike you as odd that anna just up and disappeared at the same time you were seriously ill you must have thought of that he said there was an accidenta fatal accidentand there she was he pointed to the floor what was i to do i tested her blood type thats what a godsend is what it was she was your blood type you live because another died and yet you would deny it for someone else nooooo she screamed she came at him with the shovel raised high sharon broke for the door to her cage stop he commanded sharon his finger pointed at her ominously the keeper flickered his wrist next to the dogs eyes he uttered but a single word hit the pit bull sprang forward the keeper dodged the swing of the shovel the dog leaped several feet into the air and knocked pamela to the cement back the keeper ordered but the starving dog would not obey back he demanded sensing his loss of control off of her the dog was wild with hunger and the scent of the blood the keeper lifted the shovel and went after the dog sharon looked away the sounds of the slaughter echoed throughout the building the keeper shouted he struck the dog again and again but the dogs will overcame it all sharon fainted when she awakened it was dark in the kennel she heard a car racing away moving arrows of white light shot through the trees followed by the growing whine of a car engine advancing steadily toward her daphne switched off the flashlight and darted into the trees as that sound grew increasingly louder tegg or some stranger maybe this wasnt a driveway after all the way it seemed to go on forever she hid behind a tree standing completely still as the vehicle passed her breathing competing with the sound of tires in the mud it was the troopertegg wherever he had been for the last half hour he was now leaving she headed back onto the road and took up running again though this time with the light off guided only by the glow of a broken moon she checked over her shoulder repeatedly if he returned the way he had come perhaps he was gone for good if however he turned left at the end of this long road he would come across her car and most certainly return she ran faster rounding two long turns all at once the road spilled out into a clearing the moon played its game of hideandseek disappearing and denying her any sight of what lay ahead it was far too dark to see anything clearly but she edged her way tentatively out into the muddy rutwormed driveway and followed it slowly up a rise a large heavy shape loomed to her right another smaller more angular shape directly ahead the moon cleared the clouds and it was like someone turning on the stage lights ahead of her an old twostory homesteader log cabin to her right the large arcing curve of a quonset hut no lights in the cabin a single vehicle parked that she recognized immediately as belonging to pamela chase a sense of dread filled herhad there been two people in the trooper she had seen the outline of only one had it been tegg or pamela chase could she be certain she switched on the flashlight and sprinted to the cabin drawing her weapon as she went she could feel her heart clear up in her throat she tried to swallow the lump away was sharon here she attempted to blink away the annoying white sparks that interfered with her vision it had been two long years since she had tasted terror she climbed the wooden stairs slipped off the guns safety and made herself alert for the slightest noise a board creaked slightly underfoot the quonset hut exploded in barking it so startled her that she dropped to one knee and trained her gun in that direction the flashlight tucked immediately beneath the weapon for a moment she couldnt catch her breath she was so surprised and startled frightened the dogs howled constantly for the better part of a minute and then gave it up to silence daphne winded from the exhausting run collected herself she stood and circled the perimeter of the cabin sliding her back against the logs rushing quickly across the windows weapon pointed through the glass the kitchen door was open its window broken she edged it open with the toe of her shoe and stepped inside glass crunching beneath her shoes she moved stealthily room to room her weapon and flashlight held as a team jerking around door frames and leveling the gun she climbed the stairs to the tightly confined second floor and continued her search she entered a very small bedroom the floor dotted with mouse pellets and dust balls a mass grave of dead flies was collected at the bottom of the window frame from which one of the panes of glass was missing the wood around it moldy she stepped up to this window and looked out on the quonset hut below hearing a loud hum coming from the building at first she couldnt place it his car returning she wondered panicked by the thought as the moonlight intensified a shadow raced from one end of the quonset hut to the other as if someone had yanked away a huge cover and she identified the source of the sound as a vent stack plugged into the corrugated roof a furnace why heat a quonset huteven a kennel if thats what it was they hadnt had frost in six weeks she hurried down the stairs wondering whether to check the cellar before the quonset hut she had to she descended slowly her pulse thumping in her ears it smelled like dixons autopsy room down here and it terrified her light from the flashlight played off the stone walls the storm doors to the outside were open letting in the night she reached the bottom of the stairs gun poised and turned right nudged open a door stepped inside the light revealed a plastic room a shiny gray it found the overhead surgical light and lowered onto the bloodstained operating table she was sure then what the furnace was for she went off at a sprint up the cellar stairs out into the cool night air she fell to her knees and vomited she stood and ran harder the quonset hut seemed to fade away from her her vision dimmed hyperventilating her feet sloshed through the wet grass she reached the door to the shed the dogs barking frantically and found an enormous padlock containing it she stepped back aimed her weapon and shot four consecutive rounds two hit the lock but did nothing to open it boring holes through the metal to no effect two others penetrated the galvanized metal lost to the inside of the shed when she heard a rhythmic banging obscured by the barking she caught herself immediately and stopped firing what had she been thinking sharon she shouted paying no consideration to the possibility of someonea guard teggbeing nearby daphne reared back and kicked the door repeatedly it didnt budge she grabbed hold of the lock it was hot one shot had struck it cleanly damaging the casing but the lock itself remained intact she circled the building beating on the walls with the butt of her gun three quarters of the way down one wall a return signal echoed back tears streaming from her eyes daphne shouted to the wall im coming in she came completely around the building no other doors deciding the structures only door was far enough away from sharons location inside daphne elected to use the gun one more time she placed the barrels opening directly in contact with the brass lock stretched her arm straight out averted her eyes leaned fully away and squeezed the trigger the dogs were barking so loudly that the discharge sounded more like a hand clap a piece of shrapnel sliced into her lower leg barely noticed as she inspected her target an oversized bullet hole was bored through the center of the lock which otherwise remained intact she slammed it against the door repeatedly frustrated and angry she checked her leg it was a peasized wound the metal lodged inside it was bleeding through not badly with each passing second the pain intensified she knew then that she had to find another way inside that lock wasnt coming off she hurried to pamelas vehicle and climbed inside no key she pounded her fist on the dashboard in frustration she spotted an old tractor grass growing up around it but even from thirty yards away it was apparent that it hadnt run in years she came out of the car limping she circled the building again there had to be another way inside when the furnace kicked off she looked up and realized there was tegg knew the exact location where his cellular came back into range a small rise in the road just prior to maud lake he pulled over leaving the trooper running and dialed wong keis cellular number which was now routed through the vancouver telephone system wong kei answered coldly speak tegg said this is me he looked down at the hand trembling in his lap and wondered if it really belonged to him if anything was really as it seemed felix had massacred pamela one of the few persons he had seen as a part of his futurehis budding young protege had turned her into a bloody pulp she was now inside the first pen contained in two black garbage bags pamela witnessing the slaughter attempting to stop it had drained him our plans are moved forward tegg advised what impossible the man protested tomorrow morning tomorrow morning tonight now tegg declared ill call from the airport expect me around he checked his watch midnight maybe a little after youll have to move quickly it will be two hours and counting by the time i reach you we will have used up half our time impossible the tight voice complained make it happen im on my way he pushed end he stared at the buttons simple message he could find ice in snoqualmie falls he would chain and lock the main gate use the old fire trail at the back of the property as his escape route if he got into a panic about time he could put the harvest off until later sedate sharon hide her in the back seat under a blanket in the far back of the trooper he carried everything necessary for field surgery why not head northenter canada through the logging trails do the harvest somewhere out there get the money from wong keihe needed that money now more than ever stick with the plan the old saying was right there was more than one way to skin a cat a human too if it came to that with the gun returned to its holster and the flashlight protruding awkwardly from her pocket daphne used a planter box stood on end as a ladder and scaled the quonset huts wall to the roof the constant howling of the dogs served to remind her what awaited her inside optimism fueled her sharon was alive when she reached the lower lip of the curved roof she hooked one leg up and over the edge and slid herself carefully onto it it was cold and wet and her clothes were immediately soaked through her cheek pressed to the galvanized roof her fingers groping for purchase she inched her way up to the ridge where she pulled herself up to a straddle with her hands now free she trained the flashlight onto the vent stack and inspected it finding her first bit of encouragement it was surrounded by a poor patchwork of rubber sheet metal and caulk all applied haphazardly through the hole the barking grew louder she stuffed the light under her knee leaned down and pulled on the stack it popped loose almost effortlessly she tore at the materials bending the stack to one side prying open a hole large enough to stuff herself into she poked her head into the hole and gasped with the smell coming up immediately for air she aimed the flashlight inside locating the steel frame of the propane furnace suspended from the ceiling the furnace itself was about the size of a dishwasher beneath it she saw the cyclonewire cage of a dog kennel the dogs red eyes trained up at her the furnaces superstructure offered her a platform for her descent she lowered herself inside her gun snagged on one of the furnaces angleiron struts and threw her off balance the gun ejected from the holster and disappeared into the dark banging somewhere below her instinctively she reached out to try to catch it but hit the hot face of the furnace instead and burned herself she let go and fell crashing onto the top of the dog cage directly below her the dog leapt up snapping viciously at her through the wire she moved and heard the flashlight rolling away from her she pounced for it but only managed to knock it off the cage when it hit the cement floor it flickered off and then back on as it bounced and rolled there across the room the light found a woman stark naked a bandaged eye another bandage on her side leather straps around her head holding a gag in her mouth a heavy collar around her neck sharon was up on her knees her one good eye staring hopefully at daphne an iv running from a bag overhead a large bloodstain was smeared in front of the cage sharon daphne called out in horror could it be sharon shaffer cried with joy daphne saw the other dog then he was not in a cage but loose in the aisle and he was coming right at her teeth bared unable to stomach these speeds boldt chose to look over at lamoia instead the blue police light stuck haphazardly to the dash pulsed a sterile wash across the cars hood reflected back onto their faces the siren wailed loudly but did little to part the traffic ahead of them people ignored sirens for the most part boldt jerked to one side as lamoia cut the wheel sharply and passed another slowmoving vehicle asshole he cursed under his breath this car honked angrily at them as if they were in the wrong lamoia honked back and flipped the guy the bird they had made two stops prior to this pamela chases apartment and elden teggs home the former was deserted the latter in the midst of a dinner party though the front lawn looked as if some teenager had driven across it teggs wife had been evasive but under pressure from boldt had admitted that her husband was not at home having left about an hour earlier when lamoia asked about use of their property in snoqualmie the woman said she wanted to phone her lawyer let me guess boldt said howard chamberland why yes she admitted her face reddening boldt worried about daphne called a patrol car to check the clinic as he and lamoia headed for and snoqualmie falls when it came back to them that no cars were parked in the back lot and that the clinic was locked up tight and dark he telephoned the king county police to alert them that spd homicide had a possible hostage situation north of snoqualmie falls and would appreciate cooperation five minutes later a call came back saying that two fourwheeldrive cruisers would rendezvous with them at the intersection of the burlington northern tracks and state highway an air rescue helicopter an ambulance and the local hospital were all oncall boldt requested that the ambulance join the cruisers at the rendezvous done said the dispatcher not quite mumbled lamoia as he cut the car across three lanes and just barely caught the exit for north boldt shut his eyes and said tell me when its over daphne jumped back avoiding the jaws of the dog his ear was cut his face covered in dried blood her gun was lost having fallen inside the dog pen through a gap between the two cross supports onto which she had dropped from across the room sharon attempted to shout at her through the gag it filled daphne with a sickening pity sharon inched forward on stiff legs and seized hold of the chainlink cyclone fence with both hands a loud buzzer sounded her entire body shook with the jolt of electricity she let go and smiled numb to the current daphne wondered conditioned to the pain sharon nodded proudly daphne wondered insane could she get her out of here could this woman be expected to climb through the hole in the roof one thing at a time she resolved her problem at the moment was making it over to sharons cage while staying out of the jaws of this guard dog she studied her situation thoughtfully recalling from her training so ingrained in her assess the situation difficult but not impossible the roof of the cage stood four to five feet off the cementlow enough that the dog could snap at her but too high for it to actually jump up onto she had to stay at this level up above the dog and she had to get over onto sharons side of the buildingit seemed her only hope to help her though by the lock on the cage it wouldnt be easy she squatted prepared to jump across the wide aisle when sharon took hold of the cage again sounding her collar she did this apparently only to get daphnes attention for she immediately let go and gestured toward the overhead funnel light suspended in the middle of the aisle seeing it daphne understood immediately that sharon had considered every possibility of escape even crossing the aisle they were a team indeed the light looked like a good idea she would try it it was deafening in here frightful the dogs wouldnt stop barking had cindy chapman once been inside this building daphne tried to tune them out to concentrate but it wasnt easy she risked the leaping dog just long enough to reach out and touch the funnel light and get it swinging with each pass she increased its arc until she could grab hold of it which she did she tested it giving it a little of her weight and then tugged down on it it held firm she threw her weight into it and swung across to the other side like tarzan letting go in time to land painfully on the top of the opposing cages the guard dog followed her acrossdancing nipping at her shoes the light bulb broke and fell the pit bull leaped high for it caught it midair and shattered it in its teeth unfazed seeing this daphne thought hungry the flashlight barely threw off enough light to see anything but the few feet immediately in front of it sharons cage daphne opened her eyes wide and moved from one cage to the next reaching sharons unsure how the collars worked daphne carefully lowered her finger through the wire mesh not making contact with it sharon crying now raised her finger and the two touched their fingers hooked and sharon squeezed daphne fought back her own tears she had no idea how much time she might haveall night an hour a few more minutes and knew that she had to make the most of it her top priority was getting the guard dog out of the aisle so she could get herself down to ground level and sharons cage food seemed her most promising weapon she discovered that the farthest pen on this side was stacked high with unopened bags of dried dog food the latches were a mechanism that lifted via a small finger trigger freeing a steel bar bolted to the hinged door sharons was the only cage padlocked daphne slipped off her belt and fished with its buckle for the gate latch but was interrupted by the dog who got his teeth on it seeing this sharon distracted him by banging on her cage and hopping up and down this agitated the other dogs as well the guard dog head lifted and barking patrolled the center aisle irritated and confused daphne hooked the latch and the door came open the guard dog approached her stretching his neck and barking get in there she said lowering her hand to tempt him he snapped at her and she pulled back but he did not enter the cage despite the bags of food he barked erratically one distrustful eye on the stacked contents the other on daphne she tore loose a bloodied piece of her pant leg and stuffed it between the chain link landing it directly on top of one of the bags the suspicious dog stopped barking and edged his way forward nose twitching the other dogs went silent as well inside daphne leaped down into the center aislereeling from her wounded legand slammed the cage door shut trapping him sharon applauded hopping around her cage like an ape the dog lapped up the piece of pant leg and then tore open a bag of food and gorged himself the latch on sharons cage was broken the small padlock now secured to the chainlink wire daphne wondered whether unlike the padlock outside this smaller one might succumb to being shot open she turned and studied the placement of her gun inside the occupied cage below the furnace there was a gap between a vertical post and the chain link that appeared wide enough to shove her arm through but in the time that would take it seemed the dog would win the contest she retrieved a shovel that was leaning next to sharons cage and poked the handle through this gap the pit bull locked onto the handle pulling and pushing preventing daphne from properly directing it she wrestled it free and then tried again but with the same frustrating resultsthe pit bull interfered and the gun remained at bay she hooked the shovels handle on the gun and pulled managing to skip the gun a foot closer to her it was within an arms length now within reach if she dared endure the punishment that dog would give her the flashlight went dead daphne grabbed for it shook it and it came back on sharon hopped up and down again frightened she pointed alarmingly toward the door she placed her hands against the cement daphne felt the cement it was vibrating the dogs still quiet starting pacing in their cages a car her thoughts raced ahead he would see the damaged lock but it would appear no one had made it inside she looked up at the furnaces exhaust stackthe ceiling was black tar paper the hole there impossible to distinguish how much time did she have seconds she took a deep breath steeled herself for the pain and went for the gun shoving her hand into the dog pen the dog came after her arm her fingers brushed the weapons handstock the jaws opened white teeth a dark throat she grabbed hold of the gunshe had it the dog took a piece of her arm the gun snagged on the wire and bounced back inside lost the vibration stopped he was here the dogs circled their cages she had to hide she crossed over to the food pen the guard dog would have to be released in order to return things as they were before the flashlight she retrieved the flashlight placed the shovel back and ran to the far cage where felix was still feeding from outside came the highpitched whine of a car engine revving she swung open the cage door and ducked in behind it as the dog spun and charged out sharon shook her cage savagely and briefly diverted the dogs attention away from daphne who came around the door and pulled it shut closing herself inside she switched off the flashlight and hid herself between the columns of stacked dog food bags there was a tremendous crash edlen teggs trooper broke through the far end of the kennel blowing a sixfoot hole in the wall he left the headlights on as he climbed out carrying an oversized pistol that it took daphne a moment to recognize as a dart gun the dogs went absolutely silent daphnes ears were ringing as tegg said calmly to sharon shaffer im back he glanced quickly and nervously around the structure waving the dart gun before him i see we had a visitor while i was gone hmm he spun around and faced the trooper and the headlights worried that his adversary might attack him from the gaping hole the car had caused off for reinforcements or waiting for me hmm he remained extremely distracted jerking his head back and forth between sharon and the trooper cat got your tongue he asked sharon inching toward her cage come on come on come on he encouraged waving her forward in the cage clearly intending her for his hostagefor cover hurry he was forced to switch the dart gun to his right hand while he fished for the key and this made him extremely nervous he waved the oversized pistol around attempting to cover both sides of the car paranoid he managed to get the key in the lock stay he directed felix as the dog edged toward freedom heel he commanded the dog obeyed though cautiously tegg removed the lock grabbed the collars remote wand and shocked sharon immediately daphne lost sight of sharon briefly as she fell back to the cement disconnect the iv tegg directed needle and all she obeyed he shocked her again apparently to weaken her and she looked weakened although daphne had seen her take much more than this by grabbing hold of the fence a ruse he shocked her yet again youll do exactly as i say he commanded she nodded eagerly good were going to get in the car you in front of me youll be weak on your feet but you must not fall hmm ill punish you he said tripping the warning button she nodded he opened the cage sharon moved tentatively forward were going away he said its better this way anyway he added daphne glanced across at her gun a second or two to get out of this cage another one or two to cross the aisle yet another to go for the gun five seconds at the least possibly longeran eternity for that guard dog a lifetime she thought without that dog in the equation she could take on tegg by herself handtohand if necessary but the dog swung the equation heavily in his favor even so if they made it to the car sharon was gone everything lost sharon came out of the cage daphne could feel her pain as she forced herself to stand she took one tentative step forward tegg carrying the remote in one hand the dart pistol in the other followed her slowly doing fine he said daphne went for it she leapt forward wormed her fingers through the chain link and opened the latch she swung the door open and dove across the center aisle shoving her arm beneath the chain link and straight into the opposing pen out of the corner of her eye she saw teggs reaction her hand groped for the gun the pit bull attacked but this time she got the safety off and fired the dog squealed and retreated daphne freed the gun and turned in time to aim at the guard dog who skidded to a stop as tegg hollered sit he had sharon by the neck using her as a screen the dart gun aimed around her he was at a disadvantage here he had but one shot and it wouldnt kill her immediately his only trump was sharon that dog was aching to charge tegg dragged sharon toward an adjacent cage two dogs daphne thought dont do it she advised her attention split between the guard dog only a few feet from her and its master his hand groped for the latchhe too knew that two dogs were nearly impossible to stop dont she warned switching her aim from tegg to the dog in front of her would you actually shoot a dog he asked she shot felix dead once to drop him once more to finish him off tegg cried loudly in protest you killed him he stared down at the dog in disbelief and repeated it take your hand off that cage she instructed he obeyed good they were getting somewhere she added up her previous shotsfive outside one in the pen two for the guard dog eightonly to realize she had but one bullet left but tegg didnt know that she raised the gun and aimed it directly at tegg sharon wrestled to get free no tegg ordered two years ago daphne had been in the clutches of a madman boldt with the gun now the roles were reversed she faced up to the reality of killing tegg she glanced down at the poor dog god it was still alive its paw twitched whats the use she asked tegg she had to get him talking now she resorted to negotiation the only solution she knew to such a standoff what if my partners outside the headlights almost blinded her could she get off a clean shot then hes a little bit slow tegg said slow she asked how long for whatevers in that toy to take effect she asked indicating the dart pistol this is no toy she said placing her other hand onto the beretta prepared to risk a kill shot to the head it was a tricky shot easy to miss even in the best light the most controlled environment but no matter what he wasnt going to put sharon into that car with him the dog is still alive she said you can help him youve struck a lung he will suffocate on his own blood finish him you can still save him doctor let sharon go she advised it was a good distance for a head shot the light was bad but the distance good she couldnt hold the gun up like this much longer it grew heavy quickly but with it lowered to her side shed have no chance of hitting him cleanly she kept it elevated tell me about thomas kent she said using the name of the man he had killed on the operating table in medical school stunned he loosened his hold on sharon daphne took another step forward another few feet and she could risk the head shot youre a wicked little woman arent you he said raising his own weapon it was you with pamela wasnt it of course it was you killed her you know without you she would still be alive the news of pamelas death shocked daphne and his attempt to stick her with guilt worked for she understood she had pushed pamela hardtoo hard knowingly she was going to lose the gunshe couldnt hold it up any longer if she lowered it he would shoot her sharon winked her one good eye and looked down only then did daphne notice the needle in her hand sharon leaned her head back against tegg and looked up at him briefly he glanced down at her she grinned through the leather muzzle and drove the needle into teggs eye sharon broke loose daphne fired but missed wildly as tegg dropped the dart gun and reached for the needle he extricated it with an earpiercing shriek and reached for the shovel he leveled it once onto sharon who had fallen and was crawling toward the car she buckled with the blow daphne dove at him he swung the shovel at her and caught her sideways splaying her against the cage but lost his balance he raised it againthis time aiming to come down on daphnes head daphne seized hold of the dart gun the shovel reached its apex next stop he was sure to crush her skull summoning the last of her resolve sharon sprang the few feet across the cement going for his legsone hand slid under his pant leg as the other groped for and found the electric fence the charge surged through herthrough them bothand she would not let go the buzzer on her collar cried out tegg went rigid and with the pain the shovel suspended above him eyes white jaws locked open in what began as a silent scream and then turned deafening daphne squeezed the trigger and fired the dart gun went off with a dull pop the white cottony rabbits tail protruded from teggs chest where the dart lodged no he screamed scooting backwards on the cement as if he could get away from it escape it only he knew what drug that dart contained he pulled it out and dropped it onto the cement prior to the first convulsion too much he said frantically knowing the dosage terrified staring into daphnes eyes as if she could help him too much too much his whole body jumped waves of the convulsions passed through him too much he repeated jolted again but then his mouth wouldnt move his eyes remained fixed open dead or a result of the drug his body went limp then rigid in an increasing series of convulsions it stopped completely daphne dragged herself over to sharon and rolled her over she was hemorrhaging daphne rode with her in the helicopter though the paramedic protested against it claiming there were rules to follow once airborne though he kept trying to treat daphne as well but she wouldnt have any of it daphne held sharons hand it was cold and she worried she knew what that meant several times a strange weightless feeling passed over daphne and she wondered each time whether it was the helicopter or sharons spirit leaving her body she would glance at the medic and he in turn at the various monitors and he would offer a thumbsup and again she would wonder does that mean shes gone up or shes okay she wasnt sure exactly what sharon hoped for in life and she thought that tragic because she would have wished it for her if only she knew what do any of us wish for that really matters she mused and she answered herself another day one more day what the paramedic shouted over the roar of the blades friday february dr ronald dixon cloaked in a surgical smock recited his actions as he worked on teggs dead body boldt tuned out the autopsy details as lead detective his presence was required by lawbut no one said he had to pay attention it was three in the morning an unusual time for such a procedure but dixie had rallied without complaint there were six people in the medical examiners waiting room more expected boldt felt thrilled at such a turnout the world wasnt such a bad place when you knew the right people the heat from the overhead light felt like that of a hot sun it shone down on the naked body there was nothing pretty about this sight bleached skin pieces of it folded open technical words spoken in an unbroken litany death reduced to detail he had found the three of them in the quonset hut only minutes after the shooting there were more ambulances a coroners wagon crime scene crews even a fire engine though no one knew why the road became impassable two tow trucks had been called into service sharon shaffer had suffered not only a hemorrhage but a ruptured kidney from the blow of the shovel leaving her without a backup she had lost a great deal of blood a sticker on the back of elden teggs drivers license indicated he was an organ donor blood type abnegative of the people in the waiting room one was a woman from the lions eye bank two were part of a lung team that had flown up from portland but to boldts thinking the most important was the kidney specialist from the uteggs kidney was destined for sharon shaffer a cardiac crew was enroute from spokane over the next three hours elden tegg would make his final contributions i hate autopsies said boldt dixie said just wait until we open those plastic bags me no way boldt found his first smile in a long while ive saved that for lamoia tuesday february valentines day daphne suggested lunch on bainex bridge island and boldt agreed with lizs blessings in part to try to talk her out of quitting he brought miles along in a stroller she accused him of bringing his child as a chaperon and he allowed that this was partly true she limped from her bad leg she wore a blue rain jacket the kind a backpacker would wear blue jeans and twotone leather deck shoes with rawhide laces she wore no scarf around her neck allowing the scar to show and boldt knew this was a different woman whats this about a job offer i thought we were a team she didnt answer that the ferry horn sounded miles started crying daphne walked over to the rail and looked out across the textured expanse of gray green water the city grew progressively smaller behind them a beautiful skyline and rolling hills covered in toy houses boldt and miles joined her at the rail she watched the horizon he watched her miles played with some plastic balls attached to the stroller this thing was the bmw of strollers liz had picked it out after exhaustive research we bought a piano boldt said though he didnt tell her why not exactly that reminded him that there were things they hid from each other now and that was okay he said you get me on the force and then you quit thats hardly fair shoswitz would cry foul she spoke just loudly enough to be heard above the wind and the constant vibration of the engines she rejected the kidney considering the source he joked can you blame her shes on a list now number five on a list i know that he said soberly what if shes too far down the list did she live through all that just to die her shes a fighter daffy she nodded faintly and whispered this was why he was in business in the first place if anyone can beat this yeah yeah she interrupted you sound just like dr light horse well maybe shes right five seagulls flew just off the rail miles pointed one of the passengers threw a piece of a hostess cupcake at them even seagulls are subjected to junk food boldt said to her but she didnt smile she didnt even seem to notice i brought a kite along he tried she stared off he said did einstein tell you about the fish for the kite he didnt have to i can smell it its an old trick of mine im full of tricks mostly old ones she didnt smile at this either so he had lost his touch another sign of change or age or both even if we should lose her daffy shes made a difference she has touched hundreds of lives at the shelter more since this story broke organ banks have been flooded with donors with more organs people like tegg are out of business that was her doing you cant knock that we should all have that kind of effect he added not that were going to lose her i love you she said still looking at the horizon as a friend she added smiling for the first time likewise always will think so know so once shes better she said strongly im off to london for this new job hostage negotiator so ive heard i may stay over there i dont know have you ever been to london the way it works he said bending toward his bag and hoping that she hadnt heard his voice catch is that you get the kite up good and high you get it way the hell up there then you tie the fish to the line and take up some slack and toss the fish overboard the drag on the fish in the water supports the line and flies the kite the kite sails out to sea all by itself sometimes for hours maybe for days i know youre mad about me quitting she said we can try it off the stern the wind is best there she said i suppose if youre lucky itll sail completely around the world and come right back to you this time he didnt answer she added you know it hurt more to kill that dog than to kill him is that possible what does that make me honest which is more than most of us you think she has a chance its all any of us have can i get a hug is that allowed boldt said better ask him and pointed to miles who clapped she came into his arms then and held him tightly she sobbed people stared he didnt care let them boldt cried too but for his own reasons his life was right now okay on track again and he had her to thank for some of it ill miss you he whispered miles clapped again and daphne laughed it was good to hear that in the end the kite trick worked miles fell asleep in the stroller the kite sailed off toward the horizon growing smaller and smaller people pointed some people clapped miles slept through it all a few weeks later daphne followed it into the sky and now for the good part this was where sergeant lou boldt threw out all convention where the textbooks took a backseat to experience and where he found out who in the lecture hall was listening and who was asleep he raised his voice a big man boldts words bellowed clear back to the makeout seats without the need of the mike clipped to his tie everything ive told you in the past few weeks concerning evidence investigative procedure chain of custody and chain of command is worthless a few heads snapped upmore than he had expected worthless unless you learn to read the crime scene to know the victim to listen to and trust your own instincts to feel with your heart as much as think with your head to find a balance between the two if it was all in the head then we would not need detectives the lab technicians could do it all conversely if it was all in the heartif we could simply empathize with the suspect and say yup you did it then who would need the lab nerds a few of the studious types busily flipped pages boldt informed them you wont find any of this in your textbooks thats just the point all the textbooks in the world are not going to clear a caseonly the investigator can evidence and information is nothing without a human being to analyze organize and interpret it thats you thats me there comes a time when all the information must be set aside there comes a time when passion and instinct take over its the stuff that cant be taught but it can be learned heart and mindones worthless without the other he paused here wondering if these peachfuzz students could see beyond the fortyfouryearold slightly paunchy homicide cop in the wrinkled khakis and the tattered sport coat that hid a pacifier in its side pocket at the same time he listened to his own words reverberating through the lecture hall wondering how much he dare tell them did he tell them about the nightmares the divorces the ulcers and the politics the hours the salary the penetrating numbness with which the veterans approached a crime scene light flooded an aisle as a door at the rear of the hall swung open and a lanky kid wearing oversize jeans and a rugby shirt hurried toward the podium casting a stretched shadow reaching boldt he passed him a pink telephone memo a sea of students looking on boldt unfolded and read it volunteer park after class ill wait fifteen minutesdm volunteer park he wondered his curiosity raised why not the offices daphne matthews was anything but dramatic as the departments forensic psychologist she was cool controlled studied patient articulate strong intelligent but not dramaticnot like this the curious faces remained fixed on him a love letter he said winning a few laughs but not many cops werent expected to be funnysomething else they would have to learn volunteer park is perched well above seattles downtown cluster of towering highrises and the graygreen curve of elliott bay that sweeps out into the islandriddled estuary of puget sound a large reservoir acting as a reflecting pond is terraced below the parking lot and lookout that fronts the museum which had been under reconstruction for months on its way to housing the citys asian collection boldt parked his aging departmentissued fourdoor chevy three spaces away from her red prelude which she maintained showroom clean she wasnt to be found in her car which left only one possibility the water towers stone facade rose several stories to his left wellkept beds of flowering shrubs and perennials surrounded its footing like gems in a setting the grass was a phenomenal emerald green unique he thought to seattle and portland maybe ireland too he had never been summer was just taking hold every living thing seemed poised for change the sky was a patchwork quilt of azure blue and cotton white the clouds moving in swiftly from the west low and fast a visitor might think rain but a local knew better not tonight cold maybe if it cleared he saw an unfamiliar male face behind the iron grate in one of the towers upper windows and waited a minute for this person and his companion to descend and leave the structure once they had he chose the stairway to his right ascending a narrow chimney of steep steps wedged between the brick rotunda to his right and the riveted steel hull of the water tank to his left the painted tank and the tower that surrounded it were enormous perhaps forty or fifty feet high and half again as wide with each step boldts heart pounded heavier he was not in the best shape or maybe it was because she had elected to step outside the system and that couldnt help but intrigue him or maybe it was personal and had nothing to do with the shop he and daphne had been close oncetoo close for what was allowed of a married man they still were close but mention of that one night never passed their lips a month earlier she had surprised him by telling him about a new relationship after bill gates got married owen adler became the reigning bachelor prize of the northwest having gone from espresso cart to the fastestgrowing beverage and food business in the western region he leased his own plane owned a multimilliondollar estate overlooking shilshole marina and now quite possibly the heart and affections of daphne matthews had her note been worded any other way had she not chosen such an isolated location boldt would have been convinced that her request was nothing more than some lover butterflies in another two hours volunteer park would be a drug and sex bazaar despite its view the tower was not a place frequented by the pinstriped set she had clearly chosen it carefully daphne was not given to acts of spontaneity she desired a clandestine meetingand he had to wonder why he reached the openair lookout at the top of the tower it had a cement floor and evenly spaced viewing windows crosshatched with heavy gauge steel to prevent flyers from testing their wings or projectiles from landing on passersby she held her arms crossed tightly accentuating an anxiety uncommon in her her brown hair spilled over her face hiding her eyes and when she cleared it he saw fear where there was usually the spark of excitement her squareshouldered assertive posture collapsed in sagging defeat she wore the same blue slacks and cotton sweater as he had seen her wearing at work she had not been to her houseboat yet what is it he asked worried by this look of hers her chin cast a shadow hiding the scar on her neck she did not answer immediately its a potential black hole she explaineda difficult if not impossible case to solve and with political overtones and then he understood she had bypassed the proper procedures to give him a chance to sidestep this investigation before he formally inherited it at the cop shop why she would have a black hole in the first place confused him the departments psychologist did not lead investigations she kept cops from swallowing barrels and profiled the loonies that kept boldt and the others chasing body bags she assisted in interrogations she could take any side of any discussion and make a convincing argument out of it she was the best listener he knew she handed him a faxthe first of what appeared to be several that she removed from a briefcase soup is good food for some she told him that was the first threat he received adler boldt said filling in the blank she nodded her hair trailing her movements daphne matthews had grace even when frightened innocuous enough he said she handed him the next saying yes but not for long suicide or murder take your pick no cops no press no tricks or you will carry with you the blood of the innocent it could be nothing boldt said though his voice belied this thats exactly what adler said she replied angrily lumping them together boldt did not want to be lumped in with owen adler ill give you one thing when you say black hole you mean black hole faxed threats he thought in the top left of the page of thermal paper he read a date and time in a tiny typeface to the right page of good luck tracing this he thought she handed him a third he did not want it quite a collection he said boldts nerves unraveled from time to time and when it happened he defaulted to stupid oneliners soup is bad food if adler foods is out of business within days and all of the money is gone and you are dead and buried there will be no senseless killing the choice is yours how many days has it been it was the first question that popped into his head though it was answered by the date in the corner he counted the weeks in his head the thirty days had expired you see the way he worded it looking down at her feet she spoke softly dreamy and terrified her lover was the target of these threats and despite her training she clearly was not prepared for how to handle it the more common threat would be if adler foods is not out of business within thirty days you see the difference her bailiwick not his he felt tempted to remind is that significant he played along because she had fragile written all over her to me its significant so is the attempt in each fax to place the blame firmly with owen its his decision his choice when she looked up at him he saw that she held back tears daffy he offered stepping closer owen and i are not going to see each other sociallyfor a while me being police and all she wanted it to sound casual but failed we have to take him seriously now boldt felt a chill do we she handed him another i am waiting i suggest you do not you will have to live with your choice others will not be so lucky its the first time hes mentioned himself boldt noted she handed him the last of the group that one was sent four days ago this one arrived this morning your indecision is costly it can and will get much worse than this below this on the fax was a copy of a newspaper article todays paper she explained the headline read infections baffle doctors two children hospitalized he had read the short article quickly theyre very sick she told him it can and will get much worse than this she quoted he looked up this is his offer of proof is that what youre thinking he means to be taken seriously i dont get it he complained frustrated why didnt you bring this in sooner owen didnt want to believe it she took back the faxes possessively her hand trembled the second one warns against involving us she meant cops she meant that the reason for them meeting here not in the fifthfloor offices was that she still was not sure how to handle this an adler employee boldt said past or present an employee is the most likely owen has fowler working on it she meant kenny fowler formerly of major crimes now adlers chief of security boldt liked kenny fowler and said so better yet he was good police or had been at one time she nodded and toyed with a silver ring fashioned as a porpoise that she wore on her right hand i misjudged him she said so quietly that boldt leaned in to hear as she repeated herself daphne was not one to mumble are you okay sure she lied a black hole absorbing energy admitting no lightpure darkness he realized that he had already accepted it and he wanted to blame her for knowing him so well talk to me he said nervous irritated youre right about it being an employee thats the highest percentage bet but typically it involves extortion not suicide demands henry happle owens counsel wants it handled internally where theres no chance of press leakage no police involvement nothing to violate the demands this sounded a little too much like the party line and it bothered him it was not like her to voice the opinions of others as her own and he had to wonder what kind of man was henry happle that he seemed to carry so much influence with her thats why i have to be so careful in dealing with you happle wants fowler to handle this internally owen overruled him this morning he suggested this meetingopening a dialogue but it was not an easy decision we cant be sure this newspaper story is his doing boldt told her he may have just seized upon a convenient headline maybe she clearly believed otherwise and boldt trusted daphnes instincts heart and mind he was reminded of his lecture whats fowler doing about it boldt asked he doesnt know about this meeting not yet he like happle advised against involving us hes looking to identify a disgruntled employeebut hes been on it a month now hes had a few suspects but none of them has panned out his loyalty is to the company henry happle writes his paychecks not owenif you follow me boldts irritation surfaced if this news story is his doing id say were a little late im to blame owen asked me for my professional opinion i classified the threats as low risk i thought whoever it was was blowing smoke proper use of the language the faxes are sent by portable computer from pay phones fowler traced the last two to pay phones on pill hill thats a decent enough neighborhood what that tells us is that in all probability were dealing with an educated affluent white male between the ages of twentyfive and forty the demands seemed so unrealistic that i assumed our boy was venting some anger nothing more owen went along with that he put kenny on it and tried to forget it i screwed this up lou she crossed her arms tightly again and her breasts rode high in the cradle again she quoted it can and will get much worse than this her voice echoed slightly in the cavernous enclosure circling inside his thoughts like horses on a carousel a black hole his now you want me to look into it ill look into it he offered reluctantly unofficially you know i cant do that daffy please im not a rentacop neither are you were fifth floor you know the way it works please i cant do that for very long he qualified thank you if either of these kids die daffy he left it dangling there like one of the many broken cobwebs suspended from the cement ceiling i know she avoided his gaze youll share everything with me no stonewalling agreed well maybe not everything he corrected it won a genuine smile from herand he was glad for thatthough it deserted her as quickly as it had come his frantic footfalls on the formed stairs sounded like the beating of bats wings as he descended at a run the newspaper article had listed one of the hospitals for lou boldt the victim was where every investigation began
