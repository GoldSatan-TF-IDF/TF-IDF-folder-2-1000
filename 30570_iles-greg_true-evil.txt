greg iles true evil in memory mike mcgraw and ryan buttross true evil has a face you know and a voice you trust anonymous chapter alex morse charged through the lobby of the new university medical center like a doctor to a code call but she was no doctor she was a hostage negotiator for the fbi twenty minutes earlier alex had deplaned from a flight from charlotte north carolina to jackson mississippi a flight prompted by her older sisters sudden collapse at a little league baseball game this year had been plagued by injury and death and there was more to comealex could feel it sighting the elevators she checked the overhead display and saw that a car was descending she hit the call button and started bouncing on her toes hospitals she thought bitterly shed practically just gotten out of one herself but the chain of tragedy had started with her father five months ago jim morse had died in this very hospital after being shot during a robbery two months after that alexs mother had been diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer she had already outlived her prognosis but wasnt expected to survive the week then came alexs accident and now grace a bell dinged softly and the elevator opened a young woman wearing a white coat over street clothes leaned against the rear wall in a posture of absolute exhaustion intern alex guessed shed met enough of them during the past month the woman glanced up as alex entered the car then looked down then she looked up again alex had endured this double take so many times since the shooting that she no longer got angry just depressed what floor asked the young woman raising her hand to the panel and trying hard not to stare neuro icu said alex stabbing the with her finger im going down to the basement said the intern who looked maybe twentysixfour years younger than alex but itll take you right up after that alex nodded then stood erect and watched the glowing numbers change above her head after her mothers diagnosis shed begun commuting by plane from washington dcwhere she was based thento mississippi to relieve grace who was struggling to teach fulltime and also to care for their mother at night unlike j edgar hoovers fbi the modern bureau tried to be understanding about family problems but in alexs case the deputy director had made his position clear time off to attend a funeral was one thing regularly commuting a thousand miles to be present for chemotherapy was another but alex had not listened shed bucked the system and learned to live without sleep she told herself she could hack the pressure and she didright up until the moment she cracked the problem was she hadnt realized shed cracked until she caught part of a shotgun blast in her right shoulder and face her vest had protected the shoulder but her face was still an open question for a hostage negotiator alex had committed the ultimate sin and shed come close to paying the ultimate price because the shooter had fired through a plateglass partition what would have been a miraculous escape being grazed by a couple of pellets that could have blown her brains out but hadnt became a lifealtering trauma a blizzard of glass tore through her cheek sinuses and jaw lacerating her skin and ripping away tissue and bone the plastic surgeons had promised great things but so far the results were less than stellar theyd told her that in time the angry pink worms would whiten they could do little to repair the punctate depressions in her cheek and that laymen wouldnt even notice the damage alex wasnt convinced but in the grand scheme of things what did vanity matter five seconds after she was shot someone else had paid the ultimate price for her mistake during the hellish days that followed the shooting grace had flown up to dc three times to be with alex despite being exhausted from taking care of their mother grace was the family martyr a genuine candidate for sainthood the irony was staggering tonight it was grace lying in an intensive care unit fighting for her life and why certainly not karma shed been walking up the steps of a stadium to watch her tenyearold son play baseball when she collapsed seconds after she hit the stairs she voided her bladder and bowels a cat scan taken forty minutes later showed a blood clot near graces brain stem the kind of clot that too often killed people alex had been swimming laps in charlotte when she got word having been transferred there as punishment duty after the shooting her mother was too upset to be coherent on the phone but shed communicated enough details to send alex racing to the airport when the first leg of her flight touched down in atlanta alex had used her treo to call graces husband whom shed been unable to reach before boarding the plane bill fennell explained that while the neurological damage had initially not looked too badsome rightside paralysis weakness mild dysphasiathe stroke seemed to be worsening which the doctors said was not uncommon a neurologist had put grace on tpa a drug that could dissolve clots but also carried serious risks of its own bill fennell was a commanding man but his voice quavered as he related this and he begged alex to hurry when her plane landed in jackson alex called bill again this time he sobbed as he related the events of the past hour though still breathing on her own grace had lapsed into a coma and might die before alex could cover the fifteen miles from the airport a panic unlike any she had known since childhood filled her chest though the plane had only begun its taxi to the terminal alex snatched her carryon from beneath the seat and marched to the front of the when a flight attendant challenged her she flashed her fbi creds and quietly told the man to get her to the terminal asap when she cleared the gate she sprinted down the concourse and through baggage claim then jumped the cab queue flashed her creds again and told the driver shed give him to drive a hundred miles an hour to the university medical center now here she was stepping out of the elevator on the fourth floor sucking in astringent smells that hurled her four weeks back in time when hot blood had poured from her face as though from a spigot at the end of the corridor waited a huge wooden door marked neurology icu she went through it like a firsttime parachutist leaping from a plane steeling herself for free fall terrified of the words she was almost certain to hear im sorry alex but youre too late the icu held a dozen glasswalled cubicles built in a ushape around the nurses station several cubicles were curtained off but through the transparent wall of the fourth from the left alex saw bill fennell talking to a woman in a white coat at six feet four bill towered over her but his handsome face was furrowed with anxiety and the woman seemed to be comforting him sensing alexs presence he looked up and froze in midsentence alex moved toward the cubicle bill rushed to the door and hugged her to his chest shed always felt awkward embracing her brotherinlaw but tonight there was no way to avoid it and no reason really tonight they both needed some kind of contact an affirmation of family unity you must have taken a helicopter he said in his resonant bass voice i cant believe you made it that fast is she alive shes still with us bill said in a strangely formal tone shes actually regained consciousness a couple of times shes been asking for you alexs heart lifted but with hope came fresh tears the woman in the white coat walked out of the cubicle she looked about fifty and her face was kind but grave this is graces neurologist bill said im meredith andrews said the woman are you the one grace calls kk alex couldnt stop her tears kk was a nickname derived from her middle name which was a family appellation karoli yes but please call me alex alex morse special agent morse bill said in an absurd interjection has grace asked for me alex asked wiping her cheeks youre all she can talk about is she conscious not at this moment were doing everything we can but you should prepare yourself fordr andrews gave alex a lightningfast appraisalyou should prepare for the worst grace had a serious thrombosis when she was brought in but she was breathing on her own and i was encouraged but the stroke extended steadily and i decided to start thrombolytic therapy to try to dissolve the clot this can sometimes produce miracles but it can also cause hemorrhages elsewhere in the brain or body i have a feeling that may be happening now i dont want to risk moving grace for an mri shes still breathing on her own and thats the best hope we have if she stops breathing were ready to intubate immediately i probably should have done it alreadydr andrews glanced at billbut i knew she was desperate to talk to you and once shes intubated she wont be able to communicate with anyone shes already lost her ability to write words alex winced dont be shocked if she manages to speak to you her speech center has been affected and she has significant impairment i understand alex said impatiently we had an uncle who had a stroke can i just be with her i dont care what her condition is i have to be with her dr andrews smiled and led alex into the room as she reached the door alex turned back to bill wheres jamie with my sister in ridgeland ridgeland was a whiteflight suburb ten miles away did he see grace fall bill shook his head somberly no he was down on the field he just knows his mothers sick thats all dont you think he should be here alex had tried to keep all judgment out of her voice but bills face darkened he seemed about to snap at her but then he drew a deep breath and said no i dont when alex kept staring at him he lowered his voice and added i dont want jamie to watch his mother die of course not but he should have a chance to say goodbye hell get that bill said at the funeral alex closed her eyes and gritted her teeth bill you cant we dont have time for this he nodded into the room where dr andrews stood waiting alex walked slowly to the edge of graces bed the pale face above the hospital blanket did not look familiar and yet it did it looked like her mothers face grace morse fennell was thirtyfive years old but tonight she looked seventy its her skin alex realized its like wax drooping wax she had the sense that the muscles that controlled her sisters face had gone slack and would never contract again graces eyes were closed and to alexs surprise she felt this was a mercy it gave her time to adjust to the new reality however fleeting that reality might be are you all right dr andrews asked from behind her yes ill leave you with her then alex glanced at the bank of crts monitoring graces life functions heartbeat oxygen saturation blood pressure god knew what else a single iv line disappeared beneath a bandage on her forearm alexs wrist ached at the sight she wasnt sure what to do and maybe it didnt matter maybe the important thing was just to be here you know what this tragedy has taught me asked the familiar bass voice alex jumped but tried to hide her discomfiture she hadnt realized bill was still in the room and she hated showing any sign of weakness what she said though she didnt really care about the answer money isnt really worth anything all the money in the world wont make that blood clot go away alex nodded distantly so what the hell have i been working for bill asked why havent i just kicked back and spent every second i could with grace grace probably asked the same question a thousand times alex thought but it was too late for regrets a lot of people thought bill was a cold fish alex had always thought he tended to be maudlin could i be alone with her for a while alex asked not taking her eyes from graces face she felt a strong hand close on her shoulderthe wounded shoulderand then bill said ill be back in five minutes after hed gone alex took graces clammy hand in hers and bent to kiss her forehead she had never seen her sister so helpless in fact she had never seen grace close to helpless grace was a dynamo crises that brought others lives to a standstill hardly caused her to break stride but this was different this was the endalex could tell she knew it the way she had known when james broadbent went down after she was shot james had watched alex charge into the bank just seconds ahead of the goorder for the hostage rescue team and he had gone in right behind her he saw her take the shotgun blast but instead of instantly returning fire at the shooter hed glanced down to see how badly alex was hurt for that concern hed caught the second blast square in the chest he wasnt wearing a vest hed taken it off upon learning that the hrt was going in and the shotgun chopped his heart and lungs into something you saw behind a butchers counter why did he look down alex wondered for the millionth time why did he follow me in at all but she knew the answer broadbent had followed her because he loved herfrom a distance true but the emotion was no less real for that and that love had killed him alex saw tears falling on graces cheeksher own tears numberless these past months she wiped her eyes then took out her cell phone and called bill fennell who was standing less than thirty feet away what is it he asked frantically whats wrong jamie should be here alex i told you you get him goddamn it this is his mother lying here there was a long silence then bill said ill call my sister on impulse alex turned and saw him standing near the nurses station hed been talking to dr andrews she saw him disengage from the neurologist and lift his cell phone to his cheek alex leaned down to graces ear and tried to think of something that would reach the bottom of the dark well where her sister now dwelled suesue she whispered simultaneously squeezing the cold hand suesue was another nickname based on a middle namea family tradition suesue its kk graces eyes remained shut its me suesue its kk im back from sallys wake up before mama gets up i want to go to the carnival seconds dilated into some unknown measure of time memories swirled through alexs mind and her heart began to ache graces eyes stayed shut come on suesue i know youre playing possum quit faking alex felt a twitch in her hand adrenaline surged through her but when she saw the frozen eyelids she decided that the twitch must have come from her own hand kuhkuh someone coughed alex turned thinking it was bill or dr andrews but then grace clenched her hand and let out a sharp cry when alex whipped her head around she saw graces green eyes wideopen then grace blinked alexs heart soared she leaned down over her sister because though grace was only thirtyfive her eyes were almost useless without glasses or contacts kk grace moaned iz zah wu its me gracie alex said rubbing a strand of hair out of her sisters cloudy eyes oh goth grace said in a guttural voice and then she began to sob thang godth alex had to clench her jaw muscles to keep from sobbing the right half of graces face was paralyzed and drool ran down her chin whenever she struggled to speak she sounded exactly like uncle tj whod died after a series of strokes left him without a shred of his old identity wuwu have tuh thave jamie grace gargled what i missed that havuh thave jamie grace repeated struggling to rise in the bed she seemed to be trying to look behind alex jamies fine alex said in a comforting voice hes on his way here grace shook her head

decipher some coded text billwillkilljamiessoul graces head sagged in exhaustion graciebill isnt my favorite person youve always known that but hes been a good father hasnt he he seems like a basically decent man grace gripped alexs hand and shook her head then she hissed eeth a monther alex felt a chill hes a monster is that what you said a tear of relief slid down graces paralyzed cheek alex looked at the anguished eyes then turned and glanced over her shoulder bill fennell was still speaking to dr andrews but his eyes were on alex ith biw coming grace asked in a terrified voice trying in vain to twist in the bed no no hes talking to the doctor dogtorduthendknow doesnt know what whuh biw did what do you mean what did bill do grace suddenly raised her hand and gripped alexs blouse then pulled her head down to her lips ee kiwd me alex felt as though ice water had been shunted into her veins she drew back and looked into graces bloodshot eyes he killed you is that what you said grace nodded once her eyes filled with conviction grace you dont know what youre saying even with a partially paralyzed face grace managed a smile that said oh yes i do you cant mean that not literally grace closed her eyes as though gathering herself for one last effort youonwe oneooh can thop im toowatefuh me i urddogtuhout thide thave jamie for megaygay pleath alex looked back through the glass wall bill was still watching her and his conversation looked as if it was winding down alex had always known graces marriage wasnt perfect but what marriage was not that alex was any authority she had somehow reached the age of thirty without tying the knot after years of badge groupies and badge bolters shed finally accepted a proposal then terminated the engagement three months later after discovering that her fiancé was cheating with her best friend in matters amorous she was a ridiculous cliché suesue she whispered why would bill want to hurt you thumone else grace said wuhman another woman do you know that for a fact another halfparalyzed smile uhwifeknowth alex believed her during her engagement to peter hodges a feeling very like a sixth sense had told her something was amiss in their relationship long before there was any tangible clue shed simply known there was betrayal if she had possessed the same instinct about conventional crimes shed already be an sac instead of a hostage negotiator correction she thought im a common field agent now if bill wants to be with another woman she said why doesnt he just divorce you muhneydumme would coth biw miwyenstuh do that fivemiwyenmaybe alex drew back in disbelief shed known that bill had been doing well for some years now but shed had no idea he was that wealthy why in gods name was grace still teaching elementary school because she loves it she answered herself because she cant not work grace had closed her eyes seemingly drained by her efforts tewmomi thowe she said tew huhi be waiting fuh hurhin heaven the smile animated the living half of her face again ifimake it you made it honey alex said balling her free hand into a fist and holding it against her mouth well look at this dr andrews boomed bill fennell she looks like shes ready to get up and out of that bed graces eyes snapped open and she shrank away from her husband obviously trying to use alex as a shield the terror in her eyes hurt alexs heart and it also thrust her into fulldefense mode she stood up and blocked bill from coming to the bedside i think its better if you dont come in she said looking hard into her brotherinlaws eyes bills mouth dropped open he looked past her to grace who was literally cowering in the bed what are you talking about he asked angrily what the hells going on here have you said something about me to grace alex glanced at dr andrews who looked confused no quite the reverse im afraid bill shook his head in apparent puzzlement i dont understand alex probed his brown eyes searching for some sign of guilt graces fears and accusations were probably the product of a dying womans hallucinations but there was no doubt about the reality of her terror youre upsetting her bill you can see that you should go downstairs and wait for jamie theres no way im going to leave my wifes bedside not when she might what alex asked a note of challenge in her voice bill lowered his voice when she might alex looked at dr andrews the neurologist stepped toward bill and said perhaps we should give grace and her sister some more time alone dont try to massage me like that bill said irritably im graces husband im her husband and ill decide who shes my blood alex said with bonedeep conviction your presence here is upsetting grace and thats all that matters we need to keep her as calm as possible isnt that right dr andrews absolutely meredith andrews walked around alex and looked down at her patient grace do you understand me yeth do you want your husband in this room grace slowly shook her head i wanmy baybe wan jamie dr andrews looked up at bill fennell who towered over her thats good enough for me i want you to leave the unit mr fennell bill stepped close to the neurologist his eyes sheened with anger i dont know who you think you are or who you think youre talking to but i give a lot of money to this university a lot of money and i dont make me call security dr andrews said quietly lifting the phone beside graces bed bills face went white alex almost felt sorry for him the power had clearly passed to dr andrews but bill seemed unable to make the decision to leave he looked alex thought like an actor on a dvd movie after you hit pause or thats what she was thinking when the alarm began to sing shes coding dr andrews shouted through the door but the shout was unnecessary nurses were already running from the station to the cubicle alex jumped out of their way and an instant later bill did the same cardiac arrest dr andrews said yanking open a drawer because this was an icu there was no crash cart everything was already here the quiet cubicle suddenly became a whirlwind of motion all directed toward a single purposeto sustain the life fast ebbing from the body on the bed you need to leave said a tall male nurse standing behind dr andrews both of you dr andrews glanced up long enough to give alex a moment of eye contact then returned to work alex backed slowly out of the icu watching the final act of her sisters life unfold without any hope of playing a part herself ridiculous regrets about choosing law school over medical school pierced her heart but what if she had become a doctor she would be practicing two thousand miles away from mississippi and the result would be the same graces fate was in gods hands now and alex knew how indifferent those hands could be she turned away from the cubicleaway from bill fennelland looked at the nurses station where banks of monitors chirped and blinked ceaselessly how can they focus on all those screens at once she wondered recalling how difficult it was to watch multiple surveillance feeds when the bureau had a tv rig set up on a static post as she thought about that she heard dr andrews say im calling it guys time of death ten twentynine pm shock is a funny thing alex thought like the day she was shot two searing chunks of buckshot and a half pound of glass had blasted through the right side of her face yet shed felt nothingjust a wave of heat as if someone had opened an oven beside her time of death ten twentynine pm something started to let go in alexs chest but before the release she heard a little boy say hey is my mom in here she turned toward the big wooden door that had brought her to this particular chamber of hell and saw before it a boy about four and a half feet tall his face was red as though he had run all the way from wherever hed started he was trying to look brave but alex saw fear in his wide green eyes aunt alex said jamie finally picking her out of the uniformed crowd bills big voice sounded from behind alex hello son wheres aunt jean shes too slow jamie said angrily come over here boy alex looked back at her brotherinlaws stern face and the thing that had started to let go inside her suddenly ratcheted tight without thought she ran to jamie swept him into her arms and then out the door away from this heartrending nightmare away from his dying mother away from bill fennell away chapter five weeks later dr chris shepard lifted a manila folder from the file caddy on the door of exam room and quickly perused it he didnt recognize the patients name and that was unusual chris had a large practice but it was a small town and that was the way he liked it this patients name was alexandra morse and her file held only a medical history the long form that all new patients filled out on their first visit chris looked down the corridor and saw holly his nurse crossing from her station to the xray room he called out and waved her up the hall holly said something through the door to xray then hurried toward him arent you coming in with me he asked softly its a female patient holly shook her head she asked to speak to you alone new patient yes i meant to say something before now but we got so busy with mr seward chris nodded at the door and lowered his voice to a whisper whats her story holly shrugged beats me names alex thirty years old and in great shape except for the scars on her face scars right side cheek ear and orbit head through a window is my guess theres nothing about a car accident in her history couple of months ago by the color of the scars chris moved away from the door and holly followed she didnt give you any complaint the nurse shook her head no and you know i asked oh boy holly nodded knowingly a woman coming in alone and refusing to specify her complaint usually meant the problem was sexualmost often fear of a sexually transmitted disease natchez mississippi was a small town and its nurses gossiped as much as its other citizens truth be told chris thought most doctors here are worse gossips than their nurses her chart says charlotte north carolina he noted did ms morse tell you what shes doing in natchez she told me exactly nothing holly said with a bit of pique do you want me to shoot that flatanderect series on mr seward before he voids on the table sorry go to it holly winked and whispered have fun with ms scarface chris shook his head then summoned a serious expression and walked into the examining room a woman wearing a navy skirt and a creamcolored top stood beside the examining table her face almost caused him to stare but hed seen a lot of trauma during his medical training this womans scars werent actually too bad it was her youth and attractiveness that made them stand out so vividly almost fiercely chris thought you figured a woman who looked and dressed this way would have had plastic surgery to take care of an injury like that not that she was a knockout or anything she wasnt it was just hello dr shepard the woman said in a direct tone ms morse he said remembering that the history said she was single she gave him a smile of acknowledgment but said nothing else what can i do for you today he asked the woman remained silent but he could feel her eyes probing him as deeply as a verbal question whats going on here chris wondered is it my birthday or something did the staff plan some kind of trick or does she want drugs hed had that happen before some female patients offered sex for drugs usually narcotics chris studied the womans face trying to divine her real purpose she had dark hair green eyes and an oval face not much different from those of the dozens of women he saw each day a little better bone structure maybe especially the cheekbones but the real difference was the scarsand a shock of gray hair above them that didnt look added by a colorist except for those things alex morse might be any woman at the local health club and yetdespite her usualness if that was a word there was something about her that chris couldnt quite nail down something that set her apart from other women something in the way she stood maybe laying the chart on the counter behind him he said maybe you should just tell me what the problem is i promise however frightening it might seem now ive seen or heard it many times in this office and together we can do something about it people usually feel better once they verbalize these things youve never heard what im about to tell you alex morse said with utter certainty i promise you that doctor the conviction in her voice unsettled him but he didnt have time for games he looked pointedly at his watch ms morse if im going to help you at all i have to know the nature of your problem its not my problem the woman said finally its yours as chris frowned in confusion the woman reached into a small handbag on the chair behind her and brought out a wallet this she flipped open and held up for him to examine he saw an id card of some sort one with a blueandwhite seal he looked closer bold letters on the right side of the card read fbi his stomach fluttered to the left of the big acronym smaller letters read special agent alexandra morse beside this was a photo of the woman standing before him special agent morse was smiling in the photo but she wasnt smiling now i need to tell you some things in confidence she said it wont take much of your time i pretended to be a patient because i dont want anyone in your life to know youve spoken to an fbi agent before i leave i need you to write me a prescription for levaquin and tell your nurse that i had a urinarytract infection tell her that the symptoms were so obvious that you didnt need to do a urinalysis will you do that chris was too surprised to make a conscious decision sure he said but whats going on are you investigating something are you investigating me not you someone i know agent morses eyes didnt waver yes who i cant tell you that yet i may tell you at the end of this conversation right now im going to tell you a story a quick story will you sit down doctor chris sat on the short stool he used in the examining room are you really from north carolina or is that just a cover why do you ask you talk like a yankee but i hear mississippi underneath agent morse smiled or gave him what passed for a smile with hera slight widening of her taut lips you have good ears i grew up in jackson but im based in charlotte north carolina now he was glad to have his intuition confirmed please go on with your story she sat on the chair where her handbag had been crossed her legs and regarded him coolly five weeks ago my sister died of a brain hemorrhage this happened at university hospital in jackson im sorry agent morse nodded as though she were past it but chris saw heldin emotion behind her eyes her death was sudden and unexpected but before she died she told me something that sounded crazy to me what she told me shed been murdered he wasnt sure he understood you mean she told you someone had murdered her exactly her husband to be specific chris thought about this for a while what did the autopsy show a fatal blood clot on the left side of the brain near the brain stem did she have any disease that made a stroke likely diabetes for example no was your sister taking birthcontrol pills yes that might have caused or contributed did she smoke no the point is the autopsy showed no abnormal cause for the stroke no strange drugs no poisons nothing like that did your sisters husband resist the autopsy agent morse actually beamed with approval no he didnt but you still believed her you really thought her husband might have killed her not at first i thought she must have been hallucinating but then agent morse looked away from chris for the first time and he stole a glance at her scars definitely lacerations caused by broken glass but the punctate scarring indicated something else smallcaliber bullets maybe agent morse he prompted i didnt leave town right away she said focusing on him again i stayed for the funeral and over the course of those three days i thought a lot about what grace had told me thats my sisters name grace she told me she thought her husband was having an affair hes a wealthy manfar wealthier than i realizedand grace believed he was involved with another woman she believed hed murdered her rather than pay what it would have cost him to divorce her and to get custody of their son of course chris considered this im sure women have been killed for that reason before men too i imagine absolutely even completely normal people admit to having homicidal impulses when going through a divorce anywayafter graces funeral i told her husband i was going back to charlotte but you didnt no was he having an affair he was and graces death didnt slow him down in the least quite the reverse in fact go on lets call graces husband bill after i discovered the affair i didnt confront bill i engaged the resources of the bureau to investigate him his personal life his business everything i now know almost everything there is to know about billeverything but the one thing i need to prove i know far more than my sister knew and i know a lot more than his mistress knows now for example when i was going through bills business records i found that he had some rather complex connections to a local lawyer a natchez lawyer chris asked trying to anticipate the connection to himself unlike most local physicians he had several friends in natchez who were attorneys no this lawyer practices in jackson i see go on bill is a real estate developer hes building the new ice hockey stadium up there naturally most of the lawyers he deals with specialize in real estate transactions but this lawyer was different how family law is his specialty divorce said chris exactly though he also does some estate planning trusts wills et cetera had bill consulted this lawyer about divorcing your sister agent morse shifted on her chair chris had the impression that she wanted to stand and pace but there wasnt enough room here to pacehe knew from experience he also sensed that she was trying to conceal nervousness i cant prove that she said not yet but im positive that he did still theres no evidence of any relationship whatever between bill and this divorce attorney prior to one week after my sisters death thats when they went into business together chris wanted to ask several questions but he suddenly remembered that he had patients waiting this story is very intriguing agent morse but i cant see how it has anything to do with me you will youd better make it fast or well have to postpone this i have patients waiting she gave him a look that seemed to say dont assume youre in control here after i found the connection between bill and this divorce lawyer she continued i broadened the investigation what i found was a web of business relationships that boggled my mind i know something about dummy corporations dr shepard i started my fbi career in south florida and i worked a lot of moneylaundering cases there chris silently thanked his stars for being too afraid to say yes to the various friends who had offered to put him into some investments in the cayman islands this divorce attorney has interests in just about every business you can think of morse went on mostly partnerships with various wealthy individuals in mississippi this didnt surprise chris is it strange that a rich lawyerim assuming hes richwould be into a lot of different businesses not in and of itself but all this activity started about five years ago and after looking closely at these deals i couldnt see any reason that the lawyer was put into them theyre brotherinlaw deals you might say only the lawyer isnt related to the parties in question not by blood or marriage in some cases he acted as counsel but in most not chris nodded and stole another glance at his watch im following you but what does all this add up to agent morse looked intently at him so intently that her gaze made him uncomfortable nine of the individuals that this divorce lawyer is in business with share a common characteristic what are they all patients of mine morse shook her head each of them had a spouse who died unexpectedly in the past five years in several cases a relatively young spouse as chris digested this he felt a strange thrill an alloy of excitement and dread he said nothing though but rather tried to get his mind fully around what she was saying also agent morse added they actually all died within two and a half years of each other is that unusual let me finish all these spouses were white previously healthy and all were married to wealthy people i can show you actuarial tables if you like its way off the charts chris was intrigued by morses singleminded intensity so what youre sayingyou think this divorce lawyer is helping potential clients to murder their spouses rather than pay them a financial settlement the fbi agent brought her hands together and nodded or to gain sole custody of their children thats exactly what im saying okay but why are you saying it to me for the first time agent morse looked uncomfortable because she said deliberately one week ago your wife drove to jackson and spent two hours inside that lawyers office chriss mouth fell open a wave of numbness moved slowly through his body as though hed been shot with a massive dose of lidocaine agent morses eyes had become slits you had no idea did you he was too stunned to respond have you been having problems in your marriage doctor no he said finally grateful to be certain of something at last not that its any of your business but lookif my wife went to see this lawyer she must have had some reason other than divorce were not having any kind of marital trouble morse leaned back in her chair you dont think thora could be having an affair his face went red at the use of his wifes first name are you about to tell me that she is what if i did chris stood suddenly and flexed his shoulders id say youre crazy nuts and id throw you out of here in fact i want to know where you get off coming in here like this and saying these things calm down dr shepard you may not believe it at this moment but im here to help you i realize were talking about personal matters intimate matters even but youre forced to do the same thing in your job arent you when human life is at stake privacy goes by the board she was right of course many of the questions on his medical history form were intrusive how many sexual partners have you had in the last five years are you satisfied with your sexual life chris looked away from her and tried to pace the room a circuit of exactly two and a half steps what are you telling me agent morse no more games spell it out your life may be in danger chris stopped from my wife is that what youre saying im afraid so jesus christ youre out of your mind im going to call thora right now and get to the bottom of this he reached for the phone on the wall agent morse got to her feet please dont do that dr shepard why shouldnt i because you may be the only person in a position to stop whoever is behind these murders chris let his hand fall hows that she took a deep breath then spoke in a voice of eminent reasonableness if you are a targetthat is if youve become one in the last weekyour wife and this attorney have no idea that youre aware of their activities so that puts you in a unique position to help us trap them awareness dawned quickly you want me to try to trap my wife to get her jailed for attempted murder morse turned up her palms would you rather pretend none of this happened and die at thirtysix he closed his eyes for a moment trying to restrain his temper youre missing the forest for the trees here your whole thesis is illogical why those men you think murdered their wivesthey did it to keep from splitting their assets and paying out a ton of alimony right in most cases yes but not all the victims were women chris momentarily lost his train of thought in at least one case said morse and probably two the murder was about custody of the children not money again youre miles off base thora and i have no children your wife has a child a nineyearold son he smiled sure but she had ben even before she married red simmons thora would automatically get custody youve legally adopted ben but that brings up another important point dr shepard what how your wife got her money chris sat back down and looked at agent morse how much did she know about his wife did she know that thora was the daughter of a renowned vanderbilt surgeon whod left his family when his daughter was eight years old did she know that thoras mother was an alcoholic that thora had fought like a wildcat just to get through adolescence and that making it through nursing school was a pretty amazing achievement given her background probably not morse probably knew only the local legend how thora rayner had been working in st catherines hospital when red simmons a local oilman nineteen years her senior had been carried into the er with a myocardial infarction how shed become close to red during his hospital stay then married him six months later chris knew this story well because hed treated red simmons during the last three years of his life chris had known thora as a nurse of course but he came to know her much better during reds years in heart failure and what he learned was that red truly loved his little vikinga reference to thoras danish ancestryand that thora had been a brave and loyal wife a woman worthy of deep respect when red died two and a half years ago he left thora an estate valued at million that was big money in natchez but it meant little to chris he had some money of his own and he was young enough to earn plenty more agent morse he said in a neutral tone im not going to discuss my wife with you but i will tell you this thora doesnt stand to gain or lose anything if we get divorced why not shes very wealthy she has money yes but so do i i started saving the day i began moonlighting in emergency rooms and ive made some lucky investments but the real issue here is legal we both signed a prenuptial agreement before we married if we were to get divorced each person would leave the marriage with exactly what he or she brought into it agent morse studied chris in silence i didnt know that he smiled sorry to punch a hole in your theory morse seemed suddenly lost in thought and chris sensed that for her in that moment he was not even there her face was more angular than hed thought at first it had its own odd shadows tell me this she said suddenly what happens if either of you dies as chris thought about this he felt a hollowness high in his stomach welli believe our wills kick in at that point and those override the prenup at least i think they do what does your will say who gets those lucky investments you made chris looked at the floor his face growing hot my parents get a nice chunk thats good and the rest he looked up at her thora gets it all morses eyes flashed with triumph but chris protested im listening thora is worth millions of dollars what would be the point kill me to get an extra two million morse rubbed her chin for a few moments then looked up at the narrow window set in the top of the wall people have been killed for less dr shepard a lot less by millionaires i wouldnt doubt it and people are murdered every day for reasons other than money how well do you know your wife psychologically i mean pretty damn well good thats good chris was starting to dislike agent morse intensely you think my wife murdered her first husband dont you morse shrugged i didnt say that you might as well have but red simmons had a long history of heart disease yes he did morses inside knowledge of events was pissing him off but no autopsy was done she pointed out im aware of that youre not suggesting that one should be done now are you agent morse dismissed this idea with a flick of her hand we wouldnt find anything whoevers behind these murders is too good for that chris snorted whos that good agent morse a professional assassin a forensic pathologist there was a mob enforcer some years ago who prided himself on this kind of work he was a very reserved man with a massive ego he had no formal medical training but he was an enthusiastic amateur hes nominally retired now weve had some people following him just to make sure chris couldnt sit any longer he rose and said this is nuts i mean what the hell do you expect me to do now help us us thats only about the third time youve said us in this whole conversation agent morse smiled more fully this time im the lead agent were spread pretty thin on these kinds of cases since everybodys working counterterrorism chris looked deep into her eyes there was sincerity there and passion but he saw something else toosomething not so different from what he read in the eyes of those patients who tried to con him out of drugs every week murders a state crime isnt it he said slowly not a federal one yes but when you kill someone you also deprive him of his civil rights chris knew this was true several decadesold race murders in mississippi had been dragged back into the courtroom by trying previously acquitted ku klux klan killers for violating their victims civil rights but stillsomething seemed wrong about alexandra morses story the first victim you told me aboutif these are murder victimswas your sister right doesnt that create some sort of conflict im not supposed to treat family members for anything serious should you be investigating your own sisters death to be perfectly frank no but theres no one else i trust to do it right agent morse looked at her watch for the first time we dont have time to get deep into this dr shepard ill speak to you again soon but i dont want you to deviate from your normal routine not in any way that your wife or anyone else would notice who else would notice the person planning to kill you chris went still are you saying someone might be following me yes you and i cannot be seen together in public wait a minute you cant tell me something like this and just walk out of here are you giving me protection are there going to be fbi agents covering me when i walk out its not like that nobodys trying to assassinate you with a rifle if the past is any guideand it almost always is since criminals tend to stick to patterns that have been successful in the pastthen your death will have to look natural you should be careful in traffic and you shouldnt walk or jog or bicycle anywhere that theres traffic no one can protect you from that kind of hit but most important is the question of food and drink you shouldnt eat or drink at home for a while not even bottled water nothing bought or prepared by your wife youre kidding right i realize that might be difficult but well work it out to tell you the truth i think we have some working room as far as time is concerned your wife just consulted this lawyer and this kind of murder takes meticulous planning chris heard a note of hysteria in his laughter thats a huge comfort agent morse seriously i feel so much better now does your wife have plans to be out of town anytime soon he shook his head good thats a good sign morse picked up her handbag youd better write me that prescription now what the levaquin oh right he took a pad from his pocket and scribbled a prescription for a dozen antibiotic pills you think of everything dont you no one thinks of everything and be glad for it thats the way we catch most criminals stupid mistakes even the best of us make them you havent given me a card or anything chris said no references i can check all you did was show me an id that i wouldnt know was fake or not i want a phone number something agent morse shook her head you cant call anyone at the bureau doctor you cant do anything that could possibly tip off your killer your phones may be tapped and that includes your cell phone thats the easiest one to monitor chris stared at her for a long time he wanted to ask about the scars you said everybody makes mistakes agent morse whats the worst you ever made the womans hand rose slowly to her right cheek as though of its own volition i didnt look before i leaped she said softly and somebody died because of it im sorry who was it she hitched her handbag over her shoulder not your problem doctor but you do have a problem im sorry to be the one to turn your life upside down i really am but if i hadnt you might have gone to sleep one night thinking you were happy and never woken up morse took the prescription from chriss hand then gave him her taut smile ill contact you again soon try not to freak out and whatever you do dont ask your wife if shes trying to kill you chris gaped after morse as she walked down the corridor toward the waitingroom door her stride was measured and assured the walk of an athlete so holly said from behind him startling him whats her story cystitis he mumbled honeymoon syndrome too much bumping monkey huh i didnt see no wedding ring on her finger chris shook his head at hollys wiseass tone then walked down the hall to his private office and closed the door he had a waiting room filled with patients but as sick as some of them were they seemed secondary now he shoved aside a stack of charts and looked at thoras picture on his desk thora was the antithesis of agent alex morse she was blondnaturally blond unlike percent of the goldenhaired women you saw on the streetand of danish descent which was unusual in the south her eyes were grayish bluesea blue if you wanted to get poetic about it which he had on occasion but though she might be mistaken for a viking princess on the basis of appearance thora had no pretensions of superiority she had spent four years married to red simmons a downtoearth country boy whod made good by trusting his instincts and whod treated people well after he made his pile chris believed reds instincts about women were as good as his hunches about oil yes thora had become rich when red died but where was the fault in that when a rich man died someone always profited that was the way of the world and red simmons wasnt the type to demand a prenuptial agreement hed had a loving young wife whod shared his life for better or worsewith quite a bit of worse in that last yearand she deserved everything he had come hell or high water thats the way red would have put it and the more chris reflected on what agent morse had said in exam room the angrier he got he picked up the phone and called his front desk yes drawled jane henry his peppery receptionist the yes finally terminated after two long syllablesmaybe two and a half jane i had a fraternity brother in college named darryl foster thats darryl uhhuh and i think hes an fbi agent now i dont know where he was originally from memphis but the last i heard he was working in the chicago field office and i need you to find him for me his phone number i mean my old fraternity is trying to add on to the house up at ole miss and they want to hit up everybody for contributions and just how do you suggest i find this supercop get on the internet i guess you spend enough time on there playing poker and shopping ebay the least you can do is locate one old classmate for me jane harrumphed loudly ill give it a try i guess dont strain yourself she hung up without a word but chris knew she would have the number in less than an hour dont change your routine agent morse had said dont do anything that might tip off your killer my killer chris said aloud this has got to be bullshit he picked up his stethoscope and walked to the door but janes buzz brought him back to his desk he grabbed his phone you found foster already not yet your wifes on the phone chris felt another wave of numbness thora rarely called his office she knew he was too busy to spend time on the phone he looked down at her picture waiting for a spark of instinct about what to do but what he saw before him wasnt his wife but special agent alex morse regarding him coolly from behind her scars stupid mistakes morse had said even the best of us make them tell thora im with a patient jane what asked the receptionist clearly surprised im way behind already just do it ill call her back in a little while whatever you say you sign my checks chris started to hang up but at the last second he said find fosters number for me okay stat the playfulness went out of janes voice she knew when her boss meant business you got it doc chapter andrew rusk was afraid he stood at the window of his law office and gazed out over the jigsaw skyline of jackson mississippi not an impressive vista as cityscapes went but rusk did have the corner office on the sixteenth floor looking north he could see all the way to the forested plains where white flight was expanding oncesleepy counties into bustling enclaves for twentyfirstcentury yuppies farther on the new nissan plant was bringing relative wealth to the states struggling bluecollar workers they commuted up to a hundred miles a day both ways from the tiny towns surrounding the state capital behind himout of sight to the westlived the uneducated blacks who had been dragging the city down for the past twenty years rusk and a few trusted friends referred to them as untouchables the untouchables killed each other at an alarming rate and preyed upon others with enough regularity to breed deep anxiety in the white citizens of jackson but they werent the source of his fear they were invisible from his office and he worked hard to keep them that way in all areas of his life to that end he had built his home in an oak forest north of the city near annandale a golf club that occupied the selfassured niche between the old money of the jackson country club and the young optimists at reunion every afternoon at four thirty rusk took the elevator down to the garage climbed into his black porsche cayenne turbo and roared northward to his stoneandglass sanctuary among the oak and pine trees his second wife was invariably lying by their infinity pool when he arrived lisa was still young enough for a string bikini but she rarely wore swimwear in the summer after a poolside kissor more often lately a session of listening to her bitch about nothinghe went inside for a stiff drink his black cook always had supper waiting on the table and andrew looked forward to it every day but now the taste of fear overrode that of food rusk had not felt real fear for twentyfive years but hed never forgotten it fear tasted like junior high school like being backed into a corner by a tenth grader who wanted to beat your face into red pulp your friends watching but too petrified to help your bladder threatening to send an ocean of piss down your leg rusk lifted a tumbler of bourbon to his lips and took a long pull whiskey at work was an indulgence one hed allowed himself more and more in the past weeks a balm against the fear he refilled the tumbler with woodford reserve then lifted a fivebyseven photograph from his desktop the photo showed a darkhaired woman with an angular face and deepset eyesthe kind of eyes that looked alive even on a piece of paper rusk knew that the woman in that picture would never fall for his sweetest pickup line maybe if hed caught her younga freshman in college when he was a senior drunk at a frat party like thatbut even then he doubted it this girl had what most women didntselfconfidenceand she had it in spades the apple of her daddys eye you could tell that was probably what had led her to the fbi special agent alex he murmured nosy bitch rusks phone rang and his secretary answered it they still had secretaries at his little firmnot goddamn personal assistantsand they were oldschool girls all the way they gave and received generous perks and everybody stayed happy rusk had read that there was a rule at the google headquarters in mountain view no worker should ever be more than fifty feet away from food to that end snack stations had been set up throughout the googleplex the rusk ruleestablished by andrews father at his much more venerable firmpredated the google edict by five decades and it went thus no partner should ever be more than fifty feet from a good and willing piece of ass andrew junior had imported this tradition into his own firm with most gratifying results he gulped the last slug from the tumbler and walked to his desk where his flatpanel monitor glowed insistently flickering on the screen was the portal graphic of a dutch web site called ex nihiloa black hole with a shimmering event horizon rusk remembered a little latin from his days in prep school ex nihilo meant out of nothing for a considerable fee ex nihilo provided absolute anonymity in the digital domain the company also provided other services requiring discretion and it was one of those services that rusk had contracted for today he suspected that kiddieporn addicts made up the lions share of ex nihilos clients but he didnt care all that mattered was that the company could protect him partners he thought recalling his fathers cynical voice all partnerships fail in the end just like marriages the only life after death any human being will ever know is staying in a marriage or a partnership after its over and thats not lifeits living death rusk hated most things about his father but one thing he could not deny the man had been right about most things in life rusk moved his cursor into a blank box and typed pi to the ninth decimal place as a boy hed memorized pi to the fortieth decimal place to impress his father immediately after his proud dinner recitation dear old dad had told him about an indian boy whod memorized pi to the sixhundredth place typical paternal response in the rusk home nothing was ever good enough for andrew jackson rusk sr rusk retyped his password then clicked confirm with this act he armed a digital mechanism that might well become his sole means of survival during the next few weeks he had no illusions about that his partner would tolerate zero risk he had made that clear at the outset in fact the man was so obsessive about security that he had not only created a code nameglykonfor andrew to use in their conversations which were few rusk had googled glykon but all hed discovered was a greek snake god that had protected his believers in ad by dispelling a plague cloud with a magical spell rusks glykon had rather absurdly insisted that andrew think of him by the code name on any occasion where thought about their business was required security is based on rigorous habits glykon insisted and the funny thing was hed turned out to be right theyd experienced five years of steady and staggering profits without a hitch but if glykon perceived risk rusk knew he would instantly move to eliminate it and that meant only one thing death the glue that had held their partnership together thus far was a cold war strategy called mad mutually assured destruction only when each party knew that his partner held the key to his destruction could trust be guaranteed rusk had once observed an analogy to adulterers who were both married but now the situation had changed and rusk no longer felt safe for the first time in their association true danger had reared its head there were two threats and they had arisen almost simultaneously one was internal the other external in the shadow of these threats rusk had come to the conclusion that for mad to act as a true deterrent each party had to know that a sword of damocles hung above his head tacit understanding was no longer sufficient ex nihilo would provide that sword if rusk did not log in to the dutch web site every day and authenticate his identity then ex nihilo would forward the contents of a large digital file to the fbi and the mississippi state police that file contained a detailed record of the partnerships activities for the past five years with accompanying photos and business recordsenough legal dynamite to blast both men into parchman farm for life where the worst of the untouchables lived out their miserable and violent days there was a builtin grace period of course without one a random car accident causing a weeklong coma might result in andrew awakening miraculously only to be arrested for murder but the delay wasnt much longer than a week ten days in fact after that glykon would be arrested jailed and sentenced to death the prospect of relating this information to glykon was what had rusks sphincter quivering the moment that he unsheathed this sword the ground would shift beneath his feet he and glykon would become adversaries even if they continued working together which was by no means certain intellectual genius and ruthless efficiency had made glykon the perfect collaborator but those same qualities would also make him the most formidable adversary imaginable rusks fear disgusted him the walls of his office were lined with photographs that testified to his virility brilliant snapshots of a blond exfraternity president wearing every type of survival suit known to man rusk owned all the best toys and hed honed the skills to use them extreme skiing monsterwave surfing in hawaii he had a stunt plane that he flew like a barnstormer hed even climbed everest last year and during one hell of a storm albeit with oxygen all this hed done before the age of forty yet he still felt like a boy in the presence of glykon it wasnt just the age difference because rusk felt superior to most sixtyyearold men he met it was something else a set of factors probably damn few of which he could put a name to but that was the state of things rusk knew hed made a mistake taking the fennell case the targets sister was an fbi agent and her father had been a homicide cop rusk had planned to refuse the job but hed mentioned it to glykon anyway assuming that his paranoid partner would reject it out of hand to his surprise glykon had taken the fbi connection as a challenge by then bill fennell had offered a percent bonus percentso rusk caved what else was he going to do as oscar wilde once said the only sure way to get rid of a temptation was to yield to it but now rusk had special agent alex morse crawling all over his life somehow she had latched onto him like a fucking remora to a shark hed expected her to give up after a while but she hadnt she was tenacious and that kind of tenacity only led one place rusk was sure that morse had broken into his office he hadnt reported this of course not to the police and certainly not to glykon hed merely made sure that she would never get in again but that was closing the proverbial barn door after the horse had bolted what had morse discovered while she was here there was no obvious evidence to find the caserelated data on rusks hard drives was encrypted even encrypted it was a violation of glykons rules but rusk had a feeling that morse knew her way around computers probably around business records too his discreet inquiries into her cv had revealed a law degree from tulane and a year working in south florida with an fbidea task force perfect preparation for unraveling one side of his operation morse had also spent five years as an fbi hostage negotiator this had surprised him until his source explained that there were more female hostage negotiators in the bureau than males it seemed that women were better at peaceful resolution of conflict than men that was a surprise an experienced divorce attorney rusk had met women with the predatory instincts of velociraptorsfemales malicious and manipulative enough to give machiavelli remedial classes in the provocation of wars despite a promising start alex morse had proved unequal to the job of hostage negotiator her fathers death and her mothers cancer had evidently pushed her into a zone where her judgment abandoned her and shed gotten somebody killed shed almost died herself rusk thought wistfully and her butchered face bore the evidence of her brush with death but the bottom line was her emotions had shortcircuited her professional restraint shed acted wholly on instinct without regard for the consequences and this disturbing precedent could not be ignored glykon had to know about alex morse and morse wasnt their only problem internal threats were always more dangerous than those from without and right now a nuclear bomb was ticking beneath their partnership a client rusk muttered in disbelief swigging from his tumbler a goddamn rogue client he started at the sound of his door which had opened just enough for his secretary to lean inside it was only midmay but janice was already deeply tanned making her look closer to thirty than thirtyfive her true age she met rusks eyes with utter openness the look of an intimate confidante almost everybodys gone she said you want to do it before i go home rusk weighed her offer janice was older than his wife and while not as beautiful as lisa she was much more accomplished and enthusiastic in bed it was a perfect arrangement janices husband was a cost accountant who bored her silly but was a good father and janice did not aspire to higher social station moreover rusk paid her almost three times what other secretaries earned in the capital city are you all right janice asked stepping fully into the office she was wearing a khaki skirt and white linen top that her bra showed through her calves and forearms rippled with muscle acquired from tournament tennis and obsessive workouts at the gym rusk nodded but he knew she could read him in all weathers is it your father she asked tentatively knowing this was a chronic sore spot no theres just a lot going on right now her gaze remained on him but she didnt push do you want me to just use my mouth rusk studied her eyes which held only concern and estimated the chances that his wife would want sex tonight what the hell he thought i could die in a car crash on the way home he summoned a smile for janice she walked over knelt before his chair and unzipped his trousers she could usually bring him off quickly when she wanted to but today he sensed that it might take a while he looked down at the photo of alex morse and let his mind wander it was the timing that he couldnt believe he was forty years old and if business continued at its present pace he would surpass his fathers net worth within the year andrew jackson rusk srknown as aj to his friends among these a list of governors stretching back fifty yearswas seventyfive years old and still practicing as a plaintiffs attorney aj had earned millions in three recent cases that had garnered national media attentiontwo of them in jefferson county where the allblack juries handed out fortunes like party favors it was tough to keep up with that kind of racket when you handled divorce caseseven the big onesbut andrew had managed it which was good because his father never let him forget that they were competing careful with your teeth he said janice mumbled something and kept working at him aj senior had labored to grind every trace of softness idealism and compassion out of his son and for the most part hed succeeded when andrew junior saw the fatherson basketball game in the great santini for the first timerobert duvall bouncing the ball off his sons headhed found himself unable to breathe and because his own personal bull meechum had not died in a fiery plane crash the competition had not ended when andrew reached adulthood it intensified instead of joining his fathers law firm andrew had joined that of his first wifes fathera mistake it had taken him several years to acknowledge to himself his divorce from the senior partners daughter had ended his tenure with that firm but aj had not offered him a job after he was cut loose rather than join a lesser firm andrew had formed his own taking every potential money case that walked in the door most of those had turned out to be divorces and in that milieu he had discovered his gift in subsequent years he had often faced lawyers from his fathers firm in court and hed triumphed in every battle those victories had been sweet but it wasnt quite the same as licking his old man but this year hed been telling himself this year he was finally going to cut big aj down to size will you rub my nipples janice asked rusk looked down her free hand had disappeared beneath her skirt he reached down and absently pinched her she moaned then gripped him with her hand and went at him with renewed fervor he looked at the top of her head where the dark roots showed beneath the blond color job every solitary gray hair frizzed out in a direction of its own stop he said wha she gurgled i cant do it her head came up and she smiled with almost maternal encouragement yes you can you need it just relax she lowered her head again i said stop he shoved her shoulders back hard enough to disengage from her mouth but janice would not be put off so easilynot when she was aroused she stood and stepped quickly out of some blue panties then hiked up her skirt and sat down on him he didnt help her but neither did he push her off despite a rush of nausea he let her do what she needed to do focusing on her muscular thighs as she worked up and down janices grunts grew steadily louder but it didnt matter hed had the walls professionally soundproofed he took his eyes off the wet tangle where he disappeared into her and focused on alexandra morses picture he imagined the fbi agent sweating over him like this then he inverted the image in his mind now he was doing special agent alex in a very painful waymaking her pay dearly for all the inconvenience she had caused oh janice groaned now its hard an image of glykon suddenly filled his mind come on urged janice a hint of panic in her voice keep it up baby think about whatever you have to he focused on morses eyes and gripped the breasts in front of him they were goodsized but flabby janices two kids had taken their toll and surgery never quite brought boobs back to their prematernal state no matter what the surgeons promised alex morse had no children her tits would be firm and high like lisas and her iq would be percent higher at least rusk closed his hands with savage force janice screamed in pain but the scream drew out to a long moan as she broke through and peaked gritting her teeth against his neck to keep from biting him which she always wanted to do rusk was amazed to find himself climaxing after all he shut his eyes and forced the leering visage of glykon from his mind i told you janice said she stood up and looked down at him still panting from her exertions she obviously considered his climax a small victory in their ongoing sex play i told you you could do it rusk gave her a perfunctory nod thinking he might need to take half a viagra on the way home in case lisa wanted servicing whos that asked janice pointing at alex morse nobody janice fished her panties off the floor and worked them back up her legs shes obviously somebody he glanced at morse again then shook his head do you think shes hot janice asked in a girlish voice no he said meaning it youre lying you thought about her while you were inside me didnt you i did you know me janice she gave him a pouting glance you dont have to be jealous of her rusk said why not shes dead oh janice smiled with satisfaction after janice flattened her skirt and carried her shoes back to her desk rusk walked over to a credenza and removed a box of reynolds wrap from a drawer it had lain there for five years but hed never had to use it opening the long box he tore off two squares of aluminum foil then laid them on a table by the northeast window of his office there was packaging tape in the bottom drawer of his desk he cut off several short lengths and stuck a line of dangling pieces to the edge of the credenza with these he taped the foil to the eastwardfacing window shiny side out in sunlight the squares would be visible from interstate which was elevated for most of its length where it passed through the city the aluminum foil was another of glykons ideas those two goddamn squares of reynolds wrap would bring about a meeting that rusk dreaded like no other in his life one that would require all his powers of persuasion to survive his hand shook as he drained another tumbler of bourbon he felt as though he had carried out a ritual to summon the devil chapter chris shepard dropped a baseball in midair and swung the bat in a fast arc smacking a ground ball at his fourfoottall shortstop the shortstop scooped up the ball and hummed it to the first baseman chriss adopted son ben the throw went wide but ben stretched out and sucked the ball into his glove as though by magic great catch chris shouted throw at his chest mike hes wearing a glove he can catch it the shortstop nodded and crouched for the next ball bens eyes glowed with pride but he maintained as stern a countenance as a nineyearold could muster chris pretended to aim another ball at the shortstop then popped a fly over ben to his daydreaming right fielder the kid woke up just in time to dart out of the balls path but it took him several seconds to start chasing it toward the back of the lot chris glanced covertly to his right as he waited for the throw two minutes ago thoras silver mercedes had pulled onto the grassy bank behind the vacant lot where they practiced she didnt get out but sat watching from behind the smoky windshield maybe shes talking on her cell phone he thought it struck him how rarely thora came to practice anymore last year she had been one of the teams biggest supporters always bringing the watercooler or even an ice chest filled with powerade for every kid but this year she was the rarest visitor curiosity had brought her out today he knew instead of making his evening hospital rounds early as was his habit during the season chris had picked ben up from home right after his office closed thora had been out running of course so theyd missed each other as a result they hadnt spoken since his visit from alex morse chris waved at the mercedes then started working ground balls around the infield hed avoided talking to thora because he needed time to process what agent morse had told him and a busy medical office was no place to reflect on personal problems running a baseball practice for nine and tenyearolds wasnt exactly zen meditation but he could steal a little time to work through the few factual details morse had given him during their meeting he wished he had asked more questions about the supposed murders for example had the cause of death been stroke in every case he doubted that morse had forensic evidence to back up her extraordinary theory if she did she wouldnt need him to try to set up a trap she would already have arrested the murderer and yetif he was completely honest with himself he couldnt deny that in the past few hours hed been turning over certain realities that had been bothering him on a deep level for some time foremost was the baby issue during their courtship he and thora had agreed that they wanted to start having children of their own as soon as they married at least one and maybe two chris was thirtysix thora thirty the sooner they started having babies the healthier those children would be and the better they would know their adopted brother but after the wedding thora had seemed reluctant to get off the pill twice shed claimed that shed started taking the next months pack by mistake when he remarked on this rare absentmindedness she admitted that shed been wondering whether they should move so quickly chris had tried to hide his disappointment but it obviously showed through because thora had stopped taking the pill and theyd begun waiting the obligatory three months required before conception could safely occur their sex remained good but the frequency dropped precipitously thora complained that having to use other forms of birth control was a drag after the convenience of the pill before long chris felt lucky if they made love once a week after the three months passed they had abandoned all forms of birth control but so far thora had not conceived not even a missed period whenever chris brought up the subject she subtly suggested that he should get himself checked out since bens existence proved that she could bear children chris never responded verbally to these hints but he had gotten himself checked out using his own offices laboratoryservice provider and the answer was unequivocal high sperm count high motility he wished thora would get out of her mercedes several other parents were sitting on blankets or lawn chairs on the hill beside the field only thora remained in her vehicle it was this kind of behavior that earned you the reputation of snob in a small town uppity doctors wife last year chris couldnt have imagined thora remaining aloof like this she would have visited each parent in turn all the while shouting encouragement to the boys from the sidelines but maybe he was making a big deal out of nothing if she felt like sitting in her car where was the harm the sun was burning down with unusual ferocity for may and she might just be enjoying the airconditioning he couldnt tell whether her engine was running the rumble of the generator in the batting cage was too loud alex morse is nuts he muttered cracking a ball toward third base his marriage might not be in a perfect stateif any such marriage existed on earthbut the idea that his wife was planning to murder him was so ludicrous that chris hadnt even known how to respond it was almost like someone telling you that your mother was planning to kill you and yetit wasnt quite there was no blood tie between husbands and wivesnot without biological children and for some reason chris couldnt get morses deadly earnest eyes out of his mind she clearly wasnt the kind of person who would waste time playing games with peoples lives the answer had to be something else like emotional instability maybe morse believed absolutely in the absurd scenario she had outlined today given the recent death of her sister that wasnt hard to imagine chris had seen many extreme grief reactions during his medical career but what should he do about it call the fbi field office in jackson and report morses visit call his lawyer call fbi headquarters in washington or discreetly try to get more information on his own his receptionist had finally found a phone number for darryl foster and chris had tried to call his old fraternity brother but hed only reached an answering machine hed hoped that fosteran active fbi field agentwould shed some light on the mysterious agent morse before he had to face thora but the cell phone in chriss pocket had not rung until he knew more he wasnt going to let thora know anything was amiss it wasnt that he believed anything morse had told him but if he related the afternoons events to thora her first question would be who did you report her to and what would he say then why hadnt he reported her you gonna hit the ball or what coach chris blinked himself back to reality his catcher was staring up at him with confusion chris laughed to cover then hit a high fly ball to center field as he watched its arc he caught a movement to his right thora was standing in the open door of her mercedes now her blond hair flashing in the afternoon sun she was staring directly at him had she noticed his little zoneout at home plate she gave him a small wave and smiled beneath her sunglasses dark avian things that gave her the look of an art deco hawk on the side of a skyscraper she was wearing running clothes her lithe muscular body on display for all maybe thats why she didnt get out he thought but that was wishful thinking for the past eight monthssince running marathons had become fashionable among the young married women of the townthora had run between two and ten miles a day shed bought shoes the wrist gps unit and all the other gear of the modern distance runner the thing was with thora it wasnt just for show she actually had talent after just three months training shed started beating the times of women who had been running for two and three years but thoras running garb typified another point of tension between them when she was married to red simmons thora had dressed conservatively fashionably yes but never pushing the envelope of taste after a suitable period of mourning thoughabout the time shed started seeing chrisshe had subtly begun changing her style in the beginning chris had approved the new look revealed more of her beauty and signaled an engagement with life that shed sorely needed but lately thora had begun wearing things he would never have imagined she would buy much less wear in public ultrashort shorts transparent tops meant to be worn with an outer garment but worn alone and pushup bras when she wore bras at all chris had kidded her about this hoping shed get the hint but thora had continued to wear the stuff so hed shut up he didnt feel he had the right to control the way she dressed maybe he was getting old losing touch with the times and until today it hadnt seemed that big a deal nothing had really only the issue of thora getting pregnant had been disturbing enough to rob him of sleep coach grant he called to his assistant another team father lets run some bases and then call it a day the boys cheered and their parents started rising from blankets and chairs packing up ice chests and babies for the trek home chris ran the boys for five minutes then circled them and led them in a team shout that reverberated off a thick stand of oak trees to the west the boys packed the geara team traditionand then everyone headed for his family car ben walked beside chris as they tromped toward the mercedes chris tried to blank his mind but couldnt too many things were surfacing after a period of unconscious repression like the mercedes last christmas thora had bought herself an sl amg hardly anyone in town knew how expensive this car really was several local doctors owned benzes but most were in the to range thoras sl had cost chris didnt begrudge her the carit was her money after allbut while she was married to red simmons she had driven a toyota avalon forty grand fully loaded shed also worn a timex watch chris had sometimes joked with her about it while she was on nursing duty but a month ago a patek philippe had quietly appeared on her wrist he had no idea how much the watch cost but the jewels on its bezel told him it was probably something north of more than several fathers watching this practice earned in a year big ben cried thora moving out from behind the sls door with a grin and bending to hug her sweaty son you didnt miss a catch the whole time i was here ben shrugged i play first base mom you cant play first if you miss balls chris wished he could see thoras eyes but the sunglasses hid them completely she gave ben a quick squeeze then straightened and gave chris her thousandwatt smile his gaze went to the patek philippe stop it he said silently you picked up ben early today she said yeah i knew rounds were going to take a while so i decided to do them after practice she nodded but said nothing he wasnt sure where to go next but ben saved him by asking can we go to la fiesta mom thora glanced at chris over the tops of her sunglasses but he couldnt read her meaning la fiesta was a familyoriented mexican restaurant with low prices and fast service thus it was always loud and crowded i really need to get to the hospital chris said you guys go though thora shook her head weve got plenty of food at home and its a lot healthier than mexican i made chicken salad this afternoon ben rolled his eyes and wrinkled his nose chris almost said ill pick up something on the way home but that would only result in ben begging for takeout and thora getting irritated help me load the gear son chris and ben tossed the two bulging canvas bags into his pickup then chris gave ben a high five hugged thora lightly to his side and climbed into the truck i wont be too late he said through the open window as though in answer thora took off her sunglasses her seablue eyes cut right through his feigned nonchalance her gaze had always caused a physical reaction in his chest something between a fluttering and radiant warmth it caused a reaction lower down as well now that gaze held an unspoken question but he broke eye contact lifted his hand in a wave then backed onto the road and drove north toward town chapter alex morse drove her rented corolla into the parking lot of the days inn pulled up to the door of room and shut off the engine when she opened the door of her room her sisters calico cat mewed and dropped soundlessly from the bathroom counter to the carpet alex paid five extra dollars per night so that meggie could stay in the hotel room she only had graces cat because jamie had begged her to take it after the funeral jamie loved meggie but his father did not and the boy had been afraid that his dad would take her to the pound as soon as alex flew back to charlotte since alex knew that bill fennell was quite capable of this small act of brutality shed accepted the burden to her surprise the brighteyed calico had helped to ease the loneliness of the past five weeks alex took off her shoulder holster massaged the wet place where it had lain against her ribs then knelt and rubbed meggies chin with a bent knuckle when she poured some food into the plastic dish by the bathroom door the cat began eating voraciously alex had checked into the days inn five days ago and shed done what she could to make a home of her room her notebook computer sat humming on the desk its screen saver an everchanging montage of photos shot on the cruise shed taken with grace to celebrate graces thirtieth birthday beside the computer stood a photo of jamie wearing his jackson academy basketball uniforma gangly tenyearold with auburn hair a freckled unfinished face and deepset eyes that projected heartbreaking uncertainty looking at this picture she remembered how frantic jamie had been the morning after his mother died when alex told him she had to take him back to his father running off with him after graces death had been an act of desperation and in the eyes of the law kidnapping if alex had kept jamie bill wouldnt have hesitated to have her arrested and he would probably have done so the previous night had he been able to locate her many times since that day alex had regretted returning jamie but she had enough experience to know that a successful custody kidnapping required careful planning and preparation in the five weeks since that day she had actually taken several steps in that direction and if her efforts to prove bills complicity in graces murder should failwhich without dr shepards help was likelythen she would be ready to take drastic action on a low dresser beside the motel desk lay several neat stacks of paper all relating to her mothers medical care there were lists of oral medications and chemotherapy drugs treatment schedules bills to be paid by the insurance company bills from private physicians for the fees the insurance company didnt cover test results from the university medical center and from the lab of the private oncologist and of course the correspondence between grace and various cancer specialists around the world grace had dealt with their mothers cancer the way shed dealt with every other crisis shed declared war on it and shed carried on that war with the implacable persistence of sherman burning his way across the south woe betide the insurance clerk who made an error on a bill addressed to margaret morse graces retribution was swift and sure but now the running of that campaign had passed to alex and by graces standard she was doing a pisspoor job her cardinal sin she was not at her mothers bedside instead she was camped out a hundred miles southeast in natchez mississippi while paid nursesstrangerstended her mother in jackson and what was she doing in natchez only burning through her life savings and risking her career in an almost certainly vain quest to punish her sisters murderer grace would have had plenty to say about that but on the other hand it was grace who had charged alex with saving jamie from his father and since bill fennell had legal custody of his son the only way alex could see to save jamie was to prove that his father had murdered his mother alex walked to the oversize card table shed bought at walmart to arrange her case materials this table was the nerve center of her investigation it was fairly primitive stuffjotted notes surveillance records digital snapshots minicassettesbut her father had told her countless times that there was no substitute for putting your heels on the pavement or your ass behind the wheel of your car all the computers in the world couldnt nail a killer if you never left your office alex kept a framed picture of her dad propped on the card tableher patron saint of cold cases it wasnt actually a photograph but a newspaper story that included two snapshots of jim morse one as a freshfaced patrolman in the other as a weary but determinedlooking homicide detective whod solved a highprofile race murder in jackson in her father had gone into police work straight out of the army returning to mississippi after two tours in vietnam hed seen action but hed never talked about it and he never had any lasting problems that alex knew about but working as an mp in saigon jim morse had somehow wound up involved in a couple of murder cases the work had left an impression on him so when hed found himself at loose ends on his twentyfirst birthday hed registered at the police academy in jackson he did well as a patrolman making sergeant before anyone else in his academy class he passed the detectives exam when he was twentyseven and quickly made a name for two things brilliant detective work and speaking his mind no matter whom he happened to be talking to the first trait would have assured rapid promotion had he not possessed the second in equal measure alex had fought all her life to control the same tendency and shed mostly succeeded but her father had watched men with much less talent and dedication climb past him on the promotional ladder for most of his career after retirement jim morse had opened a detective agency with a former partner whod served as his rabbi early in his careera wise old redneck named will kilmer the freedom of a private agency had suited both men and they got all the referral business they could handle alex was certain that it was her teenage exposure to their livelier cases that had caused her to spurn all offers after law school and enroll in the fbi academy instead her father had applauded her career choice but her motherwell margaret had reacted as she always did when alex departed from the path of conventional southern womanhood silent reproach a stab of guilt hit alex high in the chest followed by a wave of grief to avoid the guilt she looked down at a jumble of snapshots of chris and thora shepard in some shots they were together but in most not alex had been following them long enough to form an impression of a classic uppermiddleclass couple harried by the demands of daily life and never quite catching up chris spent a remarkable amount of time working while thora alternated vigorous exercise with personal pampering alex wasnt yet sure how far that pampering extended but she had suspicions she also had some notes and photographs that dr shepard might like to see once he got over the initial shock of todays meeting but not just yet alex felt a vague resentment as she looked down at thora the woman looked better after a sixmile run than most women did after two hours of prepping themselves for a party you had to hate her a little for that chris on the other hand was much more downtoearth a darkhaired henry fonda type rather than a pretty boy a little more muscular than fonda maybe but with that same gravitas in that way dr shepard reminded her of her father another quiet man who had lived for his work mixed in with the images of thora and chris were a few of chris and ben all shot at the vacant lot where chris coached bens little league team ben shepard was only a year younger than jamie and his eyes held some of the same tentativeness that jamies did maybe its just their age she thought or maybe children sense when theres something wrong at the heart of their families dwelling on jamies plight usually made alex too upset to function so she switched on the tv to make the room seem less empty she turned on the water as hot as she could stand it then soaked a washcloth lay on the bed and began to scrub her face the heat spread through her scalp and neck sending blessed relief down the length of her body as some of the days stress faded her mind returned to chris shepard the meeting had gone a lot better than it might have of course for all she knew dr shepard had already called the jackson field office and reported her visit how many people could react with equanimity to the kind of accusation she had made today reduced to its essentials her message was i think your wife is planning to kill you if shepard had reported her she would soon be getting a call from washington like any successful field agent alex had made enemies as well as friends in the bureau but unlike most of those agents she had both in high places one of those enemies had almost gotten her fired after james broadbents death but hed been forced to settle for her banishment to charlotte if he suspected dereliction of duty there the mildest response she could expect would be immediate recall to headquarters for an interview with the office of professional responsibility the bureaus equivalent of internal affairs even a cursory investigation in charlotte would prove their case and thena squalid end to her oncestellar career but alex had a good feeling about chris shepard he was quick on the uptake and she liked that he was a good listenerwhich was rare in men and seemed even rarer in male physicians at least in alexs experience shepard had married a witchand a blond one at thatbut then a lot of decent guys did that hed waited until he was thirtyfive to get remarried which made alex wonder about his first wife shepard had married his college sweetheart during his first year of medical school but two years after graduationjust as he was finishing up a commitment to practice in the dirtpoor mississippi delta to pay off his school loansthere had been a quick divorce no kids no muss no fuss nothing but irreconcilable differences in the court records but there had to be more to it than that otherwise how had a single doctor who wasnt hard to look at evaded marriage for almost five years after his divorce that first wife did a number on him alex thought he was damaged goods for a while thats why he went for thora the ice queen theres a lot of damage in that girl too and i dont think dr chris knows much about it alex reluctantly turned her mind to more mundane matters like finances a kindly accountant might tell her that the outlook was discouraging but her own view was more succinct she was broke it cost real money to run a murder investigation even when you were doing a lot of the legwork yourself she was paying two private detective agencies regularly and various others for small contract jobs most of the work was being done by her fathers old agency but even with will kilmer giving her all the breaks he could the fees were eating her alive surveillance was the main drain uncle will couldnt send out operatives on goodwill alone time spent working alexs case was time stolen from othersmanhours piling upon manhours each days accumulation taking a hefty bite out of her hemorrhaging retirement fund on top of that she was paying for gasoline airfare between jackson and charlotte private nurses for her motherthere was no end to it the charlotte apartment was her most urgent problem for the last three years shed leased a condo in washington dc if she had bought it instead she could have sold it tomorrow for double her money but that was a pipe dream a prudent agent would have dumped the condo after getting transfer orders but alex had kept it knowing that her superiors would learn that she had and would see this as a tangible symbol of her belief in her eventual redemption but now on top of the condo she had a sixmonth lease on a place in charlotte an apartment shed slept in fewer than a dozen nights shed paid her second months rent to maintain the fiction that she was diligently working at her punishment duty but she simply couldnt afford to continue yet if she broke the lease her superiors would eventually find out she thought of possible explanations but none that would mollify the office of professional responsibility shit she muttered tossing the cold washcloth onto the other bed meggie leaped into the air startled by the wet rag alex hadnt seen her curl up on the bed and now she had an indignant cat on her hands id be pissed too she said getting up and going to her computer she logged on to msn and checked her contacts list to see whether jamie was online but the icon beside his screen nameironman qbwas red not green this didnt worry her their nightly webcam ritual normally occurred later after bill had gone to bed though only ten years old jamie was quite talented with computers and since one of the few things bill was generous with was allowanceguilt money she knewjamie had been able to purchase a webcam that allowed him to open a video link with alex anytime that both of them were logged on to msn secret communication with a tenyearold boy might fall on the questionable side of the ethical spectrum but alex figured it paled in comparison to premeditated murder and since grace had charged her with protecting jamie alex felt justified in maintaining contact any way she could leaving her msn screen name active she got up from the desk took her cell phone from her purse and dialed her mothers house a nurse answered its alex is she awake no shes sleeping shes on the morphine pump again oh god hows she doing apart from the pain no change really not physically emotionally the nurse trailed off what is it she seems down of course she is shes dying and shes doing it alone tell her ill call back later alex whispered shes been saying you might be coming back to mississippi soon im already in mississippi alex shut her eyes against the guilt of the necessary lie i may be but im stuck in charlotte for now are the doctors checking on her regularly yes maam please call me if theres any change ill make sure someone does thank you goodbye alex shoved her glock into her waistband at the small of her back flipped her shirttail over its butt then picked up meggie and walked outside to the parking lot room faced the pool which was empty at this hour she felt like swimming some laps but she hadnt packed a bathing suit nor had she thought to buy one when she was at walmart the lobby building of the days inn was styled after an antebellum mansion in imitation of natchezs primary tourist attractions beyond the lobby and a onestory line of rooms an ancient tennis court lay beneath a rectangle of oak trees alex scratched meggies ears and walked toward it she had planned to register at the eola hotel downtown which she remembered from a childhood visit to natchez but shed found she couldnt hack the rate the days inn was fiftynine bucks a night meggies fee included its parking lot led right onto highway turn left and you were headed to new orleans turn right chicago im losing it alex thought get a grip she stepped onto the cracked green surface of the tennis court and sniffed the air she smelled a heavy potpourri of verdant foliage forest leaves kudzu and pine needles laced with honeysuckle azalea and sweet olive she smelled water too real running water not the sterile pool behind her somewhere nearby a creek was winding its way through the forested city toward the mighty river that rolled only a mile to the west alex had only been to natchez three times in her life but she knew one thing it was different from everywhere else most americans considered mississippi unique in their experience but natchez was unique in mississippi an arrogant city to her way of thinking though a certain amount of arrogance could be justified especially about the past the oldest city on the mississippi river natchez had grown fantastically wealthy before the rich delta upriver had even been cleared governed by england france and spain in turn the city had absorbed the style manners and architecture of those european powers and thus quite naturally saw herself as superior to the rest of the state of which she was nominally a part this won natchez few supporters outside her borders but her cottonrich leaders cared so little that they surrendered the magnificent city without firing a shot it was for this reason that alex growing up in jackson had occasionally heard hisses when natchez was mentioned in conversation yet that bloodless surrender had allowed the city to survive the terrible war intact much like charleston and savannah and natchez remained a world unto itself seemingly immune to history outside of time as the fertile soil surrounding natchez was depleted the cotton business moved north to the delta yet natchez did not die decades later travelers from around the world began making pilgrimages to the pristine jewel of the old south to see decadent opulence preserved as though by divine intervention though in fact its beauty was maintained by the free labor of countless society ladies even the hardshell baptists in rural mississippi had a grudging fascination with the river city whose bars stayed open all night and whose blackowned whorehouse was known by name in paris the discovery of oil beneath the old cotton fields resurrected the citys vital spirit for another forty years and some of its celebrated wealth returned as a young girl visiting to take part in the confederate pageant alex had briefly been sucked into a social tornado that only old blood new money and simmering racial tension could generate but by the time she visited againduring college with a sorority sisterthe city had seemed a faded image of itself everything smaller in scale less vivid in color during the past five days alex had read the natchez examiner from front to back every morning while following thora shepard on her runs what she saw in those pages was a city still wrestling with the demons of its past halfblack and halfwhite this former capital of the plantation south could not seem to find its place in the modern world alex wondered what had brought a man like chris shepard back here after a topflight performance in medical school maybe the city sang a siren song that only its natives could hear she walked back to the pool and set meggie down at the shallow end as the cat perched gracefully on the edge and lapped up the placid water alex thought of chris shepard in his white coat after five weeks of frenetic investigation her fateand jamieslay in the doctors hands she planned to give shepard some time to think about todays meeting but not too much during their next visit shed feed him more factsjust enough to set the hook hed been intrigued by that first nibble she could tell who wouldnt have been shed presented him with a classic murder mystery alfred hitchcock brought to life the problem was it was chris shepards life and shepards wife in the end of course the doctors decision about whether to help her would be based upon factors alex could never know the secret realities of his marriage unfathomable currents of emotion that no investigator could ever plumb but she was betting that he would help shed been following thora for five days now and she was certain that thora was leading a secret life on some level her husband had to know that but would he consciously acknowledge it people saw only what they wanted to see and only when they were ready to see it reality might be painfully obvious to others but in love everything was veiled by hope by fear and most of all by trust alexs father had struggled to teach her this but it had taken personal experience to etch the truth into the marrow of her bones trust only your blood she picked up meggie and walked back toward her room a few miles to the south chris shepard was probably lying wideawake in bed wondering if he knew the woman beside him at all alex was sorry for pulling his world inside out but she didnt regret it left to the mercy of his wife shepard probably wouldnt have survived the month as she reached for the doorknob she realized that she had made her decision about the charlotte apartment sayonara she said softly she bolted the door behind her and sat down at her computer jamie still wasnt online her watch read pm alexs chest and throat began to tighten as though she were breathing noxious fumes she badly needed sleep but she would wait until jamies icon turned green no matter how long it took she rubbed her eyes fished a pink tab energy drink from her ice chest sat back down and drank half the can in a few seconds by the time she burped she could already feel the rush of caffeine absorbed through her tongue come on baby she murmured come on talk to aunt alex jamies icon remained red chapter chris had never been a good liar his father hadnt either buddy shepard never earned much money but he had earned respect wherever he worked and hed passed his integrity on to his son integrity wasnt an easy thing to maintain chris had found in a world that ran according to the laws of human nature walking down the dark path between his house and the remodeled barn behind it he wasnt even sure what the right thing was his tread was heavy and he took no joy in his surroundings which had always been a source of pride after moving to natchez he had used a chunk of his savings to buy a large house sited on twenty acres of the former elgin plantation an estate south of town that predated the civil war despite its isolation the house was only five minutes from bens school and less than ten minutes from both natchez hospitals chris couldnt see how this situation could be improved upon but thora had long wanted to move to avalon a trendy new subdivision springing up farther south red simmons had always resisted this desire but after several months of discussion chris had finally given in conceding that in the new neighborhood ben would have more friends living nearby their house in avalonhe privately called it the mcmansionwas threefifths finished thora was personally overseeing construction but chris rarely visited the site he had been raised in a series of rural towns his father had worked for international paper and they were transferred every couple of years and he believed that growing up in the country had played a large part in forging his selfreliance he knew that ben would benefit from a similar environment and for this reason he had privately decided not to sell this land when they moved to avalon a large building appeared before him in the darkness but its rustic exterior belied its real purpose chris had remodeled this barn himself converting it into a video production studio to house the technology of his avocationhis camera hobby as thora called it which bothered him more than he admitted he unlocked the door and walked into his main production room a haven of blond maple and glass spotlessly clean and kept at sixtyfive degrees for the health of the cameras computers and other equipment simply entering this room elevated his mood booting up his apple g did even more in this room he could leave the thousand importunities of daily life behind here he actually had control over what he was doing and deep down he felt that he was doing something great chris had gotten into filmmaking during college where hed worked on several documentaries two of which had won national awards during medical school he produced a documentary called a day in the life of a resident shot with a hidden camera this digital video had almost ended his medical career before it began but after a fellow student sent the tape to a national news network it had ultimately contributed to the limiting of work hours for medical residents once chris began practicing medicine for real though hed found that he had little time for filming anything medicine offered many rewards but spare time wasnt one of them but last year after associating with dr tom cage an oldtime general practitioner in natchez chris had discovered a way to combine his vocation with his avocation after close observation of his new partner chris began work on a documentary about the decline of traditional primarycare medicine and mississippi which was ten years behind the rest of the country in most things was the perfect place to do that tom cage was one of those doctors who would spend a full hour listening to a patient if a sympathetic ear was what that patient needed most seventythree years old tom suffered from several serious chronic diseases and as he often admitted he was sicker than many of his patients but he still worked eightyhour weeks and when he wasnt working he was reading journals to stay up on the latest standards of care dr cage frequently touched patients during his exams and he paid close attention to what he felt most important he questioned patients deeply about not only their specific symptoms but also other areas of their lives that might yield clues to their general health he thought about his fees in terms of trying to save his patients money and thus he was not rich and he never thought about the dozens of patientsmany of them walkinswaiting to see him tom cage stayed at his office until the last patient was seen and only then did he declare his workday done for chris who had begun his privatepractice career in a group of internists his own age dr cages methods had come as a profound shock to physicians of chriss generation a good practice meant high pay short working hours and an abundance of partners to take call so that one night a week was the most you had to worry about phone calls from patients chriss former partners practiced defensive medicine ordering every lab test remotely relevant to every patients symptoms but spending as little time as possible with those patients all in the hallowed name of gross income this kind of practice was anathema to tom cage a system geared toward the convenience and gain of the physician was the tail wagging the dog dr cage saw medicine as a life of service a noble calling perhaps but still a life of service and that chris believed was worth documenting for posterity deep down he shared a lot of toms feelings about modern medicine his own ideas of service had cost him his first wife and he had been cautious in love after that only after thora rayner entered his life had chris felt emboldened to take such a risk again for this reason agent morses visit had disturbed him more than it might have another man chris had fundamentally misjudged his first wife and to admit that he might have done the same thing a second time would be hard in fact he reflected the niggling worries that had surfaced during baseball practice were just thatinconsequential peeves every adult went through personality changes and the first year of a marriage was always a time of adjustment that thora had started spending more money than she used to or wearing tighter clothes meant nothing in the grand scheme of things chris opened the studios refrigerator poured a nearly freezing shot of grey goose and drank it off then he sat down before his g opened final cut pro and began reviewing some scenes hed filmed last week shooting directly to hard drives from his canon xls meant that he wasted no time dumping footage from tape to his computer unfolding before him now was an interview with tom cage and a black woman who had been his patient since that woman now had a greatgreatgranddaughter and that little girl was playing at her feet tom preferred not to treat children anymore but this woman had refused to take her grandchild to any other doctor chris had more recent experience with pediatrics than tom did and hed been proud to help in evaluating the childs high fever which tom had feared might be meningitis as the old woman spoke about dr cage traveling to her home one night during the blizzard of chris felt a strange tide of emotion moving through him until this morning when agent morse had subversively entered his life hed felt more content than he had since childhood his father had been a good man but hed rarely pondered lifes deeper mysteries in tom cage chris had found a mentor with a wealth of knowledge to pass on but who did so without pretense or didacticism almost like a zen master a trenchant question here a small gesture while a patients attention was elsewherein this unassuming way tom had been turning chris into more than a firstclass internist he was turning him into a healer but a career isnt enough to sustain a man chris thought feeling the vodka cross his bloodbrain barrier not even if its a passionate calling a man needs someone to engage his deepest emotions to relieve his drives to soften his obsessions to accept the gifts he feels compelled to give and maybe most important to simply be with him during the thousands of small moments that in aggregate compose a life for almost two years chris had believed that thora was that person along with ben she had closed some magic circle in his life before he married thora chris had not understood how acting as a father to ben would affect him but in less than a year with chriss patient attention the boy had blossomed into a young man who amazed his teachers with his attitude and schoolwork he was no slouch on the athletic field either the pride chris felt in ben had stunned him and hed felt it a solemn dutyeven a privilegeto adopt the boy given what he felt for ben chris could hardly imagine what having his own biological child might do to him he almost felt guilty for asking more of life than he already had every week he watched men die without the things he now possessed either because they had never found them or because they had foolishly cast them away yet noweverything had changed somehow alexandra morse had released a serpent of doubt into his personal eden forcing him to wonder if he truly possessed any of the gifts he had believed to be his goddamn it he murmured goddamn woman did i mess something up asked a worried voice chris looked over his shoulder and saw thora standing behind him she wore a diaphanous blue nightgown and white slippers with wet blades of grass on them hed been so absorbed in the footage and his thoughts that he hadnt heard her enter the studio you were pretty late getting home from the hospital she said diffidently i know you have a lot of admissions yeah most of them are routine stuff but theres one case nobody can figure out don allen consulted tom about it and tom asked for my opinion a look of surprise widened thoras eyes i cant believe don allen consulted with anybody chris smiled faintly the patients family pressured him into it it killed don to do it i could tell but if somebody doesnt figure out what this guy has he could die why not ship him up to jackson don already talked to all the specialists at umc theyve seen the test results and they dont know what to think either i think the family figured tom has seen almost everything in almost fifty years of practicing medicine so they wanted him consulted but tom is stumped too for now anyway my moneys on you thora said smiling i know youll figure it out you always do i dont know this time thora moved closer then leaned down and kissed chriss forehead turn back around she said softly toward the monitor it seemed an odd request but after a moment he turned and faced the screen thora began to rub his shoulders she had surprisingly strong hands for a lithe woman and the release of tension in his neck was so sudden that he felt a mild nausea how does that feel i almost cant take it her hands worked up the sides of his neck and began to knead the bunched muscles at the base of his skull then she slipped her fingertips into his ears and began to massage the shells working steadily inward with increasing pressure before long he felt like sliding out of the chair and onto the floor one of thoras hands vanished but her other moved down into his polo shirt the palm circling his pectoral muscles with surprising force you know what i was thinking she said what we havent tried to get me pregnant in a while no remark could have surprised him more youre right well she slowly spun his chair until he found himself facing her bare breasts normally they were porcelain paleher danish bloodbut like her friends thora had recently become an addict of the tanning salon and her skin glowed an uncharacteristic burnished gold with nary a line in sight kiss them she whispered he did she a made a purling sound deep in her throat a nearly feline expression of pleasure and he felt her shift position while her fingers played in the hair at the back of his neck he worked delicately but steadily at her nipples they were infallible sources of arousal and soon thora was breathing in shallow rasps she bent her knees and reached down to see if he was ready finding him hard she unsnapped his pants then knelt and tried to pull them down he raised his hips for her then sat back down without delay thora lifted her gown and sat wrapping her strong legs around his waist and the chair back chris groaned nearly overcome by her urgency which he had not experienced in some time but tonight thora was the woman he had fallen in love with two years ago and the power of this incarnation pushed him quickly toward climax she gazed into his eyes as she rode him silently urging him on but at the last moment she planted both feet on the floor and thrust herself up and off him what he cried thats not exactly the ideal position for bringing a new generation into the world she said her eyes teasing him with mock reproach oh taking hold of his penis she pulled him over to the leather sofa then lay down on her back and motioned for him to mount her after staring at her long enough to engrave the image in his mind he did as thora whispered lewd encouragements in his ear the interview with alex morse rose inexplicably into his mind their conversation had a surreal quality now could such a thing be possible had someone pretending to be a patient actually lied her way into his office and then accused his wife of murder and before the fact it was crazy now thora told him now now now chris thrust deep and held the contact letting thora take herself over the threshold when she cried out her nails raking his shoulder blades he let himself go and a white glare burned away all ambiguity as he came slowly back to the present thora strained upward to kiss his lips then fell back sweating despite the steady flow of airconditioning chris drew out and lay beside her on the cold leather you can get up if you want to she said im going to stay here a few minutes let things take their natural course he laughed im fine right here good answer they lay in silence for a while then thora said is everything all right chris why do you ask you seemed distant today did something happen at work god did something happen just the usual is the new house bothering you again i havent even thought about it she looked disappointed i dont know if thats good either he forced a smile the house is fine it just takes a while to turn a country boy into a city boy if its possible at all well soon find out thora pulled damp hair out of her eyes oh i forgot i wanted to ask you something what laura canning is going up to the alluvian this week she asked me to go with her the alluvian you know that hotel in greenwood up in the delta the one the viking range people remodeled its supposed to be stunning you practiced up in the delta for a while didnt you he laughed my patient base couldnt afford that kind of place they supposedly have a terrific spa up there people fly down from new york to stay there morgan freeman has that blues club in the delta you know and hes stayed at the alluvian chris nodded he liked morgan freemans work but he wasnt into picking spas based on where hollywood actors went he wasnt into spas at all to be honest he broke all the sweat he needed to while maintaining the twenty acres of land around his house if you dont want me to go i wont thora said seemingly without rancor but this is bens last week of school and he always asks you for help with his homework anyway i dont have the patience chris couldnt argue this point when are we talking about a couple of days from now probably wed just be gone three nights then right back home mud packs and champagne a little blues music then home chris nodded and forced another smile but this one took more effort it wasnt that he didnt want thora to have fun it was alex morses voice whispering in his head is your wife planning to be out of town anytime soon chris thora asked tell the truth do you want me to stay home he recalled her face as she made love to him the unalloyed pleasure in her bluegray eyes now she was lying on her back on chilly leather so that his sperm would have the maximum probability of impregnating her what the hell was he worried about i think im just wornout he said between work and rounds and working on my project and baseball practice thora added ninety minutes a day in eightyfivedegree heat with a bunch of wild indians you go up to the delta and chill out he said though he had never associated the words delta and chill in his mind before ben and i will be fine thora gave him an elfin smile then kissed him again you stay right here he stared as she jumped up and ran to the studio door then disappeared through it she reappeared a moment later holding both hands behind her back what are you doing he asked feeling strangely anxious ive got a surprise for you two surprises he sat up on the couch what i dont need anything she laughed and moved closer are you sure yes she brought her right hand from behind her back in it was a plate of chocolate chip cookies his mouth watered at the scent of themuntil alex morses warnings sounded in his head before he had to make a choice about eating the cookies thora held out a cardboard tube like the ones she used to carry blueprints for the new house chris forced a smile but the prospect of discussing the avalon house did not please him in the least i see that frown thora said setting the cookies beside him then perching her perfect derriere on his knees you just wait and see she removed a sheet of paper from the tube unrolled it and spread it across her nude thighs chris saw what appeared to be plans for a new building behind the seventhousandsquarefoot house that was now nearing completion a rather large building whats that he asked groaning internally a private gym thora laughed no thats your new studio his face flushed what she smiled and kissed his cheek thats my housewarming present to you i had our architect consult with an expert in new york youre looking at a stateoftheart video production studio all you have to do is select your equipment thorayou cant be serious her smile broadened oh im serious theyve already poured the foundation and run the hightech cabling very expensive this was almost too much to absorb after what chris had endured today he wanted to get up and pace the room but thora had him pinned to the couch suddenly she tossed the plans and the tube onto the couch and hugged him tight im not letting you slip back here every time you want to edit your videos youre stuck with me understand he didnt he felt as though he had swallowed some sort of hallucinogen but then if alex morse had not visited his office this morning none of this would seem anything but a wonderful surprise i finally surprised you thora said in an awestruck voice i did didnt i he nodded in a daze she took a cookie from the plate and held it to his lips here you need your strength no thanks her disappointment was plain i actually made these from scratch im sorry im really not hungry ill eat some later she shrugged then popped the cookie into her mouth your loss she said her eyes twinkling as she chewed mmmalmost better than sex chris smelled the melting chocolate in her mouth watched her swallow with exaggerated pleasure alex morse is batshit he told himself thora looked into his eyes then took his hand and cupped her breast with it you up for a second round we can raise the odds by two hundred million or so he felt like an astronaut cut loose from his spacecraft drifting steadily away from everything familiar who could live like this he wondered secondguessing every move in my own house he closed his eyes and kissed thora with desperate fervor chapter alexs heart leaped when she saw the little red icon turn green indicating that jamie had logged on to msn shed been checking for the past three hours playing spider solitaire and waiting for jamies icon to light up a new screen like a small tv appeared within her main screen but the tv was blank then an image of jamie sitting at his desk in his room at bill fennells house flashed up the immediacy of the webcam was overwhelming at first it truly was like being in the same room with the person you were talking to you could see every emotion in their eyes every movement of their face tonight jamie was wearing an atlanta braves tshirt and the yellow baseball cap of his dixie youth team his eyes werent looking at her but at his monitor so that he could watch her image projected from his screen she knew that she looked the same to him since she was staring at his image and not the camera mounted atop her screen hey aunt alex he said sorry im late she smiled genuinely for the first time all day its okay you know ill be here whenever you log on what you been doing bub jamie smiled i had a baseball game how did it go they killed us im sorry how did you do i got a double alex yelped and applauded thats great jamies smile vanished but i struck out twice thats okay even the pros strike out twice in one game sure they do i once saw hank aaron strike out three times in one game this was a lie but a harmless one hank aaron was about the only player whose name she knew and him only because of her father whos hank aaron jamie asked he hit more home runs than babe ruth oh i thought that was barry bonds alex shrugged it doesnt matter you got a double thats what matters what else has been going on jamie sighed like a fiftyyearold man i dont know yes you do come on i think shes over here right now missy missy hammond was bills mistress jamie nodded anger flooded through alex she tasted copper in her mouth why do you think that did you see her no jamie glanced behind him at his bedroom door dad thinks im asleep now he came in to check and i had the lights off after a few minutes i heard the back door i thought he might be leaving so i sneaked out to the rail i didnt see anything but after a while i heard somebody laughing it sounded exactly like her alex didnt know what to say im sorry jamie lets talk about something else the boy hung his head thats easy for you to say why dont you just come get me dad wants to be with her not me im not sleepy at all i cant just come get you we talked about that but your father wants you jamie alex wasnt sure whether this was true he wants both of you the boy shook his head after the game all dad talked about was my strikeouts and what else i did wrong nothing about my double alex put on a smile and nodded as though she understood i think a lot of dads are like that your granddad did that when i played softball jamie looked surprised really oh yeah he didnt hesitate to tell me what i did wrong this wasnt quite true jim morse could give constructive criticism but he knew how to do it without making you feel bad and most of what alex remembered from being ten years old was unconditional praise your dads just trying to help you improve she added i guess i dont like it though jamie reached down then lifted a heavy book onto his desk i was supposed to do my homework earlier but i didnt feel like it can i do it now sure will you stay on while i do it alex smiled you know i will now jamie was grinning they had done this many times since graces death while jamie read his assignment alex sat watching him her mind roving back through the past for some reason her father was in her mind tonight jim morse had loved his grandson more than anything else in the world and that might have included his own daughters when grace and alex were young jim had been building a business and despite putting real effort into being a father he had seen them mostly in passing but with jamie hed had endless hours to spend with the boy jim had taught him to hunt and fish to waterski to fly kites and not just to throw a baseball but to pitch one for real jamie fennell could throw a curveball when he was eight years old jim had spent all this time with jamie despite the fact that jim and bill fennell did not get along in alexs eyes her father had proved his manhood for all time by compromising as much as was required to keep close contact with his grandson one thing alex knew in her bones though if her father had been alive to hear graces deathbed accusation of murder the events of the past weeks would have unfolded differently that very night bill fennell would have been hauled into an empty room slammed against a wall and made to cough up all the sediment at the bottom of his soul had that treatment not proved sufficient to dredge up the truth bill would have been taken on an involuntary boat ride with jim morse will kilmer and some of the other excops who worked for their detective agency one way or another bill would have spilled all he knew about graces death and jamie would not be living in bills ugly mansion on the edge of the ross barnett reservoir in jackson if the courts didnt save jamie his grandfather would have taken him somewhere safe to be raised by people who loved him and alex would have gone with them she wouldnt have thought twice about it none of that had happened of course because like his daughter grace jim morse was dead alex had studied all the eyewitness accounts but none of them ever dovetailed exactlyunlike the accounts of her own act of lunacy at the bank when broadbent was killed everybody had seen exactly the same thing on that day but with her fathers death it was different at age sixty jim had walked into a dry cleaners late on a friday afternoon he normally used the drivethrough window but that day he chose to go inside two female clerks stood behind the counter a young black man wearing a threepiece suit was waiting in the store but he was no customer the real customers were lying flat on their stomachs behind the counter beside a grocery bag filled with cash from the register jim didnt know that when he walked in but alex figured it had taken him about six seconds to realize something was wrong no one was going to bluff jim morse out of a robbery in progress no matter how old he was the girls behind the counter were so scared they could hardly speak when jim walked up to the counter and started a monologue about the weather how warm the fall had been and how it used to snow once or twice a year in mississippi but nowadays almost never one clerk saw jim glance behind the counter without moving his head but the other didnt what she did see was jim take his wifes clothes from the hanging rod and turn to leave the store as he passed the waiting customer jim flattened him with a savage blow to the throat the clerk was shocked that an old grayhaired dude had attacked a muscular man in his early twenties no one who knew jim morse was surprised hed often carried a gun after retirement but he hadnt on that day not for a short run to the cleaners jim was digging in the fallen robbers jacket when the plateglass window of the store exploded one clerk screamed then fell silent as a bullet punctured her left cheek the other dived behind the counter after that few facts were known the medical examiner believed that the shot that killed alexs father had been fired from behind the counter not from the getaway car parked out front not that it mattered after a lifetime spent courting danger jim morse had simply run out of luck and despite relentless efforts by the police department by his old partner and even a large reward offered by the police benevolent association his killers were never caught alex knew that her father had not wanted to die that day but she knew something else too he would rather have died like that than the way his wife was dying nowin agony and by inches the sound of jamie closing his book startled her from her reverie im done he said his green eyes still on the screen its way easier when youre with me i like being here with you it helps me work too jamie smiled you werent working i saw you you were just sitting there i was working in my head a lot of my work is like that jamies smile vanished and he looked away from the screen jamie are you all right look at me honey look into the camera at length he did and his sad eyes pierced her to the core aunt alex yes i miss my mom alex forced herself to repress her grief tears were pooling in her eyes but they would not help jamie one thing she had learned the hard way when adults started crying kids lost all their composure i know you do baby she said softly i miss her too she used to say what you said that she was working in her head alex tilted back her head and wiped her eyes unable to shut out the memory of the night grace died when shed snatched up jamie and raced out of the hospital she hadnt gone far just to a nearby pizza hut where shed broken the news of graces death and comforted jamie as best she could her own father had died only six months before and his death had hit jamie as hard as it had her but graces death was a tragedy of such magnitude that the boy simply could not process it alex had buried his head between her breasts silently praying for the power to revoke death and hoping that grace had been out of her mind when she accused her husband of murder alex held an opened hand up to the eye of the camera you be strong little man you do that for me okay things are going to get better jamie put up his hand too are they you bet im working on it right now good jamie looked back at the door i guess i better go now alex blinked back more tears same time tomorrow jamie smiled faintly same time then he was gone alex got up from the desk with tears streaming down her cheeks she spat curses and stomped around the motel room like a confined mental patient but she knew she hadnt lost her mind yet she looked down at the newspaper photo of her father he would understand why she was living in this claustrophobic motel instead of keeping a deathwatch over her mothers bed right or wrong jim would be doing the same thing trying to save his grandson and no matter what it took alex was going to fulfill her promise to grace if the bureau wanted to fire her for doing the job it should have been doing then the bureau could go to hell there was law and there was justice and no morse she was related to had ever had any trouble recognizing the difference alex stripped off her pants and shirt walked out to the empty pool and started swimming laps in her underwear it was too late for anyone decent to complain and if a bill fennell type wanted to sit on the plastic furniture and ogle her ass while she worked out her frustration then he was welcome to it if he was still there when she got out shed kick his butt across the parking lot chapter dr eldon tarver walked slowly along the park path his big head down his eyes in a practiced state of general focus searching for feathers in the tall grass in one hand he carried a nike duffel bag in the other an aluminum reacharm device used by most people for picking up soda cans and litter from the ground but dr tarver was not like most people he was using the reacharm to pick up dead birds which he then sealed inside ziploc bags and dropped into the nike duffel hed been out since before dawn and hed bagged four specimens already three sparrows and a martin two seemed quite fresh and this boded well for the work he would do later in the morning dr tarver had seen only two other humans so far both runners not many people ventured into this corner of the park where branches hung low to the ground and the path was overgrown in many places the doctor had startled both runners partly by his simple presence at this place and time but also because of his appearance eldon tarver would never be mistaken for a runner he was not dressed in shorts or warmups but in cheap slacks and a pullover from the casual male big amp tall shop on county line road dr tarver stood six feet three inches tall with a barrel chest and ropy arms covered with black hair he had been bald since the age of forty but he wore a full gray beard that gave him the look of a mennonite preacher he had preachers eyes toonot parsons eyes but the burning orbs of a revealed prophetbright blue irises that shimmered in the center of their dark sockets like coins at the bottom of a well when he was angry those eyes could burn like the eyes of a demon but few people had ever seen this more often his eyes radiated a glacial coldness some women at the medical center thought him handsome but others called him downright ugly this impression being bolstered by what most people thought was a winestain birthmark on his left cheek the disfiguring mark was actually a severe arteriovenous anomaly a horror that had begun mildly during childhood but which during puberty had flamed to the surface like the sign of a guilty conscience all these qualities had combined to make even the large male runner jig five steps to the right as he passed for it took five steps to get clear of the bearded giant ambling along the path with his aluminum stick and duffel bag as the first yellow rays of sunlight spilled through the oak limbs to the east another runner appeareda girl this time a vision in tight blue under armour with white wires trailing from her golden hair the wires disappeared into an ipod strapped to her upper arm dr tarver wanted to watch her approach but just then he noticed another bird off the path this one twitching in its death throes it might have fallen only seconds ago the girls shoes swished through the dewy grass as she left the asphalt path on the side opposite the doctor she tried to make it appear as though shed done this out of courtesy but she could not deceive him he divided his attention between the girl and the bird one filled with life the other dying fast she tried not to look at him as she sprinted past but she couldnt manage it twice her pupils flicked toward him gauging the distance making sure he hadnt moved closer threat assessment was such a finely tuned gift one of the blessings of evolution he smiled as the girl passed then turned and regarded her flexing glutes as they receded from view appreciating their shape with the cool regard of an expert anatomist after shed vanished around a bend he stood still breathing the wake of her perfumean illadvised accessory for morning jogs if one wanted to avoid unwelcome attention after the fragrance had dissipated beyond detection he knelt donned surgical gloves and withdrew a scalpel a syringe and a culture dish from his pocket then he tied on a surgical mask and laid open the sparrows breast with a single incision with a long finger he exposed the birds liver inserting the tip of the hypodermic into the nearly black organ he exerted a gentle backpressure and probed with the needle until he was rewarded with a slow spurt of blood he needed only a single ccless actuallybut he took the full amount possible then snapped the sparrows neck with a quick twist and tossed its carcass into the underbrush opening the petri dish dr tarver squirted some blood onto the layer of minced chick embryo inside and rubbed it around with a sterile swab taken from his pocket then he closed the dish and slipped it into the duffel with the ziploc bags his gloves came off with a snapthose went into the bag as welland then he cleaned his hands with a dab of purell a good mornings work when he got back to the lab hed test the last bird first he felt confident that it was a carrier a slow shiver in the grass where hed tossed the sparrow raised the hair on his arms the accompanying sound was faint but the sounds of childhood never faded dr tarver set down the nike bag and walked lightlyvery lightly considering his sizetoward the closing groove in the grass as soon as he saw the rotting log he knew he closed his eyes for a moment stilling himself at the center then he reached down with his left hand and lifted the log what he saw beneath fluttered his heart no crotalid but a beautiful coil of red yellow and black shimmering in the sun micrurus fulvius fulvius he whispered he had uncovered an eastern coral snake one of the shiest serpents in america and undoubtedly the deadliest with a fluid motion like that of a father stroking his childs hair tarver took hold of the stirring elapid behind its head and lifted it into the air the brightly banded body coiled around his forearma full twenty inches of himbut this was not a strong snake a cottonmouth or rattler would have struggled using its strong muscles to try to whip away from him and strike but the coral snake was no brutish pit viper injecting prey with crude hemotoxin that caused terrible pain and swelling as it ate away the walls of blood vessels bringing gangrene and infection to its human victims no the coral was a refined killer like its relative the cobra it injected pure neurotoxin which brought only numbness before shutting down the central nervous system of its prey quickly bringing on paralysis and death dr tarver was a pathologist not a herpetologist but he had a long history with snakes it had begun in childhood this education and not by choice for dr tarver serpents were inevitably bound up with the idea of god not the way his adoptive parents had seen this relationshipbecause only fools tempted death as a test of faithbut bound up with god nonetheless as a boy eldon had watched dozens of frightened rattlesnakes held high by chanting hillbillies who believed that god had anointed them against the lethal compounds in the bulging poison sacs behind the slitted eyes he knew better he had seen many of those hillbillies bitten on their hands arms necks and faces and every blessed one had suffered fleshly torments beyond their imagination some had lost digits others limbs and two had lost their lives eldon knew their fates because he had been one of those hillbillies once not by choice or even by birth but by the authority of the state of tennessee he also knew that the skeptics who accused his adoptive father of keeping the snakes in refrigerators to make them sluggish or of milking their venom before the services had no idea whom they were talking about the faith of those hillbillies was as genuine as the rocks they plowed from the brickhard earth of the appalachian foothills every day but sunday they wanted death in the church with them when they witnessed to the lord eldon had personally gathered many of the vipers for sunday and wednesday services the church elders had quickly seen that the big birthmarked boy taken from the presbyterian childrens home in knoxville had the giftso much so that his adoptive father had begged him to take up the cloth himself but that was another story eldon watched the sunlight play upon the corals overlapping scales each scale part of a perfect minuet of indescribable beauty there had been no corals in tennessee you had to go east to north carolina or south to mississippi to find them but during his long walks in the wilderness around jackson he had seen three or four in the past few years it was one of the hidden pleasures of this muchmaligned state the serpents body curled around his arm in a fluid figure eight a perfect symbol of infinity his adoptive fathers congregation had believed snakes to be incarnations of satan but the twin serpents on the caduceus that eldon wore on a chain around his neck were far more representative of the reptiles true nature at least in the symbolic realm serpents symbolized healing because the ancient greeks had seen their skinshedding as a process of healing and rebirth had the greeks understood microbiology they would have observed much deeper links between serpents and the secret machinery of life but even the ancients had understood that snakes personified the fundamental paradox of all medicinal drugs in small doses they cured while in large ones they killed he held the coral snake up to his face and laughed richly then opened the nike bag slid the snake inside and zipped it shut turning toward the distant clearing where hed parked his car dr tarver experienced a sense of fulfillment that far exceeded that which he had felt upon finding the dead birds indeed he felt blessed americans lived in constant fear yet they never really knew how close they were to death at all hours of the day and night if you wanted to find death you hardly had to go looking for it stay in one place long enough and it would find you dr tarvers journey to his laboratory took him north along interstate east of the main cluster of office buildings that surrounded jacksons great capitol dome to his left the amsouth tower jutted up from the low skyline of the capital city his gaze moved along the sixteenth floor to the blueblack windows of the corner office eldon had driven along this interstate and checked those windows almost every day for the past five years but today was the first time that sunlight had ever flashed back from the office like a silver beacon reflecting off the aluminum foil that he had named as an emergency signal all those years ago the muscles of his big chest tightened and his breathing shallowed there had been bumps in the road beforesmall matters of planning or miscommunication but never had anything justified the use of this signal the foil meant real trouble eldon had chosen this primitive method for precisely the same reason that intelligence agencies did if you were truly in danger possibly even blown the worst thing you could do was contact your associates by any traceable method unlike a telephone or a computer or a pager the foil was nonspecific no one could ever prove it was a signal not even the nsa could train cameras on every square inch of land from which that square of foil could be seen no the foil had been a good idea so had the prearranged meeting andrew rusk knew where to go the question was could he get there without being followed what could the emergency signal imply other than unwanted interest on the part of someone but who the police the fbi at the most fundamental level it didnt matter dr tarvers first instinct was to eliminate the source of the danger only andrew rusk knew his identity or anything about his recent activities and rusk could not be trusted to keep silent under pressure the lawyer thought he was strong and by the standards of the earlytwentyfirstcentury yuppie he might be but that particular subspecies of homo sapiens had no clue to the true nature of strength or hardship no idea of selfreliance seconds after seeing the aluminum foil eldon was thinking of finding a comfortable perch overlooking one of the streets rusk drove every day and putting a largecaliber bullet through the lawyers cerebral cortex only by doing this could he insure his own safety of course if he killed rusk he would never know the nature of the threat killing rusk would also mean activating his escape plan and dr tarver wasnt ready to leave the country yet he still had important work to do he glanced down at the nike bag on the front seat beside him the prearranged meeting place was thirty miles away did he have time to run the birds out to his lab should he risk meeting rusk at all yes answered his instinct not one death has yet been called murder by the police not publicly anyway even logic dictated that he should risk the meeting no one could trap him in the place he had designated a new possibility arced through eldons mind what if rusk had put up the aluminum foil as bait what if hed somehow been caught and in exchange for leniency was offering up his accomplice on a platter there might be cops waiting at the lab right now eldon could afford to lose the birds west nile was an unpredictable virus highly variable in patient populations depending on preexisting immunities crossimmunities other factors the possibility of capture outweighed any possible gain in research dr tarver gripped the wheel tighter exited i at northside drive then got back onto the elevated freeway heading south what about the coral snake though he hated the idea of ditching it with the birds perhaps it should attend the emergency meeting or should he do as hed once done after his briefcase was stolen from his car at the mall park his unlocked car in a remote section of the lot with an expensive bag on the seat in the chaotic freeforall of crime that was jackson a thief had stolen the bag in less than thirty minutes dr tarver had always imagined the look on the felons face when he expectantly opened the bag and found not plunder but a coiled whip of muscle and deadly fangs instant karma shitbird a wicked smile glittered in his beard it was funny how seemingly unrelated events revealed hidden significance as time passed the foil on the building and the coral snake might well be connected in some jungian web of synchronicity maybe the snake was somehow the resolution of the problem signaled by the foil he unzipped the bag and waited for the yellowbanded head to emerge ten miles melted beneath his tires before it did when the first red band slid out of the bag dr tarver took the corals head between his thumb and forefinger and drew its body out of the bag children were sometimes bitten by corals because the snakes were so beautiful that kids couldnt resist picking them up were corals not naturally so secretive there would be a lot more dead children in the american south the serpent hung suspended for a moment then coiled itself around the doctors big forearm for the second time a euphoric rush dilated his blood vessels unlike chemically induced highs the reaction caused by the sliding of scales against his bare skin never lost its potency he felt the thrill of a young boy holding a gun for the first time the intoxicating power of holding death in your hand the death of others the ability to bring about your own as he drove southward dr tarver reveled in the proximity of eternity chapter even after three shots of vodka chris found himself unable to sleep at am he finally gave up he slid silently out of bed and dressed in the closet then walked out to the garage loaded his bike onto the rack on his pickup and drove twenty minutes to the north side of town there under a violet sky he topped off his highpressure tires mounted his carbon fiber trek and started pedaling north on the lonely gray stripe of the natchez trace the windless air had felt warm and close while he was filling his tires but now his forward motion cooled him to the point of a chill this far south most of the twolane trace was a tunnel created by the high arching branches of the red oaks that lined the parkway the effect was that of a natural cathedral that extended for miles through the few breaks in the canopy chris saw a yellow halfmoon still high despite the slowly rising sun he pumped his legs with a metronomic rhythm breathing with almost musical regularity small animals skittered away as he passed and every half mile or so groups of startled deer leapt into the shelter of the trees a warm steady rain began to fall landmarks rolled by like a film without a sound track loess bluff with its steadily eroding face of rare soil the splitrail fence that marked the ranger station at mount locust the high bridge over coles creek from which you could see low water bridge the site of some of chriss happiest childhood memories after he crossed the high bridge he got serious pumping his thighs like a tour de france rider trying to work out the accumulated anxiety of the past eighteen hours the thing was you couldnt work out anxiety arising from circumstances that remained outside your control and special agent alex morse was definitely not under his control he jammed it all the way to the end of this stretch of the trace then made a degree turn and headed back southwest out of the whisper of tires on wet pavement came a faint chirping it took him fifty feet to recognize the sound of his cell phone half the time he had no reception out here that was one reason he chose the trace to ride reaching carefully backward he dug his cell phone from the goretex pouch hanging beneath his seat the lcd said unknown caller chris started to ignore the call but the early hour made him wonder if one of his hospital patients was in trouble it might even be tom cage calling about the mystery case on north dr shepard he said in his professional voice hello doctor said a strangely familiar voice darryl he asked almost sure that he recognized his old fraternity brothers voice foster hell yeah you finally got my message huh just now i know its early but i figured you hadnt changed much since college always the first one awake even with a hangover i appreciate you calling man well that name you mentioned really woke me up why in the world are you asking me about alex morse did you meet her or something chris debated about how much to reveal if you dont mind id rather not say yet woowoowoo foster said mockingly so what do you want to know about her anything you can tell me is she really an fbi agent sure or she used to be anyway the truth is im not sure about her official status now why not i dont know the lady chris so take all this with a grain of salt but alex morse was a bona fide star in the bureau she started out as what we call a blue flamer kind of like you in collegeas on everything always doing more than you had to she made quite a name for herself as a hostage negotiator word was she was the best anything highprofile or hushhush the director flew her in to handle it youre speaking in the past tense absolutely i dont know the whole scoop but a couple of months ago morse lost her shit and got somebody killed chriss legs stopped pumping who got killed he asked coasting along the pavement a hostage no a fellow agent how did that happen word is it was a supertense hostage scene and morse flipped out the hostage rescue teambasically our swat guyswas given the order to go in and morse couldnt deal with it she charged back into the sceneapparently to try to keep negotiatingand everybody started shooting an agent named james broadbent got his heart blown out by a shotgun i did know jim personally he was your allamerican guy with a wife and two kids there was some talk that he was having an affair with morse at the time but you never know whats true in those situations chris was trying to absorb this fast enough to ask intelligent questions so you dont know if morse is legit or not he temporized no you want me to find out can you do it without setting off any alarms in washington maybe but you need to tell me what this is about darryl is there any chance that morse could be involved in a murder investigation foster said nothing for a while i dont think so we dont handle murder cases you know not unless there are special circumstances civil rights murders stuff like that on tv its always fbi agents chasing the serial killers thats hollywood bullshit one very small branch of the bureau advises local and state cops on murder casesif they request itbut they never make arrests or anything like that chris couldnt think of any brilliant questions and he didnt want foster to get aggressive with his own i really appreciate you calling back darryl thank you you cant give me any more details than you already have chris searched his mind for some plausible explanation morse was originally from mississippi okay thats all i can say right now if anything strange happens ill call you back guess thatll have to do foster said sounding far from satisfied hey hows that new wife of yours fine shes good sorry i missed the wedding but jake preston told me shes hot like really hot chris managed a laugh she looks good yeah goddamn doctors they always get the hot ones chris laughed genuinely this time hearing some of his old friends personality come through thanks again darryl i mean it ill call you back when i get the story on morse could be today probably tomorrow though any time is fine hey where are you living now still the windy city its nice this time of year but i froze my ass off last winter im ready for miami or la good luck yeah talk to you soon chris stuffed his phone back into the seat pouch and dug in hard there were cars and trucks moving along the trace now most carrying workers who lived beyond the borders of the long but narrow strip of federal land the speed limit on the trace was fiftygreat for bikers if the commuters had observed it but none did checking his watch he realized that he probably wouldnt make it home in time to take ben to school that would make thora wonder but hed had to do something to dissipate the tension that morses visit had caused now fosters call had canceled out any relief hed felt from the exercise he had more information now but no real answers alex morse was a star fbi agent whod screwed up and gotten someone killed fine shed admitted the screwup herself but what was she now a field agent working a legitimate case or a rogue agent working her sisters murder without permission in one respect it didnt matter because chris was convinced that in her views of his situation she was out of her goddamn mind he wrenched his handlebars to the right as a car blasted by from behind its horn blaring its tires spraying water he almost took a spill on the shoulder then made a lastsecond recovery and edged back onto the wet pavement the driver was too far gone to see now but chris flipped him off anyway he wouldnt normally have done that but then he wouldnt normally have allowed a vehicle to catch him unawares on a seldomtraveled road as his tires thrummed along the pavements edge he saw another biker in the distance approaching on the opposite side of the trace as the distance closed chris saw that the rider was female he raised his hand in greeting then hit his brakes the rider was alexandra morse chapter agent morse wasnt wearing a biking helmet but her dark hair was drawn back into a soakingwet ponytail making her facial scars all the more prominent it was the scars that allowed chris to recognize her he could hardly believe her presence and he was about ready to sprint right past her when she crossed the road and hissed to a stop a yard away from him good morning doctor what the hell are you doing he asked i needed to talk to you this seemed like a good way to do it how did you know i was here morse only smiled chris looked her from head to toe taking in the soaked clothes stuck to her body and her dripping ponytail she had chill bumps on her arms and legs and the cotton tulane law shirt she was wearing would take forever to dry even if the rain stopped and the bike he asked you a big cyclist no i bought it four days ago when i found out that you were a biker and your wife was a runner youve been following thora too morses smile faded ive shadowed a couple of her runs shes fast jesus chris shook his head and started to ride away wait morse cried im not a threat dr shepard he stopped and looked back im not so sure of that why not he thought of darryl fosters words call it instinct you have good instincts about sources of danger in the past i have even when those sources are human a red pickup truck whizzed past its rider staring at them why dont we keep riding morse suggested well be less noticeable talking that way i dont intend to continue yesterdays conversation she looked incredulous surely you must have some questions for me chris looked off into the trees then turned and let some of his anger through his eyes yes i do my first question is did you personally see my wife go into this divorce lawyers office morse took a small step backward not personally no but who did another agent how did he identify thora he followed her down to her car then took down her license plate her license plate no chance of a mistake no chance he got one number wrong and it could have been someone else morse shook her head he shot a picture of her do you have that picture not on me but she was wearing a very distinctive outfit a black silk dress with a white scarf and an audrey hepburn hat not many women can pull that kind of thing off anymore chris gritted his teeth thora had worn that same outfit to a party only a month ago do you have any recordings of her conversation with the lawyer copies of any memos or files anything that proves what they talked about morse reluctantly shook her head so you admit that its possible that they talked about wills and estates or investments or something else legitimate agent morse looked down at her wet shoes after a while she looked back up and said its possible yes but you dont believe it she bit her bottom lip but said nothing agent morse i happen to know from my wifes recent behavior that what you suggested yesterday is impossible the fbi agent looked intrigued but instead of asking what he was talking about she said its ten miles back to your truck why dont we ride back together i promise not to piss you off if i can help it chris knew he could leave morse behind in seconds but for some reasonmaybe just the manners hed been raised withhe decided not to he shrugged climbed into his pedal clips and started southward at an easy pace morse fell in beside him and immediately started talking have you called anybody about me he decided to leave darryl foster out of the conversation i figured youd already know the answer to that arent you tapping my phones she ignored this im sure you have some questions for me after all i said yesterday chris shook the rain out of his eyes ill admit ive done some thinking about what you told me especially about the medical side good go on i want to know more about these unexplained deaths as you called them what do you want to know how the people died was it a stroke in every case no only my sisters really what were the other causes of death pulmonary embolism in one myocardial infarction in another what else a hundred feet of road passed beneath them before morse answered the rest were cancer chris looked sharply over at her but morse kept watching the road cancer she nodded over her handlebars and water dripped off her nose fatal malignancies youre kidding right no youre telling me this cluster of suspicious deaths that has you so worked up involves people whove died of cancer yes he thought about this for a while how many victims were there total nine deaths tied to the divorce lawyer i told you about six cancers that ive traced so far same kind of tumor in every person that depends on how picky you are they were all blood cancers call me picky blood cancer encompasses a whole constellation of diseases agent morse there are over thirty different types of nonhodgkins lymphomas alone at least a dozen different leukemias were all the deaths from one type of blood cancer at least no three leukemias two lymphomas one multiple myeloma chris shook his head youre out of your mind you really believe someone is murdering people by giving them different kinds of cancer morse looked over at him and her eyes were as grim as any hed ever seen i know it thats impossible are you so sure youre not an oncologist chris snorted it doesnt take an oncologist to realize that would be a stupid way to murder someoneeven if it were possible even if you could somehow induce cancer in your victim it could take years for that person to die if they died at all a lot of people survive leukemia now lymphomas too and people live well over five years with myeloma after bone marrow transplants some patients have two transplants and live ten years or more all these patients died in eighteen months or less this brought him up short eighteen months from diagnosis to death all of them all but one the myeloma patient lived twentythree months after an autologous bone marrow transplant aggressive cancers then very aggressive obviously morse wanted him to work this out for himself these people who diedthey were all married to wealthy people all of them to very wealthy people and all the surviving spouses were clients of the same divorce lawyer morse shook her head i never said that i said all the surviving spouses wound up in business with the same divorce lawyerand only after the deaths of their spouses big deals mostly oneoffs that had nothing to do with the lawyers area of expertise chris nodded but his mind was still on morses cancer theory i dont want to get into a technical argument but even if all these patients died from leukemias youre talking about several different disease etiologies and the actual carcinogenesis isnt understood in a majority of types include the lymphomas and youre dealing with entirely different cell groupsthe erythroid and bcell malignanciesand the causes of those cancers are also unknown the fact that your blood cancers killed in less than eighteen months is probably their only similarity in every other way theyre probably as different from each other as pancreatic cancer and a sarcoma and if the best oncologists in the world dont know what causes those cancers who do you think could intentionally cause them to commit murder radiation causes leukemia morse said assertively you dont have to be a genius to give someone cancer shes right chris realized many initial survivors of hiroshima died of leukemia in the aftermath of the atomic bomb as did many survivors of the chernobyl disaster marie curie died of leukemia caused by her radium experiments you could cause sophisticated genetic damage with a metaphorically blunt instrument his mind instantly jumped to the issue of access to gamma radiation youd have to consider physicians dentists veterinarianshell even some medical technologists had access to xray machines or the radioactive isotopes used for radiotherapy agent morses theory was based on more than wild speculation yet the basic premise still seemed ludicrous to him its been done before you know morse said what has during the late s the nazis experimented with ways of sterilizing large numbers of jews without their knowledge they asked subjects to sit at a desk and fill out some forms that would take about fifteen minutes during that time highenergy gamma rays were fired at their genitals from three sides the experiment worked my god why couldnt someone do the same thing to an unsuspecting victim in a lawyers office morse asked or a dentists office chris pedaled harder but said nothing you know that researchers purposely cause cancer in lab animals all the time right of course they do it by injecting carcinogenic chemicals into the animals and chemicals like that are traceable agent morse forensically i mean she gave him a skeptical look in an ideal world but you said yourself it takes time to die from cancer after eighteen months all traces of the offending carcinogen could be gone benzene is a good example chris knit his brow in thought benzene causes lung cancer doesnt it also leukemia and multiple myeloma she informed him they proved that by testing factory workers with minor benzene exposure in ohio and in china shes done her homework he thought or someone has have you done extensive toxicological studies in all these deaths almost none of them this stunned him why not several of the bodies were cremated before we became suspicious thats convenient and in the other cases we couldnt get permission to exhume the bodies again why not its complicated chris sensed that he was being played i dont buy that agent morse if the fbi wanted forensic studies theyd get them what about the families of these alleged victims did they suspect foul play is that how you got into this case or was it your sisters accusation that started it all two big touring motorcycles swept around a long curve ahead their lights illuminating the rain the families of several victims suspected foul play from the beginning even though their relatives died of cancer yes most of the husbands were talking about are real bastards big surprise had all of these alleged victims filed for divorce none had none did the husbands file then morse looked over at him again nobody filed then what the hell happened people consulted this lawyer but didnt file exactly we think theres probably a single consultationmaybe two visits at most the lawyer waits for a really wealthy client who stands to lose an enormous amount of money in his divorce or maybe the client stands to lose custody of his kids but when the lawyer senses that he has a truly desperate clienta client with intense hatred for his spousehe makes his pitch thats an interesting scenario can you prove any of it not yet this lawyer is very savvy paranoid in fact chris gazed at her in disbelief you cant even prove that any murders have occurred much less that anyone specific is involved youve got nothing but speculation i have my sisters word doctor spoken on her deathbed after a severe stroke morses face became a mask of defiant determination im not trying to upset you chris said im very sorry for your loss i see that kind of tragedy week in and week out and i know what it does to families she said nothing but you have to admit its a pretty elaborate theory youve developed its hollywood stuff in fact he said recalling fosters words not real life morse did not look angry in fact she looked mildly amused dr shepard in a fortyfouryearold neurologist was arrested at the vanderbilt medical center with a sixinch syringe and a fourinch needle in his pocket the syringe was filled with boric acid and salt water im sure you know that solution would have been lethal if injected into a human heart thats about the only thing a fourinch needles good for chris thought aloud the neurologist was planning to murder a physician whod been his supervisor when he was a resident there when police searched a storage unit he owned they found books on assassination and the production of toxic biological agents they also found a jar containing ricin one of the deadliest poisons in the world the neurologist had planned to soak the pages of a book with a solvent mixture that would promote the absorption of ricin through the skin morse looked over at chris with a raised eyebrow is that elaborate enough for you chris shifted down two gears and pedaled ahead morse quickly rode alongside him again in a woman in san jose california was admitted to the hospital with nausea and blinding headaches they gave her a cat scan and found nothing but a technician had laid the womans earrings down next to a stack of unexposed xray film when they were developed the tech saw an apparent defect on each of the films it was very distinctive he finally figured out that one of the womans earrings had exposed the films the earrings were radioactive one of them was the womans husband was a radiation oncologist the police called in the bureau and we discovered that her cell phone was as hot as a piece of debris from chernobyl turned out her husband had hidden a small pellet of cesium inside the phone of course by that time hed put the pellet back into its leadlined case at his office but the traces were still there did she develop cancer she hasnt yet but she may she absorbed hundreds of times the permissible exposure what happened to the radiation oncologist hes in san quentin now my point is doctors arent immune to homicidal impulses and theyre capable of very elaborate plans to carry them out i could cite dozens of similar cases for you chris waved his right hand save your breath i know some stonecrazy doctors myself despite his casual retort he was sobered by morses revelations there are four and a half thousand doctors in mississippi she said add to that about five thousand dentists then you have veterinarians med techs university researchers nursesa massive suspect pool even if you assume the killer is from mississippi and ive only been onto this theory for seven days as morse spoke chris realized that the apparent enormity of the task was illusory it only existed because of a lack of baseline information youve got to find the cause of death in these peopleor rather the cause of the cause the etiology of these blood cancers if it is radiation you could start narrowing your suspect pool pretty quickly her voice took on an excited edge an expert i talked to says radiation is the surest and simplest method but you dont have forensic evidence no radiation burns or strange symptoms noted long before the cancer was diagnosed no again because local law enforcement authorities dont believe these deaths were murder theres a problem of access to the bodies what about the medical records of the alleged victims i managed to get the records of two victims from angry family members but experts have been over both of them in microscopic detail and they havent turned up anything suspicious chris blinked against stinging sweat that the rain had washed into his eyes but im told that radiation could explain the variation in the cancers morse went on you expose somebody to radiation theres no way to predict how their cells will react chris nodded but something about this idea bothered him your expert is right but then why are blood cancers the only result why no solid tumors why no melanomas and why only superaggressive blood cancers you couldnt predict something like that with radiation maybe you could morse suggested if you were a radiation oncologist maybe chris conceded if you managed to expose the bone marrow primarily you might get more blood cancers than other types but if thats true you just shrank your suspect pool by about ten thousand people morse smiled believe me every radiation oncologist in mississippi is under investigation at this moment how many are there nineteen but its not a simple matter of alibis i cant ask some doctor where he was on a given day at a given time because we have no way to know when the victims were dosed you see yeah dragnet methods are out the window but its not just a doctor youre looking for right its the lawyer too if youre right he functions almost like the killers agent exactly only he handles an assassin instead of a quarterback or a singer chris laughed softly how would a relationship like that get started you cant go scouting for promising young assassins theres no national draft does your greedy lawyer put an ad on the internet to recruit someone who can kill people without a trace does he hire a medical headhunter i know it sounds ridiculous when you put it like that but were talking about a lot of money here how much millions in every case so the lawyer has a pretty big carrot to hold out in front of someone who probably makes a hundred grand or less at his legitimate job to break the monotony of the ride chris gently steered left and right morse gave him room to ride his serpentine course lawyers get to know a lot of professional criminals in the course of their work she pointed out and necessity is the mother of invention right i think this guy simply saw a demand for a service and then found a way to provide it chris pedaled out in front of her so that a large truck could pass illegally since big trucks werent allowed on the trace a lot of what you say makes sense he called over the sound of the receding truck but i still say your theory doesnt add up why not morse asked pulling alongside again the time factor if i want to kill someone its because i really hate them or because i stand to gain a hell of a lot if they die or maybe i stand to lose millions of dollars if my wife goes on living like you said yesterday what if she wants to take my children away forever im not going to wait months or years for her to croak i want immediate action even if thats the case said morse the most likely result of any conventional murderespecially in a divorce situationis the killer going to jail and if youre not going to try the murder yourself who do you hire youre a multimillionaire you dont have a gangsta posse to turn to imagine how someone that desperate might react to a slick lawyer offering him a riskfree road out of his problems a perfect murder is worth waiting for she has a point chris thought i can see that but no matter how you slice it theres an element of urgency in a divorce situation people go crazy theyll do anything to get out of their marriage theres a frantic desire to move on to marry their lover whatever youre right of course morse agreed but youve already waited years for your freedom maybe decades any divorce lawyer can tell you that obtaining a divorcethe whole process from beginning to endcan take a very long time if the divorce is contested were talking nightmare delays even filing under irreconcilable differences spouses often argue back and forth for a year or more people are hurting they stonewall negotiations break down you can wind up in court even if its the last thing you wanted years can go by morse was suddenly puffing hard if your lawyer told you that in the same amount of time that your divorce would take he could save you millions of dollars guarantee you full custody of your children and prevent them from hating youyoud have to at least consider what he had to say wouldnt you they were crossing the high bridge over coles creek chris braked to a stop climbed off and leaned the trek against the concrete rail youve got me he said if you remove urgency from the equation then a delayedaction weapon becomes viable you could use something like cancer as a weapon if its technically possible thank you alex said softly she leaned her bike against the concrete and gazed at the brown water drifting lazily over the sand fifty feet below chris watched a burst of tiny drops pepper the surface of the water then vanish the rain was slacking off didnt you tell me that some of the victims were men yes in two cases the surviving spouses were female so theres a precedent for women murdering the husbands in this thing morse took a deep breath then looked up at him and said thats why im here with you doctor chris tried to imagine thora secretly driving up to jackson for a clandestine meeting with a divorce lawyer he simply couldnt do it i buy your logic okay but in my case its irrelevant and for lots of reasons the main one is that if thora asked me for a divorce id give her one simple as that and i think she knows that morse shrugged i dont know the lady youre right you dont the concrete rail was not even waist high to chris he sometimes urinated off it during his rides he suppressed the urge to do so now its beautiful down there morse said gazing down the winding course of the creek its looks like virgin wilderness its as close as youll find it hasnt been logged since the s and its federal land i spent a lot of time walking that creek as a boy i found dozens of arrowheads and spear points in it the natchez indians hunted along that creek for a thousand years before the french came she smiled youre lucky to have had a childhood like that chris knew she was right we only lived in natchez for a few yearsip moved my dad around a lot between mills you knowbut dad showed me a lot of things out in these woods after heavy rains wed each take one bank of the creek and work our way along it after one mudslide i found three huge bones they turned out to be from a woolly mammoth fifteen thousand years old wow i had no idea that kind of stuff was around here chris nodded were walking in footsteps everywhere we go the footsteps of the dead he looked up at the sound of an approaching engine it was a park rangers cruiser he lifted his hand recalling a female ranger whod patrolled this stretch of the trace for a couple of years after she moved on hed seen her face on the back of a bestselling mystery novel set on the trace the place seemed to touch everyone who spent time here what are you thinking doctor he was thinking about darryl foster and what foster had told him about alexandra morse chris didnt want to bluntly challenge her but he did want to know how honest she was being with him from the moment we met he said looking into her green eyes youve been digging into my personal life i want to dig into yours for a minute he could almost see the walls going up but at length she nodded assent what choice did she have your scars he said i can tell theyre recent i want to know how you got them she turned away and stared down at the rippling sand beneath the surface of the water when she finally spoke it was in a voice that had surrendered something gone was the professional authority yet in its place was a raw sincerity that told him he was hearing something very like the truth there was a man she said a man i worked with at the bureau his name was james broadbent people called him jim but he preferred james they often assigned him to protect me at hostage scenes hehe was in love with me i really cared for him too but he was married two kids we were never intimate but even if we had been he would never have left his family never you understand chris nodded she looked back down at the water i was a good hostage negotiator doctor some said the best ever in five years i never lost a hostage thats rare but last december morse faltered then found the thread again my father was killed trying to stop a robbery two months later my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer very advanced and you know what that means im sorry morse shrugged i sort of lost it after that only i didnt know it see my dad had raised me to be tough so thats what i tried to be never quit thats the morse motto from winston churchill to my father and right down to me chris nodded with as much empathy as he could im getting to the scars i promise she said nine weeks ago i was called to a hostage scene at a bank not a normal bank a federal reserve bank in dc sixteen hostages inside most of them employees a lot of suits at the bureau had the idea this was a terrorist attack others thought it was about money it could have been botha sophisticated robbery raising capital for terrorist operations but my gut told me it was something else the leader spoke with an arabic accent but it didnt sound real to me he was angry maybe schizophrenic he had a lot of rage toward the government i could tell hed experienced loss in the recent past like a lot of people who try something extreme morse gave chris a tight smile like me youre thinking anyway an associate deputy director named dodson had overall command and he didnt give me enough time to do my job i had a real chance to talk the leader down without anyone firing a shot all my experience and instinct told me that and there were sixteen lives at stake you know but there was a lot of pressure from above this being washington in its post mindset so dodson jerked me out of there and ordered in the hrt chris saw that she was reliving the memory as she recounted the events shed probably been over it a million times in the privacy of her head but how many times had she spoken of it to someone else there was no way to resolve the situation with snipers it had to be an explosive entry which meant extreme risk to the hostages i couldnt accept that so i marched right back through the cordon and into the bank my people were screaming at me but i barely heard them some hrt guys didnt get the word in time and they blew the doors and windows just as i reached the lobby flashbangcrash grenades the works morse touched her scarred cheek as though feeling the injury for the first time one of the robbers shot me from behind a plateglass partition i caught shards mostly but what i didnt know was that james had followed me into the bank when i was hit he looked down at me instead of up for the shooter which was what he should have done his feelings for me were stronger than his training and they train us hard you know morse wiped her face as though to brush away cobwebs but chris saw the glint of tears hey he said reaching out and squeezing her arm its okay she shook her head with surprising violence no its not maybe someday it will be but right now its not i know one thing chris said in the shape youre in you dont need to be working a murder case you need a medical leave morse laughed strangely im on medical leave now as he looked down at her everything suddenly came clear her deep fatigue her obsessiveness the thousandyard stare of a shellshocked soldieryoure on your own arent you she shook her head again but her chin was quivering you say i a lot more than you say we morse bit her bottom lip then squinted as though against bright sunlight is that how it is he asked gently are you alone when she looked up at him her eyes were wet with more than rain pretty much the truth is almost everything ive done beginning five weeks ago was unauthorized theyd fire me if they knew chris whistled long and low jesus christ she took him by the wrists and spoke with fierce conviction youre my last shot dr shepard my noshit last shot last shot at what stopping these people proving what theyve done look he said awkwardly if everything youve told me is true why isnt the fbi involved frustration hardened her face a dozen reasons none of them good murders a state crime not a federal one unless its a rico case a lot of what i have is inference and supposition not objective evidence but how the hell am i supposed to get evidence without any resources the fbi is the most hidebound bureaucracy you can imagine everything is done by the bookunless it involves counterterrorism of course in which case they throw the book right out the window but nobodys going to nail the guys im after by using the marquess of queensberry rules chris didnt know what to say yesterday morning his life had been ticking along as usual now he was standing on a bridge in the rain watching a woman he barely knew fall apart if youre acting alone who saw thora go into the lawyers office a private detective he used to work for my father jesus what does the fbi think youre doing right now they think im in charlotte working a prostitution case involving illegal aliens when they transferred me there after i was shot i got lucky i found an old classmate from the academy there hes done a lot to cover for me but it cant go on much longer holy shit i know im not making perfect sense about everything i havent slept more than three hours a night in five weeks it took me two weeks just to find the connection between my brotherinlaw and the divorce lawyer then another week to come up with the names of all his business partners i only came up with my list of victims a week ago there could be a dozen more for all i know but then your wife walked into rusks office and that brought me to natchez ive been splitting my time between here and jackson where my mother is dying and whos rusk chris cut in the divorce lawyer yes andrew rusk jr his fathers a big plaintiffs attorney in jackson more tears joined the raindrops on her cheeks fuck its a mess i need your help doctor i need your medical knowledge but most of all i need you because youre the next victim morses eyes locked onto his with eerie intensity do you get that chris closed his eyes nothing youve said today even remotely proves that her frustration finally boiled over listen to me i know you dont like hearing it but your wife drove two hours to jackson to meet with andrew rusk and she lied to you by not telling you about it what do you think that adds up to not murder chris said stubbornly i dont believe that i cant morse touched his arm thats because youre a doctor not a lawyer every district attorney in this country has a list of people who come in on a weekly basis to plead with them to open a murder case on their loved one the deaths are recorded as accidents suicides fires a hundred things but the parents or the children or the wives of the victimsthey know the truth it was murder so they work their way through the system begging for someone to take notice to at least classify what happened as a crime they hire detectives and spend their life savings trying to find the truth to find justice but they almost never do eventually they turn into something like ghosts some of them stay ghosts for the rest of their lives morse looked at chris with the furious eyes of a hardened combat soldier im no ghost doctor i will not stand by and let my sister be erased for someones conveniencefor his profit her voice took on a dangerous edge as god is my witness i will not do that out of respect chris waited a few moments to respond i support what youre doing okay i even admire you for it but the difference is you have personal stake in this i dont her eyes narrowed yes you do you just havent accepted it yet please dont start again doctor i would do anything to get you to help me do you understand id go over there in the bushes and pull my shorts down for you if thats what it would take her eyes gleamed with cold fire but i dont have to do that chris didnt like the look that had come into her face why not because your wife is cheating on you he tried to keep the shock out of his face but nothing could slow his pounding heart thoras screwing a surgeon right here in town morse went on his name is shane lansing bullshit chris said in a hoarse whisper morses eyes didnt waver do you have proof circumstantial evidence circumstantial i dont want to hear it denial is always the first response shut up goddamn it morses face softened i know how it hurts okay i was engaged once until i found out my fiancé was doing my best friend but pride is your enemy now chris you have to see things straight i should see things straight youre the one spinning out byzantine theories of mass murder cancer as a weapon a newlywed planning to murder her husbandno wonder youre out on your own morses level gaze was unrelenting if im crazy then tell me one thing why didnt you call the fbi to report me yesterday he stared down at the concrete rail why chris he felt the words come to him as if of their own accord thoras leaving town this week she told me last night morses mouth dropped open wheres she going up to the delta a spa up in greenwood a famous hotel the alluvian he nodded i know it whens she leaving maybe tomorrow this week for sure returning when three nights then home morse made a fist and brought it to her mouth this is it chris my godtheyre moving fast you have to deal with this now youre in extreme danger right now he took her by the shoulders and shook her do you hear yourself everything you told me is circumstantial there wasnt one fact in the whole goddamn pile i know it seems that way i know you dont want to believe any of it butlook do you want to know everything i know he stared at her for a long time i dont think so he looked at his watch im really late i need to get back to my truck i cant wait for you now he climbed onto his bike and started to leave but morse grabbed his elbow with surprising strength with her other hand she removed something from her shorts a cell phone take this she said my cell number is programmed into it you can speak frankly on it its the only safe link well have he pushed the phone away i dont want it dont be a sap chris please he looked at the phone like a tribesman suspicious of some miraculous technology how would i explain it to thora thoras leaving town you can hide it for a day or two cant you he angrily expelled air from his cheeks but he took the phone morses eyes fairly shone with urgency you have to drop the niceguy routine chris youre in mortal fucking peril a strange laugh escaped his mouth im sorry i just dont believe that time will take care of that one way or another he wanted to race away but again his southern upbringing stopped him will you be okay out here morse turned and lifted the tail of her shirt revealing the molded butt of a semiautomatic pistol it looked huge against her tiny waist as he stared she climbed onto her bike and gripped her handlebars call me soon we dont have much time to prepare what if i call the fbi instead she shrugged as though genuinely unconcerned then my career is over but i wont stop and ill still try to save you chris slipped his feet into his pedal clips and rode quickly away chapter andrew rusk gunned his porsche cayenne shot across two lanes of traffic then checked his rearview mirror for the past week hed had the feeling that someone was following him not only on the road either he usually ate lunch in the finer local restaurants and on more than one occasion hed had the sense that someone was watching him turning away just before he looked around to catch them but he felt it most on the highway yet if someone was tailing him they were good probably using multiple vehicleswhich was a bad sign multiple vehicles meant official interest and he didnt want to have to say anything to glykon about official interest and he hadnt had to so long as he remained unsure today was different today a dark blue crown victoria had been pacing him ever since he climbed onto i he had made several extreme changes in speed and the crown vic had stayed with him when rusk pretended to exit the freeway then shot back onto the interstate at the last second his pursuer had finally betrayed himself the good news was that a law enforcement entity using multiple vehicles would be extremely unlikely to make a bushleague mistake like that the bad news was that rusk had a meeting to make and no time to waste losing a tail as he drove southward a possible solution came to him exiting onto meadowbrook drive he drove under the interstate and headed east the crown vic stayed ten car lengths behind soon he was rolling through old eastover one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in the capital city rusk wondered if the ford might be a government car the fbi sometimes used crown vics underpowered american crap he kept to the main street which was slowly but steadily dropping in elevation he wondered whether his tail knew that this gradual drop was caused by their increasing proximity to the pearl river a few years ago the area ahead of them had been a flood plain unsuitable for building it was still a flood plain but in the interim money had spoken and now the lowlying land was a spanking new housing development a few years back rusk had done some kayaking on the pearl with a friend who was getting in shape for a float trip in canada at that time the woods near the edge of the river had been honeycombed with dirt roads most of them kept open by crazy kids on fourwheelers if rusk was right some of those rutted roads would still be there in spite of the new houses he turned right and parked the cayenne in front of a large ranch house would the crown vic pull up behind him or would it try to preserve some illusion of unconcern he watched the dark blue silhouette slow as it passed the opening to the street then drive on rusk shot forward following the residential street through its long ushape and back to the main road of the subdivision when he emerged the road in front of him was empty he checked his rearview mirror the crown vic was idling about a hundred yards behind him rusk floored the accelerator and the turbo roared pressing him into the seat like an astronaut in the boost phase of a launch in seconds he was hurtling toward a wall of trees and chesthigh weeds as the deadend barrier expanded to nightmare proportions rusk spied a dirt road to the left of it the opening was scarcely wide enough to accommodate the porsche but he didnt hesitate with a rush of adrenaline he wrenched his wheel left gunned the turbo and blew right through the opening in the trees praying that he wouldnt meet some kid on a fourwheeler and crush him like a bug on his grille the cayenne jounced up and down like a dune buggy in baja but rusk kept his foot jammed nearly to the floor the ass of the cayenne flew into the air and its nose slammed down into a deep hole spraying water in all directions before all momentum died rusk jiggered the steering wheel and applied power letting the fourwheel drive do its work after a few tense moments the rear tires found traction and he scrambled up out of the hole his front wheels spinning with a high whine rusk howled with delight when his front wheels grabbed the sandy ground and hurled him down the rutted track his engine growling like an angry grizzly bear no cheapass crown victoria could follow him through that hole the only remaining trick was to find his way back to a paved road before his pursuer figured out where he might emerge he kept bearing toward the riveror where he thought the river waskeeping his eyes open for a wider track his instinct didnt fail him in less than a minute he saw the broad brown stream of the pearl cutting through a wide ravine thirty yards below he whipped the wheel to the right and started following the rivers course where was the crown vic was its driver a jackson native would he guess that rusk was trying to work his way south and back onto paved roads the mystery man in the crown vic could easily call for backup another car or maybe even a chopper a chopper would be tough to evade unless rusk abandoned the cayenne and went to ground in the woods but what would that accomplish they already knew who he was hed long had an escape plan in placeone that would put him out of reach of all american authoritiesbut it would be tough to implement if they were already sending choppers after him theyre not he told himself its not even a they as far as i know its one guy yeah but who he said aloud that fucking girl rusk gritted his teeth against the juddering of the porsche all he could do was play the hand he was dealt a beautiful wooden canoe rounded the river bend ahead of him piloted by two collegeage girls with bright red backpacks stowed between them rusk wondered if theyd started out on the strong river then entered the pearl not far away hed floated that trip back in high school with some fellow boy scouts as rusk watched the girls that memory brought strange baggage with it he was a long way from the boy scouts nowgood old pack and their mottoholy christ there was a reason people called babes in the woods boy scouts rusk mashed his brake pedal just beyond a cluster of thick bamboo stalks on his right a dark tunnel opened in the trees deep wheel ruts led into it and at the opening lay a pile of halfburned logs and about a hundred empty beer cans rusk nodded with satisfaction that road led back to civilization he gave the porsche some gas ramped over a sand berm and raced toward the tunnel ten seconds later the shadows swallowed him he was still laughing when he bounced onto clean asphalt and drove unmolested toward the i overpass towering in the distance chapter the sun was fully up now and chris was pushing his pickup well over the speed limit the rain had finally petered out but his left front wheel threw up a wall of glistening spray as he swung onto the bypass that would take him to highway south alex morses final revelation had left him hollow inside he couldnt really think about it yet but at least hed solved the mystery that darryl foster had been unable to explain special agent morse was a rogue agent conducting a murder investigation that the fbi knew nothing about and not just an investigation but a quest a singleminded mission to punish those she believed had murdered her sister she had been on that mission for five weeks yet all she had produced were some fascinating theories and circumstantial evidence and yet he thought with something like shame when she finally offered to reveal real evidence i cut her off as he passed the super walmart he picked up the cell phone morse had given him and dialed the only number in the simm memory its alex morse answered are you okay i know i hit you pretty hard back there about thora what evidence do you have tying my wife to shane lansing morse took an audible breath twice this week dr lansing has stopped at your new house while thora was there chris felt a wave of relief so what shane lives in that neighborhood the first time he stayed inside for twentyeight minutes and the second fiftytwo minutes fiftytwo minutes long enough tothora was probably showing off the place to him she designed the house herself and there were workmen there right morses reply was a blunt as a hammer no workmen neither time neither time im sorry chris he grimaced that could still be innocent contact you know is that how you think of shane lansing a choirboy chris didnt think of lansing in those terms at all no matter who i ask about him morse said i hear three things hes a gifted surgeon hes an arrogant asshole who treats nurses like shit and hes a pussy hound chris flinched i also hear he likes them pretty morse added thora definitely meets that requirement is that everything no ive talked to a few nurses in the last five days and they say thora had an affair with a married doctor when she first got to town seven years ago that was before you knew her right the guy was an er doctor did she ever tell you about that who was the guy supposed to be his name was dennis stephens a faint memory of a young bearded face went through chriss mind never heard of him apparently the affair started getting out of hand so stephens took a job in another state the hospital is always buzzing with gossip like that morse said nothing thora would have been single at that time anyway theres also a story about her and an ophthalmic surgeon who was here for a while this would have been just before she married red simmons a lot of nurses hate my wife agent morse they think shes arrogant is she thats hard to answer thoras smarter than half the doctors here in terms of raw intelligence you can imagine the effect that has on them most of them are men i can relate to that the cellular connection crackled with static im your friend chris even though you dont know me friends tell the truth even when its tough are you my friend or is it just that you need me give me a chance to show you then make up your own mind ill bet she was a good hostage negotiator he thought as he hit end shes manipulating me already chapter four hours after bicycling the last mile to her car alex morse sat on a bench in the shadow of a catholic cathedral in downtown natchez and watched thora shepard walk out of the mainstream fitness center her blond hair flying from beneath a blue silk scarf she turned right and started walking west on main street a quarter mile in this direction would carry her to the twohundredfoot bluff that overlooked the mississippi river thora often ran along the edge of that bluff which stretched for miles with only chainlink fencing or a few scrub bushes separating her from eternity alex had jogged along behind her once amazed by the vastness of the mississippi river the muddy flood was a full mile across at natchez and beyond it the louisiana delta stretched flat beyond the limits of human vision but thora would not be jogging today she was wearing mosquito sunglasses and a tailored pantsuit that cost more than alex earned in a month as thora strode gracefully down the street she looked fit for a magazine cover shoot alex could see the doubletakes as thora passed people on the sidewalk the thing was it wasnt only men who staredwomen stared too she was that kind of woman and maybe that was the root of alexs antipathy alex had never been able to like blondes she didnt want to stereotype anyone but in the case of blondes it was hard not to they had a certain way of walking of talking of flipping their goddamn hair that just plain got to her that helpless lilt in their voicesthe pathetic littlegirl soundeven the smallest trace of it made alex want to hit somebody and that was leaving out the whole dumb issue she knew that blondes werent all dumb by genetic command but on the other hand she hadnt known manyif anywho were rigorously intellectual and that was the core of her problem with them most blondes had simply never had to work hard to get what they wanted in life therefore they had developed few skillsbeyond flirting and inserting knives between female shoulder bladesthat would prove useful in any practical situation of course hardly any blondes nowadays were true blondes she had to give thora that few human beingseven those who were blond as childrenmade it far through adulthood without their hair darkening naturally but thora had danish blood and her viking blond hair was almost the same shade of straw as that of her father who at fiftyeight still had a shockingly full head of hair for this reason thora shepardunlike the frosted streaked bottled frizzed teased and darkrooted blondes alex saw and despised every dayradiated a kind of predatory confidence an avian watchfulness that signaled you would not get far trying to pull something over on her it also made men and women turn and stare after her as she walked by them on the street and finally it had made a smart and fairly goodlooking young doctor named chris shepard propose marriage to hernot to mention legally adopt a fatherless baby born nine years before not bad for a woman with her past alex hurried across main street and began walking behind thora who was a block ahead now she felt a pang of irritation as a young man wearing a business suit turned degrees to watch thora walk away from him then an older man stopped thora and engaged her in conversation thora spoke animatedly using her hands often to make her point alex turned and looked into a shop window she had instinctively disliked thora from the beginning but she wasnt sure why no one could argue that thora had had an easy childhood she had begun life with a silver spoon in her mouth but that spoon had quickly been snatched away the daughter of a renowned vanderbilt surgeon thora rayner had spent the first eight years of her life in the elite social world of nashville tennessee a tony school the right country club the riding academy the works but when thora was eight her mothers alcoholism had reached a crisis point after several attempts at drying out anna rayner slipped into an alcoholic daze that showed no sign of abating with the help of some friends lars rayner committed his wife to a state hospital then filed divorce papers six months later he was free of her but the price of keeping his fortune had been his daughter signing away his rights to thora had little effect on dr rayner but this act profoundly altered the little girls future thoras life became an odyssey from one small east tennessee town to another she attended public schools private academies being far out of economic reach as her courtmandated childsupport payments were squandered on alcohol her mothers drinking waxed and waned by no particular rule but on several occasions thora had to be taken in by her paternal grandmother her high school grades were middling to poor until her junior year when she apparently decided to show her father what she could do when she put her mind to it when thora blew the top out of both the act and sat lars rayner finally took notice he offered to pull strings to get thora into vanderbilt and also to foot the bills thora refused instead she applied on her own and won an academic scholarship to her fathers alma mater sadly her luck did not last long her maternal genes and conditioning were against her after a perfect first semester her grades steadily worsened until the second half of her sophomore year which she did not complete when she took a job as a waitress in a dive in the printers alley district the reason soon became apparent thora was pregnant the boyfriend vanished but thora chose to have the baby in spite of this with financial and babysitting help from her grandmother she entered nursing school and after two years graduated with honors she began work at the va hospital in murfreesboro tennessee but quit after only nine months suddenly and inexplicably relocating to natchez mississippi alex suspected that a messy affair lay behind this move but she had no proof though she did have a detective working to find it thora had been hired by st catherines hospital and it was there that shed met red simmons the oilman who would become her first husband and soon after make her a widow a very rich widow alex glanced to her left thora spoke for another twenty seconds then hugged the older man and continued down main street alex took a small camera from her purse and shot a picture of the man as he passed he looked sixty probably too old to be a paramour alex had long prided herself on her physical conditioning but simply following thora through her daily routine was exhausting up at dawn for a morning runfour miles minimum and sometimes tenthen a quick shower at home followed by a trip to the shepards building site in avalon thora would argue with the contractors for a half hour or so then drive her mercedes convertible to the country club for a swim or a couple of sets of tennis alex usually watched from the parking lot afterward she alternated touchups on her hair and nails with serious weight work at mainstream fitness another shower and then lunch with at least one girlfriend she favored thai food from an excellent restaurant not far from mainstream and that was probably her present destination after her meal very little nourishment alex had noted from a nearby table thora often made a second trip to the building site the only absolutely required stop of her day was st stephens prep to pick up ben while most mothers waited in line for up to twenty minutesin case their children came charging out of school right after the bellthora always showed up twenty minutes late that way she avoided the boring wait and usually found ben shooting baskets alone on the playground after taking him home to the maid she would spend the remainder of the afternoon running errands or shopping then stop by the avalon site one final time before going home to the elgin house it was during these endoftheday stops that dr shane lansing had twice stopped by for an informal visit alex had never entered the house while lansing was inside but if the surgeon showed up again she planned to try after her two meetings with dr shepard whom she hadnt expected to be so staunch in defense of his wifes morals she regretted not bringing will kilmer to natchez with her her fathers old partner routinely worked marital cases and he owned equipment that could listen in on and decode digital cell calls in real time but will was already going beyond the call of duty in his surveillance of andrew rusk and alex couldnt afford to pay one of his operatives to come to natchez she was working on hacking into thoras email account though thora carried a treo everywhere she went and frequently logged on to the internet with the device alex felt sure that if she could obtain a single email proving that thora and lansing were lovers dr shepard would realize the danger he was in and get on board with her plan thora stopped again this time to speak to a man about her age as alex cautiously moved closer trying to catch the conversation her private cell phone rang when she moved away and answered she heard the gravelly voice of will kilmer hey uncle will she whispered though the honorific was purely one of affection got some news for you said the old man good or bad bad in the short run a little while ago andrew rusk made one of my guys and turned rabbit oh shit how did he lose one of your guys bastard took that fourwheeldrive porsche down to the pearl river and drove slap into the mud my guy was in a crown victoriasupercharged but that dont do you much good in the mud and i dont think rusk was doing it for fun i think he was headed somewhere important otherwise why go to the trouble damn it i told you we needed more cars but you said i know what i said alex snapped furious that she lacked the money to pay for the kind of surveillance this case required pennywise poundfoolish her father whispered from the grave now all the surveillance shed paid for up to now was wasted rusk was gone and she could do nothing about it until he chose to show up again thirty yards away thora shepard shook hands with the man she was talking to then crossed commerce street and turned right alex followed im sorry will this is completely my fault i hamstrung you labored breathing came down the line kilmer was seventy and he had more than a touch of emphysema what you want me to do now hon put someone out at rusks house if you can he has to come home eventually right sure hell be home tonight for sure unless we really spooked him will said nothing you think a guy like that would blow town because of this no i dont rusk is dug in hes got a highdollar job a wife a big house kids his kids dont live with him alex pointed out take it easy rusk is a rich lawyer not a cia field agent hell be home she forced herself to calm down thora had almost reached the thai restaurant ill send somebody out there will said and if i dont have anybody free ill go myself you dont have to do alex froze in midsentence thora had stopped dead on the sidewalk to answer a cell call now she was backing against the wall of a building with the phone held close to her ear god i wish you were here alex breathed whats the matter nothing ive got to go call me as she hit end thora leaned out from the wall and looked obliquely through the window of the thai restaurant apparently satisfied she nodded then put the phone back into her pocket and reversed direction moving quickly back toward main street straight toward alex alex darted into the nearest shop an everythingbutthekitchensink place filled from wall to wall with antique furniture framed mirrors prints woven baskets and trays of pecan pralines for sale when thora passed the shop her features were set in an expression of severe concentration alex counted to fifteen then walked out of the shop and followed thora toward her mercedes something was about to happen chapter andrew rusk checked the porsches odometer once more then started searching the trees for the turn hed left i forty minutes ago and after twenty miles hed turned onto a narrow gravel road somewhere along this road was the turn for the chickamauga hunting camp rusk had been a member of the elite camp for fifteen years buying his way in after his fatherinlaw opted out and the membership had proved useful in many ways beyond providing recreation in the fall rusk saw the turn at last marked by a sign over the entrance road he swung his wheel and stopped before the steel gate blocking his way then punched a combination into the keypad on the post beside his vehicle when the gate swung back he drove slowly through he still had a half mile of gravel to cover and he did this slowly despite the vast wealth of the clubs members this road was poorly maintained he wondered if they left it that way to preserve the illusion of primitive conditions because illusion was all it was though the camp buildings appeared to be log cabins they contained hotelstyle rooms with private baths central air and heat and satellite tv in the common room for serious hunters the expense was justified there were more whitetail deer per acre in this area than in any other part of the united states and they were big the largest trophy buck ever taken had been shot in mississippi whitetail loved the deep underbrush of secondgrowth woods and the virgin forests around this part of the state had been logged out almost years ago this was deer heaven and hunters from around the country paid premium prices for hunting leases here the prices were even higher to the southwest right around natchez that was deer heaven as rusk drove up to the main cabin and parked he scanned the clearing for eldon tarver he saw no one climbing out of the cayenne he checked the main cabins door but found it locked that made sense because eldon tarver was not a member of the club and thus had no key but tarver did have the combination to the front gate courtesy of andrew rusk that was the arrangement they had made long ago in case of emergency they chose chickamauga because they had planned their first joint venture here their acquaintance predated that meeting by two years but there had been almost no physical contact in the interim any further meetings had been kept to less than two minutes and at a place so public that no one would even call their contact a meeting despite the emptiness of the clearing rusk was certain that dr tarver was already here he would have hidden his vehicle in case any other members happened to be herean unlikely event out of season but you never knew the question was where would tarver wait for him rusk closed his eyes and listened to the sounds of the forest he heard the wind first the rustling dance of a billion spring leaves then the birds sparrows jays martins a lone bobwhite the erratic poppoppop of a woodpecker beneath all this the low hum of distant trucks on highway but nothing in the varied symphony gave him a clue to the presence of another human then he smelled fire somewhere out to his left wood was burning he set off in that direction moving with long surefooted strides through the trees the farther he walked upwind the more intense grew the smell of smoke and meat someone was cooking out here that made him doubt it was tarver but he had to make sure a moment later he found himself in a small clearing at the center of which sat eldon tarver the big pathologist was tending a castiron skillet over a small fire and the sound of sizzling meat filled the clearing hanging on a wire beside dr tarver was a dead fawn freshly skinned but only partly butchered take a seat tarver said in his deep baritone im cooking the tenderloin its sinfully good andrew by killing the fawn the pathologist had broken a sacred rule of the camp by killing it out of season he had broken several state and federal laws but rusk wasnt going to say anything about that he had bigger problems to deal with and whatever rules and laws dr tarver had broken he had done so with full knowledge and intent tarver speared a shaving of tenderloin with a pocketknife and held it out in the air rusk took the knife and ate the meat as a sign of their bond its good he said damn good as fresh as it comes this side of raw have you ever eaten it raw a bemused look crossed the pathologists face oh my yes when i was a boybut thats another story id like to hear that story sometime rusk thought when i have more time id like to know what could turn a boy into a character like this he knew a little of dr tarvers history but not enough to explain the mans odd behavior and interests but today was not the day to tease out that kind of thing we have a problem rusk said bluntly im here am i not two problems really dont rush things tarver said sit down have some more venison rusk pretended to look down at the fire he saw no rifle near dr tarver not even a handgun there was a nike duffel bag near his feet which might contain a pistol or even a submachine gun hed have to keep an eye on that im not really hungry he said youd prefer to move straight to business rusk nodded then we should get the formalities out of the way first formalities take off your clothes andrew adrenaline blasted through rusks vascular system would he tell me to strip if he wanted to kill me to save himself the trouble of stripping my corpse no what would be the point out here do you think im wearing a wire doctor tarver smiled disarmingly you said we have an emergency stress makes people do things they might not ordinarily do are you going to strip i dont have to you called this meeting that made sense and if rusk knew tarver nothing substantive was going to be said unless he complied with the doctors order thanking god he had left his own pistol in the porsche he bent and untied his cole haans then unsnapped his pants and stepped out of them next he removed his ralph lauren buttondown which left only his shorts and socks tarver seemed to be watching the campfire not him is this far enough rusk asked everything please tarver said in a disinterested voice rusk swallowed a curse and pulled off his shorts he felt an odd and surprising shyness at this point and it disturbed him he had stripped in front of men hundreds of times at the health club and hed spent his whole youth doing the same in locker rooms around the state he certainly had nothing to be ashamed of not by the standard measure and several women had commented that he was wellhung but this was different this was stripping naked in front of a guy with god only knew what sexual perversions and a pathologist to boota man who had coldly stared at a thousand corpses sizing up every anatomical flaw it was creepy and dr tarver wasnt making it any easier he was now staring at rusks body like an entomologist studying an insect mating youve been working on those latissimi dorsi tarver observed it was true lisa had commented that age was taking a toll on his back so rusk had been putting in extra time on the nautilus at the club to remedy the alleged deficiency but how the hell tarver knew that from a single glance you should spend more time on your legs the pathologist added weight lifters are obsessed with their upper bodies but underdeveloped legs ruin the whole effect symmetry is the thing andrew balance ill remember that the lawyer said with a trace of bitterness rusk knew he had skinny legs but they had been good enough in college besides he had more to worry about every day than working out and who the hell was tarver to talk the guy was big sure but what kind of tone did he have rusk suspected that underneath the unseasonable flannel shirt was a jellied wall of beer fat get dressed dr tarver said you look like a turtle without its shell rusk pulled on his shorts and pants then sat down to put on his shoes the last time we were here he said you told me you hated the woods the doctor chuckled softly sometimes i do what does that mean you know so little about me andrew even if i told youmy experience is wholly outside your frame of reference rusk tried to read this as arrogance but it hadnt been intended that way tarver seemed to be saying youre from a different tribe than i amperhaps even a different species and this was true however dr tarver felt about the woods he was certainly no stranger to them on that last tripfive years ago nowhe had come to chickamauga as the guest of an orthopedic surgeon from jackson for two days he had killed nothing to the increasing amusement of the other members who were killing record numbers of deer that year albeit mostly does and on the smallish side but all anyone talked about that weekend was the ghost a wise and scarred old twelvepoint buck whod managed to evade the best hunters in the camp for almost ten years after two seasons of invisibility the ghost had been sighted the previous week and everyone was gunning for him man and boy alike each night tarver had listened in silence as the members told ghost stories by firelightsome true others apocryphaland each morning hed vanished into the woods before dawn on the third daya sunday rusk recalledeldon tarver had marched back into camp carrying the pound carcass of the ghost across his shoulders he upset quite a few club members by killing their nearmythical beast but what could they say tarver hadnt shot the ghost from a tree stand the way most of them hunted now waiting in relative comfort for a deer to walk right under thema tactic that regularly allowed eightyearolds to bag a deer their first time out dr tarver had gone out and stalked the ghost in the old way the indian way he stalked the big buck for three days across the length and breadth of the camp a damned tough slog through thick underbrush and rainyautumn mud tarver had never revealed more than that he seemed to cling to the ancient superstition that telling a thing lessened its power but eventually the members had pieced together a legend those hunting from tree stands reported hearing odd sounds just after dawn on the day of the killmating calls fighting gruntssounds that could only have been mimicked by a master hunter then had come a single rifle blast a perfect spine shot that would have dropped the ghost right where he stood it was as close to a painless death as the big buck could ever have hoped forno running miles through the brush with half his heart blown out or his stomach filling up with bloodjust instant paralysis and death late that afternoon rusk had found himself gutting his own trophy buck outside as though sent by fate eldon tarver had walked up and offered to show him some timesaving tricks for dressing a deer after rusk gave over his skinning knife he witnessed a demonstration of manual dexterity and anatomical knowledge that left him in wordless awe hed barely followed tarvers words so fascinated was he by the mans deft knifework and that part of his brain not wholly occupied with the bloody spectacle before his eyes was turning over an idea that had been born some years ago in the dark recesses of his soul an idea born from need but unrealized due to moral scruple and a lack of opportunity but the more years he practiced law the more those scruples had eroded and morality rusk had known even then was not a component of eldon tarvers personality two problems tarver said taking a slice of tenderloin from the skillet and dropping it into his mouth thats what you said yes and they might be related tarver chewed slowly like a man accustomed to making his supplies last as long as possible does anyone know who i am andrew no does anyone know that you and i are connected in any way no does anyone know what you are doing no does anyone suspect it rusk licked his lips and tried to appear calm i cant rule that out not with a hundred percent certainty who an fbi agent tarver stuck out his bottom lip who is he its a girl grace fennells sister her name is alexandra morse a strange smile touched tarvers lips ahh well we knew she was a risk why is this girl suspicious of you bill fennell thinks his wife may have said something to morse just before she died morse was very upset by her sisters death remember she kidnapped fennells son but she returned him before the funeral yes right theyd had a lot of trauma in that family even before we stepped in the father was shot during a robbery the mother is dying now ovarian cancer morse was almost terminated from the bureau a couple of months after her fathers death for getting a fellow agent killed has she talked to you directly no dr tarvers eyes bored into rusks with relentless intensity the question andrew is how does she even know you exist i dont know that would fennell have told her anything about you he could havebut would he i dont think so hes not stupid is he fucking her i dont think so rusk replied asking himself this question for the first time which was pretty sloppy in a divorce lawyer he realized i mean not that i know of this answer obviously did not satisfy tarver shed never screw bill fennell rusk said more confidently shes too goodygoody for him too hot too she has a vagina doesnt she point taken why isnt she his type you remember the file on the fennells dont you hes a snake basically you malign that creature by your comparison tarver said with strange severity nonplussed rusk blinked a few times then continued i checked morse out before the operation remember shes a bythebook agent always plays by the rules or did anyway thats why she joined the fbi and not the cia but you know nothing about her deeper psychology i guess not when you put it that way it could be the business connection tarver said thoughtfully the real estate deal between you and fennell yes you should have stuck to diamonds this deal is better than diamonds eldon way better not if it kills you rusk instantly noted two highly disturbing things first dr tarvers use of the singular pronoun second he had not said anything about prisonhe had gone straight to death do not pass go do not collect two million dollars tarver was watching rusk with fresh interest what has agent morse done to upset you so youre obviously worried i think i might be being followed the understatement of the year no mention of the crown vic or the chase along the pearl rivernothing to trigger eldon tarvers overdeveloped instinct for selfpreservation tarver had gone still you might be or you are its possible im not sure who do you think is following you the fbi honestly i dont think so leave out the adverbs andrew give me facts rusk resisted the urge to cuss the pathologist if alex morse is digging into her sisters death she has to be doing it on her own time morse is already in deep shit with her superiors why would the fbi investigate grace fennells death its a state crime youre the lawyer look into it i will what else has morse done here goesshe may have broken into my office tarver stared without blinking are you certain of anything andrew or are you simply afraid to tell me the truth im not afraid he said which was the height of absurdity even if she did break in theres nothing in my office to find nothing incriminating i mean theres always something i know your type compulsive about writing things down come on if she got into my computer she might be able to trace some business relationships nothing illegal though everythings aboveboard but the connections tarver said softly connections to other corpses spouses of corpses only the earliest jobs rusk said the latest three years ago if you discount grace fennell tarver reminded him right tarver dropped several more slices of raw meat into the skillet rusk considered using this silence to tell tarver about ex nihilo but somehow the time wasnt quite right ive still only heard about one threat murmured dr tarver the second is more direct but also more manageable continue its one of our former clients william braid the bargecompany owner in vicksburg thats the guy what about him hes having a nervous breakdown i kid you not eldon its from the guilt from watching his wife die hes hallucinating seeing his dead wife in crowds all kinds of crazy shit it took her so long to die you know he just couldnt stand it im afraid of what he might do who he might talk to his pastor a shrink the police even braid called you he stopped me at the goddamn golf course he drove by my fucking house yesterday lisa just about freaked out dr tarvers face drew taut was he seen only by lisa and i played that off what did braid tell you at the golf course hes thinking of killing himself whats he waiting for rusk forced a laugh but he was too worried about his own skin to indulge in levity why tell you that hes suicidal dr tarver reasoned aloud why not just go ahead and do it exactly i dont think hes the suicidal type too much selfregard i think at the end of the day hell lay the blame on us and confess to the police tarver stared at rusk awhile then shrugged philosophically this was bound to happen sooner or later inevitable really what should we do braid has children three you think he forgot your warning he forgot what happened to his wife i dont think he cares anymore eldon hes that far gone these people tarver said with almost tangible disgust so weak theyre like children themselves really no wonder women despise men nowadays rusk said nothing where was mr braids precious conscience while he was paying us to murder the old frump the lawyer shrugged hes a southern baptist tarver looked puzzled for a moment then he laughed you mean saturday night is a lot different from sunday worlds apart my man tarver scooped the rest of the meat from the crackling skillet and laid it on one of the stones around the fire i used to know people like that what do you think we should do the doctor smiled we is there something you can do to get us out of this rusk almost blushed welli meant you meant what am i going to do to save your ass this is going to cost me rusk suddenly realized bigtime dr tarver stood erect and stretched his long frame rusk could hear tendons popping tarver looked like that graybearded guy who was always shilling for starving children on latenight tv except for the birthmark that fucking thing was hideous get plastic surgery for christs sake he thought its the twentyfirst century and you are a fucking doctor of course he knew quite a few doctors with bad teeth come to think of it ill take care of mr braid tarver said in an offhand voice rusk nodded cautiously he wanted to know when the doctor meant to act but he didnt want to anger him by asking will braid be home tonight tarver asked yes i told him i might drive over to talk to him moron what if he told his mistress that she left him ten days ago nobody talks to him now his kids have been staying with their grandparents for the last two weeks all right rusk was breathing easier no mention of money so far two hundred fifty thousand tarver said suddenly as though reading his mind rusk crumpled inside that seems like a lot he ventured i mean hes a threat to both of us right all humanity went out of dr tarvers face does braid know my name no does he know my face of course not then hes no threat to me you are the only conceivable threat to me andrew and i advise you not to make me dwell on that how do you want the money the safe way well make the transfer here sometime next week rusk nodded a quarter of a million dollarsjust like that all to shut the mouth of one guiltridden client he had to start screening better but how it was tough to predict who had the intestinal fortitude to watch someone theyd once loved reduced to a hollowedout shell before they checked out shooting someone was a lot quicker and loads easier to deal with one trigger pull and the source of your temporary madness was lying in the morgue three days later she was prettied up for her final appearance in the casket and then poofgone forever that was fine in the old days of course the days of perry fucking mason but this was the modern age you couldnt shoot anyone you knew and get away with it nor could you strangle them poison them or push them off a hotel balcony just about any way you could kill somebody was traceable and provable in a court of law and spouses and family members were automatically prime suspects in every murder it was axiomatic the first thing a homicide detective learned no if you wanted to kill your spouse and get away with it you had to do something truly ingenious something that wouldnt even be perceived as murder and that was the service that andrew rusk had found a way to provide like any quality product it did not come cheap nor did it come quickly and perhaps most important of allas william braid was provingit was not for those with weak constitutions demand was high of course but few people were truly suitable clients it took a deeprooted hatred to watch your spouse die in agony knowing that you had brought about that pain but on the other hand rusk reflected some people bore up remarkably well under the strain some people in fact seemed almost ideally suited for the role they stretched their dramatic wings donning a suit of martyrdom that they enjoyed all the more for its being unfamiliar rusk tried not to judge anybody that was not his function his job was to facilitate an outcome that a great number of people desired but only an elite few could afford if the money bothers you dr tarver said think about being gangraped in parchman prison for twentyfive years or think about sticking your hand inside that bag tarver gestured at the blue nike bag at his feet because i could make a strong argument for that theres no risk to me and it absolutely guarantees my safety it would also deprive you of your future income rusk said bravely tarver smiled im already rich andrew rusk said nothing but he was on surer ground here dr tarver had earned millions from their association but the pathologist had already spent much of his money his private research work ate up capital at a staggering rate rusk wasnt sure what he was working on but whatever it was rusk couldnt see the pointunless it had nothing to do with money he knew that tarver had once been fired by a pharmaceutical company for some sexual impropriety and this had deprived him of the fruits of whatever research he had done for them maybe tarvers goal was to prove to those people that theyd made the worst mistake of their lives all this went though rusks mind in a matter of seconds and only at a shallowest level of thought for the core of his mind was focused on the question whats in that nike bag he had been watching the bag for twenty seconds now and he was almost positive that it was moving do you want to see tarver asked rusk shook his head with eldon tarver there was no telling what was in the bag a poisonous snake a fucking gila monster god only knew we need to talk about something else whats that andrew my safety a new watchfulness came into tarvers eyes yes i knew today would upset you especially the stuff about morse and because of that i felt i had to take steps to protect myself the doctors eyelids dropped like those of some south american lizard sunning itself on a stucco wall what did you do andrew take it easy eldon all i did was make a simple and absolutely safe arrangement whereby if i dont do a certain thing every day certain events will be set in motion rusk heard his voice quavering but he had to go on if he didnt hed never get it out events which would insure you going to prison for multiple murder a strange light had come into the halflidded eyes dont tell me that you left some sort of confession with your attorney or put something in a safedeposit box somewhere no no its much more discreet than that and much more reliable what if you happen to die accidentally youll have a couple of days to get out of the country no more though and thats not so bad were already set up like kings youd just be leaving a little earlier thats all the bottom line is this you cant kill me and stay in america but why would you want to kill me im making you more money than you could get any other way tarver was breathing in long rhythmic respirations thats not true your idea of wealth is very provincial andrew the profits from my research will dwarf what weve earned i consider our little operations piecework like a student cutting lawns during medical school for some reason this irritated rusk who believed what they were doing to be a revolutionary business but he didnt argue the point he was still looking at the bag there was definitely something alive in it i need to get back to the city he said tarver reached down and unzipped the nike bag your idea of a city is provincial also jackson mississippimy god as rusk edged away from the fire something black and yellow emerged from the opened zipper of the bag it looked like a lizards head a black lizard with a yellow band across its head too small for a gila monster he thought unless its a baby before you go said dr tarver tell me about the woman the woman rusk echoed for some reason thinking of janice and her muscular thighs alex morse oh she was a hostage negotiator for the bureau the best they had until she fucked up what was the nature of her mistake she let her emotions override her logic a common pitfall with an almost balletic fluidity tarver reached behind the black and yellow head and lifted a brilliantly colored snake from the bag oh shit the narrow brightly banded tail was twenty inches long and it coiled around tarvers arm as though around the trunk of some pale hairy tree rusk stared at the alternating bands red yellow black red yellow black his blood pressure dropped so rapidly that he thought he might faint it was a goddamned coral snake a stonefucking killer unless unlessthere was a king snake that looked almost exactly like the coral the scarlet king snake he remembered a story about some guys scaring the piss out of a pledge with one during hell week he tried to remember the rhyme hed learned as a boy scout red over yellowkill a fellow was that it red over black friend to jack if he was right then eldon tarver was holding a goddamn coral snake in his hand as casually as rusk would hold a kitten where did you get that fucking thing rusk asked in a quavering voice i found him this morning hes a shy fellow like all his kind he came right on out of that bag when you opened it tarver smiled i think he wanted to warm himself in the sun hes coldblooded remember just like you you crazy motherfucker is agent morse married tarver asked never interesting children just the nephew fennells boy are they close very dr tarver seemed lost in thought hes a rough old cob rusk thought not freakishly uglyexcept for the birthmarkbut repulsive in small ways he had big pores for one thing if you looked closely at his face it was like looking onto a landscape of holes like interior lining on the roof of an old volkswagen and he was pale the whole year round as though the relentless mississippi sun had no effect on him oh one more thing rusk said ive got a potential client tomorrow this guy is a total redneck but theres nothing provincial about his bank account and i know for a fact that he hates his wife she might consult one of the local divorce sharks any day now but lisa tells me she hasnt yet any reason i shouldnt pitch him if he looks likely greedy boy whats the potential take we could each clear a million i think dr tarver held the snakes head mere inches from his eyes really hell yes it would cost him ten times that to get divorced then do it no worries about braid tarver shook his head forget braid focus on your sales presentation thats your gift andrew sales rusk laughed genuinely this time partly because it was true and partly because tarvers last remark indicated that the doctor saw a future for himone that did not include the coral snake coiled around his forearm rusk wondered absently if william braid had a blind date with that snake but the truth was he didnt want to know snakes gave him the fucking willies if he was honest about it even from a distance i really need to go tarver smiled say goodbye to my little friend rusk shook his head no thanks take some tenderloin with you for your ride back not hungry rusk had already backed fifteen yards away from the fire how will i know that braid has been taken care of irritation flashed in tarvers blue eyes have i ever promised anything that did not become fact no my mistake go away andrew and remembertwo hundred and fifty thousand dollars i want uncut stoneswhite crystals but not that flashy stash you use to seduce college girls uncut white crystals rusk acknowledged finally in the trees now youll have them next week tarver was mostly a silhouette now but rusk saw him hold up the arm with the coral snake coiled around it i will indeed he called rusk turned and started running chapter chris had been working nonstop for hours the last face he expected to see when he walked into his private office for a break was his wifes thora was sitting behind his desk typing on the keypad of her treo she wore blue silk pants and a white silk top so fine that he could see through it at the rustle of his white coat she looked up and gave him a brilliant smile hey he said what are you doing here she started to answer but then her eyes clouded chris are you all right sure why you look green baby whats the matter he closed the door behind him i just diagnosed a fiftyfiveyearold woman with advanced carcinoma of the lung she was a friend of my mothers when we lived in natchez thora pulled off the pale blue scarf she was wearing in her hair and laid it on the desk im sorry i know that kind of thing tears you up im really glad to see you im just surprised well i happened to be driving past on the highway so i turned in here to see your face and get a kiss she got up and came around the desk stood on tiptoe and kissed him on the cheek sit down he did thora moved behind him and began rubbing his shoulders the soft scent of perfume reached him and soon he was back in his studio in the moments before she made love to him last night feel good this job really sucks sometimes thats because you let it in doctors like my father shut it all out they come in for the cutting then take their check and move on shane lansing rose into chriss mind lansing shared that trait with lars rayner relax thora said softly just for a minute im trying she kneaded the base of his neck trying to ease his tension he tried to go with it but mostly to please her a massage wasnt going to resolve any of his current problems oh i ate lunch with laura canning at planet thailand thora said she told me the alluvian had a cancellation this morning they gave us reservations for the next three nights the only catch is that we have to stay togetheras in the same room together chris leaned back and looked up at her inverted face you mean youre driving up there today no no tomorrow night we wont leave until tomorrow morning he leaned forward again absorbing this in silence dont worry ill still take ben to school and mrs johnson can take him to camerons birthday party if you cant get away chris had completely forgotten the birthday party a bowling party like so many held by bens classmates thora came around the chair and sat on the desk his mood had deflated her excitement but she looked more concerned than irritated youre pretty quiet she said her eyes intense he wished he could do something about his mood but after alex morses accusations and a morning of dealing with terminal illness it was tough to get excited about vacation plans as he looked at thora propped on the desk something struck him with odd force hed actually noticed it last night but his starved libido had relegated it to minor importance how much weight have you lost he asked staring at her concave belly beneath the silk top thora looked flustered what seriously you look too thin a little laugh thats what running does to you i know and it can be unhealthy are you still menstruating normally i had a period two weeks ago chris tried to remember any signs that this was true i want you to go in the hall and let holly weigh you thora reached down and squeezed his thigh youre being silly chris no im being serious come on he said standing ill weigh you myself i want to draw some blood too blood thora looked stunned no way look you hardly ever come to the office when was the last time you had a complete physical she thought about it i cant remember but mike kaufman checked me out during my last gyno visit that was more of a focused exam im worried about your general health plus you werent running nearly as much when mike looked at you that could be interfering with your ability to conceive thora looked sober but said nothing what are you worried about he asked with genuine concern nothing i just dont like needles you know that thats no reason to put it off come on he took her by the arm and walked her out to hollys nurses station leaving her sandals on thora stepped up onto the medical scale chris shook his head and told her to take the sandals off after she did he worked the black iron balances until the bar settled into a level position a hundred and eleven pounds he said how much did you weigh when we got married thora shrugged i dont remember i do a hundred and twentysix i never weighed that in my life chris chuckled she was definitely lying about that but there was nothing sinister in it youre five feet six thora you dont need to lose fifteen pounds when your starting point is one twentysix she sighed and stepped off the scale chris knew hed never get her down the hall to the lab so he sat her down and fastened a bloodpressure cuff around her upper arm after hed pumped it up he dug into hollys bottom drawer and took out one of the syringes she used for injections hey thora cried what do you think youre doing with that just sit back and be calm im very good with a needle he is said holly from behind him he could find a vein on an overweight elephant im not sure thats relevant here thora said what gauge needle is that a twentyone said chris she grimaced cant i have a twentythree stop being a baby most people get twentyones you know im not most people she pulled her arm away at first but after a few evasions she sat back and let him draw ten ccs of dark venous blood into the barrel of the syringe if they were in the lab he would have filled several tubes but this was better than nothing god thora said clenching her inner elbow to facilitate clotting i come in for a kiss and i get violated instead no wonder i dont come here very much chris laughed but he was thinking that something hed always suspected about thoras attitude toward his office was true it reminded her of her father in some way and she didnt want to be around it i thought you liked me violating you he said not today she got up and walked back toward his office when chris got there she had put her scarf back on and was slipping her treo into her purse ive got a lot to do to get ready for my trip she said coming to the door will you be home when i pick up ben he asked weve got baseball practice today practice thoras eyes narrowed ben has a game tonight chris youre playing last years championship team jesus youre right thora laughed with real pleasure i cant believe you forgot and i remembered the world must be rotating backwards today after the morning ive had it wouldnt surprise me i hope the rest of the day is better she shook her head as though puzzled its afternoon already chris he looked at his watch she was right god ill bet the staff is ready to kick my ass have you eaten anything not since this morning thora walked into the corridor and looked back at him you need to shut this place down and run over to the hospital cafeteria i think i will do you want to come no im full of sushi somehow i doubt that you probably took two or three bites total she pushed him playfully then called goodbye to holly who was down by the door to xray ill see you at the house okay thora leaned close to him maybe after bens game we can do a replay of last night he was about to answer when he felt her hand close around his testicles she looked meaningfully at him and squeezed maybe so he said turning red thora laughed softly then turned and walked toward the private exit her silk pants swishing gracefully around her ankles after shed gone chris walked down the hall and handed the full syringe to holly i want you to inject this into a redtop vacutainer and spin it down okay what tests do you want done a cbc and a standard chem but dont throw any serum away i may do some more tests depending on what i find okay holly walked quickly toward the lab as chris turned he saw jane his receptionist leaning through the window that opened onto the hall are you okay boss she asked yeah why you dont seem like yourself today im good to go jane snorted then maybe you should its time to tie on the feed bag darlin past time said his lab tech from behind him even dr cage left out of here fortyfive minutes ago chris shook his head if tom was gone to lunch he had definitely stayed too late youve still got one patient holly reminded him coming back up the hall room four mr patel sounds like a hot gallbladder chris walked back to his office and closed the door he needed to examine patel but right now he couldnt summon the concentration he walked around his desk and sat in his chair again without quite knowing why he opened his drawer as he did he realized that he was checking to see if thora had been through his things why should i worry about that he wondered then he saw the answer lying on top of a prescription pad was the silver motorola clamshell phone that alex morse had given him on the trace that morning if thora had opened this drawer she would have seen it instantly maybe she did he thought noif shed seen a new cell phone she would have asked me about it as chris turned the motorola in his hand he saw that its blue lcd window said missed call the phones ringer was set to silent he flipped open the phone and checked the time of the call one minute ago strangely flustered he speeddialed the only number programmed into the memory after only half a ring a woman said its alex can you talk yes im right outside your office thora just left he felt a wave of disorientation why are you here i followed your wife here crap alex what are you doing trying to save your life jesus i told you i have something to show you chris something unequivocal dread settled in his chest what is it ill tell you when i see you goddamn it you said thoras gone yes just come into my office then a hesitation that would be a mistake you can use my private entrance no you come to me i still have patients i cant leave now besides where would we go theres some kind of park at the end of this boulevard thats not a park its a historical site the grand village of the natchez indians fine whatever its deserted and its only a quarter mile away agent morse i is thora leaving town today chris tomorrow morning a quick expulsion of breath this wont take ten minutes you owe it to yourself to ben too irrational anger flooded through him he considered asking morse to wait ten minutes and then slip into his office but sometimes one or two staff members stayed through lunch and ate lean cuisines in the lounge he couldnt be sure that wouldnt happen today ill meet you there in five minutes ill be waiting on the big hill in the middle morse said the big hill thats a ceremonial mound not a hill an indian mound great please hurry fifteen minutes later chris was trotting under a thick stand of oak trees heading for a vividly lit stretch of grass almost half a mile long he jogged past a replica of an indian hut and broke out into the sunlight in the distance stood two steeply sloped mounds separated by eighty meters the nearer was a ceremonial mound where the chief of the natchez the great sun had once presided over the rituals of this unique tribe farther on stood the temple mound both had been built by the sunworshipping natives that settled this land a thousand years before the white man came like many old cities natchez had been founded upon murder in this case the massacre of the natchez indians by french troops from new orleans in retaliation for a rebellion in the previous year chris shielded his eyes with the flat of his hand and studied the crest of the nearer mound a small silhouette appeared against the sky he wasnt sure that the shadow figure was alex morse but he walked in that direction anyway he scanned the village grounds as he walked sighting half a dozen tourists near the temple mound all moving in groups of two he breathed harder as he climbed the mound but it was nothing compared to emerald mound north of the city there the natchez had constructed an earthen analog of the mayan structures in the yucatán though anthropologists believed that no direct connection existed its been twenty minutes said the silhouette above him when chris reached the crest he recognized morse she had exchanged her wet biking garb for khakis and a pale yellow top he saw no sign of her gun maybe it was in the brown handbag that lay at her feet what do you have to show me were pretty exposed here morse said can we move somewhere else jesus i guess so st catherines creek runs through this site theres a path under those trees over there that leads down to it fine she started in that direction without waiting for him chris shook his head in frustration then followed along the path the trees changed from oak to elm and then to cottonwood thick stands of bamboo appeared on either side and then they were walking on damp beige sand the humid air smelled of dead fish only two years ago chris recalled one of the most beautiful young girls in the city had been killed along this creeknot far away from here in fact tom cages son had defended the prime suspect in the casea natchez internist of all peopleand only by exonerating the suspected physician had penn cage escaped the ill feeling that had attached to his client during the investigation but escape he did for less than two months later penn had been voted into the mayors office during a special election how far away is this creek morse asked breathing hard and sweating harder fifty more yards should we just stop here no were in mosquito heaven the trees gave way to an empty sandbar beyond which lay a wide placid creek the calm water was misleading during thunderstorms chris had seen the creek reach a depth of twenty feet as it swept through town carrying massive tree trunks along like matchsticks it had been that way on the day that poor girl was murdered thats far enough said morse stopping in the middle of the sand put your game face on doctor chris clenched his fists at his sides she opened her purse and handed him a sheet of printer paper still damp with ink it was a photograph of thora standing facetoface with shane lansing behind them was a seamless sheet of black granite that chris recognized as the face of the fireplace in the great room of their new house in avalon thoras face was highly animatedseemingly by anger but he couldnt be sureand she was gesturing with both hands lansing was listening with a submissive expression chris had never seen on his face before it was difficult to read what was being discussed but the two of them were standing very close togetherdefinitely in each others space though not quite at an intimate distance where did you get this chris asked you know where i mean how did you get it and when i took that picture fortyfive minutes ago i printed it in my car on a portable canon chris felt unsteady on his feet thora was wearing the same silk top and blue scarf she had worn to his office only minutes ago and she had said nothing about talking to shane lansing you sneaked into the house with them i shot it through a window i was tired of you telling me im full of shit that i have no proof of anything chris looked downstream at a fiftyfoot bluff covered with thick green kudzu what do you think this picture proves that your wife is doing something besides giving dr lansing the threepenny tour of your house this is their third meeting this week did you hear what they said i couldnt get close enough without her seeing me chris walked over to a large driftwood log and sat down heavily dr shepard he didnt reply he was thinking of last night when he and thora had made love on the couch in his studio of thoras efforts to get pregnanther surprise plans for his studioi know this looks bad he said in a monotone holding up the picture but it doesnt prove theyre having an affair maybe lansing is having problems at home maybe hes confiding in thora about something morse opened her mouth in astonishment youre acting like a wife chris a longsuffering wife defending her cheating husband to her family and friends goddamn it he said in a low voice you dont know thora maybe you dont either he looked up youre saying she got it on with shane lansing then drove straight to my office to give me a kiss youve got to wake up chris adulterers lie like that all the time my fiancé left my best friends bed then came straight to my apartment and had sex with me he never even showered but maybe thats just my life did thora tell you she came to your office to give you a kiss chris looked away and dropped the photo on the sand what else did she do today the usual she ran she showered she swam at the country club then she drove to mainstream fitness for her weight lifting she showered again there then started walking to planet thailand he nodded distantly at the last minute her cell phone rang she took the call then suddenly turned around and went back to her car thats when she drove out to avalon chris looked up sharply thora didnt eat at planet thailand no what did she tell you i ate with laura canning at planet thailand today no im full of sushi chris he couldnt look at morse an equivocal photo was one thing an outright lie was another she lied to you didnt she morse said if you still have any doubts check her cell phone bill you can do it online therell be a call from lansing at twelve twentyeight pm today you have the picture that proves she met him immediately afterward and you know she lied to you about where she was during lunch once you put those things together i get it okay chris snapped turning away just give me a minute here alex walked down to the waters edge leaving dr shepard to absorb the new reality at his own pace it was the lie that did it she thought with satisfaction she could have talked until she went hoarse and shepard might have remained in denial he was even prepared to make excuses explaining the photograph but now that didnt matter thora had damned herself with a single lie it hadnt even been a necessary lie alex reflected but that was human nature as her father had explained many times when people got into the habit of lying they came to depend on it as a means of sliding easily through life thora probably hadnt even considered the risk of that little fib after all she had planned to eat lunch at the thai restaurant and chris would never check on something so small alex looked down into the creek in search of fish but all she saw was a cloud of tadpoles the creek and the woods made her think of jamie and how her father had taught the boy to fish in the various waterways around jackson bill fennell had been glad for those fishing trips she remembered and now she knew why getting jamie out of his hair had made it that much easier for bill to meet his mistress for a quick screw it left only grace to get rid of and grace stayed so busy that she was easy to evadeespecially after their mothers diagnosis oh god alex thought i need to check in with the nurses she turned back to chris ready to call out that pictures not going to change no matter how long you look at itbut in the event she said nothing chris shepard was gone chapter the crowd roared at the clang of the aluminum bat and two hundred eyes followed the arc of the harddriven baseball beneath the lights coaching first base chris tensed and watched ben race toward him from the batters box the boy had smacked the ball between the second baseman and the bag but the center fielder had charged forward and was already scooping up the ball turn and look chris shouted ben pivoted off the bag with his right foot and sprinted a third of the way to second base the throw would easily beat him to the bag he had to come back chris heard thora cheering from the bleachers but he didnt look up hed been in a mild state of shock since seeing the photograph alex morse gave him on the bank of st catherines creek his first instinct had been to drive home and confront thora but by the time he passed the hospital in his car he had calmed down enough to turn around go inside and make rounds instead after that hed returned to his office and finished out the afternoon most of thoras blood tests had been completed by then and the only abnormality he found was mild anemia which he often saw in distance runners dad said ben do you want me to steal on a passed ball chris stared at ben as though in a trance this handsome young boy who called him dad was the son of a man chris had never met the issue of a chapter of thoras life that remained largely unknown to him before alex morse arrived in natchez the unknowns in thoras life had not much bothered chris but now everything had changed he hadnt spoken to thora since she left his office that afternoon after work hed called ben and told him to be waiting outside the house thora had waved from the kitchen window when he drove up signaling for him to wait but chris had left for the baseball field without a word dad ben said again do i steal or what chris tried to force his mind back to reality he hadnt eaten lunch or dinner and hed been feeling dizzy since the game started it was the bottom of the sixth inning and the opposing team was up by one run if his boys couldnt score and push the game into extra innings it was over he looked at the batters box and his heart sank hed reached the bottom of his batting order three weak nineyearolds in a row they were good boys but they couldnt hit a baseball if their lives depended on it he had moved ben deep in the order to keep some power late in the lineup but ben could only do so much chris knelt beside him met his eyes and whispered steal no matter what ben started to question this call then thought better of it he understood the situation the instant the next pitch crossed the plate ben bolted for second base the catcher caught the ball cleanly jumped to his feet and fired the ball across the pitchers mound his throw was a little highjust high enough for ben to slide safely under the second basemans glove as it whipped down to tag him half the crowd went wild and the other half groaned chris gave ben a thumbsup and watched his left fielder walk nervously into the batters box the boy took his position at the plate then looked worriedly at chris chris hitched up his belt giving the signal to bunt while he waited for the pitch he glanced over the chainlink fence to his left as he did he realized that his eye had been drawn by movement a young woman was riding past the field on a bicycle when she lifted her right hand in a subtle wave chriss heart thudded in his chest alexandra morse shed probably panicked after he disappeared from the creek bank shed called his cell phone so many times since that meeting that hed switched it off shed even tried calling his office but his staff had refused to put her through chris didnt care as morse rode slowly away his head whipped around at the ring of a baseball hitting aluminum his left fielder had bunted the ball six feet in front of the plate and was now charging toward first base his arms windmilling wildly in an effort to keep himself balanced chris screamed encouragement but in vain the catcher drilled the ball into the first basemans glove while the boy was still ten feet from first base the first baseman tried to throw ben out at third but chris knew before he looked that ben had made it he patted his left fielder on the shoulder and told him hed made a good play stay focused on the game he thought fighting an urge to glance in morses direction again ben is on thirdwe can tie it right here there were two outs on the scoreboard his next batter already had a strike against him the opposing pitcher hadnt thrown many wild balls today most of his pitches were straight down the pipe a strikeout was a near certainty to tie it up ben would have to steal home plate he had the speed but would he have the opportunity chris looked across the field at his thirdbase coach a local welder the man was looking at him questioningly chris closed his eyes for a moment then tugged on his right earlobe if the catcher missed a ball ben would go for it swing hard ricky chris shouted in this league a swinging bat increased the odds that the catcher would miss the ball especially the way ricky ross swung the bat he was as likely to hit the catchers mitt as he was to hit the ball as it flew over the plate the pitcher unloaded a fastball ricky swung like mark mcgwire overdosing on steroidsand missed the ball glanced off the catchers mitt and caromed off the backstop behind him ben exploded off third base reaching full speed in five steps but the pitcher was already dashing to cover home plate the catcher wouldnt beat ben to the plate for a tag but the pitcher might ben sprinted as far as he dared before dropping into his slide and then he was skidding down the baseline in a cloud of dust every voice in the bleachers fell silent and chriss heart rose into his throat he thought ben had it but a flash of white at the center of the dust cloud made him clench his fists in fear out screamed the umpire the stands erupted in a schizophrenic roar of fury and joy chris ran toward the plate but it was no use arguing the call he hadnt seen the play instinct told him that no one had including the umpire there was so much dust that the final act of the game had been obscured ben got up his face red and stared at the umpire with tears in his eyes he seemed on the verge of challenging the ump so chris caught him by the arm and pulled him into the dugout it was a good try chris said but its over time to be a man the two teams lined up then filed past each other saying good game good game and then it was over chris gathered his team behind the dugout gave them an encouraging wrapup talk in the gathering dusk and dispersed them to their waiting parents four or five fathers told him he should file a protest about the final call but chris shook his head and told them to start thinking about the next game dad said ben tugging at his arm can we stay and watch cjs game no honey said a female voice from behind chris thoras voice aw come on mom dad didnt say no all right then thora said in a clipped voice ask your dad and see what he says ben grinned and looked up at chris can i dad can i sure said chris lets see how cj does against webb furniture ben screeched in delight and ran off toward the bleachers why did you do that asked thora stepping in front of him with a betrayed look i thought we were going to spend some time together at home chris choked back a half dozen replies he really wants to stay but im leaving tomorrow by your choice she looked at chris as though hed slapped her youll only be gone three days he said right thora nodded slowly but said nothing he walked past her toward the bleachers he thought she might call after him but she didnt as he walked he tried to get a handle on his emotions after going back to his office he had done as morse suggested and checked the online billing records for thoras cell phone hed found several numbers he didnt recognize but none belonged to shane lansing chris knew this because he had called them all to check stranger still there had been no call at pm there wasnt even a call in the thirtyminute window surrounding either agent morse was mistaken or thora had a cell phone he knew nothing about chapter eldon tarver stood alone beneath a flaming sky staring at a mansion built by slaves years before he was born one of the most splendid homes in vicksburg the greek revival palace stood on a hogback bluff overlooking a oncestrategic bend of the mississippi river not far away lay the big cannons that had held ulysses grant at bay for fifty siege days while the citizens of the town ate rat flesh and clung to their longcherished beliefs how many had died in that lost cause dr tarver wondered fifty thousand casualties at gettysburg alone and for what to free the slaves who built this house to preserve the union had stonewall jackson died to create a nation of couch potatoes ignorant of their own history and incapable of simple mathematics if those brave soldiers in blue and gray had seen what lay in the future they would have laid down their muskets and walked home to their farms dr tarver moved deeper into the shadow of an oak tree and watched a lincoln continental sail slowly up the long curving driveway to the house after it parked a heavyset man in a soiled business suit staggered out of the drivers door straightened up and made his way toward the mansions front door william braid dr tarver removed his backpack and laid it at his feet he breathed in sweet honeysuckle the scent of spring it reminded him of his childhood home in tennesseea mixed memory braid struggled for nearly a minute to fit his key into his front door he hadnt shaved for days and his suit was a wreck after another thirty seconds he took out a cell phone and called someone he seemed to be ranting but eldon couldnt make out his words as braid walked farther from the house probably to improve his reception eldon glanced at his watch and returned to his thoughts like william braid america seemed hellbent on selfdestruction she was squandering her power in halffought wars and exporting her manufacturing base to future enemiesin short practically begging for darwinian retribution of all the great modern thinkers dr tarver believed charles darwin had proved the most prescient his laws worked at every level governing the life cycles of microbes men and nations dr tarver tracked the elegant operations of those laws like a watchmaker observing a flawless timepiece like all scientific laws darwins could be used not only to describe the past but also to predict the future not by chance had eldon tarver been one of the few scientists to predict the emergence of hiv in homo sapiens darwins laws had also revealed to him that the new paradigm of war so ballyhooed in the news mediawar against terrorist groups rather than nationswas merely an illusion there was nothing preternatural about his insight the future was barreling toward america with such momentum that nothing could stop it and any child of the cold war should have seen it five years ago that future was china an ancient empire reborn as industrial superpower a singleminded engine of economic expansion that cared nothing for ethics the environment loss of life or the destinies of other nations this insured that in a very short time china would be locked in mortal combat with the only other monolithic power on the planet and the united states tarver knew was woefully unprepared for this darwinian battle for survival william braid had been walking aimlessly as he talked on the phone but now he took a sudden turn toward dr tarvers hiding place the doctor tensed until the fat man veered left and stopped beside a welltended bed of roses still ranting at full volume from this distance dr tarver could tell that braid was stone drunk the battle between the united states and china would begin as a cold war with leaders on both sides denying that a conflict even existed but in a world of scarce resources industrial giants could dissimulate for only so long the first skirmishes would occur in the area of international trade then escalate into the realm of international banking long before armies ever faced each other on land or sea the targeting coordinates of nuclear missiles on opposite sides of the globe would be changed to reflect the new reality and for the second time in history the worlds smaller wars would recede into the background as children grew up in the shadow of a polarizing conflict that brought with it a unique and almost comforting order william braid barked something in dr tarvers direction then threw down his cell phone and reeled up to his front door like a boxer about to drop to the canvas bending over his key again braid uttered a startled cry of triumph and disappeared inside the house dr tarver removed a pair of surgical gloves from his pocket put them on and studied his watch he would give braid a minute or two the only future he would ever know unlike the last cold war this one would not drift along for decades punctuated by selflimiting crises because the chinese werent the russians the russians as tarver often told his colleagues were basically just like us white europeans with a strong judeochristian heritage despite whatever lip service theyd paid to communist denials of god but the chinese were most assuredly not like us when push came to shove the chinese were capable of destroying half of their population to wipe us off the face of the earth as mao once said if nuclear war kills half a billion of our people we will still have half a billion left and then hed laughed but mao had not been joking war with china was inevitable and eldon tarver knew it but unlike the professional ostriches now running the country he wasnt content to sit back and watch it happen in eldons adoptive father had fought his way across four blooddrenched islands in the pacific and hed learned a thing or two about the asian mind he might have been a bitter old bastard with ironhard hands but he had inculcated the lessons of that war into all his childreneven the one hed adopted solely to obtain an extra worker on his farm thus unlike the dilettantes who reveled in antichinese repartee on the cocktail party circuit eldon tarver had a plan he had studied his enemy for decades preparing to wage what the pentagon called asymmetrical warfare but dr tarver had a simpler phrase for it oneman war a light clicked on in the master bedroom of the braid house spilling lowvoltage halogen light onto the perfectly manicured lawn dr tarver knew about the halogen bulbs because hed spent time in that bedroom nearly two years before he lifted his backpack and moved swiftly around the house to the patio doors braid would not have switched on his security system yet like most people he was a creature of habit and like most peopleat least in relatively safe mississippibraid did not feel the least bit threatened while the sun was still shining that was why dr tarver had come early he opened the french doors with his keya key that braid had given andrew rusk over two years agothen slipped inside and moved toward a closet beneath the main stairwell dr tarver was halfway there when a brief ping echoed through the house he stepped into the closet and stood absolutely still listening the way he had when hed hunted for food as a boy he heard nothing he had planned to wait until braid went to sleep to do his work but now that he was here he couldnt bear the thought of the wasted hours it wasnt as if this operation were going to add a single line of data to his research notes as he stood fuming in the closet a possible solution struck him if braid was in the shower now eldon could do what he needed to do and be headed home before the moon was up all it would take was a little audacity which was not a scarce resource in the tarver gene pool he removed his shoes then opened the door and moved quickly along the carpet runner in the hall at the end of this runner lay the master bedroom he listened at the bedroom door with the same concentration hed used in the closet nothing braid was almost certainly in the bathroom dr tarver silently opened the door confirmed that the room was empty then moved straight to the closed bathroom door braid was either taking a shower or taking a crap eldon hoped it was the former looking down he saw a faint trace of steam wafting up from beneath the door he moved to a highboy against the wall to his left in the top drawer he found the weapons he had known would be there man was a creature of habit a dozen vials of insulin and two bags of syringes there were two types of insulin shortacting humulin r and the longeracting humulin n unsnapping his pack he removed a cc syringe and stripped off the packaging this syringe could hold five times more liquid than the standard diabetic syringes in braids drawertwenty times his usual dose the doctor lined up ten vials from braids drawer then quickly filled the syringe to capacity to complete the charade that would later be played he loaded two of braids syringes as well then uncapped the needles on both held in one hand they looked like the fangs of some cybernetic serpent as he reached for the doorknob eldon dimly heard the shower flowing he had to move fast if braid emerged and saw him there might be a struggle despite the mans inebriated state even if braid was suicidal eldon could not count on a passive victim facing the black maw of death some wouldbe suicides would kill a dozen men to save themselves dr tarver turned the knob with his gloved hand and pushed he heard the hiss of wood against the nap of the carpet the bathroom was large but thick with steam braid had forgotten to switch on the exhaust fan he must have the water very hot hes so drunk he cant feel it dr tarver felt intense satisfaction this scenario was far better than his original plan his sleeping gas left a traceable residue in the tissues for up to thirtysix hours if you knew what to look for and in some people it could cause allergic reactions this method involved no forensic riskonly iron nerves he laid the two smaller syringes on the bathroom counter then positioned himself to the left of the shower door behind the etched glass a pale flabby blur swayed in the steam eldon heard four wheezing breaths then a groan that made him suspect braid was either urinating or masturbating a moment later a strong odor confirmed the former it took more than urine in the shower to disgust a pathologist but dr tarver was disgustednot by the bodily function but by braids essential weakness the man had decided to change his life then proved unequal to his desire braids mental process eluded him why had the man broken down had he decided that it was all right to murder your wife quickly but a mortal sin if she suffered that was the kind of contradictory thinking that afflicted the nation as a whole eager to be away eldon slid two gloved fingers behind the stainless steel pull on the shower door then he knelt opened the door and speared his needle into a prominent vein in braids lower leg there was no reaction he had injected almost the full barrel of insulin before braid jerked away and gasped wha it reminded eldon of the time his adoptive brother stuck a penknife into a cows side at first nothing then the cow shambled three steps away and looked back at him in dumb incomprehension had braid even felt the needle or was it the draft hed noticed it was the draft he was reaching out blindly to close the door either braid suffered from severe neuropathy or he was blind drunk before the door closed dr tarver slipped one hand behind braids ankles and yanked his feet out from under him the man went down hard banging his head on a tiled seat and possibly breaking his hip after more than a minute of groaning braid tried to get back to his feet but his left leg refused his considerable weight dr tarver crabwalked away from the shower door and sat on the commode behind a small partition whatever injury braid had sustained the pain was severe enough to burn through the anesthetic alcohol his groans slowly escalated to bellows of rage then screams of panic a plump white hand emerged from the open door clutched the tiled edge of the shower basin eldon worried for a moment that the fat man might extricate himself from the shower but then the insulin began to take effect the fingers of the hand stopped moving the screams faded back to groans and finally the groans to silence coma would soon follow dr tarver got up tossed the two unused syringes into the shower then the empty vials from the drawer now came the truly unpleasant part of tonights work before he left this house he would have to search it from top to bottom including the computers he could take no chance that braid had left behind a confession in any form walking back to the shower stall eldon bent and pulled up one of braids eyelids the pupils were fixed and dilated william braid was well on his way to being a vegetable if he didnt die of shock on the journey for the first time in many years eldon reflected the fat mans face was not lined with care as he walked down the hall toward braids study dr tarver decided that it would be no stretch to say that this operation had been a mercy amen chapter it was nearly dark in natchez but the stadium lights of three baseball fields had turned the surrounding park into an emerald island in the night chris had seen no further sign of alex morse but he sensed that she was close he had delayed going home to give himself time to think but he wasnt going to get that time after moping by the fence for a few minutes thora was now making her way up to him in the bleachers two sweating bottles of dasani in her hands chris had chosen a seat on the top bench hoping to avoid endless recitations of medical symptoms thora spoke to every patient she passed and they responded with the effusive welcome reserved for the wives of physicians on whom they depended are you going to tell me whats wrong thora whispered sitting beside him at last nothing he said staring straight ahead i just dont like to lose she set one of the bottles on the bench seat seems like more than that nope leaning toward him thora kept her eyes forward and spoke in a low voice i thought the prospect of sex would get you home early win or lose he looked at her then when she turned to him chris saw unfamiliar lines of tension around her eyes what did you do today he asked she drew back slightly thats a quick transition he shrugged the usual things thora said looking back toward the field i ran i swam i worked out at mainstream then lunch then i argued with the contractors and bought a few things for my trip chris almost said how did lunch go but instead he asked whats happening with the contractors thora shrugged then clapped for a st stephens boy whod hit a double same old same old delays on the woodwork change orders they want more money in advance chris nodded but said nothing on the next pitch bens friend cj cracked the ball out to the rightfield fence driving in the run and scoring a triple dad ben cried from two rows down did you see that are yall even watching the game i saw it all right next year maybe we can get you and cj on the same team oh yeah ben highfived one of his buddies then climbed up to chriss side chris almost sighed with relief he didnt want to talk to thora not here not at home either come to that he wished she were leaving for the delta tonight with ben so close thora watched the game in silence chris couldnt help but notice that almost everything ben said was directed toward him as the game wore on chris scanned the fences and the other bleachers he knew nearly every face he saw that was how it was in small towns some families had four generations sitting at this field the infants rolling around in the dirt while their greatgrandparents sat against the fence in wheelchairs looking down toward home plate he saw a man about his own age waving at him a strange numbness came into his hands and face the man was shane lansing before he was even aware of it chris found himself reappraising the surgeons sharpjawed handsomeness and athletic build for the first time it struck him that lansing bore a marked resemblance to lars rayner thoras absentee father their hair color was different but apart from that the similarities were considerable they were both lean and muscular both arrogant and sometimes cruel both surgeons with outsize egos lars rayner of course was a topflight vascular surgeon and thus had reason for his arrogance shane lansing on the other hand was a journeyman cutter who cared as much about golf as he did about medicine he was grinning now and thora was waving back as though lansing were a longlost relation wave chris she urged nudging him in the side fuck him chris thought almost saying it aloud he inclined his head slightly in lansings direction then looked pointedly back at the game whats gotten into you tonight thora asked nothing i told you i thought you liked shane i thought he was waving at you she looked at him strangely whats going on with you whats the matter hey ben chris said taking out his wallet and handing the boy run get me some popcorn aw dad theres a line a long one chris handed him the money and gave him a push ben got up and walked dejectedly down the steps you ever see lansing out at avalon chris asked in a casual tone i saw him today thora said without hesitation this admission brought chris up short you did yes he stopped by the site on his way home for lunch what for to look at the house for one thing what else for the first time thora looked uncomfortable ive been meaning to talk to you about this but youve been so busy lately about what chris felt his face flushing youve been meaning to talk to me about what god chris whats the matter shane asked me to come work for him thats all chris didnt know how to respond nothing could have surprised him more work for him doing what you cant tell anybody this but shane is planning to build a large outpatient surgery center it will compete with the local hospitals so you can imagine the stink it will cause the idea that shane lansing wanted to build a surgical center didnt surprise chris lansing was one of the new breed they started building their empires the first year they could legally tack the letters md after their names but why lansing would want thora to work at his surgical center was beyond him what does he want you to do supervise the personnel nurses and technicians mostly but but what youre a multimillionaire for gods sake why would you go to work as a nursing supervisor thora laughed her eyes twinkling i didnt say i was going to take it are you considering it she looked down at the field i dont know i get pretty bored sometimes playing the yuppie housewife chris said nothing she looked at him again and this time she let her real self shine through are you going to tell me what you think or can i already tell is that lansings only interest in you thora laughed louder this time the sound like a handful of bells what do you mean she asked but the flicker in her eyes told him she knew exactly what he meant dont be disingenuous her smile faded shanes married baby and if he wasnt in the silence that followed this question the giveandtake of their previous exchanges escalated to something more unsettling come on now thora said youre not serious shanes had three affairs that i know about in the last year thats just gossip she said dismissively you know this town no the gossip has him screwing six or seven nurses in the past year the three affairs i mentioned are fact he had to pay off two of the women to make them go away two tall boys had joined shane lansing behind the backstop the surgeon had four sons all handsome all good athletes i hadnt heard that thora said thoughtfully i cant believe ive actually heard some gossip that you havent im not in the hospital loop you know that chris turned his attention back to the game thoras revelation of a job offer had flabbergasted him could that be the explanation for their secret contact if lansing was putting together his own surgical center he was right to keep it a secret the two local hospitals would do all they could to stop him after a silent inning chris said ive got to pee and climbed down to the ground choosing a route that took him behind the backstop when he passed lansing he stopped and shook the surgeons hand fighting a juvenile urge to crush it in his grip heard you guys lost tonight lansing said chris forced down a surprising amount of bile and nodded what about yall the surgeon laughed with four boys you win some and lose some every night hey thora told me you came by the house today the remark seemed to take lansing by surprise but he recovered quickly yeah the place is really coming along its hard to believe thora designed it all not if you know her she can do pretty much anything she sets her mind to lansing chuckled again yeah i heard she used to upset a lot of doctors by telling them how to do their jobs where did you hear that lansing shrugged around you know the hospital chris forced a smile been playing much golf lately when i can you know me i was thinking about playing this week you going to be in town lansings eyes locked onto his yeah sure all week yeah you want to play a couple of rounds chris nodded ill call you lansing smiled then turned back to the field at the sound of a hit chris walked toward the restroom his ears ringing as though he had tinnitus halfway there he looked back at thora she was staring intently at shane lansing lansing was watching the game though after several moments thora turned toward the restroom and spied chris watching her he looked back at her long enough to let her know hed seen her watching lansing then turned and walked on he was standing at the kidsize urinal when a female voice hissed chris can you hear me he almost pissed on his jeans as he whipped left to find the source of the voice when it came again he realized that the cinder block wall dividing the mens and womens restrooms stopped six inches short of the tin roof the voice was coming from the crack there agent morse who else she whispered what did you do this afternoon you didnt show thora the picture did you no did you confront her about lansing no not directly what did you say dont worry about it its not what you think okay christ chris are you kidding me just leave me alone damn it i wish i could but i cant im going back to my seat call me tomorrow she said as soon as thora leaves town chris flushed the urinal will you call morse asked as he washed his hands who the hell is talking drawled a deep male voice a man wearing greasestained overalls had walked into the mens room behind chris chris smelled alcohol which was forbidden at the park but which always seemed to be a part of little league games nevertheless some chick in the ladies room chris said i think shes looking for some action the man in the overalls was trying to climb onto a lavatory to see through the crack by the roof when chris walked out of the restroom alex was late logging on to msn discouraged by dr shepards response at the baseball field she had stopped at a liquor store and bought a bottle of pinot noir before she reached the motel with it one of her mothers nurses had called and informed her that the oncologist was moving her mother back to the critical care hospital because of worsening liver involvement alex had started packing and drinking at the same time all the while checking her computer to see if jamie had gotten online she drank more than shed intended toa lot moreand as a result had passed out in her clothes only to startle herself awake at pm with a full bladder and a terror of having let both jamie and her mother down a flood of relief went through her when she saw the little green man that signaled jamies presence on the network before she could type a word an invitation for a videoconference popped up onscreen she accepted then watched the miniature video screen appear when jamies face materialized her voice caught in her throat the boys face was red and there were tears on his cheeks bill must have told him that his grandmother was going back into the hospital whats the matter little man she asked hoping it was only a lost baseball game what happened missys moving in with us alex felt a thunderclap of shock what why do you say that she came over to eat with us tonight she was acting all weird like shes my new best friend or something then dad said something about how great it would be for me to have a lady around again they both watched me really close after he said it im not stupid aunt alex i know what theyre doing alex almost got up and walked away from the webcam she couldnt conceal her emotions in this situation but maybe she shouldnt hide them what the hell was bill thinking his wife hadnt been in the ground six weeks and he was planning to move his mistress into the house with his bereaved son the man had no shame what should i do jamie asked and in that moment alex felt the full weight of responsibility for his future you hang tight bub thats what you do jamie wiped his eyes do i have to stay here if she moves in alex gritted her teeth and fought the temptation to give him false hope im afraid you do according to the law anyway he winced but anger seemed to be getting the better of his sadness now that alex was online can you do anything to help he asked is there any way i can come live with you maybe im working on that every day but you cant say anything about it not to your dad and not to missy i hate her jamie said with real venom hate hate hate missys not the problem alex thought bill is the fucking problem i didnt do my homework jamie said uneasily i told dad i did but i didnt i couldnt think about it do you think you can do it now jamie shrugged can you stay on while i do it alex needed to start for jackson she was already late and it was a twohour drive but how could she turn away from the confusion and fear in jamies eyes what choice would her mother make in this situation alex forced herself to smile as though she had all the time in the world absolutely just let me run to the bathroom jamie giggled me too i was afraid id miss you so i waited right here in this chair i almost peed in my coke can see you in a minute jamie held his opened hand up to the camera their substitute for physical contact alex held up her hand in reply but she had to turn away to hide her face that boy she thought proudly that boy is keeping me alive right now and hes worth ten of his daddy as she walked away from the computer she spoke softly but with conviction in a voice that could have come from her father that boy is a morse not a fennell and hes going to be raised by somebody who gives a damn five miles from alex morses hotel room chris lay in his adopted sons bed listening to the slow rhythmic sound of bens breathing he was exhausted and hed about decided to sleep right where he was today had been one of the worst days of his life and he had no wish to continue it by getting into further discussions with thora before bed his mind was spinning with morses accusations and thoras explanations and beneath that storm of words was an inchoate terror of having screwed up yet again he had dated his first wife for five years before marrying her and hed thought he knew her well but in a few short years life had proved him wrong kathryn ledet had been a physical therapy student at umc in jackson when chris married her a native of covington louisiana shed attended tulane as an undergrad and thus was ecstatic when chris was able to secure his residency at tulane medical center in new orleans but when the time came for chris to repay his school loans by practicing two years in the impoverished mississippi delta kathryn had been less than ecstatic still she toughed it out until chris was informed that his replacement would be four months late chris was ready to leave the delta too he had a plum job waiting with a premier internal medicine group in jackson but despite this he did not feel that he could abandon the neardesperate patients hed been treating for two years kathryn felt no such obligation when chris told her that he felt obliged to stay on until a replacement could be found she packed up her things and drove back to new orleans after his replacement arrived chris went after her to try to save the marriage but there was no point he had already proved that he was not the man kathryn wanted by the time hed worked three months in jackson he realized that neither kathryn ledet nor boutique medicine were for him but lingering over him like a pall was the realization that even after living with kathryn for years he had not seen through the beautiful facade to the true woman within hed dated thora less than a year before proposing to her hed known her longer than that of course mostly as the devoted wife of one of his patients and in that time he had come to respect and desire her more than any other woman hed met in the seven years since his divorce but noweven without alex morse whispering at his side he sensed that the thora he had come to know as red simmonss wife was only one facet of a much more complex character how deeply could you know a woman anyway a sailor could sail around the world a couple of times and believe he knew the sea when in fact all he knew was a set of waves and tides that had long since changed behind him and what about ben in a remarkably short time the boy sleeping beside him had put all his trust and faith in chris ben looked to him for answers for friendship for support and security not financial securitythora could provide that on her ownbut for the feeling that there was a man twice his size ready to stand between him and any danger that might come his way and though some of the boys admiration would fade during his teenage years right now he looked up to chris as though he were invincible it was hard to believe that thora would put that bond at risk to have an affair with a guy like shane lansing almost impossible really and yethe had seen friends and patients cast off everything of value in a desperate grasp for something they believed they needed a vertical crack of yellow light appeared in the darkness then a shadow darkened the crack thora was at the door looking in at them chris closed his eyes and lay still chris she whispered he didnt answer chris are you sleeping no reply after several moments thora tiptoed in and kissed each of them on the forehead goodbye boys she whispered i love you then she slipped out and closed the door behind her chapter alex blinked and stirred at a groan of pain she had been hovering in some purgatory between sleep and wakefulness her butt was numb from sitting in the hospital chair which shed pushed up to the side of her mothers bed her back ached because she had been lying for hours with only her head on the mattress beside her mothers shoulder now faint blue light was leaking around the window blinds margaret morse really belonged in intensive care but one week ago she had signed a dnr form which meant that no extraordinary measures would be taken to save her life should she crash the cancer that had begun in her ovaries and grown undetected for years had now despite three surgeries spread unchecked to her liver and kidneys and had also disseminated into various parts of her abdomen her liver was swollen to twice normal size and severe jaundice had set in she also was skirting the edge of renal failure which was unusual in ovarian cancer yet still she clung to life well past the time that dr clarke had told alex to prepare for the worst alex could have told the oncologist a thing or two about her mothers resilience but shed kept silent and let events teach the doctor about his patient alex had almost run off the road twice during last nights drive up to jackson jamies homework had taken over an hour and only images of chris shepard leaving the park with his wife at his side had brought alex back to alertness yesterday afternoon at the creek shed felt sure that the incriminating photo and the shock of thoras lie had convinced chris of her guilt yet one of alexs fathers lessons had come back to her during the drive if a cuckolded male did not actually catch his wife in bed with her loverif all he heard was gossip and innuendothen a period of denial was inevitable sometimes even obvious evidence would be ignored and iq had nothing to do with it just as with initial reactions to death or terrible disease the survival instinct enforced a period of emotional resistance to the dawning truth so that adaptation to the new reality could take place without radicaland possibly fatalreactions chris shepard was obviously living through that period right now the question was how long would it take him to progress to anger margaret groaned again alex squeezed her hand her mother was now taking so much morphine that periods of consciousness were less frequent than periods of sleep and lucidity was a forgotten state twice during the night margaret had begged alex to bring her father and sister into the room then railed at their callous absence during her illness with death so close alex had not found it within her to remind her mother that both her husband and eldest daughter had died in the last seven months alex jumped at the chirp of her cell phone which was tucked in her purse on the floor without letting go of her mothers hand she stretched out her other arm and retrieved the phone hello she said softly its will darlin hows she doing will kilmer had stayed with margaret until alex arrived from natchez a demonstration of true devotion to a partners wife who would never know the difference no better no worse did she keep sleeping after i left not all night but she slept more than i did the old detective sighed angrily damn it girl i told you last week you need to take a break from this case take a horse pill and sleep for twenty hours straight that damn rusk isnt going anywhere but youre too big to listen to me now alex tried to chuckle for wills sake but she couldnt manage it anyhow ive got some news thats going to wake you up kilmer said what is it remember william braid sure the husband of victim number five i told you last week that id gotten reports about him drinking heavily margaret began to snore uhhuh and you said his mistress left him right well whats he done now looks like he tried to off himself a shiver of excitement brought alex fully awake how when last night at home in vicksburg thats what the vicksburg police think anyhow go on braid was diabetic last night or sometime between last night and this morning when his maid found him he shot himself full of enough insulin to put him into a coma a permanent coma holy shit alex breathed could it have been an accident possible but braids doctor said its unlikely holy shit this could be what weve been waiting for this could be our break could be will said in the cautious tone of an old hunter who has watched a lot of game slip from his grasp it was guilt alex thought aloud braid couldnt handle the reality of what hed done to his wife she died hard worse than most of the others we need to find out everything we can about braids last few days do you have any operatives in vicksburg know a guy over there who does matrimonial work owes me a couple of favors thanks uncle will id be dead in the water without you one more thing kilmer said ive got a guy willing to spend two nights at the alluvian hotel for you his wife has always wanted to go up there and see the place if youll pay the cost of their room theyll pay the rest how much is the room four hundred for two nights will chuckled softly one alex summoned a mental image of her last surviving bank account then shoved it out of her mind she had to do whatever it took to get chris shepard on her side do it ill pay are you going back to natchez today i dont have a choice shepards my only chance you making any headway there hell come around nobody likes to find out their whole life is a lie will sighed in agreement tell your mama ill be by sometime today alex looked at her mothers sagging face her mouth hung open and drool ran steadily onto the pillow alex had the absurd impression that the fluid in the iv bag was being drooled out of her mothers mouth at exactly the same rate that gravity was pushing it into her veins i will hey little girlyou okay yeah i justim sitting here looking at mom and i cant believe someone would intentionally do this to another person much less a person they once loved she heard the raking sound of wills emphysema when he spoke again it was in the voice of a cop who had put in twenty years with his eyes wideopen believe it darlin ive seen human beings do things god couldnt create a bad enough hell for you look out for yourself you hear youre the last child your daddy left on this earth and i dont want you throwing your life away trying to avenge the dead im not doing that alex whispered im trying to save jamie well do that one way or another will said with certainty you just be careful i got a feeling about this case these are bad people were messing with and just because theyve killed slow in the past dont mean they wont strike quickly if you threaten them you hear me yes all right then alex hung up her eyes on her mothers jaundiced face what more could she do here she stood and kissed a yellow cheek then let go of her mothers hand time to move chapter andrew rusk had finally hooked the big one he knew it as surely as that time off bimini when the big swordfish had hit his bait and run like a jet ski tearing across the waves he had carson g barnett himself sitting opposite his desk a largerthanlife man of fortysix a millionaire so many times over that hed quit counting a legend in the oil business barnett had made and lost three fortunes but right now he was in an up cycleway up for the past hour barnett had been describing his marital situation rusk was wearing his most concerned look and nodding at the appropriate places but he wasnt really listening he hadnt had to listen for quite a few years now because the stories were all the same variations on a themea very tired one the only time rusk pricked up his ears was when barnett slid into the business side of things then the lawyer made sure he recorded every syllable but right now was the worst parta melodramatic soliloquy on how misunderstood barnett was rusk knew where the oilman was going long before he got there rusk could recite the lines of this movie without even thinking she hasnt grown at all since the day we got married not emotionally or psychologically or intellectually or sexually the softer ones would qualify quite a few would add her ass on the other hand has grown like a goddamn baby elephant another universal refrain was she doesnt understand me and of course the grandprize winner she doesnt even know me in rusks experience the opposite usually proved true in most cases the wife knew the husband too wellknew him more deeply than he wanted to be known in factand understood him better than he did himself therefore she did not ooh and aah every time he bragged about his latest business triumph and she complained long and loud when he disappointed her which was often she no longer thought he was brilliant or even smart or imaginative in bed and he certainly wasnt funny anymorenot to someone who had long ago heard every pathetic joke hed ever memorized and most of them twice and then of course there was the mistress some clients came right out and admitted they were having an affair others tried to hide it to appear noble and selfsacrificing rusk had come to respect directness more than anything else men and women who were considering divorce were always walking time bombs of frustration guilt lust and nearpsychotic levels of rationalization but no matter who sat in that chair opposite hima brilliant physician or a redneck barely able to total up his investment portfoliothey finally figured out a couple of things one there was no painfree choice whatever they decided to do someone was going to suffer the only real question was would they endure the suffering themselves by giving up their paramour and staying in the marriage or would they pass the suffering on to their spouse and children by breaking up the family rich or poor here was the essential agony of divorce rusk had come to believe that once children entered the picture women were less inclined to sacrifice family in the search for happiness than men this didnt mean they wanted happiness lessonly that they were less willing to buy it at the expense of others but this was based on anecdotal evidence from a limited geographic area rusk had no interest in the dynamics of divorce in new york or los angeleshe didnt live in those places besides he figured that the motives of a bunch of damn yankees were about as neurotic and selfobsessed as a woody allen movie only without the laughs carson barnetts marital problems had their own particular twist and would not be without interest to an anthropologist or sociologist but to a lawyer they meant little however carson barnett was very rich and in rusks viewas in his fathersthe rich were entitled to a fuller hearing than people of more limited means mrs barnettluvy carson called herhad begun the marriage as a baptist but this had played no bigger part in her life than the fact that she was a chiomega but sometime after the kids were born luvys interest and involvement in the church had increased exponentially around the same time her interest in all matters sexual had decreased in direct proportion carson had suffered through this as best he could for a while and then like any redblooded male he had sought relief wherever he could find it if there aint no food in the freezer you go to the store he boomed aint that right andy yes it is rusk agreed i mean even a dog knows that if there aint no food in his dish he goes on the prowl dont he he does indeed rusk gave an obligatory laugh he had seen this pattern many times men who sought sexual relief went through a period when they would screw anyone whod drop their pants for them and surprisingly this didnt usually impact the family at all in fact things seemed to run more smoothly all around the trouble started when the manor womanfound someone who was different from the rest a soul mate this term could almost trigger spontaneous vomiting in andrew rusk or a relationship that was meant to be when love reared its ugly head divorce was soon to follow barnett was telling a similar story right now and his soul mate had proved to be a sweet young thing who worked over at the barbecue place on route a restaurant where hed done quite a few oil deals in the pastbig deals tooscribbling out a map of the prospect on a cocktail napkin and sealing the agreement with a handshake anyhow barnett said as big drops of sweat rolled down his neck i love that little girl like nobodys business and i aim to marry her one way or another rusk liked barnetts choice of words because despite the mans crude way of expressing himself barnett was speaking in a kind of codea code that andrew rusk was silently fitting into a particular system of moral calculus one evolved over years of listening to frustrated people most of them men everybody got angry during a divorce it was axiomatic most people even got homicidally angry for a day or two but the majority of those people soon got over their anger and resigned themselves to the fact that life from then on was going to be one long compromise but some people refused to compromise especially the very rich it was probably a matter of habit as much as anything whatever the case carson barnett had already fallen into line with a couple of essential laws of rusks system and they were coming to the part of the conversation in which the lawyer could play a meaningful part so you want to divorce your wife he said in a somber tone yessir i do i never thought it would come to this but by god shes drove me to it rusk nodded sagely a lot of attorneys would discourage you mr barnett theyd encourage you to seek counseling call me carson andy please and let me stop you right there the only counseling luvy would try was her pastor and one visit was more than i could stomach you never heard such hogwash in your life i stood up and told him jesus doesnt have a damn thing to do with our marriage and the lord was lucky for it rusk smiled in appreciation of his clients rustic wit im not going to discourage you carson because i can see that youre in love truly in love you got that right true love is a wonderful thing but i can tell from all youve told me and from your manner that you anticipate some trouble from luvy with this idea of splitting up oh hell yes barnett said with a look of something like fear in his eyes rusk had a feeling that luvy barnett was a formidable woman luvy dont even believe in divorce andy says its a sin says its the root of all the evil in this world i thought money was the root of all evil barnett snorted luvy dont have nothing against money no sir no problem with money at all isnt that convenient you said it brother i talked to her about filing under irreconcilable differences like my buddy jack huston did jacks wife and luvy was best friends a few years back but no she wouldnt hear of it what did luvy say exactly she said i didnt have no grounds to divorce her and she wasnt going to give me one she says if i try to go to court shell deny me as much time as she can with the children seeing how im a sinner and a terrible role model for them course if i stay with her and try again im just an allaround great guy how about that she wants you to martyr yourself for the children you said it brother jesus all over again only you can forget the kids im supposed to give up everything for her has luvy said anything about the financial side of things barnett gritted his teeth for some time before answering she claims she doesnt want any money for herselfbeyond half of what i earned while i was married to herbut she wants everything she can legally get for the children which means all future production from the wells i hit while we was married or even prospects i mapped out while i was married to her rusk shook his head as though rendered speechless by the enormity of luvys greed shes also hired the meanest goddamn divorce lawyer in jackson too from what i hear rusk leaned forward at the news of this complication who did she hire david bliss youre right carson thats bad news indeed david bliss has accountants on permanent retainer who specialize in various businesses the hot new thing with lawyers like bliss is medical practices he gets all the doctors wives he has his jews take their businesses apart piece by piece by the time the ink is dry on the divorce the poor medic will be working for his wife for the next twenty years well im no doctor thank god im afraid your position is even worse carson you own tangible assets with documented records of monthly production you can consider half of those wells gone as of this moment barnett swallowed audibly and not only could a judge award luvy half ownership in all your current wells but he could also base an alimony figure on your current production numbers while in fact those wells will be going steadily downhill year after year correct barnett had gone white youd have to go back to court every time the price per barrel dropped or else youd be paying too much youll spend half your time in court carson do you have time for that barnett got up and started pacing the office you know what the price of oils done lately even my old wells have tripled in value for the past year i been kicking off wells i capped five years ago if a judge did projections based on my current productionholy jesus id owe her at least twenty million and maybe more then theres the rigs the houses the boat the goddamn restaurant rusk turned away to hide his excitement this was the client he had been waiting for the payday that would take him into retirement at forty the timing couldnt be better either being in business with eldon tarver would not be an option for that much longer please take a seat carson he said softly you came to me for a reason didnt you barnett stopped his flow looking more than a little lost then he sat down and stared at andrew rusk like a penitent staring at a priest empowered to offer him a papal dispensation a clever lawyer would tell you to forget about getting divorced what an animal look of suspicion you cant afford it what do you mean im worth fifty million bucks twentyfive carson if youre lucky thats still real money yes it is rusk leaned back and folded his hands across his chest lets talk about your kids dont you have a son playing football for jackson academy a smile broke out across barnetts face sure do jakes damn good too faster than i was by a damn sight how old is jake thirteen rusk smiled like a proud uncle thats good at least hell have some input into the custody issue what about your other children barnetts smile vanished got two little girls twins how old six course one is eighteen minutes older than her sister a sober nod six years before they even get to express an opinion you see what im getting at carson a long sigh from the big man getting divorced would cost you twentyfive million dollars and ninety percent of your time with your kids ninety percent if luvy takes the position youve outlinedand david bliss represents herthats correct you can expect to see them every other weekend and then a special arrangement for holidays of course a few extra hours i can almost guarantee fathers day fathers day i was planning on flying jake up to half the nascar races this year boythat just aint right morally i couldnt agree with you more but legallyim afraid it is right in the great sovereign state of mississippi anyway no such thing as nofault divorce here hell ill take the blame i just want to end this thing and be friends rusk shook his head sadly a pipe dream carson let me ask you this have you and your new love been careful barnett actually squirmed in his seat pretty carefulyou know ever bought her a present well sure ever use your credit card for that hell they make it damn near impossible to buy anything with cash these days you know yes what about phones have you called her on your cell phone barnett nodded a desolate look on his face you can count on bliss bringing suit against your girlfriend for alienation of affection what oh yes theyll drag her through the papers and try to get a financial judgment against her as well she dont have nothing as your wife she will they can garnish all her future earnings well i dont give a damn about the money but to put her through that for spite how long were you planning on waiting to marry this girl i know it cant be right off but were getting pretty itchy you know rusk could imagine the girl in question being very itchy to tie the knot before her soul mate got distracted by another sweet young thing in another restaurant somewhere you should also be prepared for a lot of anger on the part of your kids he had barnetts full attention now theyll be made painfully aware that youre abandoning their mother for a younger woman and theyll know who that woman is barnett was sullenly shaking his head do you think luvy will make an effort to integrate your new love into the life of the family shell scream harlot or jezebel every time she sees her and youre right about something else luvyll do everything she can to poison the kids against me shes already told me she wished id drop dead from a heart attack says shes praying for it every night youre not serious i swear on the bible she says its better for the kids to think im dead than gone off to leave them but youre not leaving them carson try telling that bitch that barnett screamed coming up out of his chair goddamn it im sorry andy sometimes i get so damned frustrated i could just what i dont know rusk let the silence stretch out now that barnetts anger had reached critical mass it wasnt going to cool anytime soon rusk stood up and rolled his chair around his desk then arranged barnetts chair so that it faced hisvery close too the big oilman stared at him with obvious curiosity even suspicion as though wondering if rusk might be queer please sit down carson i want to talk to you mantoman this was a language barnett understood he turned his chair around and straddled it his big forearms inches from rusks face what im going to say may shock you carson no you go right ahead im guessing that a man like you has come across some unusual situations in your business how do you mean welldifficulties thats for sure rusk nodded soberly some difficulties ive found are solvable by conventional methods while othersothers take some creative thinking extraordinary measures you might say barnett was watching him carefully now go on ive handled a lot of divorces hundreds in fact and a few of those cases had some similarities to yours really rusk nodded and some of those cases well they just broke my heart more than once ive watched a liberalbiased judge take away half a mans lifetime earningsor moreand then stop him from seeing his own children to bootthe children he brought into the world when you see thatwell it feels almost unamerican carson youre right i know im right and after id seen enough of those cases after fighting down in the trenches for a client and watching it all come to nothingwell a thought would come to me what was it i thought god forgive me but how much of a mercy would it be for this manand for these kidsif one of the parties to this goddamn court battle was to just disappear barnetts mouth was open like that of a teenage boy watching a stolen porn film and his eyes were gleaming rusk could almost see the idea sinking into the slow gray cells behind those eyes he dared not look away from carson barnett he held his eyes with almost evangelical fervor barnett swallowed and looked down at the carpet between them you mean i mean what i said no more no less if a vicious and unforgiving person was doing their utmost to stop a person they supposedly loveda person with whom they had had childrenfrom even seeing those children and also trying to take away everything that person had worked for all his lifewell then it just seemed like almost divine justice if some forcefate maybewere to intervene to stop that from happening jesus barnett said quietly you said a mouthful there i dont say this to many people carson but youre in a desperate situation the big man looked up with dark animal intelligence has something like what you talked about ever happened i mean has the other person justdisappeared rusk nodded slowly barnett opened his mouth to speak again but rusk stopped him with an upraised hand if that idea intrigues you you should never come back to this office again what you should go to the jackson racquet club the day after tomorrow at two pm and ask to take a steam bath i aint a member barnett said awkwardly rusk smiled a tendollar guest fee will get you in but he put his left forefinger to his lips then stood and offered barnett his right hand carson if you want to get a divorce ill be happy to represent you given luvys attitude it could take a year or more to resolve everything but i promise ill do my best for you and as you said you could give her twentyfive million dollars and youd still have a lot of money barnett was opening and closing his mouth like a man in mild shock a guy like you a guy whos made and lost several fortunes money probably doesnt mean the same as it does to a guy like me i aint as young as i used to be barnett said softly thats true rusk smiled time works on us all he rolled his chair back behind his desk barnett was watching him like a man who had thought he was sharing space with a dog then discovered that his roommate was a wolf you take it easy now rusk said dont let her get you down the jackson racquet club barnett murmured whats that rusk said i didnt hear you barnetts eyes flickered with comprehension nothing i was just mumbling thats what i thought the oilman looked at rusk a moment longer then turned to go when he reached the door rusk called after him carson when barnett turned back he looked exhausted i dont think you ought to share this with your future bride and then in the truest moment of their meeting rusk added you never know how things will go down the road barnetts eyes widened then he hurried out of the office chapter chris pedaled past the little theater then turned his trek onto maple street and pumped hard up the long slope toward the natchez cemetery soon he would break out onto the bluff with miles of open space to his left and the pristine cemetery on his right chris had prescribed a lot of antidepressants in his career but he had never experienced depression hed read deeply on the subject and asked the most penetrating questions he could to patients but until today hed had no true inkling of the condition those patients had described to him plaths metaphor of a bell jar seemed strikingly apt he felt as though all the air had been sucked out of his life that he was moving in a vacuum and that his actions whatever he might choose to do would have no meaning or positive consequence in the world tom cage as perceptive as ever had noticed chriss dazed mental state and told him to take the afternoon off since thora had left for the delta before daybreak despite having promised to take ben to school his only remaining obligationbarring evening roundswas to deliver ben to the birthday party at the bowling alley at pm and even that could be handled by mrs johnson with a single phone call after leaving the office chris had driven home suited up and without really intending it had begun a ride from elgin to the mississippi river hed covered fifteen miles in thirtysix minutesa record time for himyet he felt neither tired nor elated he felt like a machine endowed with the capacity for thought yet he did not want to think with a rogue wind blowing out of the west he wanted only to crest the hill and hit the breeze shooting up the face of the twohundredfoot bluff that lined the mississippi river ten seconds after he hit cemetery road the vast river valley opened up on his left he knew then that he would not sidetrack and ride the cemetery as was his habit but rather continue past the shotgun shacks that lined the road beyond the cemetery and ride on to the devils punchbowl the deep defile where notorious outlaws had dumped the bodies of their victims in past centuries he was staring so intently over the endless miles of louisiana cotton fields on his left that he almost slammed into a car that had turned broadside across the road chris braked so hard that he nearly went over the handlebars he was about to start screaming at the driver when she jumped out and started screaming at him he stood with his mouth hanging open the driver was alex morse she looked as though she hadnt slept for days her voice was shockingly hoarse her eyes ringed with black and for the first time since hed met her she appeared to be out of control why havent you been answering my calls she shouted i dont know you dont know because i already know what youre going to say you dont know what im going to say goddamn it something terrible has happened something i couldnt have predicted in a million years chris pedaled up to her open door what one of the husbands that murdered his wife tried to commit suicide last night this took chris aback tried how insulin overdose hes still alive morse nodded in a coma right how did you know i saw that a lot during my residency people try insulin because it offers hope of a painless death more times than not they wind up in a permanent vegetative state was he diabetic yes two injections per day chris looked toward the river could have been an accidental overdose i dont think so but then i dont think it was suicide either he said nothing morse took a couple of steps toward him her eyes boring into his whats wrong with you nothing chris replied why arent you at work didnt feel like working why dont you think it was suicide she studied him as though unsure whether to drop the issue of his mental state the guys name is william braid hes from vicksburg his wife suffered terribly before she died if im right and braid paid for her murder then we have two possibilities one braid was so consumed by guilt that he couldnt stand to live with himself one more day some local gossip supports that scenario but a couple of his close friends say braids ego was so big that he could never kill himself go on it could also be that whoever braid hired to murder his wifeandrew rusk for exampledecided that an unstable guiltridden client was an intolerable liability especially now with me poking around morse looked up and down cemetery road how hard would it be to put braid into a permanent insulin coma childs play compared to giving someone cancer think of the klaus von bülow case same thing morses eyes flashed youre right only in this case theres no family to get pissed off so by putting braid into a coma rather than killing him the attacker greatly reduced the amount of police scrutiny on the case an ancient pickup rumbled by spewing blueblack exhaust from its tailpipe you look terrible chris said why havent you slept i drove to jackson last night to see my mother they had to put her into umc again last night her livers going kidneys too im sorry shes close to the end this time tons of edemashes heavily sedated now chris nodded hed seen it many times its weird morse said put me on a plane and i can sleep from wheelsup to the arrival gate but hospitalsi cant do it she seem to expect him to make conversation but chris didnt know what to say i did sleep in my car for a couple of hours she added sounds risky not really i was in the parking lot of your office i was still asleep when you left he felt a prick of guilt i figured you might come out here she went on ive followed thora when she ran out here look agent morse would you call me alex for gods sake exasperation colored her face darkening the scars around her right eye okay alex ive heard everything youve told me okay ive seen what youve shown me i know what you want me to do ive even thought a bit about the feasibility of inducing cancer in human beings but i didnt feel like listening to any more about it today thats why i didnt answer your calls her expression had changed from exasperation to something like empathy what do you feel like doing riding she turned up her palms fine why not she nodded at an approaching car but we should get off this road where were you going from here he didnt want to mention the devils punchbowl i was going to do some sprints in the cemetery then sit on jewish hill for a while whats jewish hill chris pointed to a thirtyfoot hill topped with marble monuments and a tall flagpole the american flag was shamefully weathered even tattered at the ends of the stripes best place to watch the river go by i cant ride with you today alex said nodding at the empty bike rack attached to her rear bumper could we just take a walk in there i wont even talk if you dont want me to chris looked away could she walk beside him without bringing up her obsession he doubted it and talking to alex morse would certainly drive him deeper into depression yet oddly enough she was the only person who might remotely understand what was eating at him were liable to run into people who know me in there believe it or not a lot of people run in this cemetery alex shrugged if we do tell them im a doctor from out of town you and tom cage are thinking of bringing in a new associate chris smiled for the first time in many hours maybe days then he mounted his bike and pedaled slowly toward the nearest cemetery gate a wroughtiron monster attached to heavy brick pillars the whole cemetery was filled with beautiful ironwork from another age alex drove through the open gate and parked her corolla on the grass chris chained his bike to her rack then led her down one of the narrow lanes that divided the tall and silent stones they walked some distance without speaking penetrating ever deeper into the cemeterys interior like much of old natchez the cemetery had a classical greek feel to it thanks largely to the greek revival architecture favored by anglophile cotton planters before the civil war confederate dead were buried here and also many americans of national reputation but the graves of the common people had always interested chris most look he said pointing toward a dark stone covered with moss whos buried there a little girl who was afraid of the dark she was so afraid that death would be dark that her mother buried her with a glass lid on her coffin little steps lead down to the tomb the mother would go down there every day and read to the dead child from her favorite book my god when was this about a century ago can i see her not anymore they finally had to block it up because of vandals assholes come out here all the time and destroy things i wish i had the time to sit out here for a few nights in a row id kick the shit out of anybody who tried to desecrate this place alex smiled i believe you she took the lead and started up a lane that sloped toward the high ground over the river you said youve given some thought to my cancer theory i thought you werent going to talk about that you opened the conversation chris heard himself chuckle i guess i did he walked on for several yards then said ive been doing a little reading in my oncology texts between patients what have you learned i was right about the complexity of the blood cancers we dont know what causes ninety percent of them we do know that most of them have different causes they can tell that from the changes in various blood cells and by other factors like tumorsuppressor genes cellular growth factors et cetera this is bleedingedge medicine were talking about was i right about radiation as far as you went yes you could definitely cause a whole spectrum of cancers with radiation butchris held up a forefingernot undetectably you fire gamma rays into somebody without a qualified radiation oncologist directing the beam youre going to have severe burns skin rotting off vomiting around the clock even with qualified personnel you get serious side effects from radiation therapy and im talking about minimum doses given to cure people but its possible with enough expertise alex insisted did you come up with any other options chemicals said chris making steadily for jewish hill as i suspected the toxins known to cause cancer are some of the most persistent on the planet you put one nanogram of dioxin into somebody itll be there on the day they die detailed toxicology studies on autopsy would turn up things like that very quickly as for volatile compounds like benzene which you mentioned the second time we met youd have the same problem you have with radiation using enough to reliably kill people would almost certainly cause acute illness so basically as a class chemicals are a less reliable oncogenic murder weapon than radiation but more likely to get you caught i suppose im sorry oncogenic cancercausing chris clarified sorry go on i suppose someone could come up with an untraceable oncogenic poisonthe cia or the army i meanbut in that case youd have almost no practical hope of discovering it alex looked thoughtful but its something to consider i havent been profiling intel or military officers as suspects but maybe thats a realistic option not around here fort detrick maryland is where they keep the germs and toxins you really need to talk to an expert alex and i dont mean a gardenvariety hematologist you need somebody from nih or sloankettering or danafarber chris stopped and watched a half dozen butterflies flitting around a bush bursting with purple flowers one had marks on its wings that looked almost psychedelic rounded spheres of electric blue m d anderson is probably the closest place thats houston right seven hours by car alex held out her hand and one butterfly danced around her extended finger and what do i ask these experts what would you ask them chris started walking again if we dispense with radiation and chemicals in our little hypothetical that leaves only one possibility i know of and its a biggie what is it oncogenic viruses she turned toward him a professor i spoke to last week mentioned viruses but a lot of what he said was over my head do you know anything about retroviruses only that aids is caused by one reverse transcriptase alex looked embarrassed okay some viruses in the herpes family are known to cause cancer and theres at least one retrovirus thats known to be oncogenic if theres one there are probably more there are theoretical models about this stuff but its not my area i was thinking of calling my old hematology professor from medical school peter connolly hes up at sloankettering now hes done groundbreaking work on gene therapy which actually uses viruses to carry magic bullets to tumor sites its one of the newest forms of cancer therapy from jackson mississippi to new york chris laughed again it happens didnt you know that the first heart transplant in the world was done in jackson i thought that was in houston too the jackson transplant was done on a monkey but the technology was the same the difficulty was the same kind of like the first space shot michael debakey and alan shepardmonkeys helped blaze the trail for both of them they had reached jewish hill at last but as they started toward its forward precipice and the immense vista it offered chris glanced at his watch alex i hate to say this but ive got to run bens at a birthday party and with thora gone ive got to pick him up she smiled its okay we can jog back to the car they started trotting downhill but alex clearly didnt intend to squander her remaining time with him ive wondered about someone simply injecting tumor cells from a sick person into a healthy one i saw that done with mice on the discovery channel a little knowledge was a dangerous thing chris reflected they can do that because the mice used for cancer research are either nude mice which means they have no immune systems or because theyre genetic copies of each other clones basically thats like injecting cells from a tumor in my body into my identical twin sure those cells would grow or theyd have a chance to anyway but if i injected cells from my tumor into you your immune system would quickly wipe them out very violently too on the cellular level are you positive even with really aggressive tumors im pretty certain even with what we call undifferentiated tumors those cancer cells began as part of a specific person from their unique dna any other persons immune system is going to recognize that foreign tissue as an alien invader what if you somehow beat down your victims immune system beforehand you mean like with cyclosporine antiorganrejection drugs or corticosteroids alex suggested she had been doing her homework if you compromised someones immune system sufficiently to accept cancer cells from another person theyd be vulnerable to all sorts of opportunistic infections theyd be noticeably sick very ill do the medical records of your victims show strange illnesses before their cancer diagnosis i only have access to the records of two victims but no those records dont show anything like that the corolla was forty yards away chris cut across the grass picking his way between the tombstones if you had the records of every victim you might be able to learn a lot you could really move this thing forward alex stopped beside a black granite stone and looked at him with complete candor i feel so inadequate in this investigation i mean my genetics stops at the high school level mendel and his peas but you speak the language you know the experts we need to talk to alex if i can get hold of the other records will you consider helping me analyze them alex listen to me please chris do you really think youre going to be able to avoid thinking about all this he grabbed her hands and squeezed hard listen to me she nodded almost violently as though aware she had crossed some line im not sure what to do yet he said everything thats happened is swirling around inside me and im trying to come to terms with it im working on it okay in my own way i am going to call my friend at sloankettering tomorrow alex closed her eyes and exhaled with relief thank you but right now i need to pick up ben and i dont want to be late let me give you a ride to your truck where is it he dropped her hands at home home itll take you an hour just to get there a half hour you have to let me take you he walked the rest of the way to the car and she followed i need to be alone alex ive had all i can take for now he unlocked his bike and took it off her rack im going to call in a prescription for you to help you sleep those things dont work for me not even ambien im going to give you ativan it cant not work unless youre already addicted to it if you dont sleep youll still relax is walgreens pharmacy okay thats near your motel sure he climbed onto the trek and held out his hand when alex took it between both of hers he felt her hands shivering promise me youll be careful she implored stay away from the traffic ill be fine i do this all the time now let me go well talk later tonight maybe by tomorrow for sure promise jesus alex bit her bottom lip and looked at the ground when she raised her head the sclera of her eyes were shot with blood im out on the edge here chris you are too only you dont know it he looked back long enough for her to see that he meant what he was going to say i do know she obviously wanted to say more but before she could he kicked his right foot forward and sprinted for the cemetery gate chapter eldon tarver exited from i south and drove his white van deep into the lowrent commercial sprawl of south jackson soon he was lost in an aluminum jungle of small enginerepair shops pipe yards automotiverepair shacks and the few sundry retail shops that had survived the coming of walmart and the other bulk retail outlets his destination was an old bakery building one of the only brick edifices in the entire area built in the s it had once filled the idyllic neighborhood with the rich aroma of baking bread every morning but the bakery like the neighborhood had died a slow death in the late s and a succession of owners had failed to make a go of whatever businesses they installed there dr tarver pulled up to the gate of the high cyclone fence that guarded the parking lot got out and unlocked a heavy chain he had thought someone might remark on the razor wire mounted atop the fence but no one had everyone knew that this area suffered some of the highest crime rates in the united states dr tarver closed the gate behind the van but did not lock it as he was expecting a delivery in this neighborhood he was known not as eldon tarver md but as noel d traver dvm the bakery was ostensibly a dogbreeding facility selling beagles mice and fruit flies to research institutions around the country because dr traver accepted no federal funds he was not subject to many of the oversight regulations that caused other breeding facilities such inconvenience this was a necessity since the dogbreeding operations were merely a cover for what really took place inside the old bakery dr tarver had not chosen the old bakery for its location he had chosen it because beneath the factory floor lay one of the most extensive bomb shelters he had ever seen the owner of the bakery a rightwing zealot named farmer had feared the soviet union as much as he hated it consequently he had constructed an elaborate shelter capable of protecting not only his family from a nuclear attack but also selected members of his workforce while eldon believed that the bomb shelter might well save his life in the next ten or fifteen years his primary reason for purchasing it was as a clandestine primate research facility he unlocked the front door and walked quickly through the large holding area in the front of the building two hundred beagles began barking wildly in their cages dr tarver had grown inured to the racket and indeed was thankful for it as it masked the more curious noises that sometimes emerged from the bowels of the old bakery he had passed into the breeding area and was searching for his adoptive brother when the blare of a horn penetrated the walls of the building cursing he turned on his heel and hurried back outside a refrigerated panel truck with ice cream sundaes painted on its side was rumbling up to the front door dr tarver waved his arm indicating that the truck should drive around to the delivery entrance the truck swerved accordingly and eldon jogged along in the foul wake of its exhaust he was eager to see what the mexicans had brought him this time luis almedovar jumped down from the cab and nodded excitedly to the doctor a heavyset man with a black mustache luis wore an almost perpetual smile but today dr tarver saw anxiety in the taut flesh around his black eyes did you just get here dr tarver asked no no weve been here for hours javier wanted a hamburger how many do you have for me two señor this is what you asked for no yes open the truck again the shadow of anxiety crossed luiss face he unlocked the door at the rear of the truck and dr tarver stepped up onto the bumper the stench hit him in a solid wave that would have incapacitated anyone but a pathologist what the fuck happened he asked luis was wringing his hands in obvious terror the refrigerator señor he broke jesus dr tarver pressed his shirt over his nose and mouth how long ago at matamoros señor dr tarver shook his head in disgust and marched into the truck it was filled with animals of various species with at least a dozen nhps or nonhuman primates locked in cages against the front bulkhead the smell of excrement was almost suffocating in the heat which had probably built to above degrees under the mississippi sun flies had gotten into the truck and their buzzing droned at an intensity that would drive a human mad were one confined in the truck with it walking forward eldon saw that two indianorigin rhesus monkeys had died in their cages that would cost the mexican traders dearly but the loss to his research was what concerned him indianorigin macaques were the best animals for hiv research and he had made good use of them in his own studies but eldons prize cargo lay against the front bulkhead in a single large cage sat two lethargic chimpanzees their eyes gazing up at him with exhausted reproach the cheeks of one chimp were covered with mucosal drainage and the coat of the other had several bald patches that might indicate any number of diseases it was obvious that the chimps had not eaten for days and possibly weeks goddamn idiots he muttered fucking mexican morons he turned in the darkness and roared at the squat shape silhouetted in the door get these cages out of here luis nodded again and again then forced his way past dr tarver in the narrow aisle between the cages you stupid bastard eldon said to luiss back do you know what kind of delay this causes i have to get them back to normal weight before i can run any tests and i cant begin to measure the effects of the stress you put them through stress directly impacts the primates immune system señor if you were delivering a sixtythousanddollar car in your fucking truck youd take care of that wouldnt you sí señor luis grunted as he struggled to lift the cage but these monkeys chimpanzees wheres your retarded partner señor these are vicious animals theyre wild animals luis sí but theyre smart like people smart probably smarter than you are eldon thought they fake you out make you think theyre sleeping or that theyve given in and then dios miothey rip your head off and try to make a break for it wouldnt you do the same if you were being starved sí buti am human javier nearly lost his eye after one of these chimps went at him that eye was hanging out of javiers head i do not lie señor tarver smiled at this image what do you do with these monkeys anyway i make them sick said the doctor señor then i make them well again the work i do here could save your life one day luis its worth losing an eye over luis nodded but it was clear that he questioned this assertion unable to remove the cage on his own luis finally coaxed javier sanchez from the cab of the truck it took a bill from dr tarvers pocket to get javier to enter the trailer but together the two mexicans finally manhandled the cage out of the truck and into the bakery dr tarver resented having to bribe his drivers but after paying apiece for the blackmarket chimps what did a hundred bucks matter he escorted the mexicans outside and sent them on their way no deliveryman had ever penetrated deeper into the bakery than the shipping area just inside the door when eldon walked back in his adoptive brother judah had loaded the cage onto a piano dolly and was moving it toward the lift platform that led to the bomb shelter one of four brothers in the family that had adopted eldon as a boy judah could easily have carried the cage downstairs at fiftyfive he was still as wide and hard as a tree trunk with a shock of black hair and pale eyes beneath his low forehead he had been a willful child until his father decided to break him since then judah had not spoken much but he was devoted to his adoptive brother who had always taken care of him in the outside world which was so unlike the one they had known as children in tennessee as the lift groaned downward eldon instructed judah to delouse and bathe the chimps then sedate them for a complete physical examination judah nodded silently when the lift hit bottom eldon turned the wheel that opened the airlock door and walked into the primate lab no one driving on the surface streets above could have guessed that such a facility existed beneath them an obsessivecompulsive with a cleanliness fetish could happily eat dinner off of any surface in the lab judah cleaned it daily with ritualistic attention to detail sterility was essential when one considered the opportunities for crosscontamination in a lab like this dr robert gallo had learned as much in his aids lab and only two years ago half the nations flu vaccine had to be destroyed because of such a mistake the west wall of the lab held the primate cages luxurious custombuilt affairs designed by dr tarver and welded together by judah at the moment they held four chimpanzees two dozen macaques four marmosets two baboons and a cottontop tamarin all the primates even those suffering from terminal diseases rested in obvious comfort dr tarver provided roundtheclock climate control and music to keep the social animals happy even now mozarts seventh symphony was rising to a crescendo in the background the mouse cagesprefab plastic thingswere stacked against the north wall near the east wall hung breeding bubbles for the fruit flies drosophila melanogaster beneath these stood three stacks of aquariums that seemed to contain nothing but foliage but close inspection would reveal the scaled bodies of some of dr tarvers prize serpents most of the floor space was occupied by massive refrigerators used for storing cell cultures and testing machines built by the beckman coulter company two were newer models of analyzers in the oncology and genetics departments at umc dr tarver had initially tried to carry on his experiments at the medical school under cover of his legitimate work but budget constraints had resulted in a level of oversight that made this impossible on occasion he ferried samples from this lab to the medical school to view them under the biochemistry departments electron microscope but for the most part hed had to construct a virtual mirror of the umc labs right here he could do pcr amplification on the spot and with remote connections to the computers in the commercial pathology lab he operated in north jackson he could use sequence software to do genetic analysis to date he had spent more than million on the facility some of the money had come from his wife an early believer in his talent but after her death hed been forced to find more creative sources of financing like andrew rusk there were other sources happy to provide him with funds of course but all were foreignusually foreign governmentsand dr tarver would have no truck with them not that he wasnt tempted the united states had adopted an almost suicidal policy regarding medical researchnearly as bad as the brits though not quite in britain you couldnt experiment on chimps at all which pretty much guaranteed that britain would not be a player in the pharmaceutical field in future but it was bad enough in america chimpanzees were on the endangered species list but they had been splitlisted by the government which allowed them to be used for medical research still fewer than sixteen hundred chimps were being used for research at any moment in the united states most had been bred domestically at highly regulated breeding centers one of those centers was only miles away at new iberia louisiana but dr tarver couldnt use those animals not for what he was doing wherever those primates went government inspectors would follow your chinese on the other hand didnt give one goddamn how many chimps were left in the wild they would send an army of biologists to strip every tree in africa if they decided it was necessary the animal rights fanatics could go straight to hell for all they cared dr tarver shared this view in his experience the moral convictions of animal rights activists lasted about as long as it took them to get a fatal disease that could be cured by receiving a valve from a pigs heart suddenly that pig didnt seem so goddamned sacred after all your animal rights fanatics werent like jehovahs witnesses who would lie there and die within ten feet of a bag of blood that could save them they were liberal arts pussies raised by summer of love hippies theyd never gone without a lifeessential since the day they were born jehovahs witnesses had been some of the toughest resisters to nazi tyranny eldon knew especially in the death camps he figured the average animal rights activist would have lasted about three days at auschwitz animal experimentation had a long and venerable history aristotle and erasistratus had experimented on live animals and galen had dissected countless pigs and goats in rome edward jenner had used cows to develop the smallpox vaccine and pasteur had cured anthrax by purposefully infecting sheep how the hell anyone expected scientists to cure cancer or aids without using animals to set up testable models was beyond him but dr tarver didnt stop there because the truth was animal models only took you so far when you got into neurological diseases or viral studies it wasnt enough to experiment on a similar metabolism you had to use the real thing and the real thing meant homo sapiens any serious medical researcher could tell you that only most of them wouldnt because research dollars were often controlled by foggyminded liberals who hadnt a clue to what science really was and no one wanted to risk his research budget for something so politically dangerous as the truth the conservatives could be just as bad some of them didnt even believe in evolution it staggered the mind dr tarver walked across the lab and watched judah bathe a sedated chimp it gratified him to see his adoptive brother carefully scrubbing the chimps snotty cheeks after patting judah on the shoulder he walked over to the metal table he used as a desk in here on the right side of the big table lay a stack of thick file folders each folder held a unique compilation of documents and photographs that added up to a persons life each had been delivered to eldon by andrew rusk who had ordered them compiled by various clients over the past two years the files held daily schedules medical histories keys labeled for what they opened which included cars houses offices and even vacation homes lists of important numbers such as social security numbers passport numbers phone numbers pins and credit card numbers and of course there were photographs eldon didnt spend much time looking at the photos until right before an operation he spent most of his time poring over the medical records searching for anything that might negatively affect his research or something that might make someone a candidate for a particular approach dr tarver was as meticulous in this work as he was in all things everyone was in such a hurry everyone wanted it done yesterday everyone believed that his case justified special consideration but that was the twentyfirstcentury man for you no notion of patience or deferred gratification when eldon had faced a similar situation hed handled it himself he was uniquely qualified to do so of course but he had never let unfamiliarity stop him before when a mechanic tried to gouge him on the price of repairing an engine dr tarver had ordered a maintenance manual from the ford company studied it for four days then disassembled the engine repaired it and reassembled it himself in perfect working order this kind of thing was beyond most americans now and because of that the day was coming when conventional war would not be an option against any major power only a special weapon would suffice dr tarver intended to be ready chapter chris was working late in his studio when he sensed that he was not alone hed been running footage on the apple using the familiar routine of reviewing and editing video to occupy his conscious mind while on a deeper level his brain worked out what his next step should be his first thought upon sensing another human presence was that ben had awakened chris saved the file he was working on then walked down the hall toward the back room of the converted barn any other night he would have put ben to bed and then come out to the studio to work alone but fifty yards of darkness separated the studio from the house so tonight hed let the boy fall asleep on the sofa where he and thora had made love two nights ago once ben was dead to the world chris had moved him to an old twin bed in the back room ben he called softly opening the door ben lay stomachdown on the bed fast asleep chris stared for a second then rushed back to the front room and switched off the light after listening carefully for twenty seconds he edged up to the window and drew back the curtain the darkness just outside the studio slowly revealed itself to be empty beyond that lay the black gulf between the studio and the house feeling a little foolish he switched on the light and went back to his workstation he was reaching for the flywheel when a sharp knock sounded at the studio door he had no firearms out here but an aluminum baseball bat was propped beside the door left there after an informal batting practice he jumped up grabbed the bat and went to the door whos there its alex said a recognizably female voice alex morse he yanked open the door alex stood there in the same clothes shed worn in the cemetery that afternoon and she looked still more drawn and confused if that was possible in her hand was a black automatic what the hell are you doing he demanded if id had a gun i might have shot you im sorry for just showing up like this i tried to call i know i said id wait butcan we go inside the published number only rings in the main house alex nodded an exaggerated apology her eyes were still ringed with black shadows can we go in yeah she pushed him backward and closed the door behind them have you slept at all since i saw you last chris asked no i picked up the prescription but i was afraid to take it i had to drive back to jackson to see my mother shes going down fast but she was awake for a little while and she was asking for me he motioned for alex to sit on the sofa opposite his workstation after she did he rolled his chair across the hardwood floor and sat in front of her why are you carrying your gun she set the pistol on the sofa beside her ill tell you in a minute has thora called you tonight oh yeah shes having a great time she and laura had fullbody mud baths this afternoon how long ago did she call i dont know a good while ago ben was awake did she ask if you were in the house or the studio chris leaned back in his chair she wouldnt have to my private phone only rings out here what are you doing here alex i came back from jackson because i knew that once thora left town someone might make a move against you ive been watching your house for the last three hours why and from where i parked across the road in the carport of that house thats for sale did you see anything when i pulled into elgin i passed a vehicle coming out the driver had his brights on but it looked like a van a white van does anybody who lives back in here own a white van he thought about it i dont think so but there are about sixty houses out in these woods even though it looks like wilderness also we get a fair number of strangers out here kids parking or nosy people just trying to check out the houses this didnt mollify alex about fifteen minutes ago another vehicle drove slowly down the road it came around the last curve but instead of going on toward your house it nosed into the drive of the house where i was parked it came far enough up the hill for its lights to illuminate my car then stopped and backed out that sounded like teenagers looking for a place to make out did they see you i dont think so i took cover pretty quickly could you id the vehicle she shook her head when he backed out he didnt turn around he backed all the way around the curve chris saw genuine fear in her bloodshot eyes i know that seems suspicious to you okay but ive seen exactly that kind of thing happen out here at night poachers drive out here to spotlight deer theyll shoot right into your yard and the residents out here will shoot back the poachers know theres only the one road in and out so theyre paranoid as hell alex was watching him carefully youre too tired to think straight he said gently you told me yourself that we have a margin of safety before anybody tries anything remember the first day we met that was before william braid and his insulin coma alex if you want me to i can call the neighborhood watch captain hes got a big john deere that he can pull across the road and block all access in or out really absolutely chris looked at his watch and if it werent so late hed love to do it for us she looked as if she wanted chris to make the call but she said i admit i didnt see the vehicle that second time i dont know if it was a van you said you werent even sure about the first vehicle you passed i know that was a van i just wasnt sure about the color he reached out and squeezed her knee you know what i think what i think that even if some guy drove here to kill me once he saw you parked across the street hed realize the game was up alex didnt look convinced i mean he has to make it look like an accident right thats the deal according to your theory not even an accident but a disease theres no way he can pull that off now she was shaking her head three of the victims didnt die of cancer remember one heart attack one stroke one pulmonary embolism you dont know those were murders and they dont fit in with the other deaths do they i think those deaths show that if the fee is high enough the murderer will take the risk of killing someone quickly her stubbornness was starting to wear on him even if youre right you contacting menot to mention hanging around and ambushing me for the past three dayshas wiped out any chance of someone murdering me for money and making it look like an accident thats just not an option anymore you told me yourself that someone trying to kill me would be watching me tapping my phones that kind of thing if they have any sense at all theyre lying low and hoping youll get tired of chasing them i wont he smiled i know that but tonight you can take a break a short rest im going to fix up a bed for you in the main house and no i dont want to upset ben ben will never see you no argument alex youre going to take an ativan and crash for the next twelve hours all this is going to look different after you wake up i promise he could tell she was considering it if i do that she said i want you and ben in the main house too so i can what he laughed watch us forget it youre going to sleep alex opened her mouth to keep arguing but her cell phone preempted her she checked the lcd and her face darkened who is it chris asked my fathers old partner hes a private detective she opened the phone uncle will alex listened her face growing taut she put her elbow on her knee and cradled her forehead in her hand after a short while she asked some questions about her mothers prognosis then hung up what is it chris asked it sounded like renal failure she nodded the doctors think this is the end she has two or three hours barring a miracle they told me that once before but this time will agrees you cant drive to jackson now not in this state alex stood and put the phone in her pocket then lifted her gun off the sofa i dont have a choice its my mother he stood and took hold of her free hand do you think she would want you to risk your life to be there when shes not even conscious alex looked up at him with determined eyes shed do it to be there for me he saw that there was no arguing the point if i didnt have ben to worry about id drive you myself you dont need to do that but what embarrassment made alex look away for a moment do you have anything that could help me stay awake i hate to ask but im dead on my feet id be glad to prescribe something but all the pharmacies are closed youre kidding nope the last one shuts down at nine pm alex hung her head obviously dreading the coming ordeal wait i think i may have something before i became his doctor ben had been diagnosed with add he was taking ritalin and too much of it i think we still have some in the house i thought ritalin calms you down it has the opposite effect on adults i figured youd know that from handling drug cases i mostly worked the money side in miami forensic accounting although i did go on a few raids chris walked to the door you stay here with ben and ill get the pills she shook her head we all need to go together alex youre about to leave town what does a walk to the house matter you have a gun in the house dont you he nodded she handed him her automatic you know how to use this he hefted the pistol in his hand it was a glock caliber but smaller than the ones hed held in the sporting goods shop yes take it with you bring your gun back with the pills ill watch ben till you get back i will if he wakes up i can handle it go chris closed his eyes long enough to dilate his pupils then walked out into the darkness he felt no fear but even on normal nights he kept his eyes open during this walk there were always deer in the yard not to mention the occasional coyote and hed killed a sixfoot rattlesnake on the patio only last spring he covered the distance to the house in thirty seconds then slipped through the back door and went to the master bedroom he had several rifles in his gun cabinet in the study but his only handgun was a kept locked in a small safe in his closet he retrieved it then pulled down an old box from the top shelf of the closet where he kept old medicines and samples hed brought home from the office sure enough a bottle of ritalin lay at the bottom a drug that ben should probably never have been taking chris slipped the bottle into his pocket shoved alexs gun into his waistband then left the house and jogged back to the studio with his in his right hand take one of these he told alex take another later if you start to fade ill get you some water no need she dryswallowed one of the pills then put the bottle in her pocket youre pretty good at that a wry smile birthcontrol pills ah not that ive needed them lately she looked up suddenly selfconscious too much information not at all you just focus on staying awake she nodded thankfully then took her gun back and went to the door ill talk to you tomorrow okay tonight he said call me when you get to jackson call before that if you cant stay awake i will but ill be all right she lingered for a moment as though she wanted to say more but then she turned and walked away in seconds she was swallowed by the blackness chris stood looking at the lights of the main house wondering if he would ever truly leave it to move to avalon with thora even before alex arrived in natchez the idea had not seemed quite right but now it seemed truly tainted he was thinking of the night hed carried thora over the threshold of this house when he heard an engine start in the distance it revved a couple of times then slowly faded away he breathed in the night smell of spring leaves and sweet olive then turned and went back into the studio chapter alex turned left out of the driveway across from chriss house and headed toward highway it was nearly a mile to the turn with much of the narrow lane threading between high wooded banks thankfully she didnt see a single headlight on the road nor any vehicles parked in the darkness on the few driveways she passed turning north on she soon passed st stephens prep then half a mile farther the days inn she felt an impulse to stop and get her computer but since she already had fresh clothes in the bag from her earlier trip she decided to go on without stopping if her mother died tonight she could use uncle wills computers for any necessary email if by some miracle margaret survived the night then alex would probably be back in natchez by noon tomorrow as she passed the fork where highway veered away toward the mississippi river she realized that a pair of headlights was pacing her from behind her first thought was cop because the car seemed to have come up suddenly then remained at a uniform distance behind he was probably radioing her tag in now but after watching the lights for a while in her rearview mirror alex decided they were too high off the ground for a police cruiser more probably a pickup truck or a van a baptist church with a tall steeple drifted by on her right then the road narrowed to a single laneconstruction where a new stretch of the natchez trace highway intersected highway alex could see the super walmart ahead on her left she accelerated steadily then whipped the corolla across the oncoming lane of traffic and into the walmart lot the vehicle behind kept on at a constant rate of speed as it passed the turn she saw that it was indeed a vana white van covered with patches of mud and primer the drivers window appeared almost black she didnt have the angle to see the license plate but something told her that mud would be covering it she parked thirty yards from the store the nose of the corolla pointed toward the highway what do i do now she wondered she could call the local police complain of harassment and have them stop the vanif they could find itbut she didnt want to do anything that would force her to reveal her fbi credentials if she could avoid it but neither did she want to blindly begin a hundredmile journey to jackson over a mostly deserted highway she needed to know if the van represented a real threat or an overactive imagination the idea that graces killer might be in that van was almost too much to hope for but she cradled her glock in her lap nevertheless occasional cars passed on the highway and two turned into the parking lot but she saw no further sign of the van thats long enough she said aloud she put the car in gear and drove out to the highway but there she turned right instead of left which would carry her away from jackson she hadnt gone more than fifty yards when an approaching vehicle made a uturn between orangeandwhite traffic barriers immediately after passing her she hadnt seen the make but she made a quick right turn anyway which put her on liberty road if memory served correctly this road would take her past a few of the towns premier mansions then into the heart of downtown a set of headlights appeared behind her they sat high enough to be a van she took the first right turn she came to this time into what appeared to be a residential subdivision tract homes that looked as though theyd been built in the s she gunned the motor for five seconds then waited to see if the headlights followed her into the neighborhood they slowed stopped then rolled into the road behind her alex wrenched her wheel left sped up a low incline then took another left into a lane that wound beneath a pitchblack canopy of trees a mansion like something out of a technicolor period piece materialized out of the darkness on her left she could almost see grayclad officers and ladies in hoop skirts strolling across the wide veranda she idled past the broad front steps then accelerated and found herself at another intersection she sensed this was the same road she had been on before looping around the estate at the center of this strange subdivision as she pondered which way to go the high headlights floated toward her from behind sensing that a left turn would carry her back to liberty road she jerked the wheel right and sped around a curve that swept through degrees at the end of the curve she turned left then right and reduced speed again the headlights had fallen farther behind but they were still there there could be no doubt now she drove thirty more yards then on impulse turned into a long driveway beside a onestory ranch house the driveway actually ran past the house which was set far back from the road she shut off her engine and got out moving quickly underneath a carport that held two americanmade sedans shed worried that the occupants of the house might wake up but no lights came on she cycled the slide on her glock and waited the headlights glided up the road then passed the driveway without slowing down alex leaned back against the clapboard wall her pounding heart resonating through the wood was she going crazy her left hand went to the cell phone in her pocket who could she call chris he couldnt leave ben even if he did he wasnt trained for this kind of situation will kilmer was too far away to help christ even if she called she couldnt direct help to her exact position she only knew where she was in general terms in the last ten minutes she had broken half the rules in the fbi book they ought to fire me she whispered her heartbeat slowed steadily and when no headlights appeared stabilized at something like high normal to pass the time she counted the beats per minute seventyfive as she stood there waiting it occurred to her that the driver of the van might only have been insuring that she was out of the way before attacking chris fuck she muttered digging out her cell phone she dialed chriss cell phone and this time thankfully he answered hey you doing okay he asked no listen to me the white van followed me after i left your place im parked in a neighborhood off liberty road and he took off about five minutes ago he couldnt be at your place yet but its possible that he could be headed there are you still in the studio yeah your gun close by in my hand should i call the police it wouldnt hurt you could just say you saw a prowler ive done that before it took fifteen minutes for anybody to show up this is the country not the city make the call now okay ill call you back in a few minutes what are you going to do find the van anybody approaches that studio you shoot to kill alex im hanging up now she was reaching into her pocket for her keys when her threat radar redlined there was no warning no sound nothing tangible to make her freezeyet she had something had changed while she was on the phone her conscious mind had not registered it but deep in her reptilian brain some ancient sensor had been triggered adrenaline was flushing through her as though she had an infinite supply it took all her selfcontrol not to burst into panicked flight a normal person would not have been able to resist the urge but alexs training had set deep she knew that to run was to die her heartrate had doubled thirty yards away the asphalt street was dimly lit by the spill from a distant streetlight the nearby houses had single bulbs on their porches nothing more and there was no moonlight to speak of her world was black and gray she crouched and moved swiftly to the inside corner of the carport sweeping the area with her glock as she moved it took an act of will not to push the doorbell button beside the screen door her ears were attuned to the slightest sound but she heard only the steady thrumming of air conditioners in the humid darkness then it came a percussive skating sound like a stone skipping across cement her pistol flew to the right where the carport opened to the driveway she stared into the blackness like a trapped miner searching for light she stared so hard that she was almost entranced when a leathergloved hand seized her throat before she could react another hand slammed her glock against the carport wall she fought with every fiber of muscle in her body but her struggles had no effect she couldnt even see her attacker his enormous bulk blocked out the light she tried to lunge upward with her right knee but this only revealed the helplessness of her position her assailant had pinned her lower body against the wall she tried to scream but no air could escape her windpipe think what can you do what weapon do you have one free hand she struck again and again where she thought a face should be savage blows yet they had no effect her fist collided with flesh and bone yet her attacker didnt even move to avoid her blows he was choking her to death in seconds she would lose consciousness fear welled up with debilitating force she was stunned to realize that it had no limit it shot up into terror and rocketed free like a missile breaking away from the earths gravity she tried to gouge the invisible eye sockets with her fingernails but the man simply drew back his head putting them out of reach had she heard an appreciative chuckle tears of rage blurred her eyes the already faint image of the distant street began to go black a ringing crash of metal on metal heralded a barrage of canine fury a huge dog had launched itself against the cyclone fence at the end of the driveway the animal was fifteen feet away but his thunderous barking made an attack sound imminent the grip at alexs throat lessened for a moment and the massive thigh pinning her to the wall torqued away with all the strength left in her body she twisted into the attacking shadow and hammered her knee into the apex of faint light at its center testicles crushed beneath her knee and an explosive grunt burst from the shadow the grip at her throat loosened and she screamed with the piercing shriek of a panicked fiveyearold even the dog fell silent but before she could exploit the instant of uncertainty the glove closed around her throat with redoubled force and the hand pinning her arm slid down toward her glock if he gets my gun im dead the hand tried to wrench the pistol from her grasp in desperation she thrust her left hand deep into her pocket dug past her cell phone and jerked out her car keys raising her hand high she stabbed again and again like norman bates in psycho she felt the glock tear loose from her hand but her next blow struck something vitalsomething soft and yielding anywayand a gasp of pain gave her hope praying shed hit an eye she whirled away from the blast of her glock in the same instant the carport light switched on what she saw disoriented her not the face of a man but a huge maroon shape sitting on a massive pair of shoulders a door flew open behind her a man shouted a warning but the glock flashed up to her face with eerie slowness and blotted out the light hey miss hey are you okay alex blinked her eyes open and looked up at the face of a bald man wearing pajamas in his right hand was a pump shotgun in his left her glock her right hand flew to her face there was blood there lots of it for a moment she was back at the federal reserve bank shed fallen on her back then too only the soundtrack had been the automatic weapons and grenades of the hostage rescue team not a southern drawl uttered by a man in pajamas am i hit she asked i heard shots youre not hit said the man with the shotgun that fella fired one shot but when i jammed my twelvegauge through the door he knew hed better not shoot again he slammed this pistol into your head so i aimed my remington center mass he dropped the pistol and took off running did you see his face no maam he was wearing something on his head looked like a tshirt or something he looked like something out of texas chainsaw massacre alex breathed deeply and tried to calm down her dilemma was simple identify herself as an fbi agent or get the hell out of here her instincts told her to haul ass but if her attacker turned out to be graces killer she would have squandered a real opportunity to catch him did you call the police she asked hell yes theyre on their way the station aint but a mile from here as the crow flies what was that guy trying to do to you alex rolled over slowly then got carefully to her feet sir im special agent alex morse of the fbi pajama man took a step back my credentials are in my car maybe i ought to take a look at them as she retrieved her purse a laser show of blue light ricocheted off the faces of the nearby houses then a squad car squealed to a stop in front of the house over here called pajama man in the driveway alex had her creds out when the cops trotted up they were amazed to find an fbi agent at the end of their call the homeowners wife appeared and offered alex a paper towel to wipe the blood from her face which she did with enough theatrical toughness to impress local cops she presented the situation as an attempted rape and practically ordered them to issue an apb for the white van she repeatedly assured them that there was no chance of lifting fingerprints from her glock since her attacker had worn gloves and in answer to their questions informed them that she was staying at the home of dr christopher shepard an old friend from school the last thing she wanted was natchez cops walking into her room at the days inn and discovering what even rookie patrolmen would recognize as the tools and logs of a murder investigation they practically insisted that she go to the emergency room to have her head laceration examined but she protested that chris shepard could sew it up just as well and for free when she promised to be available to answer questions in the morning they were placated after thanking pajama man repeatedly for saving her lifeand leaving her cell number with the copsalex got into her car and drove past a crowd of shocked neighbors wearing nightclothes and back to highway her whole body was shivering delayed stress reaction she thought she pulled to the shoulder and took out her cell phone chris answered after six rings she apologized for bothering him again and thenbefore she could explain what had happenedshe heard a sob escape her throat its the sleep deprivation she thought i havent really slept in weeks where are you chris asked on the side of the road in town i think i need stitches what happened ill tell you in minute i just she touched her face which again was slick with blood can you get to my office uhhuh ill meet you there in ten minutes what about ben ill call mrs johnson and tell her i have a medical emergency shell come alex wiped the blood with her sleeve hes here chris hes here who him the guy who killed grace did he attack you he almost killed me did you see his face he wore a mask take ben to mrs johnsons okay your house isnt safe can you do that yes and bring your gun with you i am if you think youre going to pass out drive to the er at st catherines im all right just hurry alex lay flat on her back squinting up into a surgical light like a bluewhite sun chris had already cleaned her wound now he was stitching beneath her eye with surprising slowness this laceration runs through some existing scar tissue he said i dont know what your plastic surgeon will think about my work but i guess you dont want to broadcast this injury to the world by going to the er exactly why did you dilute the betadine when you cleaned the wound thats a new thing at full strength it kills white blood cells that speed the healing process the first responders microbiologically speaking alex said nothing in less than a minute chris had tied off the last stitch you can get up when you feel like it he said no rush she eased onto an elbow making sure that her inner ear knew which way was up then rose into a sitting position thank you for doing this you have no idea who this guy was no the question is was he after me or you i think thats pretty obvious chris said no theres a good chance he went to elgin to kill you but unexpectedly found me there chris shook his head hes probably been on your tail all day in your sleepdeprived state you wouldnt have noticed a herd of elephants following you alex got to her feet youre still in denial one of us is where to now chris asked youre not still planning to drive to jackson are you i dont know but id like you to do me one favor if you would sure come with me to the days inn to get my computer its not far away and i really need it what about the guy who attacked you i dont think hell be there thats only instinct but i have faith in it chris turned and set his instrument tray in a sink if you promise to stay the night at my house ill go with you when she hesitated he said obviously im not talking about anything improper i know she took out her cell phone and dialed will kilmers cell he answered after two rings after she had explained the situation will practically ordered her to remain in natchez im in the lounge now he said wearily shes not even conscious alex theres no change at all hell margarets just liable to fool the doctors again shes a tough old bird like me alex hung up and turned to chris your house it is lets go the days inns parking lots were silent but well lit most of the vehicles parked there were pickup trucks or bigger rigs alex parked the corolla four doors down from her room then waited for chris to pull up beside her in his pickup he climbed out of his truck with his in his hand i really appreciate this she whispered he laughed softly we used to eat sunday dinner at this hotel sometimes when i was a kid it used to be called the belmont everything changes i guess even small towns yeah but slower i like it that way she took out her room key and handed it to him the rooms one twentyfive right down there id like you to unlock the door and turn the handle but dont go in ill be right behind you and im going in hard if anything crazy happens use your gun to protect yourself not to help me just get away and call the police chris stared at her in disbelief youre kidding right she gave him a deadly earnest look no no southern neanderthal heroics you dont know what youre missing he eased down the side of the building then inserted the key and turned the handle when alex heard the mechanism open she crashed through the door with her glock leveled sweeping it from side to side clear she called moving toward the bathroom halfway there she stopped cold graces cat lay stretched on the carpet its mouth open in a rictus of death alex saw no blood but she knew that meggie was dead she started to kneel but then she heard a sliding sound from behind the bathroom door what the hell chris cried from behind her alex motioned toward the bathroom with her glock then waved chris back after hed knelt behind the far bed she yelled federal agent throw out your weapon and come out with your hands up nothing happened im special agent alex morse of the fbi come out or ill shoot after five seconds of crazed silence she heard the sliding sound again in her mind she saw a shower curtain sliding along the side of a bathtub maybe the waters on chris said alex cursed to herself then charged forward and kicked open the bathroom door ready to blast a hole in anybody she found there she saw no one the sliding sound came again she looked down then leaped backward in terror a brilliantly colored snake was writhing on the floor beneath the commode its head biting empty air its body twisting wildly through figure eights and whipping back upon itself as though it had been run over by a car chris she hissed he jerked her out of the doorway and thrust himself in front of her what is that she asked its a goddamn coral snake the deadliest snake in the us are you sure positive see the red bands touching the yellow ones they teach you a rhyme in the boy scouts red over yellow kill a fellow red over black venom lack alex shuddered is that what killed meggie has to be the scary thing is nobody would go to that trouble to kill your cat that snake was put here for you even in its current distress the snake had an almost hypnotic beauty whats wrong with it id say meggie gave as good as she got cats are good snake hunters but it still killed her coral snakes arent like rattlers or moccasins they carry neurotoxic venom like cobras they have short fangs but one good bite to an animal as small as a cat and its lights out chris grabbed a pillow off the near bed and blocked the open door with it then he went out to his truck and came back carrying a tall white bucket filled with baseballs what are you going to do with those alex asked stone it to death he held up the bucket with both hands then leaned over the pillow and smashed the buckets bottom down onto the snake with all his strength he ground the wounded reptile against the tile floor then lifted the bucket and slammed it down again the next time he lifted it the snake came up with it stuck to its bottom like a bug on a windshield is it dead alex asked dead is a subjective state with a snake their nervous systems continue to function after death people have died after being bitten by a dead rattlesnake what about this one chris examined the halfexploded serpent on the bottom of the bucket dead as a hammer he carried the bucket outside and tossed it into his truck bed alex heard baseballs roll everywhere while she gathered up her computer and her case materials chris loaded meggies remains into a trash bag ill take a look at her when we get back he said see if i can find any bite marks youre sure i wont cause a problem with ben hes at mrs johnsons house lets get out of here alex started to get into her car then paused is the coral snake native to mississippi i mean i grew up here but i dont remember any theyre native to mississippi all right but not this part of mississippi youd have to drive two hours to reach coral snake territory and you could still search for a week and never find one theyre very shy so theres no way it could have simply wandered no way in hell somebody put that snake in your room and that answers your question once and for all what question the guy who attacked you in that carport came here for you not me chapter eldon tarver nosed his white van through a thicket of bushes blocking the rutted track this was the fourth route he had tried and this time he felt lucky reaching the river wasnt difficult every fifty yards or so dirt tracks led from the gravel road to the broad sandbar bordering the mississippi south of natchez the problem was that at the end of those tracks the sand was soft and the river shallow dr tarver needed a shoulder of land that would bear the vans weight right up to the rivers edge then a good ten feet of water in which to sink it the rivers powerful current would do the rest rolling the van downstream with a force guaranteed to make it disappear by morning but if he stuck it in the sand it would still be standing there in the morning for any redneck or jig with a johnboat to see as they sped past in search of catfish and gar dr tarver had known better than to run for jackson agent morse could easily have ordered roadblocks on the main routes leading out of town for this reason hed driven back roads all the way from the subdivision where hed fought her to the asphalt road that ran past the colossal husk of the old international paper mill a vast soybean field marked the place where pavement turned to gravel the gravel paralleled the river it it led to a string of oil wells and a federal game reserve south of town eldon had learned all this from studying topographical mapsone small part of the intensive preparation he put into every operation experience had taught him that preparedness was the key to survival and he never let himself down in that regard in the back of the van was a tangible symbol of the doctors readiness for every eventuality a honda motorcycle designed for both street and offroad riding eldon had carried the honda with him on every operation hed undertaken for the past five years and tonight every drop of sweat he had ever put into loading and unloading that bike would prove worth it the vans headlights refracted off a thousand leaves as branches stretched then snapped back into position with a scream along the vans sides he had always viewed the van as disposable he had another exactly like it except for the color safely garaged at his primate lab in jackson suddenly the twin beams shot out into unobstructed space a pure blackness that changed to dark blue when he extinguished his lights as he stared into the night sky tiny red lights on the massive towers that held telephone cables suspended across the river announced themselves lower downmuch lower and to his right about a mile distanthe saw the lights of a barge churning toward him if he stayed where he was it would soon pass him he shut off his engine climbed out of the van and walked slowly forward his eyes never leaving the sandy earth beneath his feet he had a sense that he was above the river but how far above he could not tell an armadillo bolted from beneath his feet he watched the moonlight on its armored back until the creature vanished into waisthigh grass starting forward again only ten steps carried him to a cliff twenty feet below swirled the dark waters of the mississippi river he pulled off his bloodsoaked shirt and tossed it into the current the woman had stabbed him well and truly in the throat but with a blunt weapon probably a key had she used a knife he would already be dead as it was his beard was matted with blood he jogged back to the van opened its rear doors and mounted the aluminum ramp he used to unload the motorcycle with all the caution due the darkness he rolled the honda to the ground and set its kickstand then unloaded a small igloo ice chest and duffel bag from behind the passenger seat apart from these three things the van was empty he had driven all the way from jackson with work gloves on his hands a ziploc bag over his beard and a plastic shower cap over his scalp he kickstarted the honda to be sure he would not be stranded then climbed into the van put it into low gear and drove slowly toward the cliffs edge fifteen feet from the precipice he leaped from the open door and rolled paratrooperstyle on the sandy ground he heard a splash like a breaching whale crashing into the sea running to the cliffs edge he stared down at the absurd spectacle of a chevy van floating like a royal barge down the mississippi river the vans nose collided with a little spit of land which started the vehicle spinning in slow circles as it sank drifting southward toward baton rouge and new orleans had not the circumstances been so dire eldon would have laughed but laughter would have to wait a thousand troubling thoughts fought for supremacy in his mind he would allow none free rein until he reached a place of sanctuary part of him wanted to remain in natchez to finish the work hed started but in that matter time was on his side he had more important problems to deal with andrew rusk for example rusk had lied to him eldon couldnt be sure about the extent of rusks deception but he was certain of the lie this angered him more than almost anything rusk could have done eldon shut out the images of revenge welling up inside and focused on survival he had always known a day like this would come now that it had he was ready sanctuary was less than forty miles away there he could rest regroup and plan his response he strapped the igloo and the duffel bag to the honda all he needed to reach that sanctuary was a cool head and steady nerves as he climbed onto the bike and kicked it into gear a rush of confidence flooded through him he was already there chapter chris pulled his pickup into the doctors section of the st catherines hospital lot and parked before going inside he ran a cable lock through the pitching machine and generator he carried for bens baseball practices there had been a time in natchez when he would not have had to take such measures but that time was gone he made his rounds as conscientiously as he could but the events of last night would not leave him after saying goodbye to his last patient on the medicine floor he took the stairs down to the first floor heading for the icu there he met michael kaufman thoras obgyn coming up two days ago chris had sent some of thoras blood to kaufman for analysis to check for hormone imbalances that might be affecting her fertility im glad i ran into you mike said pausing on the stairs i found something strange in thoras sample really what a high level of progesterone what kaufman nodded shes still trying to get pregnant right of course what kind of level are we talking about contraceptive level more like morningafter pill chris felt blood rising into his cheeks mike kaufman had probably just committed an ethical breach and he seemed to be realizing it himself more than this they had both become aware that chriss wife was not being honest with him about a very important matter kaufman gave him an embarrassed nod then continued up the stairs chris walked slowly down toward the intensive care unit hardly aware of his surroundings the implications of kaufmans revelation did not bear thinking about was it possible that thoras whole seduction of him in the studioher talk about trying to get pregnanthad been a charade a coldblooded act designed to cover up an affair and god knew what else when chris saw the big doors of the icu before him they seemed to offer escape from the burgeoning hell in his mind the cooler air the hum and beeping of machinery and the soft voices of nurses gave him a momentary respite from himself here he had no choice but to concentrate on work he had a resistant bilateral pneumonia in the unit that had failed to respond to two powerful antibiotics a teenager from st stephens last night during evening rounds chris had ordered a vancomycin drip if the boys condition had not improved he intended to punt the case up to jackson to an infectiousdisease specialist he knew at umc when he looked toward the glasswalled cubicles the first thing he saw was tom cage coming out of one of the rooms tom i didnt know you had anybody in the unit i dont dr cage replied writing on a chart i was seeing the patient don allen consulted me about i wanted to take a more detailed history than the one i found in his record you learn anything interesting im not sure something is telling me that this guy might have generalized scleroderma even though the lab tests dont show it you often see almost no external signs in men and this guys blood pressure is truly malignant nothing will hold it in check if it is internal scleroderma what can you do about the hypertension when the whitehaired physicians eyes rose from the chart chris saw a look that dr cage would never show a patient helplessness mingled with frustration rage and resignation chris nodded sadly oh i looked in on your pneumonia tom said his white count dropped significantly during the night ill be damned chris said excitedly i was really starting to worry the kids only seventeen tom sighed in commiseration im seeing more and more of these atypical pneumonias particularly in young adults are you done with your rounds yeah im headed over to the clinic im right behind you chris walked into his patients cubicle but he didnt need to see the chart to notice the change there was a brightness in the boys eyes that had not been there for at least a week and his flesh had already lost its deathlike pallor when chris listened to his chest with a stethoscope he heard marked improvement especially in the left lung chris was laughing at a joke the boy had made about nurses and bedpans when he caught sight of shane lansing writing in a chart at the nurses counter outside lansing was looking at the chart as he wrote but chris had a strong feeling that the surgeon had been staring at him until the instant he looked up mike kaufmans words replayed in his mind morelike morningafter pill was lansing thinking about a patient or was he thinking about thora chris felt some relief at finding the surgeon in natchez this early in the morning greenwood was over four hours away and it was damned unlikely that lansing would commute eight hours every day to screw thora at the alluvian hotel he would have to have left her at am to be here now still chris felt an irrational urge to walk out to the nurses station and punch the surgeons lights out he told his patient hed be back to check his progress after lunch then updated the chart and walked out to the counter morning chris said lansing you think any more about that golf game i cant do it this afternoon chris searched lansings eyes for signs of fatigue but maybe i can get away tomorrow just give me a call or leave a message with my service you can get away in the afternoons yeah its my mornings that suck thats why you make the big bucks lansing didnt reply chris watched the handsome surgeon scan another chart then turned on his heel and walked out of the icu as he trudged aimlessly down the hall he almost walked into jay mercier natchezs sole hematologist like the other smalltown specialists who found themselves treating everything from poison ivy to gout mercier served as a generalpurpose oncologist diagnosing almost every neoplasm in the county then either treating them himself or acting as the contact person for specialized care in large metropolitan centers he was one of the busiest doctors in town yet chris had always found him generous with his time especially with consultations chris thought of pulling him aside and asking about the possibility of intentionally inducing cancer in human beings but if he did mercier was certain to pepper him with questions about such an offthewall scenario morning chris mercier said with a smile hows that resistant pneumonia coming i think the vancomycins going to do the trick good that kid was looking shaky they had slowed enough to stop for a fuller conversation but chris forced himself to continue down the corridor once he rounded the corner the exit was only a short walk away but without quite knowing why he stopped and leaned against the wall like a man taking a smoke break less than a minute later he had his answer when shane lansing rounded the corner chris stepped directly in front of him blocking his path the surgeon looked surprised but not afraid you reconsider that golf game chris looked hard into lansings eyes are you fucking my wife shane lansing blinked but he betrayed no deep emotion hell no what are you talking about chris stared without speaking for a few moments i think youre lying lansings eyes narrowed he started to speak then he closed his mouth and tried to sidestep chris chris caught him by the arm and slammed him against the wall dont walk away from me you son of a bitch lansing looked stunned probably more by the directness of the confrontation than the physical attack youve lost your fucking mind shepard ill bet youve been through a lot of these scenes havent you a ladies man like you well guess what this time youre not going to skate if this were junior high school id just whip your ass and let it go but theres a kid at stake in this and i know enough about you to know you dont really give a shit about thora oh you like fucking her im sure you like knowing she wants you but the whole package doesnt interest you does it lansings eyes continued to betray nothing but then in the crackling silence chris saw a chink in his armor it was smugness lansing could not conceal the superiority he felta secret superiority undoubtedly based on his intimate knowledge of chriss wifeher body her emotions her intentions and then a far more frightening scenario entered chriss mind or does it he said its the money you always did love money and thoras got enough to make your mouth water doesnt she lansing had abandoned all pretense at innocenceor so it seemed to chris he was saying something but chris didnt hear his reptilian brain was reacting to the fist he felt rising from the surgeons waist chris was no boxer but he had wrestled for three years during high school he threw himself backward with the momentum of lansings punch then grabbed the extended wrist and hurled the surgeon bodily over him smacking him to the floor lansings breath exploded from his lungs chris flipped him onto his stomach shoved a knee into his back and wrenched one arm behind his back as lansing yelped in pain two nurses rounded the corner and stopped gaping move on chris shouted leave they scurried down the hall but never took their eyes off the scene chris put his mouth against lansings ear a friend of mine almost got killed last night you may know that or you may not but remember this youre not the only one involved here theres ben your kids your wife thora and theres me most of those people cant defend themselves but i can he twisted lansings right arm until the surgeon screamed you do something to hurt ben and itll be a year before you operate on anybody again do you hear me shane lansing grunted i thought so now if youre innocent you just call the police and press charges against me ill be waiting at my office chris heard a buzz of voices approaching from around the corner he got to his feet and walked through the glass exit doors then trotted to his pickup as he drove out of the parking lot he saw the hospital administrator standing outside the door staring after him when chris reached the clinic he told holly not to disturb him then walked into his private office buzzed the front desk and asked jane to get dr peter connolly of the sloankettering cancer center in new york on the telephone pete connolly had risen high in the world of oncology but six years ago he had been a professor of hematology at the university medical center in jackson mississippi then sloankettering had tapped him to head a new clinical research unit focusing on simultaneous organ and bone marrow transplantation during his stint in jackson connolly had started umc on the road to gaining the designation of national cancer instituteof which only eight existed in the united states jane buzzed chriss phone and he picked up the receiver yes im on the phone with his nurse dr connolly is teaching some residents how to harvest bone marrow right now but hell try to get back with you before lunch thanks chris said trying not to feel disappointed you couldnt expect to call what was arguably the best cancer center in the nation and get one of their top researchers on the phone without a wait tell her i appreciate the quick response she can give you his voice mail if you want to leave a message okay yeah hang on after a couple of clicks he heard a digital voice say please leave a message peter this is chris shepard calling from mississippi ive got a pretty strange question so im just going to lay it out and give you time to think about it i want to know if it would be possible to purposefully induce cancer in a human being in such a way that a pathologist wouldnt detect that it had been done im talking about blood cancers and an eighteenmonth time frame from diagnosis to death i know this sounds crazy but we dealt with some pretty crazy stuff back at umc i know youre busy but id really appreciate it if you could get back to me when you get a chance chris hung up and buzzed jane when connolly calls back dont make him wait get me out of a room no matter what im doing i will unless im doing a pelvic i know thanks chris took a deep breath walled off the paranoid fears writhing in his brain and walked out to face the days patients alex jerked erect in bed with her glock in her hand and her eyes wideopen blue light streamed through a crack in the drapes on her right it took her several seconds to remember where she was a guest room in chris shepards house there was a desk against one wall stacked with household bills and papers it looked like the kind of desk housewives used to handle daytoday business as alex stared at the desk her cell phone began to ring inside her purse it had been ringing before she realized that was what had awakened her what frightened her was that her private cell phonethe one she used to run her murder investigationwas lying silent on the bedside table the phone in her purse was her official phone oh god memories of last nights attack flashed through her mind she had given her real name to the natchez police shed had no choice as she stared at the words unknown caller in the message window she felt an impulse to answer the phone but at the last moment she followed her standard procedure for the past month which was to use her voice mail as a screening device her official phone could only mean bad news the caller might be any number of field agents or it might be her sac in charlotte who was supposed to be on vacation in the bahamas after waiting a full minute she dialed voice mail to find out who was looking for her agent morse began a familiar voice with a priggish boston brahmin accent this is associate deputy director mark dodson in washington alexs chest tightened until breathing was difficult im calling to inform you that we have dispatched a bureau plane to bring you back to washington for an interview with the office of professional responsibility her blood pressure went into free fall jet is bound for jackson mississippi if you are anywhere other than jackson you should call me back immediately so that i can reroute the plane to wherever you are do not delay agent morse you will only make matters worse for yourself she heard a click and dodson was gone when the voicemail program offered her a chance to delete the message she did so she would not put herself through the hell of listening again to a mortal enemy in his moment of triumph the office of professional responsibility damn it she cried climbing off the bed and pulling on yesterdays pants if they were sending a jet for her they must know everything the extra sick leave she had taken the fake reports she had filed the classmate covering for her in charlottethey probably even knew about last nights attack in the carport by now that was probably what had started the collapse of her whole house of cards and all for nothing every white van checked by the police last night had been legally registered to a legitimate citizen stupid stupid stupid she cursed fighting back tears alex dialed the main switchboard of the puzzle palace in washington better known as the j edgar hoover building of course she thought wryly theres always the chance that theyve sent the plane to carry me to afghanistan to negotiate the surrender of osama bin laden or something equally as important possiblebut unlikely she asked the alltoochipper switchboard operator to connect her to associate deputy director dodsons office when she gave her name she was immediately put through special agent morse said dodson yes sir where are you at this moment natchez mississippi there was a longish pause i see they have an airport there that can take a lear i believe they do sir you will be at that airport in thirty minutes packed and ready to go yes sir may i ask why sir you may not yes sir thats all sir alex said but dodson had already hung up she looked around the empty guest room last night with chris shepard in it the bedroom had seemed a warm and human place now it was just another hollow shell she walked into the bathroom to clean up as best she could when she closed the door and sat on the toilet she found herself facing an elevenbysixteeninch color portrait of thora shepard thora stared back at her with the cool indifference of a magazine modelstared right through her reallywith perfect blond hair framing the high cheekbones sculpted nose and seagray eyes that had ensnared chris shepard as surely as they had red simmons before him though alex had never spoken a word to thora she had always felt that they were adversaries like two agents on opposite sides of the berlin wall playing a distant game of cat and mouse but now she realized that this was a ludicrous fantasy the cool visage before her belonged to a woman who had already won whatever game she was playing while alex was about to be flown back to washington for what amounted to professional execution neville byrd delicately adjusted the joystick in his lap shifting the laser on the roof five millimeters to the right then he donned his goggles to check the line of the beam hello this time hed done it the green beam terminated precisely at the center of the northeast corner window on the sixteenth floor of the amsouth bank tower from this moment forwardthanks to the laser and the fourthgeneration optical scope sighted along the same trackevery word spoken and every keystroke typed on the keyboard inside the office of andrew rusk would be recorded on the instruments racked in the flight case behind neville byrd neville took a slug of vault and leaned against the window of his hotel room which was separated from the amsouth tower by only a single city street he was here at the behest of noel d traver a wellspoken man of about sixty with a horrible purple birthmark on his face dr traver had given neville very simple instructions then offered double his usual rates to accomplish them this had made neville byrd a happy man hightech security work wasnt exactly a growth business in mississippi for the last few years byrd had worked for divorce lawyers and private detectives hacking into email accounts and eavesdropping on the cell phones of people committing adultery a long fall from the days when he worked for netscape just ten years ago he had been part of the forefront of the battle against mighty microsoft now ceo jim barksdale was a philanthropist and netscape was only a shadow of its former selfmuch like its former software engineer but this job was different andy rusk was one of the top five divorce lawyers in the city and he had actually hired neville on several occasions in nevilles notsohumble opinion rusk was just another aging ole miss frat boy with too much money and more ego than was good for him right now he was blabbing on the phone to some guy about a crosscountry motorcycle trip he was organizingon harleys of course hawgs manbut rented ones rented harleys that pretty much said it all neville took another slug of vault and giggled unlike andy rusk dr traver seemed like a decent guy and he was certainly a hell of a lot smarter than rusk and his ilk neville knew traver was a veterinarian because he had looked him up on the internet a breed apart noel d traver dvm proprietor dr traver knew about a lot more than animals too he had known exactly what kind of gear it would take to carry out the surveillance on rusks office and he wouldnt have hired anyone who didnt own it dr traver had not hired neville blind either hed asked him to drive down to the byram exit on i south for a facetoface neville hadnt minded hed met people in lots worse places in the five years since hed hung out his digital security shingle over a frescata club sandwich from wendys neville had assured dr traver that he would be able to hack into rusks office network no problem dr traver had been skeptical and so far his skepticism had proved justified whoever had beefed up rusks security had done all right but the laser rig would nail him in the end not only would it pick up all of rusks conversations by measuring the vibration of the window glass but it would also track which keys were depressed on rusks computer keyboardand in which orderby measuring changes in the electromagnetic field of the office the optical scope alone could make out about twothirds of rusks keyboard and monitor which meant that much of what was typed would also be recorded onto digital video the tough part of this job had been the installation the marriott hotel was the only building with lineofsight access to rusks sixteenthfloor window and even the marriott lacked windows facing the amsouth tower to solve this problem neville had built a custom rig at homesort of a plastic doghouse for the laser and optical scopethen installed it on the roof of the marriott then hed checked into a room on the top floor and set up his wireless monitoring station so far its highestvalue data transfer had been stunning views of rusks secretarys tits the lawyer must have listed russ meyer tits as the prime qualification for the job because his secretary had them in spades she had killer calves too neville wondered if maybe dr traver was married to rusks secretary but she was no more than thirtyand hotwhile dr traver was close to sixty and had that ugly mess of a birthmark on his face neville sipped his vault and watched rusk pick his nose as he jabbered on the phone maybe travers loaded he said that must be it neville waited for the secretary to reappear confident that he would know everything there was to know about andy rusk his secretary and the old vet before the week was out that was the main kick in this work the feeling of omnipotence a lot of game designers talked about the same thing but that was only hackers fantasy this job wasnt animated chicks with comicbook bustlines this was real life real people and if you were good you got to peek into their private lives their bedrooms wherever you wanted if you were really good sometimes you got to peer inside their heads that was the kick man chapter alex stood on the edge of the little concrete apron at the natchez airport and watched a lear make a perfect landing across her field of vision she was only a couple of miles from the natchez trace where she and chris had stood on the bridge overlooking the creek that seemed a week ago already as the jet began its taxi toward the spot where she was standing she took out her official cell phone and tried chris again her private phone had died during the night while she slept an ativaninduced slumber in chriss guest room to her surprise chris answered her call alex yes i are you still at my house no im at the airport im about to board a jet for washington what theyre onto me chris my investigation everything they called this morning he was silent for a bit im sorry i may be in some trouble myself why i saw shane lansing in the icu this morning and i confronted him alex closed her eyes in disappointment dr shepard was turning out to be a poor choice for setting a trap he didnt have the devious personality required what did you say to him i asked if he was fucking my wife oh god he tried to take a swing at me so i took him down took him down is he hurt maybe but no cops have showed up to arrest me yet i doubt they will i hope i didnt screw you up too bad your investigation i mean dont worry about it just try not to do anything else okay the lear was steadily approaching i dont have long i just wanted you to know that you might not see me for a while how bad could this be washington i mean her laugh had a touch of hysteria bad remember my screwup at the bank when i got shot yes i went back into the bank because i thought i was right but a deputy director ordered the hrt in on top of me right i remember thats who called me today his name is dodson and the thing isi turned out to be right that day the bank robber wasnt a terrorist he was a disaffected employee i made a terrible procedural mistake that day but when the truth came out my instinct was proved correct i was right and dodson was wrong and hes never forgiven me for that hes been after me ever since and today is payback the approaching jet swallowed almost all sound in the whine of its turbines what alex yelled i said i put in a call to my friend at sloankettering chris repeated ill let you know what he says look somebody up there has to know they need you focus on that ive got to go bye chriss reply if he made one was lost in the roar alex hit end set the phone to silent and slid it into her pocket as the lear stopped and its side door opened a stereotypical fbi agent walked down the little stair blue suit dark sunglasses even with his jacket cut a little full she could make out the butt of his weapon beneath the cloth under his left arm special agent alex morse he called im alex morse as the cleancut blond agent drew closer alex suspected that he was part of one of the most exclusive agent cliques in the bureau the mormon mafia special agent gray williams he said williams did not offer his hand are you carrying a weapon agent morse yes alex was afraid he would order her to surrender her sidearm do you have any other bags nope she bent to lift her softsided suitcase lets get aboard then williamss tone indicated extreme reluctance to talk to hera sure sign that she was known to be an official leper she tossed her suitcase through the hatch then climbed in after it bent low and took a forwardfacing seat she expected williams to take the seat facing her but he sat two seats behind her alex could hear him talking softly on his cell phone confirming that she was aboard and soon to be bound for washington after gripping the armrests for takeoff she took out her private phone plugged it into an outlet beside her seat and checked her voice mail a ragged male voice came through the ether alex this is uncle will she clicked the volume down to minimum level using the side button your moms the same as she was last night alive and not quite kicking you did the right thing getting some rest im calling because i got a report from my guy at the alluvian hotel he couldnt find out which floor thora shepard was staying on but his wife talked to her in the wet area a couple of times thoras girlfriend was with her and everything seemed legit but around five thirty this morning my guys wife happened to look out her window which overlooks the main courtyard that leads to the back parking lot she saw a guy carrying a small suitcase out to the lot he was in a big hurry it was fast and in poor light but she thinks it could have been dr lansing she couldnt be positive said shes sixty percent sure im going to check out the possibility that lansing could be commuting back and forth to get his poontang from mrs shepard you call me as soon as the line had not gone dead voice mail had cut will off before he finished his message there were no more messages alex wondered if a few hours in bed with thora was worth commuting four hours both ways most men she knew would undoubtedly say yes she saw no point in calling chris to pass on an inconclusive report but she was likely to have real evidence soon if chris had attacked dr lansing based on suspicion what would he do if will provided the kind of graphic evidence that he frequently obtained in his business alex had not expected a violent reaction from chris yet he was a southerner and in matters of this kind direct action was the rule among them rather than the exception she sat back in her seat summoned by the roar of the engines and the shuddering airframe a hundred memories assailed her how many times had she been rushed to a jet like this one and ferried to some strange city where a man with a gun held innocent people under his power being the person that the bureau counted on in those situations had engendered its own sense of power within alex and she had justified their faith time and time again the faith of her tribe but now she had broken that faith at least in their eyestheir being an allinclusive euphemism for the quasimilitary superpatriotic culture known to outsiders as the fbi it had destroyed a part of her to break that faith to forge daily reports to ask fellow agents to cover for unauthorized absences what would it do to her to be expelled from the bureau altogether she felt hollow and afraid like someone about to be driven out of her village and forced alone into the bush but there was a higher duty than that owed ones tribethe obligation to ones family to blood and no matter what it cost she would not break faith with them after her mother died alex would be the only morse left save jamie fennell like alex jamie had no one else why couldnt the bureau understand that fed up with being passive alex took out her cell phone and clicked into textmessaging mode if she had to sweat out the next twentyfour hours she wasnt going to do it alone andrew rusk was surfing an internet porn site and thinking about calling janice into his office for some personal attention when his cell phone emitted the brief chirp that signaled an incoming text message he looked away from the ménage à trois on his screentwo girls on a guy his fantasy since high schooland pressed read on his cell phone his heart began to race as he saw the words outlined in blue youre going to pay for what you did i dont care how long it takes youre going to ride the needle andy for grace fennell for mrs braid for all the others i dont care what happens to me nothing will stop me nothing rusk stared at the message with a sense of unreality the letters seemed to shimmer before his eyes like blurry waves of heat over desert sand he checked the source of the message but no number showed up it didnt matter he knew who had sent it his first instinct was to get up and tape two squares of reynolds wrap to his northeast window but his good sense stopped him for one thing dr tarver might not see the foil until the end of the day for another tarver was already upset enough about alex morse this new development would only add fuel to the fire and the hotter that fire got the less rusks life was worth what the hell is she doing he thought aloud why would she send this shes trying to provoke me its like throwing a rock into a thicket to try to make your prey move into your sights that means somebodys watching to see which way i jump waiting for me to lead them somewhere just stay cool he murmured stay cool rusk toyed with the idea of sending dr tarver one of their viagra spam messages tarver would likely receive this within the hour and it would prompt him to head for the country club where rusk normally dropped off the operational packets annandale was exclusive enough that he could even risk a conversation with tarver there but he could not know how the doctor would react he needed to think before he did anything if alex morse was working with the full backing of the fbi the usual drop point would afford no protection whatsoever stay cool he said again then in a much lower voice he said do you have the patience to do nothing rusk was no scholar but he had read the tao te ching during collegemostly to please an english major he was screwingand that line had stuck with him the best time to do nothing of course was when your adversary was about to make a big mistakeor had already made one but alex morse hadnt made any recent mistakes that he knew about that i know about he said thoughtfully he picked up the phone and dialed the number of a detective agency he sometimes used they were expensive but they boasted several former government agents among their operatives some had been irs agents others had worked for the dea or batf while a highly paid few were former special agents of the fbi its time to find out what agent alex has really been up to he said chris was in an examining room checking a prostate gland when jane called him out to take dr connollys call he ripped off the glove hurried to his office and picked up the phone pete its chris shepard hey boy whats it been seven years more the last i heard you were playing albert schweitzer in the mississippi delta just a phase i know better hows your wife pete annas good and my daughters starting at uva med next fall god is she that old no im that old now whats all this about giving people cancer on purpose that was a pretty strange message you left me have you switched from making documentaries to horror movies or did somebody get murdered down there to tell you the truth petei cant talk about it there was a long pause then connolly said okay well i did some thinking about it during what passed for my lunch you ready shoot as for chemical agents multiple myeloma can be caused by a spectrum of carcinogens herbicides are particularly damaging but youre talking about a twentyyear incubation period before the cancer hits toxins could work much faster but virtually all are detectable using gas chromatography and a mass spectrometer the csi guys would bust you in a hurry on tv they would im finding out that the real world is different what the heck are you into chris no ones going to be mixing this stuff up in his kitchen sink not even in an average university lab i hope youre right chris replied ignoring the question radiation is another obvious choice connolly went on theres no doubt you could induce leukemia with it but could you do it undetectably not easily but it might be possible chris felt a strange thrumming in his chest xrays would probably cause all sorts of side effects both local and systemic so forget that radiotherapy pellets would probably cause burns skin tumors maybe nausea early on although there are some alpha emitters whose effects arent doserelated at all even the smallest exposure is oncogenic really chris grabbed a pen and scrawled this on a notepad it would take a real specialist to know that kind of thing of course the most interesting radiation option isnt pellets though what is it against some tumors we use irradiated liquids that have very short halflives im talking twentyfour to fortyeight hours chris felt a chill of foreboding take thyroid cancer we put radioactive iodine into the bloodstream the iodine collects in the thyroid kills the cancer cells then is harmlessly excreted from the body a sociopathic radiation oncologist could probably figure a way to induce cancer like that without leaving any measurable trace chris wrote rapidly his time with connolly would be limited go on i know about an actual case where somebody used irradiated thallium to attempt an assassination in africa the radiation broke the thallium into microparticles that dispersed throughout the body the victim nearly died but at the last minute they shipped him here our best doctors treated him for over a week he ultimately survived but anywhere else in the world he would have died and i seriously doubt whether anyone else could have traced the cause of death i had no idea ive been going through my oncology books and i havent found anything like that not everything is in the books doc you know that but listen if i really wanted to give someone cancer with zero risk of being caught id explore one of two avenues the first is viruses ive considered that myself but i dont even know enough to be dangerous youd have to be willing to wait a while for your victim to die chris nodded to himself up to a point time isnt a factor in these cases well then you know that htlv has been implicated in at least one form of leukemia the kaposis sarcoma associated with hiv is the result of infection with herpes eight epsteinbarr can cause burkitts lymphoma and of course human papilloma virus is known to cause cervical cancer herpes eight may also be a factor in multiple myeloma i think that over the next ten years were going to discover that viruses are responsible for all sorts of cancers that we dont yet suspect have a viral etiology or mediator other diseases as well as chris jotted down connollys words in the shorthand hed invented during medical school he talked to keep the hematologist on the line i knew that one of the herpes viruses had been implicated in multiple sclerosis herpes six said connolly and there are indications of a viral component in juvenile diabetes but lets get back to cancer theres no doubt that viruses can cause cancer but you have to remember getting cancer isnt a onestep process millions of women carry hpv but only a few develop cervical cancer millions of people smoke without getting lung cancer it wouldnt be enough to isolate and infect someone with an oncogenic retrovirus youd have to solve several other riddles too how to switch off tumor suppressor genes how to increase cellular growth factors it would take a massive research effort chriss thoughts were already shooting ahead so were talking about something beyond the reach of presentday technology not at all ive already done it myself right here in my lab connollys words hit him like a body blow what its amazing really but we did in trying to understand the cause of chronic myelogenous leukemia my team and i basically carried out gene therapy in reverse we attached a leukemiainducing gene to a retrovirus then infected a mouse with the virus the oncogene was incorporated into the mouses genome and within weeks the mouse had developed the rodent version of cml chris was literally speechless after several moments he asked was this mouse immunecompromised no perfectly healthy christ peter what you basically murdered this mouse by giving it cancer absolutely and thousands of human lives will one day be saved because of that murder youre missing my point what i asked you about on the phoneits possible well in theory i suppose what about in the real world connolly took a few moments to consider the question i suppose if you had some higher primates to test your work onor god forbid human beingsthen yes its possible chris gripped the phone in stunned silence i might be worried said connolly if it wouldnt cost someone millions of dollars to reach the point where they could murder someone using that method not to mention that theyd have to sit pretty goddamn high on the intelligence curve but if they did use that method they could be sure of getting away with murder connollys voice took on a clinical coldness chris if i used this technology against a human being i could kill whoever i wanted and the greatest pathologist in the world wouldnt even realize that a crime had been committed even if i told him he couldnt prove it with the science at his disposal a deep shiver went through chris hey said connolly you dont think i dont know pete you mentioned two possible scenarios in this line didnt you right the second scenario is far scarier to me because it requires much less expertise all youd need is a hematologist or oncologist with the ethics of dr mengele go on all you do is modify the process of a certain type of bone marrow transplant remove marrow cells from your patient irradiate or otherwise poison them in the lab causing your malignancy of choice then reinject them into the patient what would be the result a cancer factory powered by the victims own bone marrow exactly the kind of thing you described to me in fact a spectrum of blood cancers and no one could ever prove what had been done barring a confession no way in hell jesus chris analyzed this scenario as rapidly as he could would you have to use marrow cells for that or could you use cells that are easier to get hmm connolly mused i suppose you could use just about any kind of living cell so long as it contained the patients dna a hair root or a scraping from the mucosa say but marrow cells would be best chris had received too much information to process it efficiently pete can you tell me anything about the hematology and oncology departments at umc now do you know anything about your replacement not much its been six years you know i left there in a hurry so they made alan benson acting chairman until they recruited a new chief i remember theyve got a brandnew criticalcare hospital down there the new hematology chief is named pearson he came down from stanford where he did some groundbreaking work theyve got a terrific bone marrow transplant program but theyre still a ways from getting their nci designation which was always a dream of mine do you know of anyone at umc whos working on the kind of stuff weve been talking about which stuff retroviruses bone marrow transplant radiation all of it i dont know of any ongoing retrovirus trials there but im not the best guy to talk to id give ajit chandrekasar a call firstrate virologist and i was damned lucky to have him theres another guy there multiple specialtiesi used him for difficult histology and culture stuff his name wastarver eldon tarver i dont know if hes still around ive got it chris heard a female voice in the background theyre calling for me buddy did i help you at all you scared the shit out of me cant you tell me why you need this stuff not yet but if someone i know turns out to be right ill have some reportable cases you can write up for the journals connolly laughed im always happy to do that keeps the research money flowing chris hung up and looked down at his notes hed been a fool to resist alexs theories she might lack medical training but she had evolved her hypothesis by observing empirical evidence and had thus come to an improbable but quite possible conclusion he had discounted her ideas on the basis of professional prejudice nothing more he felt like the pompous french physicians who had ridiculed pasteur when the country doctor claimed anthrax was caused by a bacterium but chris wasnt like those doctors shown the error of his ways he would become a zealous convert after all his life was at stake chapter alex sat in a low chair opposite the desk of one of the two associate deputy directors of the fbi one of those deputy directors she considered a friend the other had long ago revealed himself to be an enemy that man was the one she was facing now outside of the bureaus washington headquarters mark dodson was said to have been eugenically bred as a bureaucrat he had spent little time in the field because hed set his sights on fbihq from the beginning by judicious use of his familys political connections dodson had insinuated himself into the bureaus halls of power with almost unprecedented speed hed honed his skills in the ethically bankrupt coveryourass environment of washington until his character consisted only of what remained after countless compromises made not for the good of the service but for advancement in the bureaus rigidly delineated hierarchy his title said it all associate deputy director administration dodson had taken a set against alex early during her washington service she had no idea why this should be so but in the byzantine corridors of the j edgar hoover building one could never be quite sure why anything was so after the fiasco at the federal reserve bank dodson had pushed relentlessly to have her fired had it not been for the intervention of senator clark calvertalexs staunchest supporterdodson might have rammed his agenda through today however there would be no lastminute charge by the seventh cavalry and alex had only herself to blame dodson stared across his desk with open satisfaction you had a good flight i trust can we not play games alex asked wearily can we just not do that im really too tired the good humor instantly left dodsons face he leaned across the desk and spoke in a harsh voice very well agent morse tomorrow morning at nine am you will meet with three representatives of the office of professional responsibility before the interview you will be ordered to take a drug test failure to submit to that test will constitute grounds for dismissal from the bureau failure to answer every question truthfully and fully will also constitute grounds for dismissal do you understand alex nodded once youre not going to skate this time dodson went on prodding her for a reaction she gave him nothing i mean what the hell were you thinking down there dodson asked as far as i can tell youve been carrying on a oneman murder investigation in mississippi youve broken so many rules and laws that i dont even know where to begin youve also influenced serving agents to break rules and laws and it pains me to say that they have probably done so out of misguided loyalty to you do you have any comment agent morse alex shook her head is there some purpose to your silence dodson asked with narrowed eyes are you attempting to communicate the fact that you despise me her eyes flashed she hoped he could read her mind dodson jabbed a forefinger at her you wont look so goddamned highandmighty at tomorrows meeting youll be living proof that even blue flamers can crash and burn alex studied her fingernails two had broken in last nights struggle are you finished gloating dodson leaned back in his seat lady im just getting started he was about to go on when the phone on his desk buzzed he reached out and pressed a button yes david director robertss office just called sir the director would like to speak to agent morse personally dodsons face tightened he leaned forward and pressed the button again then picked up the telephone and said something too low for alex to hear she heard him say now right now then as she watched in amazement dodson hung up the phone and spoke without meeting her eyes youre to go to the directors office immediately she stood and waited for the deputy director to look up at her but he never did she left dodsons office and walked down the hallowed corridor to the office of newly appointed fbi director john b roberts the directors office was considerably larger than dodsons his window overlooked pennsylvania avenue just as j edgar hoovers had done but hoover had watched the inaugural parades of seven presidents pass beneath his window whereas no fbi director since had enjoyed anything like that kind of tenure some hadnt even lasted long enough to learn the names of their sacs alex wondered how long roberts would survive a darkhaired man of fiftyfive roberts had been appointed to lead the bureau after the initial wave of post reforms had stalled his predecessor had spent almost two hundred million dollars on a new nationwide computer system that never worked while terrorists roamed the country with sacks of cash to keep them off the digital grid the street buzz on roberts was good as a us attorney he had taken on some of the largest corporations in the country proving again and again that they had colluded to defraud american consumers and investors to alexs surprise roberts wasnt the only senior officer in the room seated in a club chair to his left was a ruggedly handsome man of fortyeight associate deputy director jack moran moran handled investigations not administration and he had been a good friend to alex during her washington years often running interference to keep dodson off her back though there was little that moran or anyone else could do to save her today it warmed her heart to see him here hello alex moran said you look tired i am i dont believe youve met the new director john roberts alex morse alex stepped forward held out her hand and said special agent alex morse sir roberts took her hand and gave it a firm shake special agent morse i regret extremely the circumstances in which we now find ourselves im a close friend of senator clark calvert and im well aware of the great service that you performed for his family the director was referring to alexs careermaking case a kidnappingforransom of a us senators daughter the bureaus play had ended in a dangerous standoff in rural virginia but after nine hours of nerveracking negotiation alex had talked the barricaded kidnappers into releasing their fouryearold hostage to preserve the illusion of the invulnerability of government officials no word of this incident had reached the media but alexs career had been kicked into overdrive even now her work that day was paying dividends ive asked you here today director roberts said to find out whether there might be mitigating or extenuating circumstances that im unaware ofcircumstances that might justify your recent behavior alex knew that her amazement showed on her face please have a seat said the director take your time and think about my question she tried to gather herself to marshal what arguments there might be in her favor but in the event she couldnt find any i have no excuse sir she said finally all i can say in my defense is that im convinced my sister was murdered along with at least eight other people alex saw jack morans face falling but she pushed on i dont yet have objective evidence to prove these assertions all my actions over the past few weeks have been directed toward uncovering such proof last night i was almost killed by a man attempting to stop my investigation the natchez mississippi police department can verify that director roberts stared at her for some time without speaking then he said its my understanding that neither the mississippi state police nor the local police departments in the various towns involved believe that any such murders ever took place that view is supported by our field office in jackson alex tried to keep all emotion out of her voice i know that sir but these are not conventional crimes they are in effect very sophisticated poisoningsalmost in the sense of biological weapons the deaths occur so long after the administration of the poison or biological agent that forensic evidence is difficult or even impossible to obtain werent some of these deaths the result of cancer yes sir they were six of nine that i know about but i believe there have been more possibly a lot more alex jack interjected in a gentle voice you lost your father last december your sister died from an unexpected stroke only a month ago your mother is dying of ovarian cancer as we speak is it just possibleand i say possible mind youthat under this phenomenal amount of stress your mind has latched onto an explanation thats outside the realm of whats probable she didnt answer immediately ive thought about that a lot its a reasonable question but i dont believe thats the case i also believe that ive identified the next victim of this killing team jacks chin sagged onto his chest director roberts rubbed his left cheek and spoke in a harder voice agent morse i want you to listen to me very closely i would like you to take a voluntary leave of absence from the bureau well list your absence as extended compassionate medical leave during that absence id like you to voluntarily undergo an extensive psychiatric evaluation roberts glanced at jack moran if you will agree to this ill cancel the opr interview tomorrow morning pending the results of your evaluation im making you this offer because of your exemplary record as a crisis negotiator for the bureau but as a condition of this offer you must here and now agree toroberts looked down at a piece of paper on his deskcease and desist from all efforts relating to the death of your sister the attorney andrew rusk your former brotherinlaw william fennell and your nephew james william fennell jr roberts looked up at her again you must also agree to terminate all contact with former agents of your acquaintance such contact can only damage their careers as well as yours if you agree to these conditions termination can be avoided you might conceivably be reinstated as an agent in good standing in this agency the director sat back in his chair obviously waiting for an answer above his head the eyes of the president stared down at alex as though he were waiting too alex studied morans shoes as she mulled over the directors words they were cordovan wing tips new and shiny a far cry from the rockports he used to wear in the field she could not deny that the offer was remarkably generous in it she felt the hands of both jack moran and senator calvert she didnt want to disappoint the new director who was obviously a considerate man even less did she want to disappoint moran who had done so much for her as a mentor after a couple of minutes she looked at the director and spoke in a quiet voice do you have a sister sir alex moran cut in dont make it its all right jack said the director i dont mean to be presumptuous sir i just want you to understand my position if you can you see as my sister lay on her deathbed she told me that shed been murdered by her husband my sister wasnt the imaginative type but i was still skeptical however in a matter of days i discovered that her husband did have a motive to get rid of hera very attractive female motive sir i promised my sister that i would do everything in my power to save her son from his father and the only way i can see to do that is to solve her murder as far as i can tell nobody else is going to do that alex turned up her palms so that leaves me here i promised her sir it was her last request do you understand the director stared intently at her i do have a sister agent morse and truthfully i cant answer for what i would do if i were in your shoes roberts picked up a paperweight from the deska glass cube enclosing a clockand turned it in his hands but this is the fbi and we cant tolerate the kind of offthereservation things youve been doing i understand sir i dont want to be off the reservation im no rogue agent i wish you would throw the weight of the bureau behind me ive got good instinctsjack can attest to that moran nodded with obvious affection i know im right about this the same way i was right about the federal reserve bank which still bothers some people im afraid moran winced at this veiled reference to dodson alex touched her scarred cheek as she went on i paid a heavy price to go with my instincts on that day a lot heavier price than my face and whether you help me or not im going to fulfill the promise i made to my sister no matter what you do to me im going to get to the bottom of her death i hope that im still an fbi agent on that day but whether i am or not that day is going to come director roberts sighed wearily then looked over at moran i think were done here jack moran got up and escorted alex into the hall as soon as the door closed he put an arm around her shoulders and hugged her tight she struggled to hold back her tears but when she felt jack stroking her hair a sob broke from her throat what was it she asked what finally did it the charlotte apartment when you broke that lease dodson knew you were never going back he started asking questions in charlotte and that was that she nodded into jacks chest then leaned back and looked into his eyes do you think im crazy i think youre exhausted ive been tired that way myself i had to be hospitalized in minneapolis once i was working so hard by a strange coincidence that was just after my wife died you hear what im saying theres a connection between personal loss andlosing your grip on things youve lost a lot in the past few months alex more than anybody should have to lose she nodded in agreement then tried to wipe away her tears i concede all that but jack put a finger up to her lips just promise me one thing what you wont hurt yourself any more than you have to tomorrow morning she laughed strangely what does it matter now moran squeezed her upper arm youve still got friends in this building thats all im saying dont give that prick dodson the rope to hang you with alex nodded but her mind was already far away as she pulled away and walked down the hall alone she saw an image of chris shepard practicing baseball with his adopted son superimposed over that picture like a descending shadow was a scene of thora shepard copulating with dr shane lansing thoras eyes blazing with desperate lust were the brightest things in alexs head standing in the shadows behind thora was andrew rusk his face a grinning mask of greed and behind him almost beyond the realm of sight hovered an even darker figurefar more threatening yet utterly faceless i know youre there alex murmured and im going to find you motherfucker chapter while alex was walking out of the hoover building eldon tarver was squatting beside a sandy stream waiting for his bowels to move he had spent the last eighteen hours in the woods of chickamauga while forty miles away the natchez police the adams county sheriffs department and the mississippi highway patrol combed the area for a white van that was tumbling along the bottom of the mississippi river toward baton rouge the doctors motorcycle was parked beneath a sycamore forty feet away and his duffel bag lay beside it eldon had come down to the stream to escape the sun and to do his business in peace as he rocked and strained on his haunches he kept his eyes peeled for movement near the stream snakes liked this kind of ground down in the cool hollows near water they needed to drink just as people did that was one of the secrets of handling them knowing that they werent so different from people coldblooded yes but eldon had learned young that many humans shared this trait snakes lived to eat sleep and mate just as humans did to eat they had to kill and to kill they had to hunt most humans hunted too those who werent so alienated from their natures that they retained nothing of their ancient selves people hunted in different ways and places now in offices financial markets laboratories and dark city streets a few still carried the spirit of the true hunter within their breasts alex morse was one of these and that only made sense she had been born from a hunters loins and she was simply fulfilling her destiny as her genes bade her to do right now she was hunting him morse had a tough job ahead eldon knew ways of hiding that even animals did not there had been times he believed when he had made himself literally invisible to people passing within a foot of him today was a good example he wasnt tearing across the country in a panic as so many people who had killed would now be doing he was living quietly close to the earth and still near the sites of his attacks he often felt a deep lethargy after a kill the way snakes did after devouring large prey it took time to digest the big things later of course he would begin to stir to focus on research again but now he felt a deep slowness in his veins a reluctance to engage with life that almost frightened him the feeling wasnt new sometimes he felt like a retrovirus himself neither alive nor dead but rather half a helixhalf a chaineternally searching for a tie that would bind he suspected that most human beings were like that dormant drifting like living corpses until they infiltrated the barriers of another person by insinuating themselves into that other life they began to function to act to feel and ultimately to reproduce but after a time varying in every case but always inevitable they began to kill the host body look at the desperate men and women who went to andrew rusk for help most had already attached themselves to a new host and were now consumed by a frantic impulse to flee the dying husk of the old one the husk that they themselves had sucked dry and they would not scruple to kill if necessary eldon listened to the whisper of the creek and let his mind drift downstream sometimes he had trouble evacuating his bowels before his adoptive father came to believe that eldon had been ordained by god to handle serpents he had flown into rages and beaten the boy without mercy all the anger that would have crashed onto the thick heads of his biological children was diverted onto eldon by his wife a living monument to passive aggression but eldon had understood none of that then he understood only pain even now he had more than a dozen burn scars on his body souvenirs of his fathers kafkaesque efforts to prove that he was not one of the elect that he had been touched by the evil one being burned by the flame constituted damning proof of sin the redhot iron had scourged eldon in places he had not touched himself back thenthe very iron they used in church to fulfill luke behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you and for the skeptical there was mark which eldon had heard repeated ten thousand times before he was fifteen they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the sound of a cell phone was alien in these woods and many creatures stopped to listen eldon let it ring three more times before he answered yes dr traver eldon blinked three times slowly yes its neville byrd yes i think i may have him sir or it rather go on the thing you were waiting for you know the mechanism go on andy rusk just logged on to this dutch web site it seems to me hes going through an authentication protocol of some kind you know verifying his identity and welli mean if he does that tomorrow id say weve found the trigger you know like if he didnt log in the next day all hell would break loose or whatever it is youre expecting eldon found it hard to adjust to the sudden intrusion of modernity very good call me whenyoure certain neville byrd sat breathing into the phonehe was almost panting really and obviously puzzled by his employers apparent detachment ill do that doctor is there anything else no okay then the connection went dead eldon hit end then wiped himself with some broad leaves and walked slowly back to his motorcycle he saw a shiver in the pine straw as he walked a shiver that filled him with anticipation instead of halting as most people would have he threw out his right foot a thick black snake reared up before him exposing the milky lining of its mouth and two long fangs a cottonmouth moccasin the tip of its tail vibrated like a rattlesnakes but there was no sound this viper had no rattle like its cousin still it stood its ground more fiercely than a rattler would have done agkistrodon piscivorus eldon murmured are you a sign my friend the cottonmouth seemed perplexed by his lack of fear as dr tarver moved forward he opened his mouth and flicked his tongue in and out an old habit from his snakehunting days the cottonmouth was not brilliantly hued like the coral but corals were rare and the one hed found in the park was probably dead by now agent morse would almost certainly survive even if shed been bitten but she would never be the same she would have tasted the enmity that god had promised in genesis and she would know that her present hunt was like no other the cottonmouth advanced in a quick rush showing that he meant business eldon laughed and sidestepped the snake whose body was nearly as thick as his forearm its diamondshaped head was big as an average mans fist a snake like that could generate a lot of fear in some contexts it could be a very persuasive tool i believe you are he said a sign of rebirth as he shouldered his duffel bag and climbed aboard the honda his laughter echoed strangely through the trees chapter chris was sitting at his kitchen table dictating charts when the cell phone alex had given him began to ring ben was in the den playing madden nfl on his xbox but they could see each other through the open door ben had already asked about the unfamiliar cell phone and chris had played it off as something the hospital had lent him he debated not answering then calling alex back after ben went to sleep but that might be some time he glanced at ben then got up and reached to the top of the refrigerator where hed stashed his slipping it into his pocket he picked up the cell phone and a flashlight then walked to the front door calling im going outside for better reception okay ben didnt even look in his direction alex he said walking across the driveway hows it going up there not so good you sound shaky not my best day im sorry take another ativan id like to but theyre giving me a drug test in the morning and its not voluntary ativans no big deal youve got a prescription not in writing ill fax one up there tomorrow that wont help they dont want me talking to you chris they dont want me talking to anybody associated with any of the cases actually noncases would be more accurate they still dont believe you for a second i thought i saw something in an old friends eye but i was wrong chris switched on the flashlight and scanned his front yard two pairs of yellowgreen eyes glowed to life on a hilltop sixty meters away the deer reassured him for the skittish animals would instantly vanish if someone were prowling the area well your big worry was that they would fire you have they done that not yet they offered me a deal what deal if i give up everything stop trying to find out what happened to grace they probably wont fire me chris didnt know what to say they want me to go to a goddamn psychiatric hospital they think im having some kind of breakdown though he didnt want to confess it chris had suspected the same thing for a while in a small voice alex said is that what you think absolutely not listen i spoke to my old hematology professor up at sloankettering today he scared me to death alex murdering someone by giving them cancer is more than just theoretically possible connolly has done it himself to mice how chris quickly recounted the scenarios pete connolly had outlined for him my god i wish i had talked to him a week ago chris walked through a flower bed and up to the den window ben was still glued to the television his mouth taut his hands flying over the game controller listen alex said i called to let you know that im sending someone down to watch over you and ben tonight who will kilmer my fathers old partner youve heard me talk about him hes an exhomicide detective now private hes about seventy and really nice hes also sharper and tougher than he looks i just want you to know hes going to be outside im not going to turn him away im walking around with my gun nervous as a cat thats good just dont shoot will dont worry there was a brief silence then alex said i also want you to know something else his stomach tightened in dread will has a detective staying up at the alluvian hotel hes watching thora chris felt a surprising ambivalence about this really i didnt tell you because its easier to ask forgiveness than permission but i had to do it chris i understand has the guy seen anything suspicious another hesitation the detectives wife thinks she may have seen shane lansing leave the hotel about five thirty this morning shes not positive though the knots in chriss stomach eased a little i told you i saw lansing early this morning in natchez he couldnt have made it back here from greenwood in that time unless he flew theres no commercial service to greenwood and lansing isnt a pilot youve been giving this a lot of thought havent you chris colored of course i even waited outside his office in my car this afternoon to make sure he was really there working was he yes but the fact that he hasnt pressed assault charges is pretty goddamn suspicious well know the truth soon enough i think be nice to will if you see him he practically raised me and hes doing this for free when will he be here probably within the next half hour what am i supposed to tell ben what time does he go to bed probably an hour from now ill make sure will doesnt come up to the house until after that thanks when are you coming back im meeting with the opr in the morning theyll probably ask for my badge and gun there may be paperwork to do up here but im going to try to get back as soon as i can you just make sure youre alive and well when i get there chris turned and looked over at the hilltop the eyes were still there like golden spheres floating in the night dont worry about that he started to hang up but he felt that he should say one thing more before he did alex yes maybe you should think about taking that deal he heard only the hissing silence of the open connection if we concentrate on the medical side of things he said if we use people like pete connolly i think well eventually have enough evidence to convince your superiors to look into this themselves not soon enough alex said bitterly not for jamie i think he knows what his father did chris he doesnt admit it to himself but at some level he knows have you made any progress getting the medical records of the other victims from the families maybe when could i have done that she replied testily i understand look just try to find out who their doctors were maybe i can get hold of them through a backdoor route thats unethical isnt it no its illegal well well things change when it gets personal dont they a rush of anger went through him look if you dont im sorry chris i couldnt resist ive been alone in this for so long you know ill do anything to get those records okay i need to get back to ben dont do anything crazy in that meeting tomorrow alex laughed the sound strangely brittle through the cell phone thats what everybody tells me chris hung up and looked over at the hilltop now there were five pairs of eyes he clapped his hands together once hard as if controlled by a single mind the eyes aligned themselves and focused on him the cheep of crickets died and even the frogs down at the pond fell silent chris whistled once long and low utterly perplexing the deer they stared for a moment that dilated into something immeasurable then bolted into the woods with a drumming of hoofbeats gone as he walked back into the house the floating eyes hovered in his mind like the afterimage of an exploding flashbulb at about the same intensity a shadowy film was running through his mind thora sitting astride shane lansing in a darkened hotel room the air fetid with humid delta heat her body glistening with sweat her eyes wild with abandon dad ben called where you been watching some deer how many five yeah come play me a game chris stepped around the refrigerator and laid the on top again okay buddy i want to be the colts this time no way chris lay on the sofa bed in his home theater just up the hall from the master bedroom suite and listened to the slow regular sound of bens breathing ben had asked him to open up the bed on the pretext that it was more comfortable for watching a movie but chris knew that with his mother gone the boy wanted to sleep down here rather than upstairs in his room chris picked up the remote and switched off the tv then got out of the bed carefully so as not to wake ben thora had called from greenwood about twenty minutes after his conversation with alex her tone was light and breezy as she gushed about the quality of the spa and she laughed as she read the names of treatments to ben who by then was on the other extension the experience seemed surreal to chris who was thinking about the morningafter pill and his scuffle with shane lansing while thora giggled out names like the mississippi mudpie the highcotton indulgence the sweat tea soul soak the muddy waters and the blues bath he thought she might get serious once ben was off the line but to his amazement she told him that they should both return in a month or so for the couples renewal treatment no mention of shane lansingnothing but sweetness and light chris wasnt about to get into anything while ben was awake so hed matched his tone to thoras and ended the conversation an hour had passed since that call so he walked to the front door opened it and poked his head outside mr kilmer he called are you out there no response he called out again but no one answered mildly annoyed he walked back to the kitchen to make himself a sandwich he was taking his first bite when someone knocked at the garage door he walked through the pantry and put his eye to the peephole through its bubble lens he saw a grayhaired man wearing glasses who is it he called loudly will kilmer said a strong male voice alex morse sent me chris opened the door kilmer was about five feet ten and in surprisingly good shape for a man his age except for a paunch above his sagging belt he wore khakis a generic polo shirt and gray running shoes when he smiled and offered his hand chris shook it getting the iron grip he expected from an excop im sorry you had to drive all the way down here mr kilmer call me will doctor kilmer released his hand its no problem im getting to where i cant sleep more than three or four hours a night these days thats pretty common with the onset of age i find the opposite of teenagers who want to sleep twenty hours out of twentyfour i was out here when you called from the front door but that was the first time youd showed yourself since i got here and i wanted to see if anybody made a move you dont really think somebodys out there do you from what alex told me id say its reasonable to expect trouble if someone were out there wouldnt they have seen you come up i walked in will said and im pretty quiet when i put my mind to it parked out by that restaurant built in the shape of a black mammy and ive got a night scope in my pack there was an awkward silence can i offer you something to drink chris asked i was about to eat a sandwich i dont want to put you out you can guard us just as well from inside as out cant you get your pack and ill make you a sandwich you can tell me why alex morse isnt crazy kilmer chuckled softly hard to turn that offer down ill be right back chris walked back to the kitchen leaving the door open behind him before he finished making the second turkeyandswiss kilmer had joined him in the kitchen the detective set a camouflage backpack on the floor and sat on one of the barstools at the counter chris slid a plate over then opened a corona and passed it to the detective kilmers eyes lit up when he saw the beer thanks doc its pretty damn hot for may chris nodded and went back to his own sandwich youve got a nice place out here kilmer said but i hear youre moving my wifes idea keeping up with the joneses i guess kilmer took another swallow of beer then started on his sandwich so you used to work with alexs father chris prompted thats right first at the pd then at our detective agency never knew a better man in a tight spot he was killed recently yessir trying to help some people in trouble which is about what id of guessed crimes pretty bad in jackson i hear bad you take the jackson i grew up in as a boy and compare it to now its like the end of the world it started in the eighties with the crack now the inmates are running the asylum now that jims gone i doubt ill stay at it more than another couple years close the agency retire up to virginia chris nodded youve known alex her whole life kilmers eyes sparkled from the day she was born worst tomboy i ever saw in my life been handling guns since she was eight and smart kilmer shook his head by the time she was fourteen she made me feel stupid not just me either chris laughed what about that murder theory of hers kilmer pressed his lips together and sighed im not sure what to think the technical side is over my head but ill tell you this i worked homicide for more years than anybody ought to and i think a lot more people have been murdered in divorce situations than anybody knows or even suspectsespecially before the forensics were what they are now i had lots of cases where i just knew the husband had offed his wife and made it look like an accident same way i knew it was sex abuse when id find a mama and her daughters over a dead husband but divorce is a lot more common than child abuse kilmer looked suddenly abashed look just because i think alex may be onto something dont mean i think your wife is doing you wrong im just here as a favor to alex i understand ive only known alex a few days but i can see why you like her so much chris took a swallow of beer but i have wondered if she hasnt gone through so much in the past few months that shes not quite in control of her faculties kilmer raised his eyebrows as though considering this possibility shes been through a lot all right and you may not know the worst of it i believe alex loved that fella who got killed the day she was shot but he was married and she wasnt the type to break up a family so that day was pretty rough she lost half her face and the man she loved in about five seconds she feels guilty that she loved him and guilty that she got him killed a lot of people would crack under strain like that but excepting her daddy alex is the last person out of anybody i ever met who would lose her grip on reality kilmer met chriss eyes if she believes youre in danger watch out she aint down here to waste her time or yours kilmers furrowed face had been hardened by years of smoking cigarettes and his belly had probably grown during years of eating bad food on stakeouts how many years had he taken off his life by choosing the life he had would alex look that rough when she was seventy it seemed unlikely but her facial wounds had already taken her partway down that road well chris said getting up and taking his plate to the sink im going to hit the rack pretty soon youre welcome to sleep in the house tonight theres a guest room right off that hall over there wheres your boy kilmer asked he fell asleep in the tv room chris pointed that glow right down there ill be just past it if he wakes up and sees me what should i tell him he wont but if he should just come get me as chris reached up to the top of the refrigerator a sudden thought struck him he brought down the and said do you have any identification on you mr kilmer kilmer stared back for a long moment then nodded walked to his backpack and reached inside chris felt himself tense as though preparing for violence but kilmer only brought out a wallet he showed chris a mississippi drivers license the goodnatured face on it matched the man in front of him look here kilmer said flipping open a plastic picture holder this is alex in her younger days with me and jim chris looked down at three figures huddled in what appeared to be a duck blind in the dead of winter sandwiched between two handsome men in their primes was a girl whose arms were wrapped around the neck of a black labrador retriever her grin revealed two missing teeth and her eyes shone as though they couldnt possibly hold more happiness than they did in that moment despite her youth chris could see hints of the woman that alex would become in the future kilmer flipped up the picture revealing a snapshot of alex at what looked like her high school graduation she was pressed between the same two men older now and this time wearing dark suits there were two women in the picture also classic mississippi wives with too much makeup and wide genuine smiles aint she something kilmer said do you have kids will the older man swallowed we had a girl a year behind alex in school we lost her on homecoming night the year alex graduated drunk driver after thati guess alex kind of took her place in my heart kilmer closed the wallet went back to the counter and drank off the rest of his beer im sorry chris said part of life kilmer said stoically you take the good with the bad go on to bed doc and dont worry about nothing i got you covered chris shook the detectives hand then walked down the hall toward his bedroom appreciate the sandwich kilmer called chris waved then backed up and stepped into the home theater room bens breathing hadnt changed but he had managed to tie the bedclothes into a knot around him chris tried to imagine getting a call like the one will kilmer must have gotten on that longago homecoming night but he couldnt do it as he stared down at bens gentle face he thought of the trauma the boy would suffer if it turned out that his mother was not the woman that either of them believed her to be praying for a miracle he no longer believed in chris quietly shut the door and walked down to his own bedroom chapter eldon tarver stood in the deep moon shadow beneath the lowhanging limbs of a water oak and watched the lights go out in the house on the hill his motorcycle lay in the underbrush back near the highway a backpack lay on the ground at his feet he had spent the day at the chickamauga hunting camp in jefferson county waiting for night to fall he had done many things during the day but one he had not done was answer the calls of andrew rusk when he arrived last night and found a woman here his first thought was that he had made a mistake about the house the wife was supposed to be out of town but when he checked the coordinates on his pocket gps unit they had matched his notes exactly he had moved closer close enough to see the woman clearly and compare her to the photos in his backpack she did not match however she did match an image deep in eldons mindone he had seen only briefly in the fennell file supplied by rusk the woman in the house was special agent alexandra morse the sister of grace fennell her presence theretalking to his next targethad such profound implications that he had almost panicked but life had taught him to expect the unexpected hed thought morse would be easy prey despite whatever training the bureau might have given her she was a hostage negotiator after all not a tactical specialist but she had fought like a demon when he moved in for the kill he hadnt been sure he meant to kill her until he was less than ten feet away killing an fbi agent was a serious matter institutional memory was long and the bureau did not forget such crimes but the way she had played itslipping into the driveway in an amateurish attempt to trick himtold eldon one thing morse was alone she had no backup there or anywhere else yet she had taught him a painful lesson and almost exposed him tonight it seemed better that she had survived had alex morse died in that carport a hundred fbi agents would have descended on this little corner of mississippi now he had time to do what was necessary for a clean escape eldon shouldered his backpack and walked slowly up the hill as he neared the house he veered right and moved around dense azaleas to the cluster of air conditioners that served the house he had studied the blueprints provided by rusk until he knew this house inside and out he knew which airconditioning units cooled which zones for example and he would soon make use of that knowledge he continued circling the house moving past an outdoor hot tub then the swimming pool then into the breezeway that led to the storeroom there was some risk that he could be seen from the darkened windows inside but instinct told him he was all right moving quickly into the storeroom he pulled down a collapsible stairway and climbed into the attic from here he could reach the attic of the main house after squeezing his bulky shoulders through one crawl space he entered a forest of rafters and ceiling joists by walking carefully on the joists he traversed the forty feet that took him to the duct he needed digging into the backpack he removed a respirator gas mask and fitted it closely over his nose and mouth then he fitted a pair of foamlined goggles over his eyes after donning a pair of surgical gloves eldon reached into his pack and removed a heavy oblong canister it looked like the co cylinders that kids used to charge paintball guns he laid a heavy rubber mat over the duct to dampen vibration then with a small batterypowered hand drill he bored a hole in the duct after laying a thin piece of rubber over the hole he lifted the cylinder and punched its sharp nozzle through both rubber and hole creating a seal once he was certain of his setup he drew a deep breath then opened the valve on the cylinder the soft hissing that followed gave him intense satisfaction within two minutes both men and the boy below would be unconscious they would remain that way until morning long after eldon had left the house the gas in the cylinder could not be purchased anywhere in the united states unless the buyer was the us government it had been provided to dr tarver by edward biddle an acquaintance from many years ago biddle had once been an army officer associated with a project dr tarver had worked on now biddle was an officer of a large corporation that handled critical defense contracts for the united states the gas was an agent similar to that the russians had used in their attempt to free the seven hundred hostages trapped by terrorists in a moscow theater quite a few people had died from the gas in that instance but most were elderly and the dosage had not been precisely calculated unlike the russians dr tarver knew exactly what he was doing he sat absolutely still for two minutes then moved deeper into the attic to the foldingladder steps over the closet of the master bedroom so confident was he of the gas that he had not brought a firearm tonight an unregistered weapon was the quickest path to arrest during a random traffic stop bracing both hands on a ceiling joist he pushed down the springmounted steps with his legs after unfolding the ladder he carried his backpack into the closet and unpacked an aluminum thermos inside the thermos were two preloaded syringes one contained a mixture of corticosteroids to suppress the human immune system the other contained a solution that had taken dr tarver over a year to develop twenty years really if you counted the research that had gone into it but this specific solution had been a year in the making it was different from those used on the other targets and for that reason eldon was excited he felt a hyperalertness that even the knowledge that this would be his last operation could not diminish for there could be no doubt of that either rusk had been lying to him or rusk was a fool either way the connection had to be severed but there were things eldon had to do first some would be unpleasant but not this this was something he had waited for for a very long time he walked into the master bedroom without even trying to be quiet dr shepard lay on his side in the bed his mouth open wider than appeared normal but this was common after the gas dr tarver took a mental snapshot of the bed to make sure he would leave everything exactly as he found it then he set the syringes on a dresser pulled the covers off shepard and rolled the internist onto his stomach dr tarver took a small led flashlight from his pocket switched it on then got the steroid injection from the dresser kneeling between shepards thighs he pulled down his boxer shorts and pushed one cheek aside exposing the anus holding the light between his teeth he opened the doctors anus enough to insert the needle then injected the steroids an inch inside the rectum dr shepard hardly stirred eldon repeated the procedure with the other solution but at the last instant shepards lower body flinched in an involuntary muscle spasm eldon found his needle embedded at the entrance to the rectum a bad mistake but now that the hole had been made there wasnt much point in removing it to find a site deeper in he hesitated before depressing the plunger several times today hed thought of extending his experiment hed known the boy would be in the house and since his research was likely to be cut short the boy offered a unique opportunity eldon had not prepared enough solution to inject both shepard and his son with the precalculated dose but instinct told him there was probably enough on the other hand a juvenile immune system might be resilient enough to overcome the virus given the unknowns eldon depressed the plunger to the bottom of the syringes barrel and gave shepard the full dose the boy would live eldon turned shepard back on his side pulled the covers over him then loaded everything back into the pack and walked quickly down the hall he found the boy on a sofa bed in the home theater to his surprise he discovered an older man sleeping in an easy chair in the den three empty beer bottles beside him eldon did not know the man he took a cell phone from his pack aimed its tiny lens at the strangers face and shot a picture of him then he forced his hand into the strangers back pocket and took out his wallet eldon looked around the room leaning against the sofa by william kilmers feet was a camouflage backpack when he opened the backpack a strange numbness began spreading outward from his heart inside was a handgun a starlight scope a canister of pepper spray a camera and a pair of handcuffs it took several moments for eldon to gather himself but he put everything back exactly as it had been before he arrived he left the house by the ladder in the closet retracing his steps back to the duct where he sealed his tiny hole with duct tape ten minutes after he injected shepard he was walking swiftly through the trees toward the highway the sense of exhilaration hed felt inside had vanished now replaced by anxiety anger even fear tonight everything had changed alex sat with her elbows propped on the desk of her hotel room in washington drunk on ativan and room service wine shed been staring at her computer for hours afraid that the announcement bell wouldnt ding when jamie logged on to msn the bell had not dinged yet but not because of a malfunction for whatever reason jamie simply had not logged on the reason might be as simple as a power outage in jackson but alex couldnt make herself believe it given what jamie had told her during their last video chat she feared that he might have tried something desperate like running away a half hour ago she had broken down and called the landline at bill fennells house she had a right to talk to her nephew and shed meant to tell bill so in no uncertain terms but she never got the chance all she got was an answering machine she looked over at the hotel bed and considered climbing into it she had an early interview tomorrow with the opr people and she needed to look her best solid reliable deserving of institutional trust ha she wasnt going to take a chance on missing jamie no way nohow chapter have you got enough silk asked the nurse i think so said chris tying off the last of twentythree stitches the lacerated arm under his light belonged to a fiftyyearold handyman named curtis johnese a huge man in stained overalls with a pumpkinshaped head and a dip of skoal tucked behind his lip an hour ago mr johnese had contrived to open an eightinch gash on his forearm using a table saw in the custom from time immemorial he had come to tom cages office to be sewn up rather than visit the emergency room which would have cost four times as much and taken four times as long johnese would have preferred dr cage but tom had stepped into chriss office and asked if he would suture the wound among toms many chronic illnesses was psoriatic arthritis and with a recent bout with cataracts under his belt he didnt feel he was ready for detailed work chris set down his forceps lifted the paper drape and examined his work as he stared a sharp throbbing stabbed the base of his skull hed felt this intermittently since waking this morning and it was strong enough that hed taken three advil surprisingly the pain had grown worse not better at first hed thought it was a tension headachethora was set to return tomorrow and there was bound to be trouble when he confronted herbut this pain had a relentless quality to it as though it signaled the onset of a fever looks great mr johnese he said rubbing his neck just let holly give you a tetanus booster and you can be on your way come back in a week and ill take them out for you johnese smiled and said i shore appreciate it doc dr cage is all right aint he hes fine were just backed up this morning the handyman looked down at his tanned forearm as holly applied a bandage thats pretty good work for a young fella you keep at it and listen to dr cage and you cant go far wrong im with you there chris said patting him on the back chris left the surgery walked into his office and shut the door behind him sitting in his chair he massaged his temples with his thumbs then tried to work the muscles at the base of his neck this brought no relief he reached into his desk and popped another advil upping the dose to eight hundred milligrams that ought to do it he muttered hed intended to call the university medical center to try to speak to a couple of the doctors pete connolly had mentioned but he was in no mood to do that now he leaned back in his chair recalling bens fright this morning when hed discovered will kilmer sound asleep in the easy chair in the den ben had raced back to chriss bedroom and shaken him awake but once chris had explained that kilmer was a distant cousin who was passing through town on his way to florida and once ben saw that his dad wasnt worried the boy put it out of his mind and started getting ready for school kilmer had apologized profusely and quickly left the house on the way to school ben told chris hed seen three empty beer bottles beside cousin wills chair chris hadnt seen the bottles but he figured that was why kilmer had fallen asleep before reaching the guest room not much of a watchdog he thought wryly the only question remaining was what hed say to thora if ben mentioned their visitor dr shepard hollys voice intruded into his reverie like a shout as he jumped in his chair chris wondered if he might be getting a migraine hed never had one before but the hypersensitivity to sound and light seemed to signal the onset of something in that line what is it holly youve got patients waiting in all four rooms chris rubbed his eyes and sighed heavily im on my way are you okay she asked breaking through the professional barrier which she didnt observe much anyway yeah ive just got a headache the nurse nodded ill try to pace things a little better today chris heaved himself out of his chair put on his stethoscope and walked into the hall between his door and that of exam room he felt a surge of sympathy for alex morse right about now she was probably watching her career get flushed down the toilet he wished there were something he could do to help her if only she could be patient there might be but alex had been under so much strain for so long that patience seemed not to be an option for her just as hed done on the day he met alex chris lifted a chart from the file caddy on the door and walked into the examining room what awaited him was not a mystery woman with a scarred face but a pound man with a pilonidal abscess chris forced a smile steeled himself against the coming stink and went to work alex sat in a straightbacked wooden chair before a stonefaced tribunal of opr officials there were two men and a woman the men bookending the woman behind a long table they had introduced themselves at the opening of the proceedings but alex had paid no attention to their names nothing she said today would change the outcome of this hearing and taking part in their little charade would only demean her further almost no fbi agent got through his or her career without a few opr reviews usually they resulted from minor infractions of the rules and sometimes from tattletale gossip anonymously provided to the opr by jealous fellow agents common enough behavior to have a slang term describing it jamming but todays hearing was different one of the worst offenses in the eyes of the opr was lack of candor which meant deception of any kind and degree by an agent including trivial lies of omission judged by this standard alexs offenses were grave she had not yet been ordered to take a polygraph but she had been placed under oath one of the male officials had recounted all the charges that associate deputy director dodson had leveled against her then added a few technicalities for good measure it was all the equivalent of an auditory blur until the woman held up a copy of the threatening text message alex had sent to andrew rusk yesterday during her initial fury at being called to washington she had no idea how mark dodson could have come into possession of that message but she was an old enough hand not to ask the bureaucrats behind the table would tell her nothing but now they were coming to a part of the proceeding that she could not ignore special agent morse said the woman do you have anything to say on your behalf before we close this hearing no maam the woman frowned like a reproachful church matron then conferred quietly with her colleagues a stenographer sat patiently at a desk to alexs right alex filled the time by studying the stenographers shoes they were low heels from nine west or maybe kenneth coles if shed saved her moneystill a far cry from the manolo blahniks covering the feet of the opr bitch behind the table it took italian leather to shoe ambition like that in the washington opr special agent morse said the woman as a result of this preliminary hearing we are suspending you from all further duties until final and formal disposition of your case you will turn in your credentials and your weapon and all further contact with the bureau should be handled through your attorney alex said nothing the woman glanced at the stenographer im going offtherecord the stenographers fingers rose from her machine in view of your exemplary record said the blahnikshod woman excluding the incident at the federal reserve bank of coursei regret extremely that weve been forced to take this action its my understanding that an effort was made to come to a compromise whereby your termination would not be necessary alex suffered silently through the pregnant pause that followed this remark the triumvirate of bureaucrats stared for what seemed an eternity how they must have been wondering could someone voluntarily walk away from the agency to which they were giving their lives im sorry you chose not to take advantage of that offer said the woman alex lifted her purse off the floor removed her fbi identity card and her glock then walked forward and laid both on the table you dont turn those in to us said the woman you turn them in on the first floor alex turned away and walked to the door agent morse the woman called after her youre not to leave washington until this matter has been fully resolved agent morse alex walked out leaving the door open behind her for good or ill she was free now chris was examining a man in congestive heart failure when jane knocked at the door and told him he needed to come to the phone its the secretary at st stephens doctor the middle school alarm hit chris with surprising force is it ben has something happened nothing terrible just a headache but its bad enough that he wants to come home a headache chris echoed ive got a headache too he walked into the reception area and took the receiver jane handed him dr shepard this is annie out at st stephens bens had a headache all morning and i think its bad enough that he ought to go home i knew your wife was out of town so i called your office everybody knows everything in this town is he having visual disturbances or anything like that i dont think so all i know is he came to see me during recess and ben wouldnt do that unless he was really hurting im on my way please keep him in the office until i get there is he there now here he is dad said a shaky voice hey buddy your head hurts uhhuh real bad im coming to get you right now where will you take me moms not home you can stay at the office with me miss holly will take care of you okay okay the relief in bens voice was plain chris hung up and started toward his office then he stopped reversed direction and walked down the hall to tom cages office the whitebearded doctor was saying goodbye to a drug rep excuse me guys chris cut in tom ive got to run pick up ben from school hes got a bad headache can you hold the fort while im gone my rooms are full no problem take off chris tried to recall who was in each room ive got mr deakins in three with congestive heart failure ive got ruth ellen green in four with a diabetic neuropathy theyll tell me whats wrong tom said with a smile go take care of ben as chris shook toms hand the drug rep said are you the guy who punched out shane lansing chris reddened he and tom had not yet spoken about this though tom must have heard about it by now we had a little disagreement nothing major the drug rep stuck out his hand well i want to shake your hand i hate that arrogant son of a bitch this was risky talk for a detail man especially in front of two doctors but the rep probably knew that tom wasnt the type to talk out of school id guess lansing had it coming said tom giving chris a private wink let the man go tony the rep grinned and withdrew his hand as chris strode down the hall he heard the rep imploring tom to prescribe whatever drug he was hawking that day you know me tony dr cage laughed im happy to accept all the free drugs youll give me but im going to prescribe the cheapest drug that works for the patient chris smiled as he darted into his office to retrieve his keys alexs cell phone was blinking on the desk shed left three voice messages in the last fifteen minutes as he walked out to his truck he speeddialed her chris she answered yeah whats up im history they fired you he asked in disbelief pending final disposition of my case but im basically a private citizen now just like you shit what are you going to do im supposed to stay here in the district didnt you tell me you have a condo up there yes but i dont want to go there i cant what do you want to do come back to mississippi and keep working the case whats stopping you theyre monitoring my credit cards probably my cell phone too but they dont know i have this phone chris got into his truck backed out and pulled onto jefferson davis boulevard thinking quickly how soon can you fly out i could go straight to the airport then ill book you a flight i mean ill get my secretary to do it chris you no argument okay do you want to fly into baton rouge or jackson jackson theres a nonstop flight i cant pick you up he said thinking of the twohour drive each way but ill rent you a car thank you chris i dont know what i would have done did will show up last night yeah we got along great he thought of adding he drank three beers and fell asleep in my den but alex was having a bad enough day will sure thinks the world of you call me when you land okay i will he hung up and stepped on the gas heading south toward st stephens he couldnt remember the last time ben had had a headache he couldnt remember the last time hed had one either that kind of coincidence was almost never random chapter wearing only a towel around his trim waist andrew rusk opened the glass door of the racquet club steam room and walked into an almost impenetrable cloud of water vapor behind him a club employee slapped a do not enter closed for repairs sign on the door rusk waved his hand through the cloud trying to disperse enough steam to catch sight of his quarry carson g barnett rusk said a deep voice low and utterly devoid of good humor yes he said carson im in the corner over by these goddamn rocks damn near burned my pecker off a second ago rusk could tell by the latent anger in the oilmans voice that this would be a tough meeting but anger wasnt a bad sign anger meant that barnett was considering going forward he had come to the meeting after all rusk had to get rid of the steam he had to be sure barnett wasnt wearing a wire he walked to the corner where barnetts voice had spoken and knelt by the machine that controlled the steam the air was thick with the scent of eucalyptus at last the control knob appeared and he dialed it back percent when he stood up he caught sight of barnetts bulldog countenance floating in the whiteness the mans jaw was clenched tight and he glowered at rusk through the haze i been thinking about what you said barnett muttered rusk nodded but said nothing you got a pair of balls on you boy still rusk did not respond i reckon you got em from your daddy he had a pair too still does i dont reckon im the first one who ever heard that pitch you made me rusk shook his head you aint sayin much today cat got your tongue would you mind standing by the door mr barnett what the tone suspicious then oh the big man got up and walked into the clear air by the glass door would you mind removing your towel shit grunted barnett he pulled off the towel and stood glaring rusks eyes moved quickly up and down the oilmans stumpy body you wanna see where i burned it barnett asked would you turn around please barnett did thanks rusk recalled the unpleasantness of eldon tarver making him strip mr barnett you would be surprised at the people who have heard that pitch before and even more surprised at those who have taken me up on it anybody i know barnett climbed onto the top bench yes sir well if thats so tell me what question im about to ask you rusk waited a few moments so as not to make it seem too easy then he said how much is this going to cost me goddamn muttered barnett laughing softly i cant believe it human nature the same all over i guess so whats your answer my answer is what do you care its a hell of a lot less than your net worth but still pricey i bet oh itll hurt rusk conceded but a lot less than the fucking youll take if you go the other way you know you pitch this kind of thing to the wrong man and hes liable to beat the shit out of you hasnt happened yet im a pretty good judge of character a good judge of bad character said barnett its a damn low thing what were talking about but nobody can say she didnt ask for it rusk sat in silence he wasnt thinking about carson g barnett or his doomed wife he was thinking about eldon tarver md he had been unable to reach tarver since their meeting at the hunting camp seventytwo hours ago tarver had neutralized the threat from william braid as promised but he must have done something to alex morse as well otherwise why would morse have sent the threatening text message rusk felt he had done right by turning over the message to the bureau his fbi contacts had painted a picture of morse as a rogue agent already in deep trouble because of the federal reserve bank debacle and with powerful enemies in the hoover building the bureau as a whole represented no danger to him or tarver the obsessive morse on her own was the threat every little straw rusk could pile onto that particular camels back would push her spine closer to breaking being out of contact with tarver was disconcerting but he could not afford to let barnett get away they could earn two to four times their normal fee for this job all he had to do was close the deal and to do that he had to broach the time issue for some it was a deal breaker for others not barnett seemed an impulsive man but he might possess surprising reserves of patience what you doing asked barnett look like youre in a goddamn dreamworld i assume that your intent is to proceed rusk asked id like to hear a few more details first it was a natural question but again it conjured images of a grand jury listening to taped testimony mr barnett have you had any contact with any law enforcement agency about this matter hell no all right theres something you need to understand no one is going to murder your wife she will die of natural causes do you understand there was a long silence i guess i do how fast would it happen not fast you want fast hire a nigger from west jackson youll be in parchman prison three months from now how fast then the likely time frame is twelve to eighteen months jesus if it can be sooner it will be but you should prepare yourself for that wait barnett was nodding slowly another thing it wont be pretty how bad rusk didnt like to use the cword if he could help it terminal illness obviously there doesnt have to be a lot of pain but it takes some fortitude to handle it what about the legal side of things the divorce and all there wont be a divorce there wont be any legal side you and i will not meet again after today one week from now i will park a silver chevrolet impala in the lot of the annandale country club in the trunk you will find a legalsized envelope with printed instructions regarding payment payment is handled in different ways but in your case it will be made using rough diamonds barnett looked as if he was about to ask a question but rusk held up his hand that will all be in your instructions when you pick up that envelope you will leave me a box in that trunk inside the box will be a complete copy of your wifes medical history including everything you can find out about both sets of grandparents copies of all the keys that have any importance in your wifes lifecars houses safedeposit box home safe jewelry boxes blueprints of your

if you agree to go forward now there will be no turning back from the time you leave this building you will be subject to surveillance to insure my safety and that of my associates rusk took a deep breath of wet dense air would you like some time to think about your answer barnett was cradling his face in his hands his dark hair was plastered to his skull and his big shoulders appeared to be shaking rusk wondered if he had pushed too hard sometimes he offered prospects tea and sympathy but with his anxiety about tarver simmering in his gut he hadnt the patience for it how long would a divorce take barnett asked in a cracked voice if your wife agrees to file under irreconcilable differences sixty days if she doesnt it could take forever she wont agree he said his voice desolate she

the opposite what if you went to get the box and found the sheriff waiting by your car barnett asked in a stronger voice it would be a shame about your twins barnett came off the bench quicker than rusk could react the oilman slammed him against the wall and seized his throat with a hand like an iron claw rusk was six inches taller than barnett but the fury burning behind the oilmans eyes left no doubt that he could rip the lawyers heart out if he chose thats not a threat rusk croaked i just want you to be aware that my associates arent the kind of people you cross twenty seconds passed before barnett released his grip is that a yes or a no rusk asked massaging his voice box ive got to do something said barnett i guess this is it im not going to give up the one woman in this world who can bring me some peace there was nothing else to say rusk knew better than to offer his hand you didnt shake hands over a deal as unholy as this he gave barnett a curt nod then reached for the doorknob how do i get into the car barnett asked the impala ill leave a spare key on the left front tire of your car when i leave here you know which vehicle im in the hummer rusk said the red one barnett clarified rusk held up his hand in acknowledgment on his way out chapter alex spent the first hour of her return flight in shock sipping vodka and reliving incidents from her truncated career her sense of being on the outside of no longer being a player in the critical events of the nation was overwhelming but somewhere over eastern tennessee she found herself unable to remain disconnected any longer after the flight attendants finished their beverage service she leaned against the window and surreptitiously switched on her cell phone keeping an eye out for roving glances this was against the law and she no longer had fbi credentials to flash for special treatment finally the phone connected to a network and three voicemail messages popped up she covertly held her phone to her ear and dialed voice mail the first message was from will kilmer i figured id hear from you this morning girl since i didnt im guessing its bad news but you cant let that get you down about four this morning my man in greenwood shot a video of thora shepard and that surgeon in flagrante delicto im emailing a clip of the video to your computer and im gonna send a captured still to your cell phone no sign of andrew rusk or anybody else suspicious in greenwood but that videos a doozy girl i feel bad for the doc hes a nice guy anyway i hope im wrong about the hearing you get your tail back home your mamas still hanging on and we miss you alex felt alternating waves of relief and sadness but she had no time to reflect the second message was from chris shepards receptionist the rental car information alex would need in jackson she scrawled it on the back of an fbi card from her purse then leaned against the window when she heard the voice on the third message her heart nearly stopped the speaker was john kaiser one of the top field agents in the entire fbi kaiser had spent several years working serial homicides for the investigative support unit in quantico virginia but had returned to normal duty at his own request some years ago widely respected throughout the bureau kaiser had spent the past few years based in new orleans where hed solved an artrelated murder case that made international news alex had tried to reach kaiser ten days ago when shed first realized what she might be dealing with but he hadnt returned her calls agents at the new orleans field office claimed he was on an extended vacation with his wife a war photographer named jordan glass so alex had dropped it alex this is john said kaiser im only just now getting back to you because ive been working undercover i havent even been able to contact jordan for the past six weeks when i heard your messages i couldnt believe it i want to hear what else you have youve got my cell number call me anytime alex tried to control the emotions welling up within her there was enough relief to bring tears to her eyes but then a terrible thought struck her kaiser had probably left that message before hearing that shed been suspended she slumped down in the seat and cradled her face in her left hand of all the people in the world whose help she could have wished for kaiser was the man not only that he owed her two years ago kaiser had been taken hostage by a pair of new orleans homicide detectives under investigation for murder for decades the nopd had been crippled by a system of graft so pervasive that it tarnished the citys national reputation in the early s several crescent city cops were convicted of murder and the federal government almost took over the policing of the city ten years later the corruption was still deeprooted kaiser had been pursuing some detectives who were facilitating the flow of hard drugs into the city when one of his informants wore a wire to a meeting in the french quarter the wire was discovered and kaiser burst in to try to prevent his informant from being killed kaiser himself was taken hostage and the detectives barricaded themselves in an apartment on royal street alex had been doing some extra training in atlanta at the time but her rep within the bureau was at its peak a bureau jet flew her to lakefront airport which was right next door to the new orleans field office and then she was rushed to the french quarter in the sacs personal car the negotiation lasted just seven hours but her psychological duel with the sociopathic detectives proved the most grueling of her career twice during the ordeal she had believed that kaiser was about to be executed and once had even believed him dead she learned later that one of the detectives had held his weapon to kaisers head and discharged it at a slight angle which resulted in permanent hearing loss in the fbi agents right ear but preserved his life kaiser had overheard the entire negotiation and he gave alex sole credit for saving his life the two detectives were still serving out the sentences that resulted from the deal that ended the incident alex thought of kaiser she realized that a digital image had been downloading to her phone after it finished she studied the tiny screen with absolute concentration though the resolution was poor the picture showed a nude blond woman standing with her elbows on a balcony rail while a naked man thrust into her from behind the woman was unmistakably thora shepard the balcony glinted dull silver as though made of steel and its architectural look gave alex the feeling she was seeing a balcony of the alluvian hotel if a still photo carried this kind of punch what would watching the video do to thoras husband she took several deep breaths then called john kaisers cell phone kaiser he answered its alex morse john he didnt respond at first then he said i heard what happened this morning im sorry not a good day amigo somethings fucked up when this kind of thing goes down im afraid youre the only one who thinks so i doubt that do you plan to stop working your case she hesitated are you going to report anything i say today you know better than that i cant stop john i know im right and now the doctor whos the next target believes it too he started out skeptical but now he knows this case is crazy you wouldnt believe the crime signature its a team scenarioa lawyer and a medical professionaland theyre killing people by giving them cancer cancer kaiser said softly alex are you sure she closed her eyes positive whats the motive i think its mixed between the perpetrators but at bottom its a divorce attorney saving rich clients millions of dollars by killing their spouses there was a long silence what exactly do you want me to do youre not supposed to do anything dry laughter came through the ether lets say i dont know that what would you want me to do then are you in new orleans now sí drive up to jackson mississippi im on my way there now nonstop flight and no the bureau doesnt know what would we do at this meeting i want you to meet this doctor listen to him then listen to me i need your brain john your experience with homicide its three hours by car please tell me youll come after a long silence kaiser said where do you want to meet alex suggested the cabot lodge near the university medical center kaiser said he could make no promises but that he would try to be there then he hung up energized by the prospect of kaisers assistance she started to dial chris then she remembered the balcony photograph chris would demand to see the video as soon as he heard of its existence what would he do after he saw it drive to shane lansings office and beat him senseless get drunk and simply shut down from despair she had seen men react both ways and there was no way to predict the reaction of course she could forget to mention the photo when she asked chris to meet kaiser but she would pay a price for that later noshe should let chris deal with the pain now that way by the time he got to jackson he might be as committed as she to nailing andrew rusk and his accomplice alex glanced around the cabin again then speeddialed will kilmer chapter chris and ben were sitting on the leather couch in chriss medical office when the cell phone rang chris had taken eight hundred milligrams of ibuprofen and his head was still pounding bens headache was just as bad chris was starting to worry about food poisoning but neither of them had any gastrointestinal symptoms its that hospital phone ben said are you going to answer it truthfully chris didnt feel like it but since there was no way alex could have landed in jackson yet the call had to be important dr shepard he answered for bens benefit chris said alex i need to talk to you are you alone hang on he touched ben on the thigh you lie down here im going to turn off the lights and go in my bathroom to take this call okay ben nodded dispiritedly chris switched off the lights and stepped into his private cubicle okay go ahead will sent me a digital photograph a few minutes ago its a still image captured from a videotape hes probably emailing the video to your address right now its not something that you want to see but you need to see it what is it he asked fear roiling his gut it was shot last night at the alluvian hotel chris wanted to curse but ben would pick up the fury in his voice even through the door he looked at himself in the bathroom mirror his eyes looked like those of a stranger okay thanks he heard himself say im going to check my email can you stay on the phone while you do it he rubbed the base of his throbbing skull id rather not is there anything else yes i need you to come to jackson this afternoon tonight at the latest why to meet an fbi agent named john kaiser hes going to help us who is he one of the top agents in the bureau kaisers a specialist in serial murder why would he help you i thought they fired you theyre going to but kaiser owes me big just watch the video chris after you see that youre going to want to do something the best thing you can do is come to jackson you owe it to yourself and to ben i cant go anywhere even if i wanted to ben is sick i had to pick him up from school whats wrong with him hes got a headache a bad one there was a pause you told me earlier that you had a headache didnt you yeah since this morning huh i need to go alex chris hung up pocketed the phone and left the bathroom who was that asked ben a doctor in new york that im consulting on a case a lady doctor chris sometimes forgot how acute the senses of children were compared to those of adults thats right hows your head it still hurts where does she want you to go jackson i sent a patient up there ben looked pensive can we go home now not yet buddy chris sat beside him and looked at the screen saver on his computer it showed ben sliding into home plate during a game last year the boy had already grown four inches and put on ten pounds chris squeezed bens arm son i need to bring a patient in here lets take you out to mrs janes office you can play games on her insurance computer okay ben shrugged apathetically chris led him to the front office then returned to his own on the way back holly tried to steer him into one of the examining rooms but he held up his hand to ward her off back at his desk he typed in his password and opened his email account the newest message had come from wkilmerargusoperationscom he opened the mail which simply read im sorry doctor shepard sincerely will kilmer at the bottom of the message was an icon indicating that a file was attached chris opted to save the file to his hard drive a little meter popped up on his screen indicating the pace of the download his blood pressure mounted in synchrony with the rightmoving meter then the process was complete and he opened windows media player he sat with his forefinger poised over the mouse button painfully certain that opening this file would change his life forever he felt like one of the patients who sat anxiously on the sofa across from his desk afraid to ask for the test results on the sheet of paper in the doctors hand but there was no use putting it off not in either case there was nothing to be gained and a hell of a lot to lose fuck it he muttered and opened the file first he saw only a steel balcony rail in what appeared to be an enclosed courtyard shot from about twenty feet below it a halfopen french door stood behind the rail the cheep of crickets came from chriss computer speakers but there was no other sound maybe the hum of an air conditioner then a womans laughter shattered the silence chilling chris to the core of his being even before he saw her he knew a muffled female voice protested something but not too seriously then the door flew inward and thora shot from the door to the balcony rail as though shed been pushed she was stark naked squealing like a sorority girl at a chippendales show she tried to run back inside but a man eclipsed in shadow barred the door he grabbed her arms and spun her back to the rail chriss hands clenched into fists as shane lansing stepped onto the balcony his penis jutting out from his body before thora could turn again he grabbed her hips and plunged into her from behind she gasped squealed once more then gripped the rail and braced herself against his thrusts her muscles stood out in stark relief as she endured what quickly became a brutal onslaught her mouth hanging open her eyes almost bulging from her head chris had seen her look that way during the final kick of a marathon when she tested the very limits of her endurance she began to grunt in time to lansings lunging hips her face more animal than human when she began to moan her catlike howls reverberating off the courtyard walls chris glanced worriedly at his office door he reached for the volume knob on his speakers but before he could turn it lansing covered thoras mouth with his hand yanked back her head and began pounding her taut abdomen against the rail as chris waited for the inevitable climax a wave of nausea suddenly overcame the shock that had held him rooted to his chair he jumped up and ran into his private bathroom where he dropped to his knees and ejected what remained of his lunch into the toilet dr shepard called a female voice holly his nurse by the time he got back to his desk the screen had mercifully gone black what is it he called knowing his face was probably red with anger are you all right yeah come in he got up and stepped back into his bathroom where he wet a towel and wiped his face im just feeling a little tired i dont blame you all that baseball at night im worn slap out myself when chris looked back holly was sitting in front of his computer fanning herself with a magazine if she clicked his mouse the balcony video would start to roll he moved behind her and squeezed her shoulders which surprised her but which also got her out of the chair more quickly his only thought was getting back into that chair to extinguish the possibility of the nightmare being displayed again ive been looking for those results on mrs young holly said have you seen them no she studied him without speaking then hesitantly she said nancy finished with mr martins xrays hes been waiting in room three for a good while im coming chris snapped hollys mouth dropped open she turned and left without a word some morbid part of him wanted to reopen the video file but he resisted the urge his mind was filled with images dating to the day he had first noticed thora rayner on a ward in st catherines hospital the video now residing on his hard drive seemed incomprehensible in light of all they had done since that day how could the woman who had so devotedly cared for her dying husband so casually betray a man who loved her as chris did how could she throw away a father who had bonded so deeply with her son it was beyond him the denial that had slowly been crumbling since alex morses arrival finally lay in ruins at his feet yet anger had not replaced it he had moved directly into grief an unbearably heavy pall that brought with it paralyzing numbness his cell phone was ringing again alex of course he picked up the phone but did not answer a juvenile response he couldnt afford paralysis any moment now holly would knock at the door again patients waiting he also had ben up front playing computer games but wanting more than anything to go home with his dad his dad chris thought im not his dad not really hes not flesh of my flesh ive legally adopted him but what would happen in a divorce i know what ben would want as crazy as that seems even thora has attributed his newfound happiness and improved grades to having me in his life but what would a judge say the cell stopped ringing as though moving underwater chris opened the clamshell phone and pressed the button that would connect him to alex she answered on the first ring are you all right she asked i know seeing that that was rough yep im so sorry chris are you of course all i care about in this is you and ben thats not true you want to nail andrew rusk this gave her pause well yes but not out of some cheap sense of vengeance its for grace and for you and for all the other people whose lives have been destroyed chris said nothing he waited for a fresh sales pitch but none came alex waited in silence as well he was about to speak when she said whatever you do please dont tell thora what you know stop worrying we already talked about that but its different now isnt it listen to me chris im assuming you want to be the one ben lives with when this is all over he remained silent im not just an fbi agent you know im also a lawyer and the best way to ensure that you get custody of ben is to make sure thora is punished for attempted murder anger flooded through him im supposed to help ben by putting his mother in jail in a word yes thats great alex theres something else something thats scaring me what is it you and ben both have headaches right yes uncle will has one too a bad one chris thought about this hes had it since this morning alex continued he took some aspirin but it wont go away a strange buzzing started in chriss head did you hear me i heard you what do you think i dont like it it seemed like too much coincidence to me too but i dont see what could have happened i mean will was guarding you all night right he was passed out in my easy chair all night what he drank three beers and went out like a light shit a sudden image of alexs room at the days inn flashed into chriss mind the wounded coral snake writhing in the bathroom the dead cat lying on the floor alex is there anything i need to know that you havent told me another pause goddamn it what are you holding back nothing i just tell me i spoke to will again right before i called you his detective found out how lansing has been getting here and back theres a small charter service out at the local airport crop dusters mostly but the local farmers use it to fly to houston and memphis stuff like that lansing called from natchez a few days ago and arranged to get roundtrip flights from the natchez airport to greenwood and back he flies in there after dark and flies out about dawn hes been commuting to screw thoras brains out pretty much yeah is her girlfriend even up there laura canning yes shes covering for thora chris slammed his hand down on his desk anger was finally coming to the surface goddamn it chris wait hold on a sec what wills calling me back it must be important she clicked him into hold mode the wait seemed to stretch forever chris she said after another click yeah theres more and its bad some deep part of him tensed against the unknown tell me will has been checking into shane lansings business affairs you know lansing has his hand in a lot of stuff right yeah truck stops with gambling restaurants nursing homes all kinds of shit well it seems hes also part owner of a radiation oncology clinic in meridian mississippi the humanity cancer care center chris felt as though his core temperature had dropped ten degrees are you kidding no will just found this out but that means lansing has access to i know cesium pellets liquid iodine radiationtreatment machineryeverything butyou told me these crimes go back like five years right yes then how could lansing be a part of it i mean if thora just went to see andrew rusk a couple of weeks ago how could rusk possibly have found lansing and hired him to kill me in that time the time frame doesnt make sense thoras an atypical client for rusk said alex thereve only been two other female clients that i know about wait chris cut in red simmons exactly thora may have used andrew rusk three years ago to have red simmons killed if so she first contacted rusk at least three years ago and possibly as long as seven she could have even met shane lansing through rusk but red didnt die of cancer neither did my sister chriss thoughts were tumbling over themselves but beneath the rational level of his mind something else was happening fear and anger were melding into a kind of dark desperation whose only outlet could be action what time did you say this friend of yours would be in jackson as soon as he can get there said alex relief suffusing her voice if you leave within the hour youll probably get there the same time kaiser does good youre coming oh yeah thank you chris dont thank me this is survival now alex started to say something but he hung up and put the phone in his desk drawer after closing his email account he walked down to toms end of the clinic toms chief nurse melba price was standing outside the door to exam room melba was quick to read nonverbal clues in patients and colleagues alike this skill had made her toms right hand for more than twenty years i need to see him melba chris said as soon as possible hes just finishing up she gave chris a sidelong glance i heard about you and dr lansing chris grimaced none of my business melba went on but a lot of peoples been wanting to do what you did for a long time tom cages goodhumored baritone reverberated through the heavy wooden door chris heard the squeak of a chair a booming farewell and then tom stepped into the hall surprise on his face hey slugger he said whats up i need to talk to you lets go in my office chris shook his head do you have an exam room open tom looked at melba number five she said chris led the way after tom closed the door he looked at his young partner with paternal concern whats going on chris i didnt mean to tease you about lansing hes just such an unmitigated prick chris looked back at his mentor realizing perhaps for the first time how much older tom cage really was tom had started practicing medicine in hed grown up in an era when antibiotics did not exist yet hed lived to practice in the era of the pet scan and gene therapy i need you to do me a favor tom no questions asked the older man nodded soberly name it i want you to examine me my whole body what am i looking for are you having symptoms tom was thinking what chris would be thinking in the same situation most doctors at some time in their life suspect that theyre dying of a terminal illness they know too much see too much and even the slightest symptom can bring on fears of fatal disease ive got a severe headache chris said but thats not really the problem i have reason to suspectsomething i want you to go over every inch of my body with a light even a magnifying glass if you need it what am i looking for anything abnormal a needle mark a bruise a lesion a small incision i want you to start inside my mouth tom stared at him for a long time chris could almost see the questions turning inside his mind but in the end tom only said youd better strip and get on the table while chris removed his clothes tom donned a leather headpiece with a light mounted on it chris climbed onto the examining table and lay on his back my eyes arent what they used to be said tom but i found a melanoma yesterday so tiny you wouldnt believe it start in your mouth you say chris opened wide tom took a tongue depressor from a jar and used it to expose chriss gums and mucosa then he took a small mirror from a drawer and cursing quietly began to check chriss mouth goddamn it tom muttered this is like spelunking chris made a guttural sound of acknowledgment looks clear to me tom withdrew the tongue depressor remember to floss after every meal chris was in no mood for levity but tom gave him a wry look anyway okay what now look under my hair chris said flashing back to gregory peck in the omen as tom carefully worked his way across chriss scalp he said i dont see anything but incipient malepattern baldness good now my skin every inch of it tom started at chriss neck and moved down his trunk im glad youre not a hairy bastard he said moving the light across chriss sternum okaygetting to the family jewels now every crack and crevice chris felt toms gloved hands lift his testicles then check his penis the hole too jesus tom checked him there then moved back to his shoulders he checked both underarms then the extremities between my toes too this reminds me of my internship tom said i worked several months in the orleans parish prison the cops used to have me check between suspects toes for needle marks same deal chris said turning onto his stomach lets get the worst over first tom said and chris felt cold hands pulling his cheeks apart he expected tom to release them immediately but he didnt what do you see im not sure tom murmured looks like maybe an injection site chriss breath died in his throat are you serious afraid so looks like somebody stuck in a needle and you tried to jerk away like a scared toddler you know theres definite bruising outside the anus or in right at the opening this is weird chris are you going to tell me whats going on chris got off the table and pulled on his pants we need to check ben too toms eyes went wide what im dead serious hes in the front office now ben has the same headache i do ill tell him were checking for pinworms tom stared at chris as though worried he might be drunk im not crazy tom i wish i was will you stay in here with me while i check ben im sure as hell not leaving you alone with him said toms eyes chris skidded into the driveway at the elgin house his heart pounding with anger and fear on the passenger seat beside him was a wooden case hed borrowed from the radiologist at st catherines hospital the image of ben lying on his back on the exam table haunted him even more than the video of thora on the hotel balcony what are you looking for ben had asked chris had lied and tom had lied to cover for him but there was no banishing the look of disapproval on the older physicians face tom cage suspected something seriously irregular and in the same situation chris probably would have too he would have to rely on the goodwill he had built up over nine months of practicing with tom to carry the day after checking ben for marks and not finding them chris had put the boy back in his receptionists care and shut himself in his office he had no idea what might have been injected into him but the thing that kept coming back to him was alexs revelation that shane lansing had access to radioactive materials added to this was pete connollys assertion that radiation would be the easiest method of intentionally causing cancer in a human being given those two facts what did the needle mark near his rectum mean had a radioactive liquid been injected into him or could pellets small enough to pass through a needle have been shot into his bloodstream he tried to recall what connolly had said about irradiated thallium being used to assassinate someone but it was difficult to concentrate with fear ballooning in his chest forcing himself under control chris walked down the hall to the xray room and asked nancy somers their tech to shoot an xray of his midsection nancy looked nonplussed by this request but she wasnt about to refuse her employer chris grabbed a paper gown stripped beside the big machine then donned the oversize napkin and climbed onto the cold table nancy adjusted the voltage then shot the picture two minutes later chris was jamming the xray into the clip of the lightbox in the viewing room what are you looking for tom asked from behind him overexposure chris could hardly speak as he scanned the xray he was terrified of seeing black spots caused by radioactive emissions overexposing the film yet though he squinted at every inch of the film he saw nothing abnormal looks fine to me tom said does this have to do with the needle mark chris nodded then he felt toms hand on his shoulder whats going on son talk to me there was no hiding it anymore chris turned to his partner and said somebodys trying to kill me tom after a shocked silence tom said who thora the older mans eyes narrowed can you substantiate that no but im working with an fbi agent to prove it tom nodded slowly is shane lansing tied up in this somehow i believe so did you know that he owns part of a radiation oncology center in meridian as tom shook his head chris saw the old docs mind working quickly behind his wise eyes it wouldnt take him long to connect the dots sounds to me like you need some time off tom said chris gratefully shook toms hand then collected ben and a few other things and left the office his headache was still going strong but bens had started to subside the boy wanted to stay with his dad of course but chris insisted on dropping him at mrs johnsons house the widow had cared for ben since before thora married chris and she loved him like her own she promised to keep ben overnight if necessary all chris had to do was call he left a bottle of advil and a stronger analgesic with her just in case bens headache returned now that hed arrived at the elgin house he charged inside with the wooden case hed borrowed from the hospital cutting into the laundry room he opened his toolbox and took out a razorsharp buck knife with the knife and a pair of pliers in one hand and the case in the other he ran back to the master bedroom first he tore the bedclothes off the kingsize bed exposing the pillowtop mattress beneath with his eyes only six inches from the cover he examined the entire surface of the mattress focusing on his side of the bed he saw no sign of tampering but that meant nothing kneeling beside the bed he opened the wooden case hed brought from st catherines inside was a geiger counter borrowed from the radiology department at the hospital the radiologist had told him that aside from checking for spills after certain procedures the counter was supposed to double for civil defense use after a nuclear attack chris switched on the counter dreading the clickclickclick that would herald the presence of radioactivity but the machine only emitted a faint hum the geiger counter had a carrying handle and a wand attached to it by a flexible cable chris moved the wand over the entire surface of the bed but he heard no clicks setting the counter aside he stabbed the buck knife into the mattress at the spot where his head would normally lie and ripped it open from head to foot using the teeth of the pliers he tore through dense foam padding throwing chunks of it around the bedroom but again he found nothing sweating and exasperated he stared around the room where would they put it he wondered where would i get sufficient exposure he picked up the geiger counter and ran down the hall to the den to the easy chair where will kilmer had spent the night in beerinduced slumber the buck knife made short work of the chair seat but when chris passed the wand over the wreckage that remained he heard nothing he realized then that he had almost been hoping for the telltale click why he asked himself because nothing is worse than not knowing that was his problem he had no idea what the needle mark meant had someone injected something merely to sedate him while they violated him in some other way that might be the answer given that ben and kilmer both had headaches too yet chris had found no needle mark on ben had bens injection site simply been more successfully concealed or had they all been sedated in some other way while only chris was attacked through hypodermic injection he had no way to know not without sophisticated medical testing the only poison he was likely to discover on his own was radiation and lansings tie to the radiation clinic in meridian increased the odds that radiation was the method of attack chris stared around the kitchen his mind spinning could it be in the shower sometimes he sat for half an hour on the shower seat relaxing under a nearscalding stream of water butno they would have had to dig out a tile to plant a pellet there then it hit him my truck he ran out to the garage and held the wand of the geiger counter over the drivers seat of his pickup all he heard was a steady hum he wanted to rip open the seat anyway but he knew that was pointless if there was enough radiation to give him cancer in that seat the geiger counter would have detected it he started to switch off the machine but an almost paralyzing terror stopped him nancy had only shot an xray of his trunk what if the radiation source had been placed elsewhere near a marrow reservoir in his femur say or what if it was moving through his body standing in his garage chris stripped naked then held the wand at his feet and began moving up along each leg what would he do if the machine started clicking probably cut out the offending pellet with the buck knife unless he could somehow muster the patience to drive back to the office and have tom cut it out using local anesthetic despite the normal xray he felt himself tense when he came to his genitals and rectum no click almost unwilling to believe the silence he kept moving north until he reached his scalp then he switched off the machine he felt like puking some childish part of him wanted to believe that it was all bullshit that alex morse was as crazy as a road lizard but tom had found something and chris had seen shane lansing screwing thora on that balcony and lansing was part owner of a radiation oncology center and then there were the headaches three out of three people on the same day that couldnt be coincidence there was no escaping the truth grace fennells killer had struck again last night his victim was chris shepard chapter neville byrd lay on the bed in his hotel room and stared openmouthed at the screen of his notebook computer he was masturbating thanks to the scope hed mounted on the marriotts roof he could watch andrew rusks secretary lying spreadeagled on rusks desk while the lawyer pounded her for all he was worth this was lightyears better than the payperview porn flickering on his tv screen this was real and he was getting it all on videotape he made a mental note to dub himself a copy for later whack use before he gave the original to dr traver the secretary got off the desk turned her back to rusk and leaned over the wood rusk took hold of her hips went into her and continued his attack the guy must be angry at her neville thought the way he was hammering her relentless man neville had never fucked like that personally he wasnt sure he could rusk was one of those guys who worked out all the time went surfing mountain climbing the works maybe all that shit paid off during sex because this was marathon stuff fortyfive minutes without a break not even a pause for water then suddenly it was over rusk pulled out of her and walked out of the frame leaving the secretary to mop herself up with kleenex from the desk neville yanked for all he was worth and brought himself to a screaming climax before she could vanish too sure enough the secretary soon limped out of the frame rusk reappeared fully dressed again he sat at his keyboard and checked his watch then he lifted his right hand and started working his mouse a few clicks and then he typed several strokes on his keyboard neville checked his other computer the one giving the readout from the laser rig then he began to laugh rusk had typed in pi to the ninth decimal place a password neville could appreciate he recorded a few more seconds then rewound the image and zoomed in on rusks monitor he saw what looked like a black holeor the event horizon surrounding one then this image was replaced by the gateway of a web site he had seen yesterday ex nihilo booya neville shouted he had pegged ex nihilo yesterday but hed needed another day to confirm his suspicion now andrew rusk was entering a deeper level of the site and typing another password to confirm his identity this was the key to the mechanism that rusk had created to protect himself neville was tempted to log into ex nihilo himself and do a little scoping but traver had told him not to waste a moment as he dialed the number the vet had given him he was tempted to press for a higher fee after all he was holding the cards now what did he have to lose traver was just a graybearded old veterinarian but then againhe had known about the laser and the scope your average puppy doctor didnt know that kind of shit such knowledge pointed to something else something in the intelligence line or even the military nah neville thought ill take my money and boogie after all hes already paying double rates eldon tarver sat alone in his office at the university medical center studying numbers on a stack of paper in front of him his research assistant had given him the most recent data on the in vitro testing and all it did was point up the inherent shortcomings of laboratorybased research but only part of dr tarvers mind was occupied with this problem on a deeper level he was working out his next move he had received several false spams from andrew rusk the viagra ads that constituted their agreed signal for a meeting at the annandale golf club but dr tarver had not gone to the club nor had he driven the fortyfive miles to chickamauga hunting camp despite the aluminum foil glinting brightly from the sixteenthfloor window of the amsouth tower since yesterday he chuckled at the idea of andrew rusk standing in the oppressive heat of chickamauga waiting for someone who would never arrive rusk was probably freaking out because he had pitched the new potential client he had boasted about rusk lived for money for the status he believed it conferred on him and he would do anything to get it even with the risk quotient rising daily all he could think about was the next big score dr tarver knew that score would never happen their collaboration was over christopher shepards injection marked the end eldon would have liked to have another year or so but there was no use crying about it it was time to move on he was already shutting down the primate lab the dogbreeding facility he would sell hed had a buyer waiting in the wings for some time only one problem remained rusk himself for five years now dr tarver and the lawyer had had an escape plan in place one that would allow them to leave the united states and live in safety and relative luxury for the rest of their lives the only problem with that planuntil recentlywas that when it came right down to it neither of them wanted to leave the united states the heyday of nonextradition havens such as costa rica and tenerife was long past the diplomatic corps had been working like a busy little beehive to sew up every loophole that allowed tax evaders to flee to island paradises and by so doing they had also closed the doors to criminals of other stripes andrew rusks jimmy buffett fantasy of frozen margaritas and willing senoritas had died a quick death as soon as they looked into it for real sure there were still places that wouldnt play ball with uncle samhellholes like mali or chad or burundi but if you wanted to commit lucrative crimes and get away in style you had to be creative using intelligence connections that dated back to the late s dr tarver had worked out a oneofakind deal for the two of them a deal worthy of a greedy lawyers fantasy but not worthy of a dedicated scientist not anymore dr tarvers primary goal was not spending his accumulated funds in the most hedonistic way imaginable he had ongoing research projects to maintain and he preferred to remain in the united states to do that after all his in vivo subjects resided in the us moreover five years of working with andrew rusk had convinced him that he never wanted to see the lawyer again rusk was an accident waiting to happen eldon could see him sitting at a bar with an umbrella drink in his hand bragging to some expatriate real estate developer or record company exec about how he had saved the rich and famous millions by snuffing their wives no thanks the irony was eldon had always had a choice of escape routes there had always been countries ready and willing to pay him to work for them some of the offers had been quite tempting the money was staggering and as for government interferenceforget it the only problem with that scenario was that eldon tarver was a patriot and the countries who wanted to pay for his services were simply the wrong ones eldon remembered a time when the research climate in america had been supportive a golden age when government and industry and the military had worked hand in hand but now you had shrieking ivy league brats throwing cans of red paint on scientists who might someday save their pathetic lives it made him homicidally angry to think about it there were still a few people in the corridors of power who remembered how it used to beand how it would be in the future and the golden age would inevitably return because war was eternal cyclical maybe but eternal and real war not shitty little conflicts like iraq or afghanistan allout war that put the holy motherland at risk that amped up even heartontheirsleeve liberals until they were ready to bayonet any bastard who came over the wire and when people got like that the research climate got very favorable very fast edward biddle remembered the good old days and not merely with nostalgia biddle worked tirelessly to prepare for the day when things went bad again it had been major biddle when he worked with dr tarver at the vcp the major had been a liaison of sorts between the army corporate america and academia he had eventually risen to the rank of general long after the project was terminated of course after retirement biddle had joined the transgene corporation one of the many granddaughters of bering biomedical the chief corporate beneficiary of the vcp the project that had brought tarver and biddle together five years they had worked side by side longer if you counted the prep work and dismantling of the project they had accomplished some miraculous things too despite the fact that the technology just wasnt there yet they hadnt lacked for ideas but so much of the technology theyd needed to bring the ideas to fruition had simply not yet been invented sequencing the human genome had been a pipe dream in even in when the army got some real control in the project successfully mapping the genome lay more than a quarter century in the future yet stillthey had accomplished so much dr tarver looked over at his wall of respect where a picture of him and biddle hung biddle was wearing his majors uniform tarver a white coat with vcp emblazoned on its breast in the background stood one of the lab buildings at fort detrick maryland the vcp had started as an academic project but they had eventually moved everything to detrick it was the only place that could handle the risks there was a woman in the picture with them a leggy blonde named wyck she had represented bering at detrick unusual for a woman in those days degrees in microbiology and statistical analysis no less eldon had lusted after her until he figured out that biddle was banging her quite a shock at the time he recalled but understandable wyck was fascinated by power and biddle had it a free rein within certain limits wyck had possessed power of her own and you could see that in the picture her eyes shone with confidence and her face practically glowed with energy with pleasure at being there in that place at that time bookended by two men who wanted her in their beds dr tarver started at the sound of his cell phone he stared a few moments longer at the photo one of many on the wall then looked down at the caller id and answered dr traver its neville byrd doctor yes ive got it sir i mean i think i do got what the thing rusk is doing to protect himself two days in a row near the end of the day hes logged on to this one web site and entered a series of passwords all at the same site dr tarvers pulse quickened did you record his keystrokes yes sir every one fax them to me are you at the fax number you gave me no take this down dr tarver read off the fax number of his university office do you have that yes sir ill send the keystrokes through but i can give you the site right now if you want to check it out its called ex nihilo its a dutch site and it exists solely to let people be anonymous on the net this sounds very promising yes sir and dr traver yes this guy rusk is screwing his secretarys brains out is he nevilles voice changed i thought you might want to know that thank you please send the data through coming up sir dr tarver chuckled as he hung up ten seconds later he was staring at the black hole that welcomed visitors to the world of ex nihilo one click took him to a page that listed the companys available services it was obvious that ex nihilo could handle the kind of arrangement that eldon suspected rusk was paying them to handle if the price was right of course thirty seconds later neville byrds fax came through two pages of keystrokes the keys to andrew rusks life my god said dr tarver using rusks passwords to retrace the lawyers digital footsteps it was just as he had suspected each day rusk would log on to the site and verify his existence by entering a sequence of passwords if he failed to do this for ten consecutive days ex nihilo would forward the contents of a large digital file to the mississippi state police and to the fbi eldon tried to open the file but the site refused to allow it he cursed and tried again no dice he needed a separate password to open the file obviously rusk had not accessed the file since creating it which meant that nevilles laser system had been unable to record him opening it without the password eldon could not delete the file it doesnt matter he told himself as long as he logged on to ex nihilo once a dayas andrew ruskthe system would not send out its destructive file and he would remain safe he could kill andrew rusk five minutes from now and nothing would happen to him eldon laughed it started as a chuckle then grew in his chest to a rolling heaving barrel of laughter ex nihilo changed everything by faxing him those passwords an outofwork software engineer named neville byrd had cut the thread holding the sword above his head with those passwords in his possession eldon could write andrew rusk right out of his plans or he thought with a unexpected thrill i could rewrite them with a much different ending from the beginning eldon had demanded his fee in uncut diamonds rusk had groused at first but he soon realized the wisdom of this system of payment unlike cash rough diamonds were immune to both fire and water they could be buried for years if they had not been engraved with id numbers in their source country they could not be traced any cash deposit over had to be reported to the irs but you could carry worth of uncut diamonds in your mouth without detection and more elsewhere in your body without discomfort you could hold millions of dollars worth in a safedeposit box but why risk it you could bury them in your backyard and no one could ever deny you access to them with a judicial writ best of all when it came time to move them they looked like rocks a box of rocks eldon laughed again hed built up quite a rock collection over the past five years rusk had too albeit a smaller one rusk had taken his early payments in the form of inclusion in the business deals of his wealthy clients hed thought this was a brilliant stroke that could keep him on the legitimate side of the irs and he was right to that extent rusk paid taxes on the earnings and that kept the irs off his back it did not however make what he had done to earn those profits legal and as the business connections multiplied so accrued his traceable connections to a list of murders and that eldon was almost sure was what had brought special agent alex morse down on their backs rusk had realized the error of his ways after a couple of years he too had started taking his fee in uncut diamonds now and then he accepted a business deal as payment as with the fennell deal but he had quite a box of rocks built up by now as well the only question was where did he keep them if eldon could learn the answer to that question he could make the transition to his next life as a much richer man he would be a fool not to add rusks stash to his own if he could and i can he thought with satisfaction rusk doesnt have the sand to hold out under duress all that mountain climbing and skydiving and running marathons wont add up to five minutes of guts in the face of true pain it was time for drastic measures it was time to call in his markersall of them and that meant edward biddle eldon hadnt spoken to biddle in over two years not since the transgene man had delivered the gas canisters to him biddle seemed to feel that the less he knew the safer he was still the gas delivery had made one thing clear biddle was living up to his promise to take care of my people and his people were of course the former staff members of the vcp not everyone but the dedicated few who had understood the true relationship between technology and life every scientific discovery was a twoedged sword a scalpel could cut out a patients tumor or slit his carotid artery morphine could extinguish pain or extinguish life a viral infection could deliver lifesaving gene therapy or cause a global holocaust it was the responsibility of some to discover and develop those potentialities others would make decisions about how to use them eldon had always understood his place in this hierarchy and edward biddle had valued him for that he flipped through the rolodex on his desktophe still preferred it to a computerbased organizerand found biddles card edward biddle vice president transgene corporation and below that america leading the world dr tarver loved them for that for having the balls to put it right on the card in the socalled age of globalization but transgene could say it and dare anyone to gripe about it microbiology was one arena in which america had kept its competitive lead look at the koreans and their cloning scam our cloning works better because we keep human beings in our labs to babysit the cells every night who did they think they were kidding with that warmandfuzzy bullshit sure enough the truth had finally come out as it always did in science you could bluff for a while but not forever and therein lay the cruel beauty of science there was nothing warm and fuzzy about it science was truth and truth didnt care a fig for morality dr tarver dialed the number on edward biddles card it rang twice and then a clipped voice accustomed to command answered this is biddle this is eldon tarver general an ironylaced laugh came down the line hello doctor what can i do for you its time for me to relocate a brief pause do you have a destination in mind id like to remain incountry i see im almost certain to require a new identity i understand not a moments hesitation a good sign i know youve been doing research at the university of mississippi medical center ive been following that off and on its interesting stuff as far as it goes but i cant help but feel youre not making full use of your talents there it was tarvers turn to laugh the regulations on research are pretty claustrophobic these days for that reason ive been carrying out some private studies for some time five years to be exact interesting in what area very similar to what we were doing at the vcp is that so deep interest now yes sir you might say i picked up where we left off only this time i had the equipment i needed very interesting yes sir and ah these are not in vitro experiments im talking about these are in vivo studies primate studies biddle asked higher primates sir exclusively im very intrigued eldon i have a feeling your work might dovetail nicely with some things our more adventurous people have been doing at transgene likeminded colleagues would be a nice change i expect so what sort of time frame do you have in mind for your relocation two or three days if possible maybe sooner a brief pause thats certainly possible you and i should speak facetoface if i flew down in the next couple of days could we meet eldon smiled with satisfaction biddle had taken the bait now he need only set the hook and that he would do facetoface absolutely sir good ill call you later thank you sir you too eldon its good to be working with you again you too dr tarver hung up then logged into his anonymous email account and sent rusk a copy of their cheap viagra cheap spam in it below the ad pitch he inserted the line satisfy the youngest chicks the word chick in all caps meant that rusk should meet him tomorrow at the chickamauga hunting club rather than the annandale golf club it was dr tarvers version of reynolds wrap in a window his crisis code after logging out of the account he removed biddles card from his rolodex and put it in his pocket then he folded the faxed pages that neville byrd had sent him and slid them into the same pocket his whole future in a single pocket only one threat to that future existed andrew rusk without rusk alex morse could not connect eldon tarver to any crime and by tomorrow nightif biddle lived up to eldons expectationsrusk would be dead and his cache of diamonds would be part of eldon tarvers unreportedasset portfolio eldon stood and went into the hall then locked his office and walked down the corridor to see the chief of oncology chapter alex was alone as she rode the elevator to the fifth floor of the university medical center her excitement at the possibility of john kaisers help exploded by chriss news that hed probably been injected with something during the night since kaiser was still an hour south of jackson and since umc was practically across the street from the cabot lodge shed decided to visit her mother when the elevator doors opened she walked down to the adult oncology wing not a place of gladness despite the efforts of families and nurses to nurture a hopeful atmosphere alex was thankful that the pediatric cases had their own hospital she might not have been able to endure them in her present emotional state she found her mother much as she had left her two days ago her liver was larger her skin yellower her kidneys deader her belly more bloated her ovarian cancer had proved atypical invading areas and organs usually spared by that diseaseyet still she clung to life to life but not to consciousness thank god alex sat beside her holding the limp and sweaty hand trying to fight off waves of despair at times like this it seemed there was no happiness in the world if there was it was unknowing the happiness of children who had not yet learned what lay behind the masks of the adults they saw each day and night the people alex knew seemed bent on destroying whatever happiness they might have found as though unable to tolerate the hell of living with what theyd once thought they wanted she wondered if human beings had ever been meant to attain the things they desired of course that question presupposed some divine intent inherent in the world whereas most of the evidence she had seen contradicted this idea she hoped that if the day ever came that she found a man who loved her as she dreamed of being loved she would be content to love him in return she believed she would if only because she had lost so much and so young unlike most people shed encountered alex knew in her bones that existence was terribly fragile a flickering flame that could be extinguished at any moment without cause or justice she checked her watch chris would arrive soon and kaiser not long after she squeezed her mothers hand then wrote a brief note for the nurses to read to her later dear mom i was here i love you i hope it doesnt hurt too much im close by and ill be back soon i love you alexandra alexandra she said getting up and walking into the hall never in her life had she felt like an alexandra yet margaret morse had spent most of her life trying to force her daughter to become one girlie outfits pink hair ribbons debutante balls sorority recommendationschrist alex stepped aside for a group of whitecoated doctors walking together most looked five years younger than she was interns a couple of the women were staring at her face they were curious about the scars and they were probably wondering how they would deal with something like that they saw people with infirmities and afflictions every day but most of that they shut out by force of will aided by the separation implicit in a wide age difference but when they saw her a woman like themeven prettier than they weredisfigured by fate it scared them when alex reached the elevator she found a man already waiting in front of it she stood behind his big white coat waiting for the car to come hospital smells permeated the air alcohol harsh disinfectant god knew what else there were highly resistant bacteria on every surface in this place waiting to find some portal into a warm wet body so that they could multiply into the millions then billions until they had wiped out the host that nourished them for their brief stay on earth a bell dinged softly alex walked into the elevator behind the whitecoated man another white coat was waiting inside both members of the same exclusive club the world within the world of the hospital inhuman humans with faces whose smiles never quite reached their eyes who dealt each day with death and thus denied it with twice the fervor of average citizens the man already on board the elevator backed away from the larger newcomer and stood in the cars right rear corner the big man took the left corner by unwritten law alex took one of the remaining cornersright front near the buttonsand stood facing the door the elevator smelled new and its doors were polished until reflective in the blurred reflection alex saw that the big man had a beard and also a flaming birthmark above it it must be bad she thought to show even in the dim reflection the elevator stopped on the third floor and the man directly behind her walked out as the doors closed alex backed into the spot that hed occupied the man with the birthmark looked over and nodded but instead of looking away afterward he continued to study her this broke one of the unwritten laws but alex figured that her scars had drawn his attentionhis professional attention shotgun asked the man touching his own cheek she colored deeply he was the first one to guess right some doctors knew that her particular kind of scarring was caused by gunshot but since so much of the mess had been made by flying glass most guessed wrong maybe he was a trauma surgeon yes she said i dont mean to make you uncomfortable i can relate to having people stare at your face alex stared back the big bearded man was about sixty with a deep voice that had probably reassured ten thousand patients over the years is that a birthmark he smiled not technically its an arteriovenous anomaly its not bad when youre born but when you hit puberty it suddenly explodes into this alex started to ask a question but as though reading her mind the stranger said surgery often makes it worse i dont want to risk that she nodded he wasnt handsome but he would certainly have been decentlooking without that awful web of indigo and scarlet on his left cheek the bell dinged again good afternoon said the man then he walked out alex stood there in a trance thinking of the day at the bank of the flying glass she had seen only as flashes of light and of james broadbent lying on the floor with his chest smashed into something his wife would weep to see miss the man with the birthmark was back he was holding the door open with his elbow this is the lobby oh im sorry thank you he nodded and waited until she had cleared the doors to let them go tough night my mother is dying genuine sympathy furrowed his brow you got on at oncology is it cancer alex nodded ovarian the man shook his head like a consoling priest a terrible disease i hope she doesnt suffer too much i think she already has he sighed heavily im sorry will you be all right yes im right over at the cabot lodge he smiled good they know how to take care of people over there yes thank you again anytime the man gave her a small wave then walked down a hall that led deep into the bowels of the hospital the floor had colored lines painted on it red lines and green lines and yellow lines and even black ones alex wondered whether if you knew all the color codes you might guess your prognosis by where you were sent probably not the yellow line might take you to mcdonalds for all she knew there was a mcdonalds in the hospital somewhere as she hitched her purse over her shoulder and walked out into the dusk her cell phone chirped it was a text message from john kaiser im at gallman ms mins away see u soon she needed to hurry will kilmer was supposed to meet her in the lobby of the cabot lodge with an unregistered gun she wanted to hide it upstairs before kaiser arrived he wouldnt like the idea of her carrying while suspended even if he understood it would make his position more difficult alex caught sight of her car across the huge parking lot and started running eldon tarver stood at the window of the secondfloor doctors lounge and watched special agent morse jog across the parking lot she ran with purpose her head well forward like a sprinters not like the hobbyists he saw jogging all the time as he stared he felt a neareuphoric sense of triumph flowing through him she doesnt know me he said softly she was three feet awayshe looked right into my face she heard my voiceand she didnt recognize me the fact that his beard hid the wound shed given him undoubtedly helped are you talking to me asked a female resident sitting on the couch behind him no he heard the girl shift on the couch she was probably pissed off that he was here the slut had probably told some attending to meet her for a quick fuck and now hed screwed up their plans eldon felt so invulnerable in this moment that he considered locking the door and bending her over the counter of the little kitchenette showing her what penetration really was take it easy said his inner censor everything is falling your way and it was first neville byrd had discovered the ex nihilo site and now alex morse had walked right into his hands shed even given him the name of her hotel eldon didnt believe in fate but it was hard not to see jungian patterns in all this of course it was also possible that morse was deeper than hed been led to believe rusks judgment could not be trusted and morse had risen to stardom in the fbi that shed disobeyed orders was more a recommendation than a black mark to dr tarver especially in a rulebound bureaucracy like the fbi yes he decided their whole conversation could have been a performance and even if it wasnteven if morse really had no idea who he wascould he take the chance that he was wrong his policy had always been zero risk and that policy had served him well he had been committing felonies almost daily for five years some of them capital crimes yet he was not in jail it was time to call biddle back chapter alex had to park a hundred yards from the lobby of the cabot lodge when she trudged through the double doors to check in she saw chris sitting in a chair against the wall to her right his head was bent over his knees and he was rubbing his temples like a man with a migraine she walked over and crouched beside him chris he looked up with redrimmed eyes hey my god hows your headache a little better my stomachs the problem now do you have any new information he groaned softly i talked to pete connolly again he wants me to fly up to sloankettering today then you should do that chris shrugged with a fatalistic air actually i can take the same drugs here that he can give me there tom cage already called in a prescription for some strong antiviral drugs azt ritonavir enfuvirtide and vidarabine i think thats why im nauseated does connolly think those will work chris laughed darkly how can he know that when he doesnt know what was injected into me pete thinks i should start intensive iv chemotherapy as well then why havent you done that there are serious risks a lot of chemotherapy drugs are carcinogenic themselves im not sure im desperate enough to try that but connolly thinks that blasting me as soon as possible gives me the greatest chance of survival alex tried to follow the logic how could chemotherapy help you if you dont have cancer yet chris stood slowly took hold of her arm for balance then looked into her eyes its possible that i do alex paled what remember petes scariest scenario the one where someone gets hold of your cells turns those cells cancerous in the lab then injects them back into you alex nodded slowly those would be active cancer cells from the moment they entered my body she thought of the needle mark in chriss anus what do you think happened last night did someone steal cells in order to alter them or did they inject cancerous cells into you chriss eyes held only bitterness i pray its the first but i doubt im that lucky why because there are easier ways to get my cells alex shook her head in confusion like how think about it who has constant access to my body thora right and shes a nurse all right but how could thora take your blood without you knowing about it chris moved his hand in a come along gesture urging alex toward the truth not blood she tried to imagine what other cells thora could take from chris hair skin orher mouth twisted in horror and disgust you get it now chris asked semen exactly hows that for cold and calculating alex shook her head i cant believe shed be capable of that why not once youve made the decision to commit murder how does the method matter you think any of the other victims died pretty she stared at him not knowing what to say or do the situation was simply beyond her comprehension the other night chris whispered the night of the day that you and i met thora came out to my studio and made love with me she told me she wanted to get pregnant it was really out of character with the way things had been but i went with it hoping for the best chriss jaw flexed in fury three days later i found out shed taken a morningafter pill alex felt cold thora never meant to get pregnant at all sowhy the sex alex shook her head in disbelief but surely no one could induce cancer in those cells that rapidly not even in the lab i hope not thats one reason i havent taken the chemo yet but who knows whats possible alex put both arms around him and hugged tight chris stiffened at first but then she felt him go limp when his arms closed around her back she realized he was shivering was it the drugs or was he about to break down right there in the lobby anybody would given the unimaginable strain he was under lets go upstairs she said have you checked in he nodded she left a message at the desk for will and sixty seconds later they were unlocking the door to room alex had reserved a suite on the executive floor attached to the bedroom was a little den with a sofa two club chairs and a desk against the wall in one corner was a sink a minifridge and a microwave oven is that a minibar chris asked alex checked the fridge no alcohol he cursed softly what do you want i dont care she checked the bedroom here we go under the tv vodka coming up ill get you some ice she handed him a tiny bottle of absolut and he drank most of it in a single gulp alex wasnt sure how kaiser would react to a drunken witness but she wasnt about to reprimand a man who had just learned he might be dying is kaiser in town yet chris asked hell be up any minute why did you pick him she walked to the window and looked out at the verdant campus of millsaps college with its clock tower rising into the sky shed been offered an academic scholarship there as a high school senior kaiser worked with the investigative support unit for a long time he worked with the guys who invented it when it was still called behavioral science hes seen stuff that the suits in washington cant even imagine reading it in a report just doesnt communicate the horror of some things you know chris nodded its like reading about diseases in a textbook you think you know what something is until you see a patient rotting away before your eyes exactly kaiser gets it he served in vietnam before he entered the bureau heavy combat hes a firstclass guy his wife is the best too he met her during a serial murder case shes a war photographer whats her name jordan glass youre kidding you know her no but i do some documentaryfilm work as a hobby jordan glass is up there with nachtwey and those guys shes won a pulitzer two i think chris drank off the rest of the vodka and went back to the minibar alex started at a knock on the door she answered expecting kaiser but will stood there with a shoe box in his hands thanks she said taking the improbably heavy box what is it a sig nine untraceable thanks will youd better get going the old detective looked as if hed been wrestling some dark demons what is it she asked whats wrong i feel like i let the doc down you have no idea last night doesnt matter now its going to work out get going will kilmer trotted down the hall to the fire stairs when alex went back inside chris was drinking bourbon room service delivers shoes he asked ninemillimeter shoes she took the box into the bedroom and stowed it on the top shelf of the closet kaiser doesnt need to know chris nodded my is down in my car ill get it for you after john leaves i can definitely see myself using it on a certain person who alex wondered thora shane lansing both of them chrisyoure not really thinking that are you i was raised in mississippi ive got some redneck in me thatll never wash out alex touched his arm i hope youre kidding because that wouldnt solve anything it would only guarantee that ben would be raised by someone besides you chriss eyes went dead what do you think caused the headache she asked trying to divert him from thoughts of ben i think we were all sedated before the attack im not sure how will ate the same turkey and cheese i did but ben had frozen pizza and ben didnt drink any beer we have a watercoolerit could have been that in the end it doesnt really matter does it as long as ben and will arent sick three strong knocks echoed through the room chris followed alex to the door a tall man with deepset eyes and longer hair than chris had expected stood there chris could hardly believe the guy had served in vietnam because he looked about fortyfive he had to be at least seven years older you gonna invite me in asked the newcomer alex smiled and hugged kaiser then pulled him into the suite chris stepped back and watched the fbi agent set a leather bag down on the sofa then kaiser turned and held out a hand to chris dr shepard yes chris shook his hand glad to meet you you too i have a lot of catching up to do alex folded her arms and looked up at kaiser its worse than i thought john chris is already in bad trouble he was hit last night kaisers eyes roamed over chris for several moments he was taking in the smell of alcohol the look of fatigue even desperation alex knew he would have a lot of questions and right now chris looked as if he wanted only to climb into one of the beds and go to sleep kaiser looked at alex somebody fill me in before dr shepard passes out chapter john kaiser stood at the window overlooking the college alex was sitting beside chris on the bed holding a trash can for him whenever he vomited hed started about twenty minutes into alexs summary of events and the waves were still coming its probably the drugs he said clutching his cramping midsection with both arms my bodys not used to them and im taking three at once kaiser didnt look away from the window when he spoke to alex so you feel like you got active resistance from webb tyler webb tyler was the sac of the jackson field office it was tyler that alex had first approached with her murder theory you could say that five minutes after i walked into his office tyler was praying id disappear kaiser tilted his head to one side as though looking at something on the ground six floors below im sure he was i also think he started complaining to mark dodson about me from that first day right again what do you think john is there anything you can do kaiser turned from the window at last you need objective evidence of murder some kind any kind is there any way that you can expedite autopsies of the victims not without on ongoing murder investigation the local authorities dont even believe that crimes have occurred how can they invite the fbi into a case that doesnt exist i know but i was thinking chris may have been injected with some revolutionary drug thats capable of giving people cancer why couldnt you classify that as a biological weapon if you did couldnt the bureau investigate it under counterterror rules like searching for a weapon of mass destruction kaiser pursed his lips thats actually not a bad idea but its too soon again we have no evidence that such a drug exists we have the injection site on chriss body that could be anything youd have to isolate the compound from his blood can we try that we dont know what to look for chris croaked a radioactive metal a retrovirus a toxin is it even traceable kaiser nodded dejectedly and whos going to do that for us fuck alex shouted im sick of having my hands tied pete connolly will start testing me if i fly up to sloankettering chris told them maybe he could isolate something i want to see it kaiser said what asked alex the injection site are you serious ive see a lot worse in my time alex looked at chris he felt cold sweat pouring down his face what the hell he said you can look if you want kaiser glanced at alex give us a minute she went into the bathroom without a word chris got slowly to his feet dropped his pants then lay down on his stomach kaiser checked him as professionally as a physician okay doctor im done well said chris slowly pulling his pants back up do you have any history of drug abuse dr shepard none the fbi agent looked deep into his eyes do you believe your wife is capable of murder chris sat on the edge of the bed another wave of nausea was coming i didnt at first but i didnt think she was capable of cheating on me either and there are some gaps in her past that i know nothing about also what i adopted my son my wifes biological son ben has only known me for a couple of years but if you gave him a choice about where to live after a divorce hed choose me over his biological mother what does that tell you a lot if youre right kaiser called toward the bathroom alex she came out a questioning look on her face do you believe me now he reached out and took hold of her hand i believe you because i believe in you but im not sure anyone else would is there anything you can do to help at the very least i can pull some strings and get local surveillance on andrew rusk will webb tyler allow that kaiser snorted tylers not too popular with his own agents i can think of a few who would help out as a favor to me i cant do anything that will put me on the bureau radar but i can get you license plates background checks that kind of thing i just have to do it through the new orleans field office i appreciate that john but those are baby steps these guys have been killing people for years and knowing about my involvement hasnt even slowed them down kaisers jaw muscles flexed this is going to sound cold but thats a good thing if they went to ground now wed probably never get them the best thing we can do right now is poke andrew rusk with a sharp stick ill do my part im going to find out everything there is to know about that asshole tear apart every company hes even remotely associated with anybody in business with him is going to hate him within two days alexs face flushed with hope kaiser walked over to chris and looked down i want you to get that chemotherapy doctor theres nothing else you can do to help this investigation your only job is to survive chris wanted to respond but at that moment he doubled over the trash can and began to dryheave kaiser led alex into the other room chris could hear their voices but he couldnt make out individual words as though compelled by some will outside himself he pulled back the bedclothes crawled into the bed and pulled the sheet up to his neck by the time alex returned he could hardly make out what she was saying chris should i take you to the hospital he shook his head nojust need to rest kaiser hes gone she stared down at him her expression vacillating between concern and outright fear shes lost too much he realized she doesnt want me to go to sleepdoesnt want to be alone is someone taking care of ben she asked mrs johnson he whispered numberher numbers in my cell phone ill call her you sleep ill be watching over you she took hold of his shivering hand and squeezed chris squeezed back with what strength he could muster then like a mountain of storm clouds sweeping over a tiny boat the shadows took him chris awoke in the dark to the chirp of his cell phone he blinked several times his dry eyes burning then turned to the right he saw a bar of artificial light where the curtains didnt quite meet in its faint pink glow he saw alex lying asleep on the other bed she was wearing a shirt but no pants he scrabbled on the night table until he found his phone hello he said his mouth sour with vomit chris a frantic female voice mrs johnson its thora where are you umjackson jackson you left ben with mrs johnson and she had no idea where you were thats not true she knew i might go out of town she told me that some woman named alex called her about ben who the hell is alex chris sat up slowly then stood and walked into the adjoining den looki had to drive up here to see a patient at umc theres nothing to freak out about where are you in greenwood where im supposed to be thoras voice had lost none of its hysteria he clenched his jaw but said nothing chris are you there uhhuh what the hell is going on down there he stood at the center of the dark room his throat and scrotum aching from the spasms of repeated retching his arm almost too weak to hold up the phone and fought to keep from screaming from the depths of his soul he remembered alex begging him not to confront thora but the truth was he didnt care about the goddamn investigation he could never look at thora again and pretend that everything was fine answer me she shouted are you drunk or something youre where youre supposed to be he said of course i am what about shane lansing is he where hes supposed to be now there was only silence or is he where im supposed to be what are you talking about chris stop it thora just stop okay waiti dont know what you think you know but you donti mean you just cant her shrill voice faded to nothing ill tell you what i know he said with quiet conviction i know you took a morningafter pill after we had sex in the studio he heard a gasp then the sound of a thumb being squashed over the cellular mike ive also got a nice snapshot of shane doing you doggy style on the hotel balcony im sure hed like another trophy to add to his case youll be whatthe tenth conquest this year he heard a muffled scream then a male grunt is he there now chris asked reeling from sudden vertigo or has he flown home to eat supper with the wife and kids again whats it costing him to commute up there to bone your skanky ass i guess that makes you feel like youre worth something huh no response if hes there put him on the phone chris thoras voice was smaller now almost desolate im alone theres no one here but me i dont believe you i know what you did okay and i may be dead in a year but youyou and lansing youre dead too spiritually dead you probably dont even know what im talking aboutbut one day you will youre going to prison and you tell that motherfucker hes going to stand toetotoe with me before its over just once she was sobbing now how could you do that to ben thora forget me but hes been doing so welljesus do you want to turn him into a clone of your fuckedup emotional blueprint thora screamed like a woman rending her flesh in mourning chris hung up and stood shivering in the darkness he was no longer alone alex was standing in the door that divided the bedroom from the den her face confused her bare legs outlined in the light from the window what did you do she asked i couldnt pretend anymore butyou may have ruined everything how youve been working on this for five straight weeks and youve got nothing you heard kaiser poke them with a sharp stick he said well i just poked thora and my guess is shes going to poke andrew rusk like hes never been poked before alex raised her hand like a little girl and wiped sleep out of her eyes hows your stomach better what time is it eleven thirty thats pm chris swallowed painfully i guess were not going back to natchez tonight not unless you need to get ben did mrs johnson say she was okay with keeping him she said he was fine shit thora acted like he was in a panic she also didnt like hearing that a woman had called asked me who the hell alex was alex smiled screw her no thanks never again alex walked forward and took his hand then led him back to the bed im not making a pass she said id just rather sleep with you than by myself are you okay with that he lay down on his back then scooted across to make a space for her she got into the bed and laid her head on his shoulder her body warm along the length of his side why did you marry thora she asked softly was it because shes beautiful he thought about it for a while i didnt think so at the time but nowi think maybe that had more to do with it than i knew alex nodded her cheek against his shirt it wasnt only that though he went on and i still dont know why she would do this i mean why not just ask me for a divorce id give it to her i think its about ben what do you mean she knows how much ben loves you she cant tell her son that she wants to take away his wonderful new father because shes suddenly bored that she lied when she married you death solves all those problems for her if you die shes a noble widow not a selfish divorcée and noble widow is a role thora already knows how to play thats for sure not to mention adding a couple of mil to her bank account he sighed but said nothing people used to think i was beautiful alex whispered her hand rising to her scarred cheek before this you still are you just cant see it right now youre not the same as you were thats all its like women who get chemotherapy theyre still beautiful theyre just bald i call it the sinéad oconnor look alex laughed softly youve got a pretty good bedside manner dont you not good enough for thora it seems well we know that bitch is crazy chris closed his eyes im going to be bald myself soon if i take the chemo no ifs bud alex wagged her forefinger in his face youre taking it youre my doctor now somebody needs to be he took her arm and turned her on her side facing away from him then spooned her tight oh no she said softly what this is my favorite thing in the world good after only a few breaths sleep was returning alex closed her hands around his arm where it enfolded her dont freak out if i cry she said because i feel like im going to why because life sucks right now its been sucking for a really long time chris squeezed as tight as he could for a few moments then eased up there are worse things than this thats one thing ive learned in medicine it can always get worse she turned her head so that her cheek touched his i hope not we need to sleep alex i know are you going to puke on me his laughter sounded like someone else laughing in a dream ill try not to she tensed in his arms whats the matter he asked i forgot to check in with someone online jamie actually its kind of a tradition chris struggled to raise his arm go ahead she pulled his arm back down and snuggled in close noits too late now hell be all right for one night chapter oh shit said a female voice chris came awake with the bed moving beneath him every muscle in his body ached but his chest and neck felt as though he had endured a car crash shit shit shit cursed the woman i slept through my alarm alex he remembered he blinked his eyes open and felt full daylight stab his retinas alex was standing beside the bed pulling on her jeans what time is it he asked nine am i set my cell alarm but i forgot to plug in my phone it died during the night i guess that snuggling scrambled my brain chris sat up and a wave of nausea rolled through his stomach do you need to use the bathroom she looked at his face and caught his meaning just let me pee she disappeared into the bathroom chris slid his legs off the bed then got up slowly and went to the minibar he chose a cold dasani which felt good going down but made him pray he could keep it there when he was confident that he could he went to his bag and took his morning dose of antivirals azt ritonavir enfuvirtide and vidarabine as he swallowed the last pill the toilet flushed in the bathroom im done alex called all yours i think im okay now i felt like i had diarrhea but it passed she walked over and sat on one of the club chairs she had washed her face and for the first time he saw the scars without makeup covering them in his mind he saw an image of someone throwing acid onto a painting of a woman what are you thinking she asked about today her suspicion didnt fade youve got two choices drive back to natchez for chemotherapy or fly to sloankettering for chemotherapy now youre my mother alex turned up her palms you want to play russian roulette with your life thats what chemotherapy would be under these circumstances we dont know what was injected into me my best chance for survival is to find out exactly whats killing me only then can i get effective treatment alex considered this how do you plan to do that how about you and kaiser catch the son of a bitch for me i guess you feel better this morning chris picked up his pants and struggled to put them on where are you going that you need your pants alex asked over to umc to see the researchers peter connolly told me about if theyre not there anymore ill get the names of the top people in the hematology and oncology departments and try to see them for what purpose a wave of dizziness hit him he sat on the edge of the bed rocking slowly i think weve focused too much on shane lansing okay he owns a radiationoncology center he owns a lot of other stuff too we know that something was injected into me if that something was radioactive it probably would have shown up on the xray i had yesterday i think its more likely that connolly is right someone got hold of my bloodor sementhen altered it and reinjected it into me if thats the case the odds are against lansing shane cares more about money than medicine so he doesnt have that depth of knowledge were looking for superdoctors alex people who are experts on bone marrow genetics oncogenic viruses there arent many of those in this entire state and the ones we do have are right across the street alex leaned forward in her chair excitement in her eyes hows your body can you function i think so id better take a shower though im not going to impress anybody smelling like vomit good call she walked to the bedside phone im going to order some breakfast can you eat anything toast and a bowl of grits and hot tea she smiled broadly youre the only man ive spent the night with in the last ten years who ordered grits in the morning welcome home andrew rusk was ten miles south of jackson when his fear hit critical mass a few days ago there had been only one car following him now there was a motorized battalion operating in shifts all american cars most of the drivers white males between twentyfive and fortyfive he was in deep shit cursing alex morse with visceral hatred he swerved off the interstate at the byram exit and pulled into the drivethrough lane of the wendys restaurant there two cars followed him goddamnit he shouted last night when he received the viagra spam from dr tarver rusk had been elated he didnt know where tarver had been hiding but he was sure that the doctor had good reason to be out of contact after all they had hardly spent more than a few minutes in each others company over the past five years last night this trip had seemed like a leisurely drive down to the hunting camp now it was impossible if he led those sons of bitches in the government sedans to chickamauga dr tarver would kill them and him without a seconds hesitation rusk ordered a cheeseburger and a coke and watched one of the tail cars park in the lot a few yards away what the hell could he do if they were following him like this then they were tapping his phones as well the office the house his cell phones for a moment he wondered if carson barnett had turned him in no way he assured himself barnett wanted out of his marriage and he was willing to do anything to accomplish that it was that fucking morse but was it only morse that was the question last night thora shepard had called his house fourteen times after two hysterical messages had been left on his answering machine rusk unplugged the phone when he arrived at his office this morning janice had reported twelve messages left by a mrs shepard each one more frantic than the last thora wasnt so stupid as to have stated her reason for needing to talk to him but something told him that alex morse was involved that or thora was having second thoughts about killing her husband that wouldnt surprise rusk the woman might be moviestar hot but she was also nuts as he had seen the first time around typical society chick really she looked as if she had it all together but underneath the facade she didnt know whether she was going or coming he took his cheeseburger from the girl in the window and paid with a bill ketchup he said i need some ketchup he took a huge gulp of his coke and pulled into the exit lane one of the tails pulled right up behind him these guys werent even trying to conceal themselves the funny thing about thora shepard he thought crossing over the interstate and turning onto i north was that they hadnt even had to kill her first husband the poor guy had died of natural causes of course rusk had never told her that thora had made her payments just as instructed and he was happy to take her money the irony of that woman becoming a return customer was almost too much but rusk didnt have time to enjoy it now thora was flipping out and if she lost it in front of the wrong people it could cost him dearly he needed to make contact with dr tarver and soon he had no idea how to do that but as he roared north toward jackson he realized that he didnt have todr tarver would do that for him all he had to do was play it cool sometime in the next twelve hours he would walk around a corner or step into an elevator or climb into his car and tarver would be there like magic that was how the guy worked and all the fbi agents in the world wouldnt be able to stop him rusk looked at his rearview mirror and laughed it was time to cash in his chips and split the country he only hoped they could fleece carson barnett before dday barnett would be their pièce de résistance and he would set them up for the last couple of decades of their lives as the interstate flowed beneath him like a gray river rusk saw himself on a sundrenched beach with a dark rum drink in his hand and lisa lying nude beside him he hated to leave the kids behind but there was nothing to be done about that business was business he slowed down until the dark sedan behind him had no choice but to pass as its cleancut driver glanced his way rusk smiled like the cheshire cat dr tarver regretted the look of dumb incomprehension on his adoptive brothers face it was exactly the look he had expected the puzzled disbelief of a child being told that his dog has been run over by a car all of them judah said every one im afraid so said eldon im sorry even the chimps they were standing in the back room beside the primate cages not the best place for this discussion the chimps most of all nothing can remain that would tell anyone what weve been doing here judahs face was working like that of a boy doing sums that were beyond him i thought what we were doing here was good it is good judah but people wont understand that you know what theyre like i know but but what if i kept them just some of them i wish you could i really do but you know thats impossible i been studying hard i been practically running the front this past year why couldnt i keep running the breeding part you know just the beagles you dont really know whats involved in the business part judah theres so much more to it than taking care of the dogs theres ordering and records computers and taxes plus you have to be licensed if im not here the whole thing just doesnt work a new fear entered judahs eyes where are you going i dont know that yet but im going to send for you once i get there are you dont i always judahs eyes darted toward the cages again why cant we just give the animals away because theyre sick theyre carrying special germs now they would infect other animals and that might be a disaster it might even cause armageddon like in the revelation of st john judah said in the voice of an automaton chapter sixteen the seven vials of the angels my name is in that book his voice dropped in pitch and the second angel poured his bowl into the sea and it became as the blood of a dead man every living thing that was in the sea and had life died and thats right eldon said cutting him off before the spirit took him you dont want to be called to account before god for bringing that to pass do you after long reflection judah shook his big head i tell you what eldon said as if just thinking of this idea on the spot you take care of the beagles and leave the primates to me i know how hard that would be for you judah bit his bottom lip the beagles is hard too you know i know every one of em now every one has a given name it amazed eldon that a man as tough as judah could be so soft when it came to animals for judah was a fearsome creature once roused to anger he was a match for any jihadminded suicide bomber it was men like judah who had taken iwo jima from the japanese men who could bayonet their way through endless ranks of the enemy then charge uphill into withering machinegun fire and never question the orders that put them there that unthinking patriotism had allowed america to survive into adolescence and a continued lack of it would insure that she never saw national maturity you dont know judah went on youre never up front with em its like theyre all mine like june bug when we was kids june bug was an old mutt with cataracts that had lived with them for fifteen years judah had doted on her right to the end this is like when daddy used to drown the runts judah said in the big washtub eldon put his arm around his brothers massive shoulder and led him away from the primate cages it was amazing that anyone had ever mistaken him for judahs biological brother intellectually they inhabited two different dimensions eldons mind probably contained four times as many neurochemical connections as judahs yet his adoptive brother had proved quite useful over the years and he would in future they were in the front now with their little town of beagles two walls of black white and brown fur glinting with plaintive eyes it would take judah most of the day to euthanize them all not that they would resist one of the reasons beagles were used for medical research was that they were so docile and friendly they would only look up with mild reproof while you stuck in needles and probes they were living proof that the meek would not inherit the earth at least in the animal word how are you going to do it judah asked the chimps i mean im going to dart them with a barbiturate after theyre fully unconscious ill use potassium chloride they wont feel a thing brother judah was biting his lip so hard that eldon feared he would draw blood does it have to be fire we have to purify this place fire is what god used so we shall too judah closed his eyes for a while but when he opened them eldon saw that he had accepted this as his lot after all eldon had defied their father and lived so he must be anointed by god you must be out by five eldon said gravely do you understand are you leaving ill be back to put the apes down but i doubt youll be finished okay where do i go when its done ill explain everything when i come back okay eldon smiled then walked back to the primate area he had some reading to do explosives were not his line still he was confident in his abilities what a production it would be an explosion then firefire hot enough to melt steeland when the firefighters arrived they would find something they had never before seen a dozen panicked primates crazed by the flames eldon figured the animals would double the time it would take to get the blaze out which was exactly what he wanted sohe would dart the animals just as hed promised judah but there would be no injection of kcl and as a last measure he would unlock the cages binding the doors with a couple of twists of wire enough to persuade the primates that the doors were still locked until a conflagration of biblical proportions ripped through the old bakery it would be interesting to see which species smashed their cage doors open first once the panic hit but it was not worth dying to find out he looked over at a locked closet to the right of the chimps cages in it were four cylinders filled with acetylene three other closets in the old bakery held identical cylinders by the time the fire department responded to the calls of neighbors the building would be burning at three thousand degrees celsius the stench of burning beagles would be permeating the area and crazed monkeys would be flying at anyone who approached what until recently had been their home eldon laughed quietly so that judah wouldnt hear him it would be a spectacle worthy of hieronymus bosch on lsd chapter chris held the elevator door for a nurse pushing a woman in a wheelchair then followed alex onto the fifth floor of the university medical center have you met dr pearson during your mothers treatment he asked alex shook her head moms doctor is walter clarke youre kidding clarke was a year ahead of me in med school i thought he was still at baylor alex shrugged they walked past the patient wards and down to the academic offices near the end of the hall was a door with a brass nameplate that read matthew pearson md chief of hematology chris paused and said not a word about the fbi murder or anything like that because this is a hospital one whiff of litigation or even liability and well be out the door this is my world okay just follow my lead alex rolled her eyes i can do that he knocked at the door then walked into the office a redhaired woman with a retro beehive looked up from a stack of papers can i help you i hope so chris said in his most genteel southern accent im dr chris shepard from natchez i happen to be up here visiting a friendhe nodded at alexand i was hoping to talk to dr pearson about a cluster of cancer cases back home the secretary smiled but the smile looked forced do you have an appointment dr shepard im afraid not but i was talking to dr peter connolly up at sloankettering and he spoke very highly of dr pearson pete seemed to think i would have a good chance of speaking with him on short notice at the mention of connollys name the womans face brightened instantly you know dr connolly i studied under him when i went to school here oh i see she stood up and coming around her desk offered her hand im joan dr pearson is busy right now but let me just slip in there and see if he cant get away for a minute when the woman disappeared into the inner office alex whispered arent you something the door opened and a smartly dressed man in his midforties walked out with his hand extended toward chris dr shepard yes sir said chris taking the hand and squeezing firmly glad to meet you at last you too i see your name on a lot of charts that pass through here you send a lot of referral business our way we appreciate it not as much as i used to im afraid now that we have dr mercier in natchez well thats a good thing for your city dr pearson grinned hey you dont have a hidden camera on you do you so even matt pearson had heard about chriss documentary on residents work hours no my days as a director are over im part of the establishment now while the gladhanding and listing of mutual acquaintances progressed chris sized up the chief of hematology despite his coming from stanford pearson seemed to be cut from the same cloth chris had gotten to know so well during his years at umc a smart cleancut wasp whod made a at ole miss or millsaps then left the state for a med school with a more prestigious pedigree and returned home covered with laurels chris was a little surprised in a rigorous specialty such as hematology hed expected a foreigner joan said something about a cancer cluster pearson prompted right but ive forgotten my manners chris turned toward alex this is alexandra morse her mother is here in your department right now ovarian cancer an appropriately somber look came over pearsons face im familiar with the case im sorry we have to meet under these circumstances ms morse thank you alex said in an accent so thick that chris could have sworn shed never left mississippi all the doctors and nurses have been wonderful is your mother part of this cancer cluster no chris said alex is just a friend as for the cluster i dont have statistical backing yet but weve had several similar cases in natchez this past year and its really starting to worry me what type of cancer asked dr pearson different kinds but all blood cancers leukemias lymphomas and a myeloma dr pearson nodded with genuine interest im surprised we havent picked this up ourselves weve taken over the state tumor registry you know have these patients passed through here some dr mercier has treated several and some of the others have gone to m d anderson danafarber like that right of course the thing is said chris some local doctors have wondered if there might be an environmental factor linking these cancers more concerned nodding from pearson thats certainly possible its a very complex subject of course controversial too ive also wondered chris went on if there might be some other etiological link between the cases such as well ive been doing a lot of reading in my frustration and ive come across a few interesting possibilities radiation is one weve got two nuclear plants in near proximity and two of these patients work at one the others dont though two of the patients have had chemo for previous cancers though ive also been intrigued by the role of oncogenic viruses in cancer dr pearson looked skeptical that seems pretty farfetched given what youve told me chris felt for the man on one level chris was playing a type that pearson would like to avoid the loquacious country doctor come to town with a bunch of wild scientific theories on the other hand chris could be a dream come true a country doctor with a handful of reportable cases that would splash pearsons name through the top medical journals what i was hoping chris concluded was that you could put me in touch with faculty members who specialize in those areas particularly carcinogenic poisons and oncogenic viruses i see said dr pearson pete connolly gave me a couple of names yours of course but he also mentioned a virologist named ajit chandrekasar ajit is no longer here i see he also mentioned an eldon tarver pearson nodded dr tarver is still with us hes done some great work since dr connolly left hed probably be glad to talk to you too with sufficient notice of course chris let his disappointment show we have some terrific people on staff pearson said both in oncology and hematology for the environmental toxins youd have to go a long way to beat dr parminder for radiation id suggest dr colbert oncogenic viruses are a little tougher most of the virologists i know are working on aids dr tarver might actually be your best bet do you have anybody doing gene therapy chris asked yes but im not sure i see the relevance dont they use viruses to deliver modified genes to the cell thats true conceded pearson but they use very simple viruses as a rule adenoviruses for example not oncogenic viruses or retroviruses which are a whole other thing as im sure you know i understand the mechanics of rna viruses reverse transcriptase and all that i assumed that researchers doing that kind of work would probably have the answers to any questions i might ask about viruses well im happy to try to set this up but i seriously doubt whether any of these specialists would be free today chris looked downcast sodr parminder for the environmental stuff colbert for radiation and dr tarver for the viral stuff dr pearson rubbed his chin eldon is currently developing his own nucleic acid amplification assay he probably knows as much about retroviruses as any virologist i ever met but you dont think i could talk to either one of them today i doubt it it would certainly have to be later in the day why dont you give me your phone number and ill call you after ive spoken to them chris gave pearson his cell number i appreciate you taking the time to see us doctor im going to tell pete connolly how helpful youve been never too busy for a colleague said pearson offering his hand again connollys doing fantastic work up at sloankettering of course they have all the resources in the world an embarrassment of riches chris nodded smiled at joan then escorted alex through the door as soon as the door shut behind them alex veered to the right toward another row of doors what are you doing chris whispered finding the guys he talked about heres parminder right here that wasnt so hard she tested the knob locked chris followed as she moved from door to door but then his bowels spasmed he doubled over trying to keep from defecating in his pants chris she gasped running back to him what is it ive got to get to a bathroom she grabbed his arm and pulled him back the way they had come theres a mens room by the elevators he struggled to duckwalk and keep his sphincter clenched at the same time he made a note to look up the contraindications of the antiviral agents he was taking the next time he got near a computer after a seeming eternity the door to the mens room appeared alex crashed right through and helped him into one of the stalls okay get out he gasped are you all right get out he tried to hold it but he was already going before she left the room will kilmer was parked at the base of the amsouth bank tower when thora shepard climbed out of her silver mercedes and stormed into the lobby of the office building her arrival stunned him kilmer was only parked here because the operative tailing rusk had reported that his target had reversed direction ten miles south of town and headed back toward jackson since that operative had reported other cars tailing rusk will had driven here to take over the surveillance the couple he had watching thora shepard in greenwood had broken off contact when they saw her checking out of the alluvian hotel they like will had assumed that thora and her girlfriend would be driving straight back to natchez but now here she was storming into andrew rusks office building with no girlfriend in sight where had she dumped laura canning will considered getting out and going up to the sixteenth floor but what would that accomplish he couldnt get inside rusks office on the other hand rusk wasnt there himself will got out of his ford explorer and hurried across the street he told the doorman that he was going up to the amsouth offices on the second floor then got into the elevator and punched and as soon as the doors opened on he heard a woman yelling at near full volume i called here all last night and ive spoken to you at least five times this morning ive paid your boss one hell of a lot of money and im going to talk to him one way or another will stepped out of the elevator and peered through a wide door that led to an ultramodern reception area thora shepard was standing with her back to him facing an attractive blonde in her thirties who was clearly struggling to maintain some semblance of professionalism mrs shepard said the receptionist ive told you repeatedly that mr rusk is out of town ive tried to reach him by cell phone but i havent been able to as soon as i do reach him i will relay your message and the urgency of your situation i promise you that thora stood with her hands on her hips looking as if she meant to stand in that spot all day if that was what it took to see andrew rusk it struck will then that for the first time he was seeing her dressed like a normal person no designer outfit no fancy hairdo just tight blue jeans and an even tighter white tshirt thora was clearly giving the receptionist the hairy eyeball but the blonde behind the desk was giving as good as she got without warning thora whirled and marched back toward the elevator you going down maam will asked youre damn right thora snapped as the elevator whooshed toward the lobby thora cursed steadily under her breath in the closeness of the car will saw that her neck was blotchy with red spots the way his wife looked when she was about to explode in a fit of temper there were dark circles under both eyes will needed to talk to alex in a hurry something had gone down last night and they needed to know what it was when the elevator opened thora did not march out to the street she walked aimlessly around the lobby like the survivor of a car crash will had seen a lot of desperate people during his years as a cop and all his instincts told him this lady was about to snap he took out his cell phone and speeddialed alex her phone kicked him straight to voice mail he jammed the phone back into his pocket and sat down on a padded bench for five weeks he had been helping his best friends daughter out of a bottomless sense of obligation he had worked a lot of deadend cases over the years and about ten days ago he had decided this was one of them but now adrenaline was flushing through his system the way it always did when a case started to break for a brief moment he thought of young grace morse who would never see her son graduate high school for an even briefer moment he thought of the daughter he himself had lost all those years ago when he got up to follow thora out to the street all the aches and pains of age were gone he felt younger than he had in years wherever this crazy woman led him will would follow alex was standing outside the hospital mens room when the elevator door opened and the bearded man with the birthmark that shed met yesterday stepped out he walked down the hall without glancing up his eyes on a file in his hand but then he turned looked back at alex and said hello again hello alex called the bearded man smiled then walked down the corridor and turned toward the academic offices alex hesitated then followed as she rounded the final corner she saw his whitecoated back disappear into an office the brass plate on the door said eldon tarver md she hurried back to the mens room but she saw no sign of chris in the hall she cracked open the bathroom door and called his name what is it chris groaned i just saw dr tarver i was in the elevator with him yesterday and didnt even know it where is he now in his office you almost done yeah dont talk to him without me hurry chris she shut the door and went back down to tarvers leg of the hall his door was still closed she was tempted to knock but what excuse did she have to start a conversation the only thing they shared was facial disfigurement the guy would think she was coming on to him okay chris said rounding the corner with a pale clammy face can you make it i think so she turned to the door and knocked hard but there was no answer she waited then knocked again no response hes gone she said thats weird why im sure he just oh hello said the now familiar bass voice what can i do for you chris held out his hand dr tarver im chris shepard an internist from natchez dr tarver shook his hand have you come to see me i suppose so pete connolly recommended you as an expert on oncogenic viruses and specifically retroviruses tarver looked surprised im not sure i would put myself forward as that i hold several degrees but im not boardcertified in virology nevertheless both pete and dr pearson seem to think youre quite knowledgeable in the area i do have quite a bit of practical experience dr tarver looked at alex and you are nancy jenner im dr shepards chief nurse dr tarvers eyes twinkled he looked at chris and said i envy you chris cut his eyes at alex but she ignored him why dont we step into my office tarver said glancing at his watch i have about five minutes before im due somewhere he admitted them to an office much less spacious than the one occupied by dr pearson bookshelves lined three of the four walls the fourth was studded with framed photographs many of them blackandwhite tarver was older than shed thought alex realized there was a picture of him with president richard nixon nixon was pinning something on his chest another showed tarver standing in front of a familiarlooking building with a long banner hanging over its entrance free aids testing today in one picture tarver was surrounded by emaciated black children all reaching for him as though he were albert schweitzer alex studied the photos while chris questioned the doctor a cluster of cancers in natchez you say asked tarver i wasnt aware of that natchez is in adams county correct yes blood cancers specifically said chris several local doctors are starting to wonder if these cases might have a common etiology a viral etiology well we dont know i was thinking radiation exposure but we cant pin down a common source most of the patients work at different places and live in different parts of town which militates against an environmental cause as well said tarver thats how i got onto the virus angle i know that several cancers have been proved to have a viral etiology or at least a viral mediator thats more true in animals than humans i cant think of a single case in which a virus has produced a cluster of cancers chris looked surprised surely there must be some cervical cancers like that in urban areas with a high degree of sexual promiscuity tarver nodded in surprise im sure youre right but those studies havent been done the process of viral oncogenesis is a long one decades long in some cases its not like tracking a herpes epidemic you could be in the midst of an hpv epidemic and not even know it in fact in some places i think we are sexual promiscuity is one of the best things that ever happened to the virus as an organism in the darwinian sense i mean alex was moving from photo to photo on the office wall the birthmark made it easy to pick out dr tarver even in large group shots though it wasnt technically a birthmark she remembered it was something to do with malformed arteries and veins as she studied the pictures a fact shed learned back at quantico bubbled to the forefront of her mind many serial murderers suffered from some physical deformity that set them apart during their childhood it was crazy to suspect tarver of coursea guy she had simply gotten onto an elevator withand yethe certainly had the sophisticated knowledge that their hightech murders would require and there was something about him a quiet forcefulness and logical precision that made him seem capable of decisive maybe even extreme action whereas matt pearson seemed more conventional chris was speaking medical jargon now an esoteric version far above her level as his voice droned on one photograph caught alexs eye in it dr tarver and a man wearing an army uniform stood on either side of a beautiful blond woman behind them stood a fortresslike building with a sign on its front that read vcp the breast of tarvers lab coat bore the same legend vcp tarver was much younger in the photo with a full head of hair and no beard the military officer reminded alex a little of her father and the womanshe had that brainy look like the models in magazine ads for saturation language courses the ones that made businessmen think they could get laid overseas if only they would learn a little french at the first pause in the conversation alex said whats vcp i beg your pardon said dr tarver in this photo youre wearing a coat that says vcp oh tarver smiled that stands for the veterans cancer project it was something the government sponsored in conjunction with the nih and some private corporations to look into the high incidence of cancer in combat veterans what era late vietnam but we were seeing a lot of men from world war two and korea as well pacifictheater vets mostly that island fighting was hell days of shelling a lot of flamethrower use no agent orange sadly no no one was talking about that back then mainly because the incubation period of the cancers caused by that compound is so long as i was saying about viral etiologies same problem before alex could ask another question chris said do you retain blood samples from patients whove died on the oncology ward this question made alexs pulse race but she turned away and went back to looking at the photographs some of her victims had died in this very hospital if their blood had been preserved might it be possible to discover some common carcinogen that would prove mass murder i know its done in some research centers chris went on so that new information can be gained after new testing technology is developed i know the pathology lab retains all specimens for ten years we probably retain samples of blood and neoplastic cells in some cases youd have to talk to dr pearson about that i could give you a list of the patients were concerned about alex said dr tarver gave her an accommodating smile i suppose i could pass that on to dr pearson for you struggling to mask her excitement she walked to his desk and took a pen from a silver cup there may i write on this prescription pad of course supremely conscious of chriss eyes on her alex wrote the name of each person she believed to be a victim of the killers they sought excepting those who had not died of cancer this may sound a little nuts chris said but ive been wondering if its possible that someone might be purposely inducing cancer in human beings alex looked up from her list dr tarver was staring at chris as though he had suggested that priests might secretly be killing babies during baptisms did i hear you correctly doctor im afraid so thats one of the most remarkable things ive ever heard what makes you suggest something like that intuition i guess nothing else seems to explain these cases dr tarver gave him an understanding look thats frequently the case with cancer specifically blood cancers they remain some of the most enigmatic and intractable opponents we face the other thing chris said in a will rogers drawlhis version of columbois that all these patients were married to wealthy people who wanted to divorce them tarver looked incredulous are you serious yes sir i am are you suggesting that someone is murdering people by giving them cancer more than that i think its a doctor dr tarver laughed im sorry but i dont know what to say to that do any law enforcement authorities agree with your hypothesis yes alex said sharply she wasnt sure why chris had gone this route but she wasnt about to leave him twisting in the wind dr tarver im actually a special agent of the fbi and i can tell you that the bureau is looking deeply into these cases may i see your identification alex reached for her back pocket then froze she had never felt so ridiculous in her life it was like having her credit card denied only the embarrassment was magnified a thousandfold i left my id at the hotel she said lamely dr tarver was looking at them with obvious discomfort id like to do all i can to help you dr shepard but i must tell you if dr pearson knew that this visit had anything to do with legal matters he would be very upset i should terminate this interview until we can continue it on an official basis he looked at his watch besides im late for my meeting he gathered up some papers from his desk then ushered them to the door once they were in the hall he locked the door said good day then hurried down to the elevators i dont know why i did that chris said walking slowly up the corridor a shot in the dark is better than nothing said alex not always once pearson hears about that conversation ill be persona non grata at this institution not if you really refer that many patients up here money talks brother and my mothers a patient they cant kick me out chris angled toward a bench opposite the elevators and collapsed on it dr tarver had already vanished probably into dr pearsons office are you all right alex asked i dont know i need to get back to the hotel at least until my stomach settles down thats fine with me i need to charge my phone she pressed the elevator button what do you think about tarver chris shrugged typical specialist that av anomaly on his face is bad she nodded he gives me a weird feeling he wants to get into your pants not that chris chuckled as though it hurt to laugh i know what you mean but were just desperate the bell dinged and the elevator opened chris had already boarded the car when a thought struck her you go ahead im going back to ask dr pearson something chris held the door open what its stupid really im just being ocd wait for me downstairs tell me damn it in one of dr tarvers photos hes standing in front of a building with a sign that says free aids testing it looked familiar to me i think it was a restaurant in downtown jackson that my dad used to take me to when i was a kid wed have breakfast there it was called pullos i just want to know if im right youre serious yeah and i want to know why they were testing for aids there it doesnt make sense ill go with you chris started forward she gently pushed him back into the elevator he was so weak that he could hardly stay on his feet ill be right down sit on a bench and wait for me he sagged against the elevator wall okay chapter eldon tarver stood behind the trunk of a large oak tree his eyes locked on the entrance of the new adult criticalcare hospital he had watched shepard emerge into the cloud of smoke generated by the patients and nurses getting their nicotine fixes outside the entrance then retreat back into the building where was morse was she canvassing the faculty or was she at this moment recounting specific suspicions to dr pearson eldon wasnt afraid but the part of his brain that handled threat assessment was lit up like a small city he couldnt go back to his office nor could he return to his house even going back to the primate lab was a riskbut it was one he had to take he doubted that anyone had the noel traver alias yet he didnt see how they could but then how had they gotten this far rusk he thought angrily a stupid fucking lawyer what else eldon congratulated himself on yesterdays decision to pull out early fate had revealed that it was not early at all it was very late the conversation with morse and shepard was one of the most remarkable he had ever experienced not only had he murdered morses sister but shepardshepard was a walking dead man yet there hed stood questioning a specialist with his pathetically inadequate knowledge of medicine eldon wondered if shepard knew he was doomed if he didnt he would soon but unlike the other victims who believed theyd been randomly selected by fate for premature death shepard would know that the cancer devouring his body had been placed there by another human being by his wife in factor at least at her request of course the cancer did not yet exist eldon had simply initiated a cascade of events that left unchecked would terminate in carcinogenesis on the cellular level and no one was going to stop that lethal cascade for chris shepard because the only man alive who could do so was eldon tarver and for eldon shepards death represented valuable research data alive shepard was useless and in conjunction with alex morse possibly even dangerous eldon needed to speak to edward biddle he couldnt risk using his cell phone the fbi might already be monitoring it but problems like this were easy to solve under a stand of trees twenty yards away stood a small knot of nurses greedily smoking cigarettes he recognized two from oncology with a quick glance at the hospital entrance he crossed the open ground and addressed the smaller of the two nurses a shorthaired brunette who had always greeted him in the halls excuse me he said my cell phone died and i need to make an emergency call its about a patient would you mind if the nurse was already handing him her phone thank you eldon said with a grateful smile ill only be a minute he punched in the number of edward biddles cell phone the phone rang and rang then kicked him to voice mail dr tarver hung up was biddle not answering because he did not recognize the number was there some problem because he was airborne that was unlikely since he was almost certainly in a corporate aircraft or was there some deeper problem eldon dialed the number once more and got the same response cursing inwardly he gave the phone back to the nurse then hurried across the grass to his car he would have to risk meeting biddle at their original rendezvous he didnt like the idea but when he thought back to the demeanor of morse and shepard in his office he felt that the worm had not quite turned if they had anything concrete on himor more important if the fbi were handling this officiallythey would have played it differently he looked back over his shoulder as he walked morse and shepard had still not emerged from the hospital alex put on a smile and pushed open the door of dr pearsons office the beehive lady was still at her post but the door to the inner office was cracked open hello again alex said i forgot to ask dr pearson one question the secretary did not hide her irritation i think its better if you call with it alex raised her voice trusting to pearsons goodwill its just one question nothing medical at all dr pearson poked his head out of his door like a curious cat though not so sleek hello again hed at least remembered her face yes i was actually talking to dr tarver a moment ago he invited us into his office beehive lady snorted and he had some very interesting pictures on his wall i grew up in jackson and one of them is really bugging me pearson looked perplexed well i grew up in california so i doubt its a long building with glass windows and it says free aids testing on a banner in front it looks like a restaurant my dad used to take me to when i was a little girl pearsons eyes lit up he was genuinely happy to be able to help yes of course that used to be pullos restaurant until dr tarver bought it a fillip of excitement went through alex almost déjà vu but slightly different dr tarver bought pullos yes about four years ago i believe ive been living in washington dc for quite a while now i see well eldon wanted a site that would be easily accessible to the indigent residents of the city the homeless the poor children the medically underserved easily accessible for what his clinic its a free clinic for the poor oh i see dr tarver gives a great deal of time to that clinic he tests for many of the common viruses that afflict the lower socioeconomic classes aids hepatitis c the herpes family human papillomavirus all that stuff he treats them as well hes won a lot of grants of course the records of his work are quite valuable in a statistical sense alex was nodding she felt as though she was nearing something important yes i imagine they would be i didnt realize we had something like that in jackson we didnt for many years but when dr tarver lost his wife he decided he wanted to make something positive out of her loss lost his wife alex echoed what did she die of cervical cancer a terrible case i believe seven or eight years agobefore my time here but dr tarver inherited quite a bit of money from his wife and he wanted to put it to good use which he certainly did you know eldon was one of the first people to suggest a viral origin for cervical cancer i saw a paper he did on it written years before the idea became generally accepted i believe hes even considered litigation over credit for that finding alex had run out of words but her mind was racing is that all you wanted dr pearson asked umyou say he spends a lot of time at the clinic beehive woman gave her boss a pointed look and dr pearson suddenly seemed to remember that alex was an outsider dr shepard told me to thank you again alex said with her best southernbelle smile then she backed out of the office outside she turned and ran to the elevator when it was too slow in coming she took the fire stairs her heart pounded as she ran but not from the exercise when she reached the first floor she saw chris standing inside the hospital entrance doors hey he said i wanted to go outside but the smoke is so thick it could choke you there are people out there smoking through tracheostomies she took his arm chris youre not going to believe this what that building i asked aboutdr tarver owns it now pearson told me its a free clinic for the poor what kind of clinic he tests people for viruses chriss eyes flickered did pearson say which viruses aids hepatitis hpv herpes he also treats people there gets grants for the medicine he started that clinic in memory of his wife who died of cancer seven years ago and guess what what he inherited a pile of money from her chriss mouth fell open did she die of a blood cancer no cervical hm doesnt that seem suspicious to you id say yes except that he turned around and used the money to open a free clinic in memory of his dead wife right but that put him down in the inner city where he could do god knows what under the guise of treating the poor for free how much oversight do you think there is on that kind of thing chris was nodding some but its tough to oversee whats actually going on in that kind of patient population osha would have to have their own eldon tarver on site to understand what was really happening alex nodded excitedly i want to go down there and do what i dont know look around for starters i want to find out if theres any connection between tarver and andrew rusk dont you i think its worth exploring chris grimaced but right now i need to find a bathroom and a bed im feeling pretty rough consciousness of chriss desperate plight rushed back into her mind like a dark tide im sorry she said slipping under his arm so that he could lean on her lets go to the car ill get kaiser on dr tarver when we get back chris nodded then walked slowly through the doors when im distracted he said like upstairs i can almost put the reality out of my head but when im alone like a minute ago alex pressed her cheek to his chest as they walked youre not alone remember that alex he caught his breath as they stepped over a hole in the sidewalk everybody faces death alone she shook her head not you you have ben andill be right beside you no matter what happens he squeezed her shoulder but nothing bads going to happen she said forcefully were going to find these assholes and were going to get you cured right his reply was a whisper i hope so will kilmer sat in his explorer watching thora shepard walk angrily up and down the block beneath the amsouth tower she clearly meant to ambush rusk even if she had to wait all day to do it will knew that the confrontation was imminent since one of his operatives had called and told him that rusk was sitting in traffic only a block away as though she were telepathic thora began to concentrate on the private parking garage from which rusk would try to leave if he had been hiding upstairs she obviously knew what kind of vehicle he drove for when the gleaming black cayenne wheeled around the nearest corner and rolled up to the bar that blocked the garage entrance thora sprinted over interposed herself between rusks window and the card reader and started banging on his window will climbed out of his explorer and hurried across the street thora was hammering the porsches window with her fists while rusk gaped in shock his only option was to back up and flee but a cadillac had already pulled into the lane behind him at last rusk lowered his window and hissed what the hell do you think youre doing give me your key card thora demanded what the cadillac honked behind them give me your card get out of here rusk snarled dont you know whats at stake you have to call it off this instant i dont know what youre talking about the lawyer said woodenly the cadillac honked again thora leaned down to the window but by now will was only a few feet away he knows she hissed chris knows everything youre crazy if you dont call it off im going to rusk thrust his key card past her and tried to slip it into the slot to wills amazement thora sank her teeth into the lawyers forearm with enough force to compel a scream rusk yanked back his arm and thora grabbed the card when the driver of the cadillac opened his door and got out rusk realized how dangerous the scene was get in you crazy bitch he snapped hurry thora ran around the cayennes hood and climbed into the passenger seat rusk took the card from her and jammed it into the slot when the barrier rose he screeched into the parking garage will took out his cell phone and called alex but again he got no answer chapter chris was vomiting in the bathroom of their room at the cabot lodge when alexs cell phone began to ring she had only plugged it in a moment ago and now she was supporting chris while he puked you can get it chris croaked dryheaving over the commode im okay youre far from okay this is just side effects from the medicine go alex let go of his shoulders and ran into the bedroom the caller id listed wills phone the detective sounded ten years younger when he answered her callback kid ive been trying to reach you all morning this things breaking wideopen whats happened thora shepard just confronted rusk on the street below his office shes lost her mind stood right in front of his car screaming at him to call off the hit on her husband jesus where are they now up in rusks office i think alex thought quickly she had already called kaiser about checking out eldon tarver but she didnt want to wait for answers can you get someone to take your place and stay on thora i want you to meet me somewhere else i guess so where are we going the old pullos restaurant that place closed years ago i know its a free clinic now and you need me there because theres a small chance it could get dicey how small ten percent but you never know right isnt that what you tried to teach me will chuckled okay ill meet you there in fifteen minutes lets meet a few blocks away the park behind the governors mansion ill be there when alex turned toward the bathroom she found chris sitting on the edge of the bed what happened he asked hoarsely she didnt want to lie but she wasnt about to tell chris that his wife was running amok on the streets of jackson not in his present state will almost got into an accident she said chris gave her a sidelong glance you said where are they now i meant the people who almost hit him alex pulled back the bedclothes and motioned for chris to get under them you need rest come on get in he looked back at her with hollow eyes but rather than protest he let himself fall onto the sheet and shoved his feet under the covers alex set the hotel phone beside him within easy reach if it gets worse call and demand to be taken to umc he nodded weakly she leaned over and kissed him on the forehead ill be back soon to check on you as she straightened up he caught hold of her wrist with surprising force be careful alex he said his dark eyes intense these people dont care about anybody dont throw your life away i know he jerked her wrist hard do you at last his concern penetrated the buzz of excitement in her brain i think so good when chris let go of her arm she removed the borrowed sigsauer from the shoe box in the closet slipped it into her waistband at the small of her back and hurried into the hall andrew rusk stopped the elevator one floor short of his office he wasnt about to drag a hysterical thora shepard past janice besides he no longer felt safe discussing anything sensitive in his office when the doors opened he smelled sawdust several walls had been knocked out on this floor where a remodel was in progress hoping to find some privacy he marched thora down the hall but a guy with a ponytail was patching drywall in the area hed hoped to use looking around rusk saw that ponytail was the only workman in the area he dug out his wallet handed a cnote to the workman and said he needed twenty minutes with the lady ponytail grinned and headed for the elevator rusk walked over exposed concrete to a tall window then turned and spoke to thora with all the pentup frustration of the past hours what the hell has gotten into you lady have you lost what little mind you have fuck you thora shouted shaking her forefinger in his face you told me this was safe you told me nothing could go wrong you remember that you cocky bastard but something has gone wrong chris knows everything thats impossible her eyes blazed you think so he called me you stupid prick he said i might be dead in a year but youre dead too he also said id never see ben again because id be in prison how does that make you feel andy does that wipe the smirk off your face rusk tried not to show how deeply her words had disturbed him you have to call it off thora insisted thats the only option he started to explain why he couldnt do that then stopped himself he couldnt tell this woman that he had zero control over eldon tarver youre right he said of course well stop it she burst into tears i cant believe this any of it what am i going to do what can i possibly tell chris nothing rusk stepped closer to her he cant prove anything hes getting all this from an fbi agent whos already been fired its going to be okay thora you think i believe that what the hell do you know about marriage anyway a lot more than most people rusk thought wearily i have to tell him something rusk shook his head with deliberation youre not going to tell him anything youre not going to tell anyone anything thoras despair reverted to fury in a heartbeat dont tell me what im going to do ill do whatever the hell i decide to do i was crazy ever to listen to you thats not what you said after red simmons died and made you a multimillionaire she looked like she wanted to cut his throat thats ancient history were talking about chris now listen to me im telling you to call whatever scumbag does this stuff for you and cancel my contract right now youre not going to get another cent from me anyway rusk grabbed her arms and let her glimpse the fear behind his eyes before you start making threats you should know a couple of things first you cant hurt me without hurting yourself but thats really not the point the person who handles these jobs is an extremely dangerous man he has no conscience as you know it no compassion you should think of him as a very efficient machine and if you upset that machine by doing something as insane as refusing to pay his fee you will incur his wrath now rusk tried to get hold of himself if your husband really suspects the truth ill do what i can to stop whats been set in motion but you will do nothing if my partner had witnessed your behavior today you would already be dead no one would ever find your body thora the only mother ben would ever know would be the next woman chris marries she stared wildly at him seemingly torn between the tangible fear of having her sins discovered and the theoretical fear of being murdered herself when you look at me rusk said softly dont see mesee him do that and you just might live through this thoras eyes jinked back and forth like a strungout addicts but after a time she started blinking like a woman coming out of a seizure what am i supposed to do she whimpered where can i go you can stay in my office for now but you cant say one word about any of this within those walls my office may be bugged break that rule and ill hand you over to my partner are we clear thora wiped her mascarastained cheeks i dont want to stay here i want to see my son you cant not yet bullshit i havent broken any law rusk gasped in amazement you hired someone to kill your husband twice she laughed like a child discovering a lie that would get her out of trouble with her parents i consulted a divorce lawyer no one can prove i did anything else youve already paid me a million dollars cool arrogance descended like a curtain over her eyes i followed the investment advice you gave me that put a million dollars under your control if anyone looks at that deal itll look like you stole the money stole it and bought rough diamonds rusk was speechless youre like every other goddamn contractor i deal with andrew its easy to guarantee your work whats tough is honoring your guarantee he looked past her to make sure that ponytail hadnt returned if anyone heard this conversation now thora said her voice utterly composed im going to ride downstairs and go back to my old life you are going to make sure that nothing happens to my husband but if something shouldor if even one policeman rings my doorbelli will hang your ass out to dry andrew are we clear rusks mind was spinning this woman had no clue to the reality of the situation there was no going back to her previous lifenot for her or anyone else thora shepard was one of those beauties who had slid through life without any mud sticking to her no matter what sins she committed she thought she could do the same thing now but sooner or laterprobably sooner given the escalation of surveillance by the fbisomeone would lock her in a small room and turn up the heat and she would crack like a china doll you need to see something he said you delusional bitch he added silently he stepped around a pile of sheetrock lying across three sawhorses let me show you why you cant just go back to your old life he nodded toward the window then offered to escort her with his arm she looked contemptuously at the arm but she did walk to the window do you see those men down there he asked stepping over ponytails toolbox where there on the corner and on the steps across the street see him thora splayed her hands on the window the guy reading the newspaper yep fbi the woman too the jogger thoras mouth opened how do you know rusk looked over his shoulder back through the metal studs of the new office i have contacts at the bureau but why are they here how much do they know i dont know yet do you see any other likely agents as thora stood on tiptoe he bent and lifted a claw hammer out of ponytails toolbox something shifted in the box as he rose and thora turned at the sound but by then rusk was already swinging the head of the hammer smashed through her skull above the ear deeply enough that he had to yank hard to free it she tottered on her feet then fell blindly trying to shield her face with all the repressed terror of being caught coursing through his arm rusk swung the hammer as though chopping firewood this spoiled bitch had threatened everything hed worked five years to buildbut had he backed off and called for help no hed stepped up to the fucking plate never again would eldon tarver see him as a gutless middleman afraid to get his hands dirty rusk stopped swinging and stood over the bloody corpse breathing the way he had on that first day at base camp on everest never had he felt such elemental power he only wished his father were here to see it will was waiting for alex when she arrived at the park behind the governors mansion she got out of the corolla locked it and climbed into the passenger seat of his explorer whats the deal with this clinic will asked its owned by a doctor from umc eldon tarver i got a funny feeling when i talked to him wills eyes crinkled with interest what kind of feeling you know what kind i gotcha tarvers wife died of cancer years ago and he inherited a lot of money he opened up this place in memory of her he treats a lot of poor people for aids herpes stuff like that but i think he might be doing more hes a cancer specialist and this would be a perfect front for him he could give those patients any kind of virus or toxin he wanted to then monitor them when they come back for free medicine a freako then maybe alex bit her bottom lip or maybe hes just a good samaritan will barked a mocking laugh havent met too many of those in my time they may look like angels but theyre usually getting something out of what theyre doing some way or other were about to find out i hope lets go will put the explorer in gear and started driving i wish i knew what kind of car he drives kaiser should be able to tell us soon i already gave him tarvers name ill do my own check just in case nothing against the fbi you understand spell the name alex did got it said will jotting in the small notebook he carried at all times hey wheres dr shepard the cabot lodge kilmers eyes asked a silent question she laid her hand on the detectives arm hes sick will bad but its not your fault okay bullshit it aint goddamn it sleeping at my post they used to shoot us for that you were drugged all three of you now let go of that and get your mind on the game i need you will rubbed his wrinkled face between both hands and sighed you taking your piece in with you she shook her head not this time shit will reached into the glove box and brought out a shortbarreled magnum im gonna be close then thats where i like you partner the renovated pullos restaurant possessed little of its former personality the only things alex recognized were some curiously shaped light fixtures hanging above where the old buffet used to stand apart from these the building had been gutted just inside the door sat a receptionist her coffeecolored elbows resting on a scarred metal desk to her right was a large group of chairs several of which were occupied by emaciated men who smelled of alcohol cigarettes and body odor a narrow corridor led deeper into the building but alex learned nothing by glancing down it an opaque window looked onto the waiting room from the back wall and alex got the feeling it was used to covertly study the patients can i help you asked the receptionist i hope so i was just speaking to dr tarver over at the medical center he asked me something i didnt know the answer to but now ive found out for him i wanted to tell him in person the receptionist eyed alex up and down trying to read her welldressed caucasian women were clearly not usual visitors at the clinic whats your name she asked alexandra morse well the doctors not here but let me go back and talk to somebody he may be coming in soon thank you id appreciate it the woman got up as though she were doing alex a huge favor and walked slowly down the corridor alex stepped closer to the desk and read everything she could off its surface there were bills addressed to the tarver free clinic and one to eldon tarver md a halfhidden magazine lay open under the appointment book jet written on a lined pad in an almost illegible scrawl were the words entergy bill latenoel d traver dvm beneath this was a number alex was memorizing the number when the receptionist returned he aint coming in today she said giving alex a territorial glare not at all thats what i said the receptionist sat down and opened her magazine as though she had done her duty and now intended to forget that alex existed alex started to ask her to take a message then thought better of it turning to leave alex almost bumped into a man wearing what had to be a business suit excuse me she said im sorry the newcomer had closecropped gray hair and steelblue eyes his face triggered something in her mind but what he reminded her of some senior bureau agents who had entered the fbi after leaving the army cid or the navy jag corps not a problem miss the man said with the slightest of smiles he stepped wide for her to pass and alex did despite a desire to ask what the hell the guy was doing in a dump like this maybe he thought it was still a restaurant in its heyday pullos had drawn some very rich men for breakfast outside alex looked back and saw the stranger in conversation with the receptionist he seemed to be having about as much luck as she had scanning the street for will she walked past a dark sedan that had parked in front of the clinic then strode down to wills explorer and got into the passenger seat a moment later will climbed behind the wheel any luck he asked nothing good he nodded you see that guy who just went in yeah you know him i know his type soldier thats the vibe i got too good girl and check this out will pulled into the street and let the explorer idle forward with the slightest inclination of his head he prompted alex to look to her left when she did she saw a young man wearing an army uniform sitting behind the wheel of the sedan she had just walked past she registered sergeants stripes on his shoulder and then they were past him he drove the sharpdressed guy here yep did you see the door the car door us government printed in black what the hell will drove down the block and turned toward the spot where alexs corolla was parked they sure as shit aint the irs who are they will grinned ive got that same feeling you were talking about before alex was thinking about the electric bill you ever hear of a vet named noel traver a military vet no a veterinarian cant say i have but traver is pretty damn close to tarver aint it alex pictured the notepad in her mind substituting lettersshit its an anagram eldon tarver and noel traver noel d traver i should have said there was a note on a desk in there about a late electric bill now were getting somewhere wills eyes flashed a cancer doctor with an alias that make sense to you not unless hes married to two women alex thought aloud something like that or tax evasion will suggested with a laugh maybe those guys were with the irs i think its time to find out he grinned you want to go back and see how long that guy stays inside the clinic yeah make the block i wish i had my computer if hes still there maybe tarver is inside with him will hit the gas and made the block not even stopping for a red light the instant they turned back onto jefferson street alex saw that the dark sedan was gone if i had to guess said will id say hes headed for the interstate let me out here ill jog to my car will slammed on the brakes and alex jumped onto the pavement when the detective floored it the door slammed shut by itself chapter describe her to me said dr tarver edward biddle pursed his lips and looked around the spartan office dr tarver knew biddle was wondering if this was the place were the groundbreaking research had been done about fiveeight biddle said dark hair pretty scars on the right side of her face almost like shrapnel scars dr tarver tried to keep his face impassive but biddle could not be deceived who is she eldon another of your obsessions dr tarver had almost forgotten what it was like to be in the company of someone who knew his private predilections shes an fbi agent shes working alone though no support from the bureau he expected to see anxiety in biddles eyes but he saw only displeasure an fbi agent shes not a problem edward thats an unrelated matter is your car still out there biddle waved his hand as though making the car vanish with his gesture lets get down to brass tacks what have you got five minutes ago dr tarver had been pumped and ready to make his pitch then alexandra morse had walked through the front door i need to take care of something first give me just one minute biddle wasnt accustomed to waiting but he raised his hand in assent eldon left the office and walked into his private restroom down the hall the door said phlebotomist he wasnt about to share a toilet seat with the scuzziest percent of the population of jackson mississippi even excluding the viruses he had given them many of the clinics patients carried most of the nastiest bugs resident in the american population he closed the door and leaned back against it his heart thudding in his chest a few minutes ago he had been focused on the terms of his negotiation with biddle now alex morse had put the whole deal in jeopardy if she werent so goddamned observant her visit might have meant little but she was if morse could look at a photo of this clinic for a few seconds and make the connection to pullos restaurant then she would eventually realize that the army major in the vcp photo she had noticed in his office was the same man she had seen walking into the clinic this afternoon thirty years had passed since their vcp days but biddle looked essentially the same his hair was gray now but he still had his hair the son of a bitch and not only had morse seen biddle enter the clinicshe had exchanged words with him yes she would remember him all right and once she did she would quickly uncover the true nature of the vcp and that would allow her to track eldon tarver from his old life to his new one eldon couldnt take that chance he could not take on his new identity until alex morse was dead he was lucky that pearson had called to warn him that morse might show up she made a big deal about the restaurant eldon and shes the type to come down and make a nuisance of herself i probably said too much but chris shepard is a highly reputable internist from natchez i just wanted you to know so you wouldnt be blindsided by the girl blindsided dr tarver murmured fubab more like killing an fbi agent was risky if you did that you were asking to be hounded to the ends of the earth for as long as you lived in the carport he had acted on instinct he would have to give it careful thought right now he had business to take care of the biggest deal of his life he flushed the toilet for cover then walked back into his office sat behind his desk and folded his hands buddhastyle over his stomach you want to know what ive got edward biddles pale blue eyes were those of a man who had handled many critical negotiations bullshit did not fly in the rooms he worked you know me eldon straight to business dr tarver leaned back in his chair ive got exactly what you were looking for all those years ago which is the holy grail biddle just stared the perfect weapon perfect is a mighty big word eldon dr tarver smiled he doubted they ever said mighty big at yale which was where biddle had gone to college he must have picked it up at detrick how about a weapon that is one hundred percent lethal yet which no one could ever prove was a weapon at all it makes bw agents like anthrax or even smallpox relics of the dark ages wasnt it you who spoke of the holy grail at detrick edward a weapon that couldnt be perceived as a weapon yes but every scientist who ever worked for me helped prove that it was impossible oh its possible it already exists eldon opened his desk drawer and took out a small vial filled with brownish liquid here it is what is it a retrovirus biddle sniffed source simian of course as we always suspected and as aids proved viable what do you call it dr tarver smiled kryptonite biddle wasnt laughing are you serious its just a working name the actual viral pedigree must remain my proprietary secret for now but if you decide to buy it just so if you decide to buy it then you can look behind the curtain and you can call it whatever you wish biddle rubbed his hands together with a dry grainy sound tell me what else makes this kryptonite a perfect weapon first it has a long incubation period ten to twelve months right now with death following in an average of sixteen months death from what cancer biddle tilted his head to one side our old friend yes the retrovirus induces it directly or is there immune breakdown first selective breakdown only the necessary steps it switches off the cellular death mechanism granting immortality it disguises itself from killer t cells it begins producing its own growth factor all the best viral strategies biddle was already thinking about the larger implications eldon the indiscriminate nature of that kind of weapon renders it unusable on a large scale you know that tarver leaned forward ive solved that problem how ive already created a vaccine i grow it in horses biddle pursed his lips so wed have to vaccinate all our forces prior to using the weapon yes yes but we already do that you could do it under cover of any other immunization biddle was frowning now suspicious that his time was being wasted but what about the general population if we vaccinated the general population it would set off all sorts of alarms and dont tell me we could do it under the guise of avian flu vaccine or something you could never keep it a secretnot in this day and age eldon could hardly contain himself i can also sabotage the virus after infection during the early stages of replication before oncogenesis occurs biddles poker face finally slipped you can kill the virus after infection i can wipe it out no one can kill a virus once its established in the body dr tarver settled back in his chair his confidence unshakable i created this virus edward and i can destroy it biddle was shaking his head but eldon saw the excitement in his eyes after about three weeks eldon went on theres no stopping the cascade but during that window i can shortcircuit the infection so what youre telling me is i have your weapon for china biddles lips parted he had the look of a man whose mind has just been read and read accurately i know you edward tarver said with a sly smile i know thats why youre here i see whats happening in the world i know the limits of oil reserves and strategic metals i know where those reserves are flowing where the heavy manufacturing is going im no geopolitician but i see the tide turning the new cold war cant be more than twenty years off maybe less biddle chose not to comment i know the capabilities of chinese nuclear submarines tarver went on i know about their missile program and even high school students know the size of their standing army almost three million strong and growing the real strength of that number lies in the fact that life is cheap there edward casualties mean nothingunlike the country we happen to be sitting in biddle shifted in his seat and spoke softly your point being the chinese arent the russians you wont be able to spend them into oblivion they already keep our economy afloat if they decide to pull the plug now well only have one option going nuclear biddle nodded almost imperceptibly and we wont do that tarver asserted you know we wont because we wont be able to the yellow men can afford to lose half a billion people we cant more important theyre willing to lose them and were not biddles eyes were halfclosed he was probably put off by the amateur strategizing but eldon knew he had made his point however clumsily is this kryptonite sexually transmissible biddle asked quietly one variant is and one is not a tight smile thats convenient you wont believe what ive accomplished edward you want deniable political assassination give me one tube of blood from your target ill induce cancer in vitro then you can reinject the blood into him hell be dead of nonhodgkins lymphoma eighteen months later biddles smile broadened i always said you were my most promising egghead eldon dr tarver laughed out loud so youre telling me said biddle that we could set this virus loose in a slum in shanghai and by the time the first cases started dying theyd have fifteen months of exponential infection it would be in every major chinese city theyd see a host of different cancers not just one the chaos would be unimaginable it would also have leaped the oceans biddle observed eldons smile vanished yes wed have to accept some casualties but only for a while with the example of aids most countries would initiate crash programs to find a vaccine your company could take the lead in the us and you could head it up said biddle is that what youre thinking i shouldnt lead it but i should be part of it and after a reasonable amount of timebefore the death toll climbs too high over herewell come forward with an experimental vaccine the rest of the world would demand access to it over the objections of their medical establishments you know the ego battles involved in this kind of research look at gallo and the french also no one but us could be sure that our vaccine worked the delays could last years but our population would be protected the entire time how difficult would it be for someone else to develop a vaccine without knowing what i know twenty years is optimistic were talking about a retrovirus look at hiv as a model its been around since and longer biddle corrected quietly tarver raised an eyebrow in any case we still dont have an aids vaccine were not even close nevertheless with chinas population this wouldnt be a decisive weapon but rather a destabilizing one you want apocalypse i can give you that how eldon held up his hands and drew them apart simply lengthen the incubation period i could stretch it to the scale of something like multiple myeloma twentyfive to thirty years amazement now could you really of course ive purposefully shortened the incubation in my work why to be able to carry out my research in a measurable time frame lengthen the incubation to twenty years and id be dead before i saw my first results biddle wet his lips with his pale tongue with a fiveyear incubation period seventy percent of the population over fifteen could be infected before anyone got sick even if they had an effective vaccine it would be too late theyd already be battling total social breakdown yes eldon lowered his voice ill tell you something else i think i can make these viruses racespecific biddle blinked in disbelief this is herman kahn territory thinking about the unthinkable somebody has to do it or all our ancestors will have lived and died for nothing the world will be inherited by dont even say it said biddle in whatever discussions we may have in futurewith whatever peopledont mention that side of it the darwinian side why not you dont have to the right people will understand the implications eldon leaned forward again i trust your instincts sonow that you know what im offering id like to hear how interested you are and what im willing to pay said biddles eyes but his mouth said obviously im interested but just as obviously there are some issues such as biddle gave him a knowing smile a shared look between equals youre ahead of your time eldon you always were you know that tarver nodded but said nothing but biddle went on a note of optimism in his voice not nearly so far ahead as you once were the regulatory climate has been hell since the clinton years but things are loosening up everyones ramping up their primatebreeding capacity theyve finally realized that you can only go so far in the lower species and of course chinas far ahead of everyone else in that too biddle conceded this with a nod so far ahead that were already doing some of our primate research there eldon shook his head in disgust biddle shifted in his seat of course when the other shoe dropspolitically speakingall those projects will be nationalized and youll be cassandra vindicated youll look like the messiah eldon how long before that shoe drops no way to know but thats not critical to our arrangement as for getting you a new identity i can take care of that in a few days if you want money real money i want what this technology is worth a look of slight surprise that will take longer how much longer hmmthree years maybe five anger and bitterness rose from tarvers gut it could be sooner biddle added depending on a score of factors but i dont want you to be under any illusions and after all money was never your primary motivation was it im fiftynine edward the world looks different than it did in biddle nodded you dont have to tell me but think about this youll be going to work for a company that understands your particular needs ill be your sole liaison if you like youll have a free hand with research can you promise that no one looking over my shoulder guaranteed my concern old friend is the risk of waiting even one minute to move to the next phase i want you to come with me now today this minute tarver drew back his palms tingling with foreboding why i dont want to risk anything happening to you before my people see your research i want your data today eldon all of it we havent agreed to anything yet biddle looked hard into his eyes when the transgene man spoke it was with the gravity of a soldier not a corporate officer his voice was edged with steel and brimming with heartfelt emotion listen to me eldon the money will come recognition will come too from the proper quarters but whats most important is what youll be doing for your country you know whats coming the fucking dragon is getting stronger by the day hes already eating out of our bowl and pretty soon a look of selfdisgust twisted biddles mouth shit im not even saying we deserve to survive given the way most americans have pissed away their birthright but those of us who remember what makes us greatits up to us to insure our national survival ive bled for this country eldon you have too in your way but you dont resent it do you i think you feel the same obligation i do dr tarver looked down at his desk there had never been any question of refusing of course he had merely hoped that the more tangible symbols of appreciation would come his way more quickly but that was all right with andrew rusks diamonds added to what remained of his own he would be comfortable for as long as it took transgene or the government to compensate him fairly all right edward im on board biddles face split in an expansive smile then he wrung his hands together and said lets talk timing im serious about expediting this i want to move you out of here today eldon held up his hands we havent seen each other for two years im not going to step in front of a bus before tomorrow you dont know that a drunk could run you over a punk could knock you on the head lightning could strike you or i could find a richer bidder eldon said bluntly his words hit biddle like a sucker punch to the throat are you looking for one he asked quietly no but i need a day edward one day suspicion clouded biddles eyes what kind of loose ends could possibly justify waiting for a moment eldon considered asking his old colleague to take care of alex morse for him the transgene director undoubtedly had military or intelligence contacts who could take her out and make it look like an accident but if biddle and the transgene board perceived eldon tarver as a risk to the company a man who had left a trail that could one day lead the authorities to their darkest secrets they might decide to eliminate him as soon as they possessed the virus and its documentation no he needed to enter his new life clean an unblemished hero to biddle and his breed fucking lancelot for once in his life you have to trust me edward he said tomorrow im yours biddle looked far from satisfied but he didnt argue further how are you going to get me out heres what im thinking said biddle transgene is owned by the same parent company as the firm thats building the nuclear plant between baton rouge and new orleans if we ive wondered about that eldon cut in new orleans already has one of the largest nuclear plants in the country biddle smiled the power produced by the new plant will be routed across louisiana to texas its a lot easier to build a nuclear plant in louisiana than texas there are laws of course but theres no organized resistance hell theres nothing but blacks white trash cajuns and chemical plants on that whole stretch of river cancer alley said tarver but how does that relate to me your new identity papers will take two or three days to be processed im going to airlift you to the plant construction site while we wait shouldnt take more than a couple of days and youll be very comfortable youll have your own trailer like a hollywood actor tarver gave him a wry smile who handles the new identity biddle answered equivocally its a bit like the witness protection program only its handled by the pentagon tarver chuckled its good to be dealing with professionals again ive felt pretty damn alone out here in the wilderness biddle stood and shot his cuffs speaking of that how the hell have you managed to accomplish what you have feeling fully secure once again dr tarver finally let some of his pride show through for inside he was as proud as lucifer ill tell you its more a matter of will than anything else i could have done what i have twice as fast at a major research center or at fort detrick but the reality is no one would have let me biddle thought about this youre right i just thank heaven we still have men like you working in the trenches dr tarver basked in the glow of biddles praise he knew from experience that it was not easily won i assume we have some logistics to take care of biddle said what do you need to bring out besides data special equipment biologicals no machinery too much risk involved in moving it out check biologicals i can bring the agents i need out in a single pelican case and my critical files can fit in a backpack excellent the only question that remains is timing tomorrow as i said but id like you to be on call beginning now biddle stared at him for a while is there anything more i need to know eldon tarver dodged the meaning behind the question id like you to fly the helicopter when i call you come and wherever i say biddle scratched his chin any risk of a hot extraction eldon smiled hed always loved intelligence jargon i dont anticipate that id prefer not to even have an observed extraction we dont want to put the company in a difficult position again i dont foresee a problem all right then biddle grinned hell id love to fly this mission i need to keep my hours up biddle offered his hand and eldon took it the old soldiers handshake was stiff like a formal salute until tomorrow said the doctor biddle walked to the door then turned back his face grave is it worth sticking around to handle unfinished business when you have an fbi agent poking around tarver regretted revealing morses true identity im afraid shes involved with that business biddles face darkened but his cold blue eyes remained steady as long as youre clean as regards our business absolutely chapter alex let herself into room as quietly as she could inside it was as dark as the hotels blackout curtains could make it she moved carefully across the floor of the suite trying to remember the furniture placement as she felt her way around a chair she heard a quavering voice ahalex chris yeah are you okay ththink so as she felt her way along the bed her eyes adjusted to the darkness and she picked out chriss eyes in the shadows he was lying on his back with the covers pulled up to his neck his forehead glistened with sweat my god whats going on typical initial ruhreaction to virus your marrow spits out a ton of igg to ddeal with the invadertries to kill the virus with fever later ondifferent immunoglobulinsright nowclassic symptoms he shook his head angrily dont think im critical right nowunlesspoisoned that hasntbbeen the patternright no but you need to get checked out anyway ill get tom to pput me through the mill i think youre past that chris i think its time to charter a jet and fly up to sloankettering want someone i trust well send out the tests everybody does fuhfor complex stuff alex wanted to call but chris wasnt panicking and he was the physician not her but was he thinking clearly he was undoubtedly depressed given what had happened to him and maybe even delirious for all she knew he might even be in shock dont worry he said smiling weakly ill ttell you when to panic she forced a smile in return do you mind if i use my computer he shook his head the light wont bother you no she bent and laid her hand on his burning shoulder but he jerked away anger and frustration surged through her never had she felt such impotence will kilmer had been unable to catch the government car they had seen parked at dr tarvers clinic john kaiser had called but to her dismay he had not been researching eldon tarver at all instead remaining focused on andrew rusk most of what kaiser had learned duplicated information alex had uncovered weeks ago kaiser had also told her that the fbi agents tailing rusk believed thora shepard was still inside the lawyers office kaiser thought this would give him some leverage in trying to persuade the local sac that alexs suspicions were grounded in fact shed asked kaiser to change his focus to dr tarver and informed him of the noel d traver alias after kaiser had promised to do what he could she signed off alex went to the hotel desk took her laptop out of hibernation and logged into the hotels ip network as the internet portal loaded she wrote what she had memorized at tarvers clinic onto a hotel notepad noel d traver dvm entergy bill late the first thing alex learned when she tried to log into the ncic computer was that her access code was no longer valid the third time she tried she got a message saying that a report was being sent to the ncic security department the cold fingers of exclusion reached deep into her chest mark dodson was being thorough in his efforts to end her career she could no longer check the governments national database of criminal records a crippling blow to any investigator she would have to go to google like any civilian cursing quietly she did so and typed eldon tarver into the search line the name returned over a hundred hits the first twenty were abstracts of medical articles or web announcements of various research incentives at the university medical center as she moved deeper into the result pages she found a few stories about dr tarver opening his free clinic downtown several black leaders had praised him to the skies and three years ago one black citizens group had given him their annual citizenship award tarver was listed as one of the top fifty physicians in the state of mississippi in that article alex learned that tarver was boardcertified in pathology and had been since chris she said softly yeah eldon tarver is boardcertified in pathology does that make sense to you uhnot really i figured hematology or oncology hes certified in hematology too but thats much more recent his first specialty seems to have been pathology weird the bedclothes rustled can you gget me a towel she rushed to the bathroom and got one where do you want it muhmouth he said through chattering teeth to bite on jesus as chris opened his mouth she saw that his entire body was shivering she stuffed in the towel and he clamped down hard after watching him shiver for half a minute she went helplessly back to her computer before she could continue searching her phone rang it was kaiser whats up she answered noel d traver has no criminal record but when i checked into his past i found that the vet school he claimed to have graduated from has no record of his attending it mississippi granted him a license based on papers he gave them from the state of tennessee he didnt have to pass a test hes not actually practicing here he owns and operates a dogbreeding facility in south jackson he sells dogs to medical schools for animal research alex tugged at an errant strand of hair beside her chin this is strange john especially if hes not noel traver at all but eldon tarver hang on a sec she heard voices but could not make out words alex i need to call you back she hung up and went back to her computer it struck her then that she had not tried the simplest method of finding out whether noel traver was an alias or not she typed the name into google then searched images the computer hummed and clicked and then a row of thumbnails began to load the first picture that popped up showed an africanamerican man wearing an army uniform captain noel d traver the second showed a high school kid with pimples the third image showed a squareheaded man with a gray beard and a full head of hair the picture had been shot by a photographer for the jackson clarionledger the caption read breeder treats research pups like pets the picture was grainy but alex had no doubt noel d traver was not eldon tarver what the hell she whispered her cell phone rang again she answered without looking at the screen john no its will do you have something maybe dr eldon tarver owns a pathology lab here in jackson what jackson pathology associates they do the lab testing for a lot of local doctors theyre pretty successful apparently they do dna analysis onsite this guy is something you want me to ride out there and check it out yes poke around and see if anything seems out of whack will chuckled i know the routine alexs phone beeped indicating an incoming call kaisers cell call me later will gotta go she clicked over to kaisers phone hello im sorry alex im over at the jackson field office and things are kind of messy right now the sac found out about my little off duty surveillance club and john listen to me i did an image search on noel d traver and i found a picture of him yeah its not him i mean its not eldon tarver really i dont get it two names that are perfect anagrams couldnt be coincidencenot if one name is found on the desk of the owner of the other i agree were into something weird here changing subject the sac says that even if youre right this is a homicide case and not under our jurisdiction webb tyler sucks kaiser laughed quietly webb says i should turn over any evidence i have to the jackson police department and go back to new orleans and you should find a new line of work screw him i say we check out noel travers dogbreeding facility tyler wont go for that i already asked for a search warrant no dice jesus whats his problem snapped alex mark dodson is his problem tyler knows dodson hates your guts and he thinks dodson is the new directors fairhaired boy he also thinks jack moran is on his way outearly retirement so tylers not about to help me since im a disciple of the wrong acolyte im starting to think im well out of the bureau you know better than that well get the warrant we just have to keep piling up evidence how without any support i dont guess tyler will try for autopsies on the past victims huh kaiser laughed out loud do you have any idea where eldon tarver is at this moment no he lives alone and hes not at home hes not at the university or at his clinic either ill let you know when we locate him alex grunted in dissatisfaction so exactly where is this dogbreeding facility dont even think about it not without a warrant i can find it on my own you know youre making it hard enough on me already ive got to go call me if theres something i need to know alex hung up and dialed will kilmer speak will said noel d traver owns a dogbreeding facility in south jackson i need you to find out where i already know i love you old man give me the address will read it out you planning on a visit i may ride by im not going in kaiser would have my ass i want you to do the same at the path lab though on my way you stay in touch i will alex went to chriss bed and knelt beside him he was still shivering but his eyes were closed now and he was breathing regularly she went back to the desk packed her computer into its case and left as quietly as she could chapter will kilmer touched alexs knee and said that building was a bakery when i was a boy hell i think it was still one till about alex nodded and kept trying to get her computer to stay connected to the internet for some reason the surveillance spot they had chosen was a cellular dead zone as far as data was concerned will had parked his explorer in the bay of a defunct auto repair shop because it commanded a good view of the dogbreeding facility owned by noel d traver travers building was an aged redbrick rectangle about the size of a cocacola bottling plant with an even bigger parking lot surrounding it glittering razor wire spiraled along the top of the fence the only vehicle in the lot was a panel truck parked assend toward the wall of the building which put its license plate out of sight the building itself looked deserted no one had been in or out since theyd arrived two hours ago nor had any sound come from the building the distance was close to a hundred yards but still alex figured they would have heard barking or something yours again said will in response to the chirping from the seat beside her kaiser said alex he keeps calling just answer it if he knew i was here hed flip out will sighed like man fed up with bullshit he had already checked out dr tarvers pathology lab and on cursory inspection it had seemed legitimate now he was wasting the rest of his day here probably for nothing the sim card in alexs notebook computer made a momentary connection to the internet then dropped it she slammed her hand against the door in frustration it was that or toss her computer out the window shed been trying to get online to do research but now it was late enough for jamie to be out of school and he might be logged on to msn im worried about jamie she said i havent talked to him for almost fortyeight hours hes all right will said hes ten years old and he has to go wherever his old man takes him im worried about chris too she felt terrible guilt at leaving him alone in the hotel room how many times have you tried him will didnt know because hed gotten out of the explorer several times to take a leak or smoke a cigarette five or six he hasnt answered in the past hour probably sleeping huh i hope so almost all the victims have taken over a year to die will reminded her not grace the old detective closed his eyes and shook his head i think i should go back and take him to the emergency room alex said will you help me get him down to the car sure you point ill march him alex tilted her head and pointed at the tall cyclone fence around the old bakery what do you think the razor wires for it sure isnt to keep dogs inside the fence alone would do that will shrugged crimes pretty bad out this way alexs cell was ringing kaiser again she expelled a lungful of air in frustration then pressed send hello john christ alex ive been trying to get you for hours where are you she grimaced then recited her lie im at the hotel taking care of chris hes in bad shape have you found something yes and no tyler has really dug in his heels i think hes basically mark dodsons puppet right now im calling in all the favors i can to run deep checks on shane lansing eldon tarver and our mysterious nonveterinarian im also pushing hard for a search warrant on tarvers residence thanks alex said gratified to have someone pushing in the same direction at last anything new on the background checks lansing looks clean to me typical surgeon son of a lawyer big ladies man hes moved around a lot which is sometimes a flag with doctors but hes only thirtysix so maybe hes just the restless type like rusk hes invested in a lot of different ventures most medical but some not the radiology clinic in meridian is a legitimate concern and lansing seems to be a passive partner i suppose he could get access to radioactive material if he really wanted to but right now he seems like the least likely killer of the bunch and the others you know rusk hes rich well connected and on his second wife lives like an international playboy when hes not working the only grounds for suspicion are those business connections you turned up but all of those are aboveboard not even the irs has a gripe with rusk and tarver tarvers is a little different he was born in in oak ridge tennessee the illegitimate son of an army officer he was dumped at the lutheran childrens home in greenwood tennessee from which he was adopted at age seven the adoptive family was from sevierville tennessee i worked a serial murder case around there twelve years ago thats the smoky mountains its commercialized now but in the s it was rural with primitive fundamentalist religion some of the snake churches were based there snake churches echoed alex and will cut his eyes at her congregations that use poisonous snakes in their worship services drink strychnine that kind of crap i dont know if tarver saw any of that but his foster father was a pig farmer and lay preacher eldon went to the university of tennessee on full academic scholarship that got him out of vietnam while i was running through rice paddies tarver was doing highlevel graduate research in microbiology at ut datas pretty scarce for that part of his life but in he went to work for a major pharmaceutical company they fired him less than a year later on sexual harassment grounds it must have been something pretty bad to be fired for that in he didnt actually go to medical school until but he definitely found his calling there hes boardcertified in multiple specialties including pathology and hematology he took the job at umc in and he married a biochemistry professor there two years later she died in of cervical cancer you know the rest he opened a free clinic with the money he inherited from his wife hes had the pathology lab for over fifteen years so far no information about girlfriends or livein lovers the sexual harassment thing gives me a little pause and the birthmark alex cut in yeah said kaiser it looks pretty severe in photos i wonder why he hasnt had a buddy take it off for him i dont think he can he told me its some sort of vascular anomaly its dangerous to mess with i think weve got a weird one all right kaiser said thoughtfully my antennae are quivering we may find some kinky stuff in tarvers house if we ever get inside it webb tylers starting to piss me off hes a bureaucrat to the marrow of his bones if he has any bones he sure doesnt have a backbone alex grumbled will grabbed her knee and pointed through the windshield sixty yards away a red van was pulling through the gate of the parking lot the gate must have been unlocked because the driver simply nosed through it without getting out and drove slowly toward the side of the building chris needs me alex said trying to make out the license plate of the van it was too far away and the angle was bad one more thing said kaiser noel traver is a real mystery man on paper he didnt even exist prior to ten years ago as far as i can tell hes got a drivers license but no car and his residence appears to be the same address as that dogbreeding facility i really need to run john anything else kaiser laughed yeah one thing ive really been calling to make sure you dont do something stupid like break into tarvers house or that breeding facility alex laughed hoping it didnt ring hollow i wish she said keep pushing for that search warrant she hung up before he could reply did you hear that asked will the driver just honked his horn the red van had pulled up to a large aluminum door set in the side wall of the old bakery as alex stared the door rose until it was high enough for the van to pull inside the building son of a bitch said will i think somebodys been in there all along he may be using a remote did you get a look at the driver no the damn windows are tinted the overhead door stayed up but the van did not pull inside what should we do alex asked will stuck out his lower lip youre the boss i want to know whos in that van will laughed softly i do too and we can find out but it sure wont be legal i dont give a shit alex reached for her door handle will caught hold of her wrist hold on now lets dont get you in worse trouble than youre already in she pulled her arm free the bastards have already fired me what else can they do will lowered his head and looked at her with seven decades of accumulated wisdom well honey theres fired and then theres fired fired you just got off the phone with a special agent of the fbi if you were fired fired he wouldnt be talking to you at all alex forced herself to sit back in the explorer anger boiling in her gut immediately after graces death she had felt she was at a great disadvantage in her quest but not powerless she may have acted irresponsibly but at least shed been doing something now she was being restrained by the possibility that the agency that should have been investigating all along might finally get off its ass and do something she grabbed her computer from the floor and took it out of hibernation yet again this time her toolbar showed a threebar data connection shed already searched the names eldon tarver and noel d traver so many times in the past few hours that her eyes blurred when she looked at the google search page im missing something she said will grunted she checked msn messenger but jamie wasnt logged on what did kaiser tell you will asked not much she thought back to kaisers brief biography of eldon tarver he said there was a gap in the years when tarver was in college or grad school during vietnam i guess when did the vietnam war end they scraped the last chopper off the roof of the embassy in but for all practical purposes the big show was over by vietnam late vietnam alex murmured what something dr tarver said to me in his office it was about a research project he worked onsomething about combat veterans and cancer she closed her eyes and saw the photograph on tarvers office wall again the blackandwhite snapshot of the blonde bookended by tarver and the military officer vcp she said scrunching her eyelids tight those letters were embroidered on tarvers lab coat also painted on the building behind him what are you talking about asked will an acronym she said suddenly recalling tarvers explanation the veterans cancer project alex typed veterans cancer project into the google search field google returned over million links but not one in the first fifty referred to a formally named veterans cancer project most of the links led to sites dealing with various types of cancer in gulf war or vietnam veterans but the vietnam links dealt almost exclusively with agent orange which tarver had said his group had not looked into theres not a veterans cancer program she said puzzled or at least it wasnt a big enough deal for anyone to remember it her fingers hovered over the keyboard but veterans cancer project isnt what i saw she thought aloud i saw vcp she typed vcp into the search field and hit enter what appeared was a plethora of results related only by their sharing the same acronym next she typed vcp plus cancer the first few hits concerned a research project in india but the fifth started her pulse racing the first words following the acronym were special virus cancer programnot veterans as tarver had claimedwhich the link description defined as a scientific program that had begun in consumed percent of the annual budget of the national cancer institute for some years then was renamed the virus cancer program in alex bit her bottom lip clicked the link and began to read the vcp was a massive research effort involving some of the most distinguished scientists in the united states all probing the possible viral origins of cancer particularly leukemia my god alex breathed what is it asked will wait she said reading as fast as she could a small but vocal number of physicians have suggested that simianrelated retroviruses like hiv and sv which has been proved to have contaminated batches of human polio vaccine were in fact created by the scientists of the virus cancer program while this is disputed by the medical establishment government records confirm that tens of thousands of liters of dangerous new viruses were cultured in the bodies of living animals primarily primates and cats and that many of these viruses were modified so as to be able to jump species barriers in a significant part of the virus cancer project was transferred to fort detrick maryland the home of the united states biological warfare effort no one denies that the vcp involved an active alliance between the nih the us army and litton bionetics this is it said alex holy shit this is it what are you yelping about will asked staring hard at her screen dr tarver lied to me he told me that vcp stood for veterans cancer project it doesnt it stands for a government project that researched the links between viruses and cancer especially leukemia it took place during the vietnam era and eldon tarver worked for them jesus hes killing people whispered alex hes still doing research or else hes using what he learned back then to make money off of andrew rusk and his desperate clients her chest swelled with fierce joy weve got them will look will said gripping her wrist son of a bitch alex looked up the panel truck and the van had disappeared and the big aluminum door was sliding back down to the concrete slab you know what i think said alex what tarver is shutting everything down i went to his office and declared myself as an fbi agent i went to his socalled free clinic i even gave him a list of the murder victims for gods sake nobody on that list surprised him either christ i even asked him about the vcp picture he knows im going to figure it out eventually hes got to run will she laid her computer on the backseat and reached for the door handle again im going down there wait cried will restraining her if youve got him nailed with evidence theres no point in screwing the pooch by going in without a warrant im not going into the building be sure alex he said gravely are you coming or not will sighed then opened the glove box and took out his magnum i guess as she got out of the explorer will said wait the gates open aint it were better off driving up to the front door and telling them were lost than sneaking in there with guns shoved down our pants alex grinned and climbed back into the explorer i knew i brought you for a reason will cranked the ford pulled across the street and drove down to the gate of the old bakery as he slowed down to nose through the fence alex dialed john kaisers cell phone hey said kaiser whats up ive cracked it john the whole case you need to check out something called the virus cancer program it was a big research project in the late sixties and early seventies it involved cancer viruses and biological weapons tarver was part of it biological weapons yes theres a photo in tarvers umc office of him wearing a lab coat that says vcp the building behind him has the same acronym how did you find out what it stood for google believe it or not it was the picture in his office that did it though id never have known what to look for otherwise but tarver lied to me about what the acronym stood for he tried to make it sound noble ill get on it the sac is still stalling on the search warrant for tarvers house maybe this will tip the scales even webb tyler cant ignore this call me when you get the warrant kaiser hung up the explorer was only twenty yards from the old bakery where do you want to go asked will those casement windows in front theyre blacked out not all of them look to the right a few have been replaced with clear panes will swung the wheel and the explorer came to rest opposite one of the windows with clear glass get out and keep your hand on your pistol said alex you think theyd try something no doubt in my mind this is a deeply fuckedup individual were dealing with she got out and walked up to the windows each pane was about eight inches square but the clear ones were too high for her to look through can you give me a step up will walked over shoved his pistol into his pants then bent at the waist and interlocked his fingers alex stepped into the resulting cradle feeling as she had as a little girl when grace used to boost her up to the lowest branch of the popcorn tree in their backyard the memory pierced her heart but she caught hold of the brick sill and pulled herself up to the clear windowpane what do you see will grunted nothing yet the pane was caked with gunk she spat on the glass and wiped a circle with her sleeve then pressed her eye to the glass when her eyes adjusted she saw a wall of cages dozens of them and inside each one a sleeping dog small dogs maybe beagles you see anything yet will asked my back aint what it used to be dogs a bunch of dogs asleep in cages thats what they breed here i know buttheres something odd about it what theyre asleep so will was wheezing now well they cant all be asleep can they havent you ever heard let sleeping dogs lie alex almost laughed but something stopped her there must be a hundred of them a hundred and fifty maybe they cant all be asleep maybe they drug them as alex peered into the darkened room the sound of a distant engine reached her its tone rising steadily even before she saw the red van racing down the fenced perimeter the spark of instinct that had guided her through so many successful hostage negotiations roared to flame run she shouted leaping backward out of wills hands what is it he gasped trying to straighten his back and grab his gun at the same time run alex grabbed his arm and started dragging him away from the building what about my truck will yelled leave it they were thirty feet from the building when a scorching wall of air slapped them to the ground like the hand of god alex skidded across the cement the skin tearing away from her elbows she screamed for will but she heard only a roaring silence it took most of a minute to get her breath back then she slowly rolled over and sat up will was on his knees a few yards away trying in vain to pull a large splinter of glass out of his back behind him a vast column of black smoke climbed into the sky all the windows in the front wall were gone behind the smoke alex saw a bluewhite flame that looked more like the glow of a bunsen burner than a roaring blaze the heat emanating from the building was almost unbearable as she struggled to her feet an inhuman shriek of terror echoed across the empty parking lot then a dark simian shape burst from the building running on all fours trailing smoke and fire alex staggered three steps toward will told him to leave the splinter where it was then fell on her face chapter andrew rusk had taken two valium a lorcet and a betablocker yet his heart was still pounding his head was worse as he stared into his wifes vacuous eyes he felt as though someone had taken hold of his spinal cord where it entered the base of his brain and was trying to yank it out but i dont understand lisa said for the eighth time in as many minutes those men outside rusk said pointing to the dark patio windows of the house theyre fbi agents how do you know that maybe theyre irs or something i know because i know but i mean cuba lisa whined shhh rusk hissed squeezing her upper arm you have to whisper she jerked the arm away this is the first time youve ever mentioned cuba to me why dont you trust me rusk squelched a desire to scream of course i dont trust you you silly bitch pouting like a child lisa retreated to the sofa and tucked her legs beneath her yoga style she was wearing biking shorts and a tank top that revealed the usual fleshscape of spectacular cleavage cuba she said again its not even american yet is it he gaped at her american i mean you know capitalist or whatever lisas primary virtue was physical beauty combined with a ravenous libido rusk still had difficulty with the idea that someone of middling intelligence could experience truly intense passion but hed finally accepted it based on empirical evidence maybe it was a vanity of intellectuals to believe that dumb people couldnt enjoy sex to the degree that smart people did but maybe they did maybe they enjoyed it more still rusk doubted it at bottom he figured lisa was some kind of prodigy an idiot savant of sexual technique and that was fine for the bedroom and minor social intercourse but when it came to actual thought not to mention decision making it made things difficult he knelt before the couch and took lisas hand he had to be patient he had to convince her because there were no more options they had to get out of the country and fast thora shepard was lying under a painters drop cloth in the back of his cayenne if one of the fbi agents outside bent the law and broke into the locked garage it was all over rusk had tried to shut out his memories of the afternoon but he couldnt do it after the first euphoric moments of triumph he had looked down at thoras shattered skull with horrorbut he hadnt frozen extreme sports had taught him one indelible lesson hesitation killed knowing that ponytail would return any moment hed rolled thora into the drop cloth then carried her featherweight body through the metal studs to a distant office in the construction area there hed found a gift from god a sixtyfivegallon trash can on wheels with the brand name might as well imprinted on the lid thora fit easily into the can which hed rolled straight to the parking garage he transferred thora to the back of his cayenne and thenafter returning the trash can to a different side of the fifteenth floorhed returned to his office as though nothing had happened but something had happened and since that murderous minute hed felt his time as a free man draining away like blood from a severed vein he had an escape plan but to initiate it hed first have to break free of fbi surveillance he did not know how to do that he still held out hope that dr tarver would save themif tarver had not already bolted the doctor had requested an emergency rendezvous at chickamauga via email but rusk had been unable to keep it without dragging the fbi along with him nearly frantic hed gone to a friends office in the tower and sent tarver an email summarizing every threat arrayed against them in the hope that tarver could somehow cut through the closing net but if tarver didnt contact him soon rusk was going to have to take drastic measures like calling his father he dreaded the thought but at this pointwithout dr tarvers helpit would take the legendary clout and connections of aj rusk to save him lisa honey he said softly were only talking about a few months in cuba ive arranged for us to live on a beautiful yacht right in the marina guys like sinatra paid through the nose to hang out there with ava gardner and marilyn monroe yeah like in the dark ages lisa was twentynine years old castros history babe hes going to die any day now he may already be dead in fact she looked skeptical didnt jfk try to assassinate him like a bunch of times and he couldnt do it rusk wanted to kill oliver stone that doesnt matter honey as soon as the heat is off well move to costa rica under different names and costa rica is a goddamn paradise but i like my name rusk squeezed her hand think of it this way with the name youve got youre worth about five million bucks under your new name youre worth twenty thats a big difference this got her attention twenty million dollars he nodded with the gravity such an amount demanded he could see the wheels clicking behind her gorgeous green eyes despite the pounding at the base of his skull he managed a smile thats hollywood money babe but why cant we go to costa rica now she asked in a girlish voice he forced himself not to scream because its not safe we have to let the fbi check costa rica and find nothing then we can go there what have you done andy you said it was some kind of tax thing how pissed off can the government be about that what have i done i killed a woman who looked a lot like you only better and if you keep this up i might just kill you too he glanced worriedly at the dark windows you dont understand these things lisa the simple truth is we dont have a choice she gave him a long stare surprising in its coldness maybe you dont have a choice but i havent done anything i can stay right here until its safe in costa rica then i can join you there rusk stared incredulous she sounded just like thora shepard youd stay here without me i dont want to youre the one making this happen andy not me shes right he thought cuba had seemed such a cool idea when tarver suggested it five years ago it was one of the last mysterious places on earth the last commie outpost save china and it had that hemingway glamour what more macho retreat could there be the fucking cold war was still going on there for gods sake but then castro got sick nobody knew what was really going on and fortyeight hours after having his umbilical to dr tarver cut rusk thought the prospect of living in postcommunist chaos sounded dicey lisa certainly wanted no part of it maybe she wasnt so dumb after all i cant do it andy she said with sudden conviction i promise ill come to costa rica when you get there but i dont want to leave my mom and my friends to go to cuba babyonce we get there youll see how great it is now go upstairs and pack the absolute minimum you need to leave the country one suitcase okay one instead of obeying lisa set her jaw and spoke through clenched teeth i saidimnotgoing you cant make me and if you try ill file for divorce for the second time today rusk was stunned speechless lisa had to be bluffing hed written an ironclad prenup if she divorced him shed get almost nothing wellthat wasnt exactly true anymore over the past three years he had found it advantageous to transfer some considerable assets into her name it had made a lot of sense at the time but nownow he saw himself as a sucker like one of his pathetic clients before he realized what he was doing he had slid his right hand up to her throat one more inch and ill scream she said evenly and when those fbi guys bust in here ill tell them about every tax scam and swindle you ever pulled rusk stood and backed away from his wife who the hell was this woman and why in gods name had he married her it doesnt matter he told himself to hell with her as long as i get out of the country it doesnt matter what she does she can have a few million theres plenty more for me if only tarver would show the fuck up he walked toward the central hallway meaning to check his email on the computer in his study but as soon as he entered the hall he saw a massive shape silhouetted by the light spilling from the study hello andrew said dr tarver its pretty crowded outside did you give up on me rusk couldnt see the doctors face but he heard the cool amusement in that voice nothing rattled this guy how the hell did you get through those fbi agents soft laughter from the shadow im a country boy at heart andrew remember when i shot the ghost hell yeah rusk thought recalling the legendary buck with a flush of admiration you really pissed off the oldtimers that day dr tarver unslung a large backpack from his shoulder and dropped it on the ground with a heavy rustle can we get out rusk asked trying to sound calm i mean have you got something figured have you ever known me not to have things figured andrew rusk shook his head this was true though he couldnt remember them ever being in this kind of spot before i appreciated this afternoons email about alexandra morse id suspected that she was acting on her own but i had no idea that the bureau was going to terminate her most convenient as rusk puzzled over this dr tarver turned toward the study call lisa in here andrew we need to get started rusk started to ask why the study but then he realized it was because the room had no exterior windows he looked over his shoulder lisa come here you come here came the petulant reply lisa weve got company company oh all right im coming with dr tarvers miraculous arrival rusk felt the pleasant return of male superiority meaning to say something witty he turned back toward the doctor and saw the pistol rise as tarver shot him in the chest alex struggled up out of a dark sea into piercing white light alex said a deep voice alex im here she shielded her eyes with her left hand and reached out with her right dont touch it uncle will im not will said the voice and gradually the blur above her coalesced into the face of john kaiser his hazel eyes held a worry as paternal as any that her father or will kilmer had ever revealed youre in the emergency room at umc kaiser said youve got a pretty serious concussion but otherwise you seem to be all right wheres will she asked gripping the fbi agents hand for support tell me hes not dead hes not he may have some internal injuries they stitched up his back and admitted him for twentyfour hours observation theyre going to do the same to you she tried to sit up but a wave of nausea rolled through her stomach kaiser eased her back down onto the examining table how long have i been out several hours its night im sorry i lied to you john i know you told me not to go there i know stop wasting your energy i should have known youd go no matter what in your place i probably would have gone too what the hell happened a bomb you tell me she shook her head trying to remember all i know is i was looking inside at dogs hundreds of them and they were all asleep every last one and it just seemed wrong you know then i heard an engine and out of the corner of my eye i caught sight of a van racing away it was just like the van that followed me in natchez only it was red and i just knew you know kaiser barely nodded but his eyes told her hed experienced such intuitive flashes before i knew that somehow noel traver was eldon tarver that tarver was bugging out and that he had let me get that close to him for a reason you saw tarver at the scene no but i felt him he meant to take me out along with whatever evidence was inside that building kaiser seemed discouraged by her answer did you get the warrant for his house alex asked is the sac still stonewalling on an allout investigation kaiser sighed heavily not completely we did get the warrant for tarvers residence and theres a team there now alex raised her eyebrows so far theyve found nothing incriminating zero nothing tying him to rusk kaiser shook his head but the vcp stuff you uncovered is mindblowing in conjunction with the explosion at the breeding facility that convinced tyler to ask for the search warrant we just need to find some evidence thats fresher than thirty years old what about rusk you should search his residence and his office tyler wont budge on that he keeps saying theres no probable cause even to investigate rusk much less search his house or office and technically speaking hes right come on john tylers just the special agent in charge dont forget that he has authority over every fbi agent in mississippi dont worry rusk is bottled up in his house right now and ive got six agents covering the place no idea where dr tarver is none thora shepard kaiser looked embarrassed she was in rusks office this afternoon but somehow she slipped out without our guys seeing her come on cried alex coming off the table again a lot of people work in that building alex four agents just werent enough what about chris kaiser pushed her back down dr shepard is here in the hospital a stab of fear went through her hes conscious and hes doing a little better he has a high fever and hes seriously dehydrated he called from the hotel and when he got here he asked for an old medschool classmate dr clarke my mothers oncologist yes between dr clarke and tom cage they managed to check chris into the oncology unit here hes just a few doors down from your mother now theyve got an oncologist from sloankettering involved alex could scarcely comprehend it all she felt as though she had come out of heavy sedation for surgery what about chriss son ben shepard hes only nine and hes staying with some older woman in natchez has anyone checked on him dr shepard was delirious when he arrived but he kept asking about the boyand you by the way he finally managed to make a call ben seems to be fine and dr cage promised to check on him alex struggled to see all angles of the situation through the fog in her mind thora could be a threat to ben she thought aloud shes got to be out of her mind with fear shes also a major threat to andrew rusk and his accomplice what if she never left that building john what if shes hiding up there kaiser considered this alex grabbed his arm what if rusk killed her up there rusk hasnt killed anyone yet has he i have no idea but christ for all we know tarver could have been up in rusks office today you know i guess its possible do you think theyd move so quickly against thora two words william braid kaiser grimaced damn it all right ill get some people to start searching that tower officially no but if we find a corpse the case will break wide open we can haul rusk in and put his feet to the fire i hope you find a very scared woman will kilmer overheard thora screaming at rusk to cancel the hit on chris if she would turn states evidence wed have rusk by the balls and i guarantee rusk would cut a deal and give us dr tarver you really believe thora would talk you show her the alternative shell crack she wouldnt last a day in prison kaiser squeezed alexs shoulder im going now its time you got some rest alex snorted in contempt you know i cant sleep with all this going on then ill have the doctor sedate you you cant sedate someone who has a concussion kaiser shook his head in exasperation but alex could tell he was glad to see her healthy enough to argue with him if youll get them to discharge me she said i promise i wont leave the hospital ill spend the night in my mothers room that way i can keep an eye on both her and chris kaiser stared at her for a long time stay here he said finally stay right here as in do not move ill see what i can do chapter andrew rusk blinked awake to a hell beyond anything that his subconscious had ever spewed into his nightmares dr tarver had ducttaped him to the chair behind his desk his mouth was taped shut lisa was sitting opposite him on the leather sofa her slim wrists and ankles taped together a silver rectangle of tape sealing her lips her eyes looked twice their normal size more white than color was showing tarver stood between lisa and the desk holding both arms high above his head in his hands twisting and curling about his muscular forearms were two thick black snakes with heads as big as a mans fist a maniacal light shone from tarvers eyes some might have called it religious fervor but rusk knew better eldon tarver was as far from god as a man could get the doctor spun almost gracefully around the room as though hypnotizing the serpents into passivity yet the flexing tubular bodies never ceased their motion the room stank of urine and rusk soon saw why lisas biking shorts were stained from her navel to her knees every square inch of his own skin was popping with sweat but at least he hadnt pissed himself yet the throbbing at the base of his skull had all but ceased or maybe it had been blotted out by the agony radiating from his sternum a bolt of terror shot through him when he saw the two spots of blood on his shirt but then he saw a shining tangle of silver wire near dr tarvers feet taser wires now he remembered the gun coming up in the hallwaythe nearly pointblank shot at his chest it was a stun gun that was how tarver had gotten him into this chair the doctor stopped his eerie dance and sat sideways on the desk facing rusk the snake nearest andrew was thicker than his forearm with a diamondshaped head and bulging poison sacs beneath its eyes cottonmouth moccasin he thought the knowledge made his sphincter clench unlike most snakes cottonmouths would not retreat when humans approached they were highly territorial and would stand their ground sometimes attacking and even pursuing an intruder i see you thinking andrew said dr tarver im sure by now youve worked out exactly why im here rusk shook his head but he knew all right eldon tarver hadnt broken through a ring of armed fbi agents to do a fucking snake dance in rusks study he wanted the diamonds all of them no said tarver perhaps youre a little distracted by my friends he stretched out his right arm until the nearer snakes head was within striking distance of rusks face rusks throat sealed shut locking his breath in his chest the pupils of the moccasins eyes were vertical ellipses like cats eyes rusk saw the heatsensing pits that his scoutmaster had taught him to look for a quarter century ago as though sensing his fear the cottonmouth opened its huge mouth to reveal a puffy white oval topped with lethal twoinch fangs the stench from its mouth was sickeningdead fish and other nameless creaturesbut rusk had passed beyond thought when the doctor moved the snake closer the ocean of piss rusk had successfully withheld in junior high school flooded his khakis the diamonds andrew dr tarver said in a voice of eminent reasonableness where are they lisa was whimpering steadily on the sofa but rusk forced himself not to look his inability to help her might unman him at the moment when he most needed his full faculties he wished to god tarver hadnt taped his mouth shut he felt powerless without his voice he was a lawyer after all a wizard in the art of persuasionor so a reporter for the clarionledger had once written about him maybe that was why tarver had taped his mouth bullshit said his fathers voice he taped your mouth so you cant scream and alert the fbi agents outside rusk hated that voice but he knew he had to heed it there was no room for illusion now dr tarver was back on his feet spinning slowly constantly changing the elevation of his arms as he did motion must have something to do with keeping the snakes from biting him or maybe its just professional courtesyone coldblooded killer to another where are they andrew dr tarver asked in a singsong voice do you want an upcloseandpersonal experience with these creatures of god perhaps your lovely bride likes serpents better than you do tarver danced over toward lisa she huddled on the sofa in a fetal position alternately shutting her eyes and opening them wide unable to endure the horror but too afraid she would be bitten while her eyes were closed these are sacred creatures lisa tarver murmured they represent both life and death death and rebirth im sure through your provincial eyes you see the serpent of the christian garden who so easily corrupted evehe bent and caressed lisas thighs with a scaly tailbut thats such a limited view the scream that burst from lisas diaphragm ballooned her tapedshut lips and trumpeted from her nostrils a few more screams like that rusk thought and shell be bleeding from her nose shell drown in her own blood laughing quietly dr tarver took two steps back and opened the mouth of a white croker sack with his foot then dipped and thrust one of the moccasins into the bag stepping on the mouth of the moving sack he pulled it tight with a drawstring then caressing the head of the remaining snake he came around the desk and addressed rusk again im going to partly remove the tape from your lips andrew you will not scream you will not beg you will not plead for your life or hers i know the stones are here i know your escape plan remember i set it up but its time to let go of your bananarepublic dream and save yourself like the smart man youve always thought you were he reached out and pulled an inch of tape from the corner of rusks mouth rusk remembered his instructions but he could not obey them in a parched croak he said youre going to kill me no matter what i do dr tarver shook his head with an expression of regret then walked to the corner and picked up a putter that rusk kept there to practice his short game gripping the head of the golf club tarver began to tease the moccasin with its padded handle he jabbed its snout again and again causing the snake to bare its fangs and strike at the club a sharp odor of musk filled the room utterly alien and yet after rusk had inhaled it two or three times eerily familiar some primitive part of his brain had recognized the odor of a reptile under stress and the swampy scent sucked fear from his glands in a way he had never known before hes a fearsome killer agkistrodon piscivorus said the doctor nothing like the coral snake the elapids are deadlier per milliliter of venom but the results of envenomation are quite different with the coral snake you get numbness sweating shortness of breath paralysis and death but with these babies you get a much nastier spectrum of consequences the venom is a hemotoxin a complex mix of proteins that starts destroying blood cells and dissolving vascular walls the instant it enters your flesh it even dissolves muscle tissue the pain im told is really beyond description and the swelling my god ive seen it split the skin within hours gangrene sets in and the skin turns black as roadkill on an august day a lifealtering experience altogether andrew if you survive it are you sure you dont want to change your mind rusk stared back at tarver with utter resignation no matter what the doctor promised he meant to kill them tonight to rusks surprise this knowledge freed him from much of his fear he had tempted death often in the past but hed always done it by choice usually with other thrillseeking yuppies who knew that if the shit hit the fan paid experts would pull their asses out of the fire or off the mountain whatever the situation required this was different this was a battle to the death and there were no paid allies on his side what he knew was this he was willing to die in agony but he wasnt willing to let eldon tarver steal the fruits of five years labor rusk also knew that his newfound courage was not based on a rush of endorphins that would dissipate in a few minutes somewhere deep within him a remnant of the boy scout still survived and that scout knew that the bites of cottonmouths and rattlesnakes while every bit as painful as tarver had described were rarely fatal if the cottonmouth coiling around tarvers arm bit rusk on an extremity he might well lose an armor even a legin the morning but he wouldnt die and therein lay his secret advantage he was willing to trade an arm for million because by morning the fbi agents outside would start to wonder why he hadnt left for work and if alex morse was pushing as hard as she usually did they might crash in here even sooner rusk looked steadily at tarver and said the diamonds arent here what happened next blasted all his logic to hell tarver leaned over lisa rapped the snake twice on the snout with the golf club then let it go the moccasin struck in a blur hitting lisa in the upper chest when the blur stopped the snakes head was clenched tight around lisas forearm she leaped up from the sofa and flung her bound arms around like a woman possessed by demons finally the snake let go and its heavy body thudded against a row of books dr tarver was on the snake in a moment he distracted it with the flashing head of the putter then grabbed it behind the head and held it high lisa had collapsed onto the sofa and was now staring at two puncture wounds in her forearm her breathing grew more and more frantic until foam emerged from her nostrils when she started jerking like an epileptic rusk feared she might have a heart attack dr tarver walked back to the desk his eyes devoid of emotion you see the consequences of noncooperation im going to give you one more chance andrew before i do im going to explain something i have no intention of killing you if i kill you here that creates a host of problems for me your ex nihilo mechanism for example not to mention a murder investigation but if i leave you alive therell be no murder investigation and youll take care of the ex nihilo business for me you cant release that confession because your hands are tied by your own guilt the way its always been you see you can survive this night your diamonds are the price of life i know youve had your heart set on spending that money but whats money weighed against thirty or forty more years of life you have plenty of time to earn more but i dont i must take what life offers tarver came around the desk and sat only inches away from him the moccasin was struggling to escape put your trust in logic andrew im much safer with you alive than with you dead rusk looked across the room lisa lay shivering on the sofa still staring at the holes in her arm two tracks of blood and yellow fluid had dribbled down to her hand and there was already pronounced swelling at the site of the bite as rusk stared her facial expression changed from the stunned shock of an accident victim to fearful curiosity she lifted her taped hands and pulled down the front of her tank top exposing her left breast where the inner curve of the breast met her sternum were two more puncture marks an inch apart and joined by a dark purple swelling lisas eyes bulged like those of a woman suffering hyperthyroidism she tried to get to her feet again but this time she tumbled onto the floor are you ready to tell me where they are tarver asked softly rusk nodded ill tell you but what about lisa after i leave drive her to the emergency room tell them you were watering your lawn she went outside to switch off the faucet and she felt something hit her once she got inside you saw the puncture marks use your imagination andrew just make sure she tells the same story you do dr tarver reached out with his free hand and pulled rusks chin until they were looking eye to eye its time rusk felt physical pain as he spoke the words or perhaps the emotional shock was so severe that it caused pain under my bed he whispered in a flight case like yours tarver laughed you keep them under your bed i buried them like you said i dug them up this afternoon good decision andrew tarver walked around the desk and stuffed the second cottonmouth into the croker sack with its mate then he resealed the tape over rusks mouth and walked out of the study a soft mewling rose from the other side of the desk knowing lisa as he did rusk could not begin to fathom what must be going on in her mind if indeed any rational mind remained he was surprised how desperately he wanted to help her but the duct tape made it impossible a creaking floorboard announced dr tarvers return grinning though his beard the doctor set the heavy flight case down on rusks desk with a bang it was bright white and twice as thick as a normal briefcase tarver pulled a corner of the tape from rusks mouth what are they worth andrew i know you have at least half your money tied up in business deals i opened it in the bedroom these looked like about ten million to me nine point six tarver resealed the tape then picked up the croker sack from the floor and stuffed it into his backpack pulling a small knife from his pocket he knelt over the spot where rusk assumed lisa lay had he lied was he about to sever lisas carotids im cutting the tape on her wrists about threequarters through the doctor said calmly she should be able to rip it the rest of the way in a few minutes if you can keep her conscious she looks a little shocky to me rusk heard a faint slap then tarver said stay awake sugar tits as rusk struggled against the tape binding his arms the doctor got to his feet shouldered his backpack picked up the flight case and strode out of the study rusk felt as though he had been raped he flexed his jaw muscles hard and the tape came loose lisa he cried can you hear me she didnt respond i know you can hear me rip the tape off your hands youve got to do it before you pass out youve got to save us baby still no response rusk heard shifting body weight relief coursed through him rip the tape off your mouth use your teeth come on honey do it more movement on the floor then he heard the blessed sound of adhesive coming loose a low inhuman moan filled the study lisa are you loose do your feet honey can you hear me now the sound of tape coming loose was continuous rusk flashed back to the high school autumns when hed had to unwind what seemed miles of tape from his ankles after football games lisa was doing almost the same thing now soon she would be free he was surprised at how little he felt the loss of the diamonds compared with the joy of surviving and the prospect of getting lisa medical attention thats it honey he didnt think you had it in you but i knew you could do it the ripping stopped replaced by the sound of heavy wheezing get up sweetheart get up and get me loose the woman who stood up on the other side of the desk was almost unrecognizable an hour before lisa rusk had been a woman of rare beauty who had glided through life without trauma of any kind her eyes had shone with the complacent bliss that could only exist in the young but the woman standing across from him now looked like a refugee from a war zone someone who had been dragged through the pit of hell and violated in ways unknown and unknowable her pupils were pinned against globes of white shot with blood her mouth hung open as from a mindless stupor and her left breast swung free smeared with blood and yellowish fluid lisa can you hear me her mouth closed and opened three times but no sound emerged shes in shock rusk thought desperately holy shit cut me loose lisa ive got to get you to the hospital theres a pocketknife on the end table by the sofa the one i got for a wedding present a flicker of recognition in her eyes yes she turned toward the sofa then with the slow tread of a zombie she walked toward the end table she bent down but when she came up she was not holding the pocketknife she was holding the golf club lisa get the knife honey thats a golf club youre holding she looked down at the putter as though unable to identify it then she said softly i know as she walked toward the desk lisa lifted the putter high above her head then she swung it in a long roundhouse arc strapped immobile to the chair rusk could only tense as the flashing silver club smashed into his cranium chapter alex let go of her mothers limp hand and quietly left the hospital room she had sat there for the best part of an hour talking quietly most of the time but her mothers face had not even twitched in response margaret morses sedation was deep and justly so she had reached the point where an ending was better than continuingor it would have been were alex in the same situation alexs hospital slippers hissed along the floor as she passed the five doors that separated her mothers room from chriss her head throbbed incessantly the er doctors had given her overthecounter tylenol which hadnt even dented the pain that accompanied her concussion to her surprise she found chris awake when she entered his room as she leaned over his bed she saw tears on his face she took his hand whats the matter i just talked to mrs johnson fear awakened in the pit of alexs stomach the same fear she felt when she thought about jamie bens pretty upset chris went on thora hasnt called him and hes picked up from my voice that theres something wrong alex laid her hand carefully on his arm you need to know some things his eyes instantly became more alert will overheard thora telling andrew rusk to call off the hit on you chris started to rise from the bed but alex pushed him back with ease it frightened her to realize that he had become so weak so fast she squeezed his hand its time to arrest her chris confusion filled his eyes she tried to call it off only because she knew you were onto her frankly i think she needs to be arrested for her own protection shes a threat to rusk and tarver they might kill her just to keep her quiet and not only that what else im worried that in her present state thora might be a threat to ben chriss eyes widened i dont think shed physically hurt him given the pressure shes under she could be suicidal what if she decided to take ben with her he shook his head i dont think shedhell i guess im the worst person to ask ive been completely wrong about her so far thoras sick chris but you didnt know that you couldnt im a doctor i should have seen some clue were all blind when it comes to people we love ive done the same thing myself who would take care of ben if thoras arrested mrs johnson alex suggested chris shook his head id rather tom cage and his wife do it tom will know what to do if things get crazy she nodded ill call him for you you lie back and take it easy i dont want ben to see his mother arrested i know you dont and i dont think he will but the alternative could be a lot worse chris stared up at her with ineffable sadness alex had only seen sadness like that on the night james broadbent confessed his feelings to her after working closely with her for three years broadbent had become convinced that alex was the love of his life he was no wideeyed boy but a highly decorated fbi agent of forty with a loyal wife and two children in a voice cracking with pain broadbent had told alex that he could never abandon his family but neither could he go on without telling her about his feelings because he couldnt endure being close to her without possessing her hed planned to put in for a transfer the next week but he never did two days after his confession james broadbent was dead alex leaned down and laid her cheek against chriss pillow i know it looks hopeless now but youre going to have a life again youre going to share it with ben too chris raised his hand and touched her face careful to avoid the scars i cant see it right now i want tobut i cant i can as clearly as i see you now he closed his eyes after a moment of debate alex climbed onto the hospital bed and lay beside him if chris noticed he made no sign she had thought they would both feel better if they lay together but as she stroked his stillburning forehead she was struck by the certainty that he would not live through the night eldon tarver pulled the dodge pickup hed been saving for his final escape up to the union truck stop on i south ten seconds after he parked his passenger door opened and judah sat heavily on the front seat judah had a small backpack on his lap as soon as he closed the door he opened the pack and took out a small capuchin monkey the capuchin had a face like a human infants it looked up at eldon with anxious eyes then buried its face in judahs huge chest please dont be mad judah said tarver was furious that his brother would disobey him and sneak the monkey out of the lab but there was likely no harm done the capuchin hadnt yet been used as a test animal nor had it shared any cages with sick animals nobody saw the monkey eldon asked idling a few yards away from the building naw judah smiled she didnt make one peep did you wait in the restaurant uhuh spent most of my time in the shower area by the game room it didnt take you as long as you said eldon smiled sometimes things just fall right you know like with this one judah said rubbing the capuchins back eldon laughed then pulled out to the frontage road he drove underneath the interstate then turned left and accelerated up the ramp onto i north before long they would reach the natchez trace exit for several miles the trace ran along the ross barnett reservoir where some beautiful homes faced that stretch of the massive lake look in the backseat eldon said what do you see judah heaved his huge frame around far enough to stare into the rear seat of the pickup eldon switched on the overhead light looks like a box of rocks said judah eldon bellylaughed for almost a half mile thats just what it is brother a box of rocks judah looked puzzled but he seemed content to caress the monkey and watch the headlights on the interstate by the time they turned onto the trace tarvers face looked carved from stone chapter will kilmer was sitting in his office when his telephone rang hed checked himself out of the hospital and come in early to try to catch up on the cases hed been ignoring to help alex but the heavy backlog and the pain in his wounded back had pushed him to open the bottle of jack daniels he kept in his bottom drawer argus operations he halfgroaned shoving a stack of files to the far corner of his desk its danny will danny mills was an excop kilmer had assigned to watch andrew rusks office today what is it danny rusk hasnt shown up for work usually hes in at least a half hour before now okay stay put ill holler back at you will hung up and considered the situation he could send a man out to madison county where rusk livedor he could drive out there himself he hated that idea because commuter traffic was hell this time of the morning with the new nissan plant and all plus according to alex the fbi was watching rusk now their involvement might be unofficial but their point man was john kaiser an agent whose reputation will had long known and respected alex had given will a cell number for kaiser in case of emergency after another sip of jack daniels will lifted his phone and punched in the number kaiser answered a strong voice agent kaiser this is will kilmer calling im not sure you i know who you are mr kilmer retired homicide detective right will sat a little straighter yes sir what you got ive got a man watching andrew rusks officehave had for weeks now and he tells me rusk is a half hour late coming in this morning hes usually regular as clockwork is that so yessir i dont know what might be happening out at rusks house because i didnt send anybody out there last night didnt want to step on your toes thank you mr kilmer ill find out if anythings up i dont need to do anything just call with anything else you think i need to know will do kilmer hung up that was the kind of fbi agent he liked all business no territorial bullshit about who got credit for what will thought about calling alex but if she hadnt called him yet she must have found some way to get to sleep last night maybe chris shepard had something to do with that will hoped so the girl had been suffering for a long time and he didnt care how she got relief so long as she finally did he dragged the pile of files back and opened the one on top john kaiser climbed into the back of a black chevy suburban parked at the edge of andrew rusks property five agents were waiting in the suburbanthree men and two womenall handpicked from the jackson field office we dont have the warrant yet he said so im going to go up and knock on the front door if no one answers i want you to spread out and check the windows see if you can find probable cause for us to go in understood everyone nodded kaiser touched the drivers arm nice and easy the suburban rolled smoothly through the trees circling around to the front of rusks ultramodern home when it stopped kaiser got out and walked up onto the porch he pressed the bell first then knocked loudly no one came to the door he rang the bell again then looked back at the suburban two agents were covering him from open windows another minute passed okay he called already filled with foreboding move out all the doors opened simultaneously and the agents dispersed around the house kaiser kept knocking the longer he did the worse he felt hed walked into many a gruesome crime scene during his service with the isu and despite his belief that most mythology about intuition was exactly that he had a feeling that something obscene lay behind this door he walked down the porch steps and circled the house some agents were getting creative climbing onto ladders or air conditioners to try to see through the windows but when the cry came it came from the far side of the house kaiser started running around here shouted a female agent the kitchen what is it the agent drew back from the window her face pale looks like a female facedown on the floor car keys in her right hand and a little blood beneath it thats the only blood i see kaiser pressed his face to the glass the scene was exactly as the agent had described it the woman on the floor wore what appeared to be spandex biking shorts a tank top and pink flipflops wait five minutes then call the state police he said and the sheriffs department i believe were in the county not a municipality yes sir that sure looks like probable cause to me kaiser said she could be in need of emergency care said a male agent beside him i think i may have seen movement lets dont get carried away bring a ram from the truck yes sir kaiser watched a burly agent smash the door open then moved inside with his weapon drawn three agents followed and spread out to clear the rooms kaiser knelt and checked the fallen womans carotid pulse dead he rose and worked toward the center of the house all the while wondering what had killed the woman in the kitchen a sharp cry around a corner ahead of him made him rush forward he stopped cold an unrecognizable man sat strapped into a chair behind a desk his face horribly swollen and bloody his skull obviously fractured a bloody golf club lay on the desk before him could that be andrew rusk what the fuck happened here asked a male agent pointing at lines of blood drops spattering the ceiling you mean how the fuck did this happen kaiser corrected him didnt we have agents watching this place all night yes sir six i was here myself you didnt hear anything no sir did you kill him kaiser asked in a deadpan voice no sir kaiser moved behind the chair reached into the corpses back pocket and slowly worked out his wallet the drivers license in the wallet identified the bloody mess in the chair as andrew rusk damn it kaiser thought this is going to be a nightmare a clusterfuck of jurisdictions a turf battle within the bureau he winced at the sound of his cell phone he expected sac tyler but the lcd window read alex morse he started to ignore the call but then he reminded himself that this was morses case had been from the start morning alex hey john will kilmer told me there might be something wrong out at rusks house kaiser sighed you could say that rusks dead and a woman with him im guessing shes his wife dead jesus im coming out there kaiser heard the excitement in her voice thats a terrible idea the place is going to be crawling with agents and cops webb tylers liable to come out here youre not supposed to be anywhere near this caseor any other case for that matter wellat least now we know i was right rusk was in this thing up to his eyeballs we dont know anything of the kind all we know is that someone you disliked intenselysome might say even persecutedis dead so i think the prudent thing is for you to stay away and let me brief you later there was a long silence do you agree john ive been investigating andrew rusk for weeks while everyone else sat on their asses and told me i was nuts ive been inside that house i might see things your people wouldnt see in ten years of looking kaiser felt a chill of suspicion youve been inside rusks house alex fell silent obviously aware that her passion had carried her into dangerous waters you stay where you are alex thats an order i hear you damn it ill call you as soon as i know anything youd better kaiser hung up one hour later alex pulled her rented corolla into the mass of law enforcement vehicles parked outside the rusk house she knew kaiser would be furious but after six weeks of blood sweat and tears she could not sit idle while others picked up the baton and went forward besides she rationalized kaiser cant give me orders if im no longer an fbi agent he was only a few pay grades above me anyway and sac tyler wont come out herenot in a million years he likes that airconditioned office downtown alex fell into her official stride and walked past a cordon of sheriffs deputies a couple of fbi agents gave her the eye but nobody challenged her in less than a minute she had worked her way into the study where what remained of andrew rusk was still taped into his chair crouched behind him were two men one of whom alex recognized as john kaiser a strange blue glow emanated from behind them then she recognized the roar of a cutting torch after about a minute she heard a grunt of triumph then kaiser stood up and turned goddamn it he said with genuine annoyance dont you ever listen this is my case she said doggedly you dont have any cases do you get that alex said nothing obviously you dont im lucky to be in here myself i told the sheriff that there might be biological weapons in this house and that we needed to check it before they do the usual homicide investigation webb tylers going to have my ass if not my job whats back there she asked a safe kaiser nodded reluctantly whats in it were about to find out the man with the torch had finally got the door open he backed away for kaiser to examine the contents you havent been inside this safe before have you he asked alex no but not for want of trying what do you see stay back there alex i mean it youre jafo today just another fucking observer i cant observe anything from over here take a look at the notepad on the desk she did it was a miniature legal pad and scrawled on it in pencil was what looked like a mans handwritingmostly numbers what is this she asked it looks like gps coordinates i think they are and a time and date she read the numbers again jesus thats today yep two pm i think your lawyer friend was about to bug out of town where are these coordinates im not sure yet hank kelly thinks theyre on the gulf coast if not actually in the gulf of mexico hes a gps hobbyist plays those games where they track down planted clues on his off time of course what a world theres a name here you saw that looked like alejo padilla to me said kaiser still peering inside the safe me too sounds cuban uhhuh and this writing after that cpt it could mean captain you think rusk was headed south of the border alex asked i do by boat probably or maybe seaplane why would he flee the country in a boat if you need to take out contraband its the best way a large amount of cash say kaiser shifted on creaking knees and laid some papers out on the floor anything good alex asked would you call two costa rican passports good holy shit theyre not valid yet but they look legit costa rica she said thoughtfully we have an extradition treaty with them now yes but these passports arent in the rusks names but they have the rusks photos yep take a look she moved forward and leaned over his shoulder kaiser was right she took one of the passports and compared the smiling photo of andrew rusk to the bloody corpse in the chair to her left god he died bad she looked back at kaiser who was wading through the usual financial papers of any affluent family insurance policies wills deeds social security papers what else have you got looks like a boat to me kaiser said holding up a photograph alex looked at the fourbyfive snapshot thats not a boat thats a yacht you could sail around the world in that did rusk sail rusk did everything all the hobbies of the rich and shameless is this boat out at the local marina ive never seen it before he owns a powerboat but it usually sits on a trailer out behind this house kaiser looked up from the papers theres no powerboat out there now alex looked down at the legal pad where the coordinates had been scrawled what if he was planning to meet someone at sea power out past the twentyfourmile mark board that yacht and then take off for costa rica kaiser was staring at a sheet of paper in his hand he gave a long low whistle what is it she asked sensing his excitement this piece of paper grants safe passage through cuban territorial waters and ensures permission to dock at the marina in havana what and its signed by castro himself no way kaiser stood and held the document up to the light not fidel his brother raúl the defense minister and this document isnt made out in rusks name either its made out to eldon tarver md alex took the paper and read it line by line her pulse beating faster with every word this is a photocopy what it is kaiser said is inarguable proof that andrew rusk and eldon tarver were working together alex swallowed hard and handed the paper back to kaiser having finally discovered what she had worked so hard to find she felt oddly disconnected from herself then she realized why she had really been working to prove that bill fennell murdered her sister until she possessed evidence that proved that she could not save jamie from his father as grace had charged her to do why would raúl castro give tarver permission to emigrate to cuba she asked kaiser looked at her as though she were slow the virus cancer program viral bioweapons ill bet the cuban dgi made an overture to tarver at some point after the vcp was terminated offered him money to come work for them they approached a lot of scientists who were involved in sensitive research tarver must have figured cuba would be a good place to lie low for a while until it was safe to transfer to costa rica under a different name was he right excepting the fact that he couldnt foresee the timing of cuban political upheaval yes rusk sure placed a lot of trust in tarver mistakenly id say kaiser tilted his head toward rusks corpse what do you think happened here alex asked do you think tarver did this had to be him this is a torture scene he put them in the most central room in the house no windows multiple walls to deaden sound it must have been awful in here what killed the wife medical examiner says shock from a gunshot wound kaiser shook his head snakebite what isnt that something she was bitten twice once on the forearm and once on the chest just above the heart my god alex shuddered at the idea of what must have happened where she now stood an evidence tech bagged two scales off a bookshelf over there kaiser added reptilian for sure he said not fish scales whats the difference snake scales are the reptiles actual skin theyre dry and have their own color fish scales are attached to the skin theyre translucent and colorless did you know that alex asked impressed kaiser chuckled hell no what do you think tarver was after i mean he didnt touch the safe did he he might have he could have taken some things but left the rest but its well hidden behind a panel under those shelves he may not have known it was there alex gazed around the room you found that legal pad on the desk the one with the coordinates on it no that was found on top of the kitchen refrigerator underneath a serving tray also kelly found a hole out back in the garden looks like something had been dug up recently the hole was twenty inches deep in a heavily mulched area twelve inches by twenty inches rectangular cash she speculated kaiser looked skeptical burying cash is tricky business im guessing something more durable gold maybe or gems or something we cant even begin to guess at he nodded grave apprehension in his eyes they found a hole at tarvers house too last night really where under the floor of a shed attached to the house thin aluminum floor with a square cut out tarvers hole was twice as big as rusks freshly turned earth same as this one these guys were pulling up stakes sir said a tech who had been examining the study with a powerful light yes ive got something on the floor here looks like the victim tried to write something with his foot its here in the blood what is it the man leaned closer to the floor it looks likeas number twentythree the number sign i mean not the word number like the oakland as kaiser asked guess so was this guy from the bay area no said alex searching her memory no connection that i know of make sure you photograph it kaiser said he took alex by the arm and led her out of the study may i see lisas body she asked as they moved toward the front door theyre loading her out now nothing to be learned there i think she was just collateral damage its too bad she didnt make it to the hospital why didnt she just dial phone was dead somebody cut the wires outside with your agents watching the place kaiser nodded then paused before the front door this guy slipped right through six fbi agents theyre not wilderness masters or anything but theyre not stupid they have ears and eyes but tarver moved through them like a ghost in and out without a sound and he tortured two people in between and hes fiftynine years old alex observed this is a formidable suspect no doubt but now im thinking he may be getting help from professionals the cubans who knows alex this case just became a matter of national security if the cia finds out about that castro document theyll want to rip this case right out of our hands do you have to report it i should hell tyler will hand it to them on a silver platter alex cursed in frustration maybe you should kick this up to the new director roberts seemed like a decent guy to me maybe hes got some balls kaiser didnt look hopeful he took hold of alexs shoulders and looked deep into her eyes listen to me you have to stay out of this at least until we figure out how were going to handle it there is no wiggle room in what im saying do you get that she suppressed the glib retorts that flashed to the surface what about those gps coordinates what if thats a rendezvous tarver himself could be there for gods sake do you think tarver would have left them here if so you said the notepad was found hidden on top of the kitchen fridge right true the coordinates could be legit kaisers eyes pleaded with her ill speak to the director about you alex ill make clear to him that you were the one who first unearthed these connections but if i go to bat for you you have to stand clear while i do it if webb tyler finds out you were herelets dont even go there youre going back to the hospital he opened the door and ushered her out alex was the first to see associate deputy director mark dodson walking up the porch steps dodson glared at her then transferred the glare to kaiser agent kaiser what is this woman doing here i invited agent morse to the scene sir shes not agent morse any longer please take note of that fact in your discourse he warned me to stay away alex said quickly i disobeyed him and came of my own accord i felt i might have specialized knowledge that could help agent kaiser understand this scene a satisfied look crossed dodsons face ill bet you do what do you mean by that i mean i think you were here last night her mouth fell open are you crazy i was at do you deny ever being inside this house she wanted to deny it but the truth was she had been here before and with damn good reason triumph shone from dodsons eyes what are you doing here sir kaiser asked last night webb tyler informed me that you were taking unauthorized measures in his area of operations its a good thing he did since youre obviously getting the bureau deep into a case that belongs to the mississippi authorities what can you have been thinking agent kaiser sir i had reason to believe that this case involves deadly biological weapons and as such required immediate federal intervention this brought dodson up short biological weapons yes sir yesterday we discovered a clandestine primate lab owned by one noel d traver which is probably an alias of dr eldon tarver under the guise of a dogbreeding facility dr tarver appears to have been conducting sophisticated genetic experiments on primates and possibly even on human beings dodson suddenly looked less certain of his position im aware of yesterdays fire do you have proof that such experiments were conducted we have some escaped animals in captivity i was waiting for approval to proceed due to the complexity of the laboratory studies required dodson licked his lips ill give that further consideration but i want ms morse held at the local field office for questioning kaiser stiffened on what grounds sir the bureau received multiple complaints from mr rusk before his death that he was being persecuted by ms morse we know she blamed rusk for the death of her sister im going to have to establish beyond doubt that ms morse did not take the law into her own hands last night kaiser stepped toward dodson agent morse has a service record of losing control of her emotions during stress finished dodson dont overstep the mark agent kaiser you dont want to throw away your career trying to save hers thats a lost cause kaiser went pale sir i happen to know that the disposition of her case is not yet final and dodson held a piece of paper up to kaisers face this is an interview with one neville byrd of canton mississippi byrd was apprehended in a downtown hotel with both laser and optical surveillance equipment in his possession he had been surveilling the office of andrew rusk when asked who hired him byrd stated that one alexandra morse had hired him at double his normal rates alex gasped in disbelief kaiser turned and looked at her seeing the doubt and pain in his eyes she shook her head in denial kaiser looked around at the audience of field agents hungry for the denouement of this battle sir i want to state for the record that it was agent morse who first uncovered a connection between andrew rusk and eldon tarver six weeks ago she suspected criminal collusion between them and she proceeded to investigate them despite active resistance by the sac of the jackson field office and by yourself dodson laughed scornfully youve just defined insubordination you can testify against morse at her final hearing i dont think so kaiser said in a voice so commanding that a glimmer of fear came into dodsons face i dont think theres going to be any such hearing he held up a plastic evidence bag that hed been holding alongside his right leg id like you to examine this evidence sir a wary look from dodson what is it a document its selfexplanatory the add took the ziploc bag and tilted back his head so that he could read it through the bottom of his noline bifocals his skeptical expression didnt change until he reached the bottom of the document then his mouth opened like that of a fish gasping for air you noted the signature sir kaiser asked dodsons face had gone slack with horror the horror of a bureaucrat realizing he has backed the wrong horse where was this found he asked in a scarcely audible voice in the victims safe that document is absolute proof of criminal collusion between rusk and tarver and may well prove espionage against the united states not another word said dodson his eyes blinking agent kaiser join me in my car kaiser glanced at alex then followed dodson down to a dark ford in the driveway alex stood on the porch trying to contain her glee at seeing dodson taken down a peg and so publicly but what truly warmed her heart was the way kaiser had stood up for her and at great personal risk she looked down at the ford but its windows were too darkly tinted for her to see what was going on inside two minutes passed before kaiser and dodson got out dodsons face was red but kaiser looked cool and composed he motioned for alex to join him as she walked she caught encouraging looks from three different fbi agents two of them women when she passed dodson the deputy director didnt even acknowledge her kaiser took her hand and led her to the suburban he had driven up in what about my car she asked quietly drop your keys on the ground ill have one of my guys bring it what drop them alex dropped her keys on some pine straw and let herself be pushed into the backseat of the suburban she settled into the deep leather while kaiser climbed behind the wheel what happened in the car she asked nothings decided yet you are so goddamned lucky that piece of paper was in rusks safe and youre not thanks by the way kaiser sighed heavily then began to laugh you dont get many paybacks like that in this life did you tell dodson about the gps coordinates had to theres no holding back anything now its all going to be kicked upstairs to director roberts we only won a skirmish not the war it still felt good kaiser started the engine backed around then stopped and waited for a coroners wagon to come through the long line of law enforcement vehicles where are we going now alex asked youre going back to the hospital dont even think about arguing im putting out a statewide alert for rusks powerboat as soon as i can get a description of it then im going to see this neville byrd character the one who claims you hired him to watch rusk kaiser cut his eyes at her you didnt do that did you ive never even heard of the guy i swear to god kaiser nodded im hoping tarver hired him to make sure his partner wasnt crossing him you know absolutely as the coroners wagon rolled by something occurred to alex did you tell dodson about the writing on the floor as number twentythree kaiser said nothing alex suppressed her delight i thought you werent holding anything back anymore screw that precious little bastard amen a young fbi agent rapped on kaisers window kaiser rolled down the glass what is it they sent me to get you sir the ad i mean they found something in the garage what i dont know but theyre pretty freaked out kaiser put the suburban in park and got out stay here alex she slammed the dashboard with her hand as kaiser ran back to the house then she counted to five got out and sprinted after him chapter alex stood outside chriss room wiping her eyes with kleenex given to her by a nurse she had been trying for five minutes to summon the courage to walk in and tell chris that his wife was dead but for some reason she couldnt manage it the irony was unbelievable she had butted into chris shepards life because shed believed that his wife was trying to kill him now his wife lay on a table with a pathologist cutting a yincision into her chest when alex crept into andrew rusks garage behind john kaiser she hadnt had the slightest inkling that she would find a body there lethal biological agents maybe or bags of gold coinsanything but thora shepard the woman alex had always seen wearing only the finest clothes had been rolled in a paintstained drop cloth and folded into the rear compartment of an suv at least it was a porsche alex had thought at the time but the condition of thoras corpse banished even black humor from her mind thoras silky blond hair had been matted with what looked like pints of blooda blessing since it covered the shattered skull beneathand her onceflawless skin looked like the grayish white underbelly of a frog when kaiser saw alex behind him he lifted the matted hair and asked her to identify the body thoras eyes were open those beautiful seablue orbs that alex remembered from the photo in chriss house were the deadest things she had ever seendull cloudy marbles already shrinking into their sockets may i help you maam asked a passing nurse no thank you alex stuffed the kleenex into her pocket and walked into chriss room when she saw him shivering in the bed she told herself that this was the wrong time to tell him about thora what good could it possibly do it would surely harm his chances of winning his battle against an unknown illness dr clarke had warned her that chris might be suffering at the suggestion of peter connolly clarke had administered yet another antiviral drugthis one experimentaland chriss reaction had been yet another fever alex he whispered come closer i dont think im contagious she walked over to his bed took his shaking hands in hers and kissed him on the cheek i know he responded with a weak smile sympathy kiss maybe he jerked his hands away and hugged himself during a particularly violent bout of shivering sorry you dont have to talk now he gritted his teeth then gave his hands back to her she wanted to distract him but she didnt know how so ben is at dr cages house yeah toms wife is great but bens really scared i wish i was in good enough shape to have him here what about the chemotherapy option you still havent taken any chemo drugs no after what ive learned about the virus cancer programand tarvers primate labim more convinced than ever that he injected me with some sort of retrovirus no virus can induce cancer in a matter of days so the way to attack it right now is with antiviral drugs chris struggled to shift on the bed i dont want to risk getting leukemia or lymphoma by taking melphalan or something else just as dangerous alex squeezed his hands i think you just dont want to lose your hair he closed his eyes but the ghost of a smile touched his lips are we friends chris she asked softly his eyes opened questioning her without words of course we are i owe you my life if i live through this that is ive got to tell you something else about thora oh god he said wearily what has she done sudden fear flashed in his eyes she hasnt taken ben has she alex shook her head no and she never will again thoras dead chris he stared up from the pillow without changing expression his eyes seemed the same but she knew that inside the tenuous hold that he had on reality was tearing loose after studying her face for a few moments he saw that she had spoken the truth how he whispered somebody killed her were not sure who yet probably rusk or tarver chris blinked once killed her how she was beaten to death with a blunt instrument probably a claw hammer alex saw despair in his eyes and then he rolled over to face the wall i didnt want to tell you she said helplessly but the idea of someone else telling you was worse the back of his head was shaking as though in denial of the news but she knew he had believed her wheres thora now he asked theyre doing a postmortem on her she heard a sharp exhalation chris knew too well what that meant in medical terms ben doesnt know does he no no could he hear it on tv or anything like that no i need to see him alex had already taken care of this hes on his way she glanced at her watch he should be here any minute actually i called tom cage as soon as weas soon as i knew tom went to check ben out of school and he promised to have him here as fast as possible chris sighed heavily thank you for doing that tom deals with death every day hell know how to handle ben will you look at me chris after nearly a minute he rolled over and looked at her with redrimmed eyes she was about to speak when he said help me up what you shouldnt come on pulling against her hands he managed to bring himself into a sitting position he was still shivering and panting but his eyes held only determination you can go now im fine right here chriss eyes narrowed fine why arent you out trying to find tarver they wont let me theyve turned me into a goddamn bystander so you never waited for permission before and the only way youre going to save jamieor meis by nailing tarver only he can convict your brotherinlaw now and only he can tell the doctors what he shot into me without that knowledge it wont matter that i have ben ill die before he grows out of little league alex was stunned by the anger in chriss voice and eyes she was trying to think of some reassuring reply when her cell phone vibrated in her pocket it was kaiser she pressed send and held the phone to her ear tell me something good john solve this puzzle and ill give you the best news you ever had what are you talking about im sitting with your alleged friend neville byrd hes recanted his statements about you and admitted that he was hired by eldon tarver alex closed her eyes in relief how did you manage that while kaiser answered alex clicked her cell phones speaker function so that chris could listen in when mr byrd and his attorney heard the words patriot act they became very talkative kaiser said but tarver didnt hire byrd just to keep tabs on rusk rusk had set up a digital mechanism that would destroy tarver in the event that tarver killed him insurance right byrd was hired to find out what that mechanism was did he asked alex yes rusk used a dutch internet service called ex nihilo every day he had to log on and enter a series of passwords to verify that he was alive if he didnt a digital catalog of every crime rusk and tarver had committed would be sent to the bureau and the mississippi state police dear god tell me you have that file john im looking at it right now but i cant open it why not i dont have the final password rusk never accessed the file while byrd was watching him neville stole enough passwords for tarver to log in and pretend he was rusk but not to open or delete the confession file nevilles been trying to hack the password since last night but he hasnt been able to do it chris was staring at the cell phone with laserlike focus do you have any idea what it could be alex asked what im thinking said kaiser is that after dr tarver smacked rusk in the head a few times with that putter rusks last conscious thought was to get revenge on the bastard if he could he couldnt use the telephone but he could move his foot enough to write in the blood on the floor as number twentythree alex cried exactly but neville and i have googled our way through all the baseball rosters of the oakland as for the past hundred and six years weve tried every player we can find who wore number twentythree but no combination of any of their names or birthdays or batting averages or anything else is the password alex thought furiously youre making an assumption that as refers to the baseball team throw that out and start from zero as numberwhat else could it mean the only hits that search engines kick up are baseballrelated i just put in a call to the nsa in washington theyve put it in the queue for a supercomputer it cant be that hard said alex its something rusk thought we could figure out what were his other passwords one was pi to the ninth decimal place pi alex echoed a couple were names from classical literature one was the speed of light in a strangely detached voice chris said how did he write miles per second squared whos that talking asked kaiser chris alex replied can you answer his question hang on alex looked down chris had taken hold of her elbow the only as number i know about is avogadros number he said whats that a constant in chemistry it has to do with molar concentration every high school chemistry student has to memorize it what was that asked kaiser chris has got a password for you to try hold on she looked at chris whats the number exactly sixpointohtwotwo times ten to the twentythird power the twentythird power alex echoed chris nodded thats the twentythree as number twentythree how would you type all that out asked kaiser chris looked up at the ceiling six period zero two two x one zero two three i heard him said kaiser nevilles typing it in alexs ears roared as she waited no dice said kaiser obviously deflated thats not it alex closed her eyes try leaving out the decimal said chris all right said kaiser byrds trying it alex winced as a scream of triumph came through the phone thats it shouted kaiser were in alex was squeezing the phone so tightly that her hand hurt what does it say whats in the file john hang on my godits a confession all right theres pages and pages of it alex caught chriss hand in hers do you see graces name tell me you see graces name im lookingi see several of the victims you listed for me alexs whole body was shaking chriss jaw muscles were working steadily i see it kaiser murmured grace fennell im reading it right off the page alex felt tears streaming down her cheeks the lump in her throat kept her from speaking until she managed to swallow copy that file now john neville already copied it he assured her hes printing it out right now what about thora chris asked or anything about me its probably the last entry in the file alex said no the last entry is a guy named barnett an oilman rusk thinks barnett is going to approach him any day about getting a divorce keep looking i am waithere it is christopher shepard md its all here alex all the proof in the world chris was holding his fist over his mouth as though he might lose control of himself ive never seen anything like this kaiser said in a fascinated voice i mean ive discovered the trophies of serial murderersmonsters aberrationsbut this is just business naked fucking greed by people who knew better alex saw tears in chriss eyes listen to this said kaiser in november of i was approached by a law school classmate named michael collins a criminal lawyer who works for gage taft and leblanc collins wanted my advice about a client a physician named eldon tarver dr tarvers wife had recently died of cancer but his wifes family believed she was the victim of foul play they were a wealthy family and tarver feared they had gotten the police involved hed hired collins because he believed he was in danger of being arrested i was puzzled that collins would seek out my help because i specialize in divorce but michael told me that he needed my psychological insight not legal expertise over the course of two interviews with dr tarver i realized the nature of michaels problem his client was guilty tarver didnt come right out and state this fact but it was plain to me i had never encountered such arrogant selfassurance in my life not even from my father and thats saying a lot in the end no charges were brought against dr tarver mainly because no forensic evidence of murder could be produced despite two separate autopsies one by a renowned pathologist in fact the second autopsy was what convinced the police that no murder had in fact occurred but i knew different do you want me to go on kaiser asked alex looked at chris whose eyes were closed do you want me to turn off the speaker no go ahead john i had no further contact with dr tarver until almost two years later when i encountered him during a weekend hunting trip at the chickamauga hunting camp during that weekend i found myself alone with him for an extended period he asked several forward questions about my divorce practice questions that i took to be a strange sort of overture strangely sure that i could trust tarver i decided to step out on a limb i remarked that after years of experience in my field i had come to believe that in certain cases involving wealthy clients a timely death would be a preferable alternative to divorce dr tarvers response was instantaneous i think you mean an untimely death dont you that was the beginning of our partnership under the influence of a moderate amount of alcohol dr tarver assured me that he could kill anyone without leaving a forensic trace he looked on this he said as a sort of professional challenge and claimed that every pathologist had at some point in his life had thoughts along those lines it was only natural he said before we left chickamauga that weekend the basics of our plan had been worked out i had wealthy clients coming to my office every week begging me to spare them a huge settlement and get them more time with their children i could judge which clients had sufficient hatred and anger to consider actually eliminating their spouses dr tarver and i would have as little contact as possible after securing a goorder from a client i would initiate contact by sending a false spam message to one of his email accounts the next day i would park my car at the annandale golf club and play eighteen holes of golf there would be a large packet in my trunk when i arrived when i left the packet would be gone that packet contained everything about the intended victim and all of it supplied by the victims spouse medical history daily schedule car keys house keys vacation plans security codes email passwords everything that was the only contact tarver and i ever had and even that involved no facetoface interaction it could never be proved or traced because dr tarver wasnt a member of that club he had a friend who played golf there almost every day and tarver could go as a guest whenever he chose he opened the trunk with a key i gave him that first weekend at chickamauga i have only spoken to dr tarver a few times in the past five years and those times by pure happenstance but together he and i have murdered nineteen people nineteen alex breathed i knew there were more wait said kaiser his voice quickening while i was reading that kelly handed me a note a deputy sheriff in forrest county just spotted andrew rusks powerboat its being towed on a trailer behind a black dodge pickup truck on highway chris looked at the cell phone with something like hatred did he see the driver alex asked a bald man with a gray beard and a bright birthmark on his left cheek alexs heart began to race jesus god weve got him no we dont we know where he was fifteen minutes ago the deputys not trying to stop him is he no forrest countys on the way to the gulf coast right could be thats near hattiesburg its the back way to the coast did you ever get an exact location on those gps coordinates yes said kaiser that location is in the gulf of mexico twentyfour miles south of petit bois island past the reach of the coast guard alex looked at her watch two pm is less than two hours away dont worry youre going to be there alex caught her breath seriously you and me babe she felt as though a steel band had been cut free from her chest ive got a chopper on standby kaiser said panting as though he were running you get upstairs to the umc helipad well take six swat guys from jackson and link up with some of my guys from the new orleans office im hanging up now dont you dare leave me behind john i dont care if the director forbids you pain of termination you set that chopper down on the umc roof ill be there in ten minutes you be waiting go she said and hung up chris was watching her his body completely still i need to go with him chris i dont want to leave you alone but im all right i have three soft knocks sounded in the room then the door opened a crack and a voice alex didnt recognize said hello chris shepard yes she called walking to the door it opened before she reached it revealing a handsome man in his early forties with two children standing in front of him a boy and a girl im penn cage said the man extending his hand tom cages son are you alex morse she nodded and shook the hand my father was having some angina this morning penn said so i thought annie and i should drive ben up to see his dad i hope thats all right only then did alex realize that the boy standing before her in the school uniform was ben shepard oh yes i really appreciate it she backed out of the way so that chris could see his visitors penn chris said from the bed what cage walked forward and gently shook chriss hand i thought ben might like to ride up with annie and me alex saw chris wipe his eyes before the children got close enough to see his tears annie cage was a wellknit girl of about eleven with tawny hair and wise eyes she took bens hand to lead him to his fathers bed and to alexs surprise ben allowed it hey buddy chris said weakly bens face was red he was about to cry are you sick dad just a little but im going to be fine in a couple of days how are you doing ben nodded the mayor brought me to see you i see that hello annie hi dr chris annie cage replied penn smiled then touched annies shoulder and pulled her back toward him i think were going to let you two visit for a while chris looked up gratefully do you need anything penn asked a coke or something no thanks well see you in a while then with a pointed look at alex penn backed into the hall with annie in tow chris put his hand on bens shoulder then looked up at alex and said go get him and dont come back here until you have okay forcing down a rush of emotion alex nodded then waved goodbye and walked into the hall penn cage was waiting for her looking down the corridor she saw his daughter sitting on a bench by the nurses station how bad is he penn asked he could die penn blew air from his cheeks is there anything i can do to help you im not just saying that i used to be a prosecutor in houston and i have a lot of contacts in federal law enforcement alex suddenly realized that penn cage was the lawyer who had destroyed a former director of the fbi by implicating him in a civil rights murder coverup that dated to the s i wish youd made that offer a week ago cages eyes burned with surprising intensity im making it now you tell me what dr shepard needs ill do everything in my power to get it or make it happen alex glanced at her watch her mind on kaisers chopper do you know chris well not as well as id like but my father says hes as fine a man as hes ever worked with thats saying something i think so too alex said surprising herself dont let me keep you just remember what i said i will alex turned and ran toward the elevators ten steps down the hall she passed her mothers door margaret morse would never know whether her daughter had stopped and alex almost kept running but halfway to the elevators she slid to a stop then ran back and darted into her mothers room as she had done with chris she squeezed her mothers hand and bent low beside her face mom she whispered its alexandra jamies going to be all right you can go now she prayed for a sign a blinking eye or moving fingerbut there was nothing she kissed her mothers cheek then fled the room chapter the helicopter that touched down on the roof of the university medical center was a sleek white bell capable of carrying eight passengers plus crew at knots for nearly four hours alex had flown into many hostage situations but rarely in a chopper as powerful as this a would deliver them to the gulf of mexico with time to spare she bent almost double as she ran beneath the whirling rotors the familiar whupwhupwhup set her heart racing she leapt through the open door took a quick look at the six blackclad swat agents behind kaiser then strapped herself in beside him ready kaiser shouted she gave him a thumbsup kaiser smiled as the whine of the engine rose these things always remind me of vietnam is that good or bad good question he squeezed her shoulder in reassurance the trick now is taking tarver alive alex nodded thats where you come in thats how i sold the director on you being here so im a hostage negotiator again in a manner of speaking youre going to negotiate only there wont be any hostages or so we hope anyway amen im going up front for a second i need to speak to the pilot before we lift off kaiser went forward and leaned down beside the pilots helmet alex looked out at the sky gray overhead and piled with black clouds to the east feeling a vibration against her thigh she took out her cell phone and looked at the lcd window it read new message when she opened the phone she saw that the message was from jamie finally she hit read the message read dads packing our stuff says were moving day heard him talking her about mexico can he take me mexico he seems scared im scared can u come get me on computer dad wont let me call u alex slammed the phone against her leg bills timing was perfect as usual she wanted to tell kaiser to order the chopper to the ross barnett reservoir to pick up jamie but of course she couldnt andrew rusks written confession would soon nail bill fennells hide to the wall but right this minute bill had legal custody of the boy alex had thought this chopper was taking her to the man whod murdered grace but now she realized that eldon tarver hadnt really murdered her sister he was just the weapon bill fennell was the real killer and now like tarver bill was planning to flee the countrywith jamie in tow that left alex no choice about what to do but she couldnt tell kaiser why she had to get out of the helicopter she might just have to commit a felony herself in the next half houra kidnapping and kaiser couldnt be party to that she lifted the cell phone to her ear and began simulating a conversation with one of her mothers nurses what she yelled i cant hear you kaiser turned and watched her from the cockpit when she shouted what does that meanher kidneys now or the in the next couple of hoursjesus all right im on my way probably ten minutes kaiser walked back and knelt beside her what is it my mothers crashing all systems she signed a dnr so shes probably going to die in the next few minutes do you believe this shit kaiser looked at his watch then the metal deck then back up at alex its your call we cant wait for you if you go back down is she conscious in and out mostly out but stillits my mother you know i know he looked at his watch again silently calculating i wish you could be there you know its going to come down to a standoff and you could be the one holding the bullhorn dont make it worse okay she forced a smile i appreciate you getting me the chance just go nailing tarver is the thing alex unstrapped her harness and climbed back down to the roof kaiser knelt in the big sliding door watching her with compassion under the roaring blades he shouted im sorry about your mom alex waved and sprinted toward the breezeway at the edge of the helipad the lifted into the darkening sky before she reached the door then swooped off in a wide arc to the south she took out her cell phone and dialed will kilmer the fbi helicopter was thirty miles south of jackson when the doubt gnawing in kaisers gut became intolerable he took out his cell phone dialed directory assistance and got the number for the university medical center when umcs switchboard operator came on the line he identified himself as an fbi agent in an emergency and demanded to speak to the chief nurse on the oncology floor while he waited one of the agents behind him moved forward and said whats going on john something new kaiser shook his head i dont buy morses story about her mother why not no way would that girl miss a chance to take down the guy who killed her sister i dont care if her mother is dying morse almost ruined her career over this and theres no way shed miss the final act hello said an irritated female voice who is this special agent john kaiser of the fbi we have a lifeordeath emergency in progress and it involves the daughter of one of your patients margaret morse her daughter is special agent alex morse iher could you speak up please im in a helicopter i know her i read you loud and clear now is she in the hospital now alex morse i mean i havent seen her since she ran out twenty minutes ago i see can you tell me about her mother has her condition suddenly worsened i dont think it could get much worse what i mean is has she crashed have you called agent morse in the last few minutes and told her that her mother was dying oh i dont think so not that im aware of let me check kaiser looked at his pilot pointed at the airspeed indicator and signaled that they should slow down after nearly a minute the nurse came back on the line no sir no call like that went out from here in fact mrs morses kidneys seemed to be a little better this morning putting out more urine kaiser hung up leaned over the pilots helmet and spun his forefinger in a circle turn around as the banked over i kaiser dialed the jackson field office and demanded to speak to a technical specialist yes sir said an even younger voice than hed expected i need gps coordinates on a cell phone as fast as you can get them call the cell company and tell them lives depend on it kaiser read off alexs cell number then said i think its a cingular phone call me back the instant you have the coordinates will do sir as soon as he hung up the pilot leaned over and said where are we going where the hell was alex going kaiser wondered did she not believe that the man towing rusks boat toward the gulf coast was tarver could someone have called and told her that he didnt think so chris shepard certainly had no way of knowing that was will kilmer still working the case could the old excop have discovered something at the last minute possibly but then again alexs reason for bailing might be something completely unrelated to tarversomething that overrode her concern for the murder case what could possibly be that important hover he said to the pilot keep us where we are as the slowed to a hover kaiser sensed that desperation was blocking efficient thought hed seen the phenomenon many times people in emergencies couldnt make the simplest logical connections no one was immune not combat veterans not astronauts nothis phone was ringing hello hello ive got the coordinates sir that phone is at thirtytwo degrees twentyfive minutes and someodd north and ninety degrees four minutes just tell me where they are son lay a map over those numbers we already did its coachmans road near the jackson yacht club right on the edge of the reservoir the ross barnett reservoir yes sir would roses bluff drive be near there yes sir right there and whoever has that phone is even closer to there now damn it thats her brotherinlaws house sir the pilot looked over at kaiser his eyes questioning behind his faceplate her nephew kaiser thought angrily is this some kind of custody crap jamie fennell was the reason alex had worked this case so hard and so recklessly butwhat if it was something else what if the kid meant something to tarver too was that possible could bill fennell somehow be helping tarver to escape not if the pathologist was driving down to the gulf he couldnt but what if he wasnt what if someone else was driving that truck chapter bill fennell lived on the southwestern bank of the ross barnett reservoir fifty square miles of water that could kick up oceansized whitecaps in a storm like the one that was on its way despite their proximity to the jackson yacht club most houses here were older than the mcmansions on the eastern shore bill had solved that problem by buying four contiguous lots just north of the yacht club then tearing down the houses on them and building his vision of nouveau riche paradise alex and will were less than five minutes away from the result roaring along coachmans road in the blue nissan titan will had substituted for his explorer which was recovering from the explosion at the primate lab wills magnum lay on the seat between them and a gauge shotgun was lying on the backseat alexs borrowed sig was in the glove box and she had a smith amp wesson strapped to her left ankle you get any more text messages will asked no i just hope they havent left yet theyve got to come out this way right not necessarily theres half a dozen ways out of that old neighborhood great the turbulent waters of the reservoir came into sight will turned south heading along the spit of land that held the yacht club and the fennell home how do you want to play it he asked were going to ask nicely for ben said alex then were going to take him out of there bill should be arrested for murder before the day is out bill can be a cranky son of a bitch will said he almost went to jail for beating up a guy on the side of the road one time road rage i didnt know that alex let her left hand fall on the magnum but id say were prepared to deal with that she pointed to a tall wroughtiron gate fifty meters ahead slow down will pulled up to the gate and stopped chained shut alex said pointing at a heavy padlock will got out climbed into the bed of his truck opened the shining toolbox and removed a long pair of bolt cutters he cut the chain easily then tossed the cutters into the truck bed and climbed back behind the wheel youre handy to have around said alex will looked hard into her eyes before we go in let me ask you one thing whats the chance that were walking into some kind of trap she had tried not to focus on this possibility but rather to prepare herself for whatever might happen but now will had given voice to her fear thats why youre here she said softly if i knew for sure it was just bill i wouldnt need anybody to help me deal with him will sighed like an old man in need of a nap thats what i figured i can go without you alex said meaning it you can wait right here the detective cocked his head and looked over at her his watery eyes like those of an old hound dog honey your daddy pulled me out of so many tight spots i couldnt begin to count em im here now because he cant be and im gonna do exactly what i know hed do will put the truck into gear and rolled forward lets go get that boy he drove through the gate and around the long sweeping drive that led to the rear of the fennell mansion an oversize copy of a louisiana plantation house with tall white columns and a wraparound porch he stopped when they were still a hundred meters away and parked behind a thick stand of trees this is far enough he said as he switched off the engine the rain that had been threatening for hours finally swept over the property like advancing waves of grayclad soldiers the first drops hit the truck like shots from a pellet gun and then the aggregate blotted out the mansion through the gaps in the trees alex could just make out the leaden surface of the reservoir she opened the glove box and took out the sigsauer will had given her two days ago then got out and walked up to an oak tree will carried the shotgun loosely along his left leg his pistol gripped in his right hand when he drew up beside her they turned together and surveyed the house and grounds while the rain soaked their clothes the mansion had been built facing the reservoir hundreds of trees and shrubs dotted the twelveacre lot with gardens and ponds placed throughout in the english style the landscaping alone had cost more than the houses around it to their left stood a tennis court to their right an infinity pool with a serpentine slide for ben in front of the house alex knew a broad pier ran far out over the reservoir a boathouse stood at the end of it and it held twice the boat that andrew rusk owned a carrera bowrider she remembered with twin outboards that could push it to ninety knots which was almost flying me and jim did this many a time will said thousands of times i bet if you count domestic calls alexs abraded elbows stung as though the rain were acid thats bills hummer she said pointing to a splash of yellow sticking out of the distant garage hes got a pair of them hs i know said will i used to see them when hed drop off jamie to go fishing with jim i forgot you used to go with them sometimes will nodded then started marching across the open ground jamies a good boy never liked his daddy much though loudmouthed prick you ask me you know what i think said alex following closely as the house grew larger a low growl crossed the space between them it was wills voice she realized speaking in an entirely different register if bill tries to stop us taking jamie out of there he said you go outside and wait for me uncle will you hush girl the detective turned toward her as he walked his eyes flat and hard none of that hostagenegotiator bullshit you get out of there and let me do what needs to be done alex had never heard will speak this way he was talking to her across a generation but she understood will kilmer had worked homicide for two decades and he knew that a murder trial was a notoriously unreliable business especially if the defendant could afford top criminal lawyers but if bill fennell perished in the confusion of a domestic disturbance there would be no custody battle over jamie it was an inhuman train of thought she knewor was it essentially human either way will had a point all that mattered now was jamie they moved like shadows through the rain will walked faster breathing hard but showing no sign of slowing when the house was twenty meters away they halted behind some tall evergreen shrubs up the porch steps alex asked will shook his head circle the house and try to get a look inside split up normally id say yes today no when we reach the right corner of the house well climb onto the porch so we can see through the windows they moved out from behind the shrubs and started toward the right side of the house will pushed through the thick hedge below the porch then climbed over the rail at the corner and waited for alex he moved with surprising grace she noted clambering over behind him through the first window they saw only an empty room they moved lightly along the wall to the next window again she saw no people put your hands in the air said a commanding voice from behind them im pointing a sawedoff twelvegauge shotgun at your backs utter blackness descended in alexs soul keep facing the wall but toss your weapons back over the rail all of them where did he come from will whispered from her left the hedge she realized he was waiting behind the hedge will halfturned and in a tough voice said listen to me bill fennell youre already in a bucketful of shit you dont want to thats not bill alex told him will looked over his shoulder then closed his eyes and shook his head alex had to admire dr tarvers strategy he had sent the message from jamie then waited behind the porch hedge to assess the response simple but brilliant since it would have prevented him from being trapped in the house had an army of swat agents descended on it but no such army was coming the question was why was tarver here at all dont try to play hero partner said the doctor chivalry is expensive and youre past the age for it tarver took a step to his right i have a picture of you in my cell phone pop youre sleeping soundly after a few beers will muttered something unintelligible and you agent alex you remember what it feels like to be hit with buckshot dont you the right side of her face tingled she could feel will tensing beside her like a cat preparing to spring she closed her eyes and tried to reach him by force of will dont try ityou cant beat a bullet not even buckshot get those guns over the rail tarver snapped again now wheres jamie alex asked tossing the sig over her shoulder youll see dear lord let him be alive i love you baby girl said the faintest whisper beside her baby girl that was what will had called his daughter before she died in the in the same motion that will tossed his shotgun over his shoulder he whirled away from alex with all the speed that a seventyyearold man could muster he fired his pistol as he spun trying to disorient tarver as much as possible while he bought alex one chance her hand was almost to the in her ankle holster when the artillerylike boom of the shotgun blotted out the reports of wills pistol the sound hurled her back to the federal reserve bank when a desperate man had shattered her closest friend and half her face in a matter of seconds when she came up with her the smoking mouth of dr tarvers shotgun was only two feet from her eyes it would be a shame to ruin the other half he said moving only her eyes alex glanced down to her right will lay on his stomach a dark pool spreading beneath him several ragged exit wounds revealed splintered white bone from his scapula one hole was almost directly over his spine aaahhhhh alex moaned her eyes stinging you son of a bitch he chose his fate dr tarver said a brave man he died like my daddy did said the voice of the little girl inside her what asked tarver snatching the from her hand had she spoken aloud into the house tarver ordered go alex started to step over will but tarver shook his head and pointed to the front of the housethe reservoir side as she walked she stared along the pier wondering if the carrera was in the boathouse bill often left the key out there if she could get jamie out of the housethen get him to the boathouse the front section of the wraparound porch was screened she opened the door to the protected area walked in then stopped before the stained cypress door that led to the main house what nightmare lay on the other side of it go in dr tarver said she turned the knob and pushed open the door bill fennell lay sprawled at the foot of the main staircase his long legs were bent at odd angles and his mouth appeared to be frozen open as alex swept her eyes across the room frantically searching for jamie the shotgun barrel prodded her between the shoulder blades driving her forward why did you kill him hes not dead said dr tarver i sedated him true or false wheres jamie tarver pointed the shotgun across the room to a hall that led to the rear of the house that way a paralyzing numbness made itself known in her lower trunk it was spreading upward fast she looked back at the doctor are you taking me to jamie a chiding smile in the gray beard youre not here for a reunion her palms tingled open the laundry room she braced herself for unendurable horror then opened the slatted door jamie was perched atop the washing machine staring down at two black coils on the floor it took alex a moment to absorb the reality the snakes were thick and short with big triangular heads and pointed snouts water moccasins aunt alex jamie cried his eyes flashing you came she forced herself to grin as though everything were fine now i sure did buddy she turned back to dr tarver and hissed you sadist tarver chuckled the boys fine see those cases hed gestured at two large waterproof cases on the safe side of the snakes pelicans alex thought the kind of cases engineers used to haul expensive gear around the world the larger case was bright yellow the other white i want you to carry them to the front of the house tarver said move it ill be back jamie she promised jamie nodded with complete faith but his eyes quickly returned to the snakes on the floor the cases were almost too heavy for alex to lift as she backed out with them she saw dr tarver pick up a white croker sack with a drawstring and open it wide maybe he was going to bag the damned snakes for a while realizing that tarver had not followed her to the front room she dropped the cases and rushed to bills gun cabinet behind those doors lay a wealth of firearms but they were locked tight she was trying to break them open when tarver walked back into the room dragging jamie by one arm jamie screamed blue murder as he came in the furious highpitched voice of a tenyearold boy my aunt alex is going to blow your goddamn head off you big ape tarver smacked the boy on the side of his head dropping him to the floor jamies screaming ceased wheres the shotgun alex wondered tarver walked over to a bookshelf reached up to a high one and brought down an automatic pistol that alex recognized as a beretta from bills collection then he drew alexs borrowed sigsauer from the small of his back why are you doing this she asked why didnt you just take off when you had the chance tarver gave her a tight smile im entering a new life today vanishing into another identity and i would gladly have let you live to old age but im afraid you have a clue to the road im taking to my new life you may not know you have it but you do and if i let you live youll eventually remember with the most casual of motions dr tarver half turned and shot bill fennell in the head with alexs sig she jumped back in shock but she had no time to worry about bill jamie was stirring on the floor if he raised his head he would see his fathers ruined face she lunged across the space between them and covered jamie with her body perfect said tarver hows this sound you couldnt live another minute with the idea that your nephew was under the power of your brotherinlaw you came to rescue him fennell resisted so you shot him sadly the boy was killed in the crossfire i think the bureau will want the investigation closed as quickly as possible please alex said to the emotionless face kill me just let him live tarver shook his head he cant survive to tell your friends at the bureau that he had two strangers as overnight guests last night she blinked in bewilderment two my brother judah alex pondered this is that whos driving the truck with the boat tarver smiled a little makeup can do wonders goodbye alexandra you led a merry chase he switched the beretta to his right hand then stepped back moving the gun left and right as though selecting a target appropriate to the intended fiction an almost irresistible rush of instinct told alex to lift jamie as best she could and run she knew she would accomplish nothing but wasnt it better to die trying the beretta stabilized as tarver settled on his final target at least jamie was unconscious for the end forcing her arms under him she struggled to lift his sagging weight no shot came why hasnt he fired she wondered dr tarver had cocked his head as though straining to hear something above the sound of the storm outside alex found herself listening too first in vain but thenthe relentless slapping of rotor blades separated from the rain and she knew that john kaisers glorious bell was dropping down over the house like the air cav descending on a besieged hamlet in vietnam your plan wont work now doctor she said summoning the calm equanimity of a hostage negotiator who has nothing personal at stake in a confrontation youll never sell that story now no matter what you do your being here screws it all up tarver stepped forward and laid the pistol barrel against her forehead clearly he was not convinced if he shot her now alex realized then somehow slipped away in the storm his tale of domestic tragedy might still play at fbi headquarters but time was his enemy time and the men gathering outside the beretta slammed into her face with blinding force she collapsed onto jamie pounding footsteps receded then returned dr tarver jerked her to her feet as her vision returned she saw he was carrying a coil of rope and a roll of duct tape his backpack lay at his feet thats fbi swat out there alex said you dont have a prayer of getting away tarver cut a length of rope bound jamies legs together then tied him to the heavy leg of the nearby sofa tell me whos in charge im the negotiator you talk to me he hit her again this time on the bridge of the nose a river of blood gushed over her lips and chin coughing blood she dug her cell phone from her pocket and handed it over speed dial four john kaiser dr tarver ripped off some duct tape and bound her wrists as though he did this every day then he put her phone in his pocket and pulled his own cell out of the other he pressed one button and waited alex knelt and hugged jamie as best she could the slap of beating rotors had diminished but she could still hear them from the rear of the house had kaiser landed between the tennis courts and the infinity pool she prayed that the swat agents were already dispersing across the grounds edward tarver said into the phone how close are youten minutes or less stay at altitude until i give you the final position right altitude alex thought does tarver have an aircraft nearby now the doctor took out alexs cell phone opened the clamshell and pressed a button is this agent kaisergood these are my demands i want an fbi suburban with its windows spraypainted black driven to the rear door of this house and left there thats the side where your helicopter is i want a cessna citation fully fueled and waiting at the madison county airport with one pilot and its engines running an fbi pilot is acceptable dont attempt to block the driveway when we leave dont ask to exchange fbi agents for my hostages the suburban should be here in twenty minutes or lessstop talking agent kaiser you have nothing to tell me no im not going to make any threats listen very closely and youll see why when the back door opens do not fire the fennell boy will be in front of me remember twenty minutes for the suburban tarver hung up the phone and shoved it deep in his pocket then he picked up bill fennells shotgun from behind the sofa and fired it into the floor jamie cringed into alexs chest when the weapon roared tarver took hold of bills corpse by the ankles and dragged it toward the back of the house alex crawled to the sofa shoved her bound hands under it and lifted with all her strength she heard the back door open then a massive grunt which told her that tarver was trying to lift bill fennells corpse a nearly impossible feat with dead weight yank the rope loose she told jamie hurry she heard another grunt this one like the sound of a shotputter making a heroic heave and then the back door slammed jamie had almost gotten the rope loose from the sofa leg when tarver marched back into the room alex shook her head and jamie lay back down you see why i dont make threats tarver said into her cell phone the boys next kaiser you have nineteen minutes alex saw that hed brought a bedsheet from the laundry room one of graces fivehundredthreadcount egyptians tarver shook it open then took a pair of scissors from his back pocket and cut two holes like ghosts eyes near the center of the creamcolored sheet what are you doing jamie asked from the floor making a halloween costume tarver laughed thats right boy and its going to scare the hell out of some people he bent and cut the rope that bound jamie to the sofa leg then cut a longer piece and tied jamie to his own body by tying them both around their waists he left less than three feet of slack between them please dont do this doctor alex begged send jamie outside ill go with you anywhere you want to go ill shield you all the way out she might as well have been talking to a statue put on my backpack tarver said to alex pointing at the blue kelty on the floor thats where the snakes are jamie said quietly theres more than snakes in there tarver said cutting the duct tape from alexs wrists she hesitated making sure the pack was fastened shut then carefully shouldered it the pack was heavy but to her relief she felt no movement inside get ready to carry those cases tarver said his eyes on the front door both of them alex suddenly realized that tarver had made his demands only to put kaiser and his men at the maximum tactical disadvantage at this moment they would be setting up interlocking fields of fire to cover the few feet of porch space between the back door and the spot where the fbi suburban would pull up in fifteen minutes they were rehearsing for a scene that would never be played and they were doing it on the wrong side of the house dr tarver picked up jamie as easily as he would a sack of groceries then pulled the kingsize bedsheet over both of them alex could no longer tell where dr tarver stopped and jamie began were going to the boathouse tarver said in a slightly muffled voice listen to me alex if you drop those cases ill shoot him in the head tell her where the gun is jamie alex saw a jerk under the sheet under my chin answered the small voice you walk ahead of us all the way if you jump off the pier ill shoot him i know theres damn little chance of you abandoning him but people do crazy things under stress remember your grayhaired friend on the porch alex would never forget him she picked up the heavy cases as dr tarver reached for the doorknob alexs cell phone rang beneath the sheet she saw movement then tarver said i assume youre calling to tell me that everything i asked for is being done so you dont need to talk im watching the clock goodbye he opened the door and gestured for alex to exit first straight to the boathouse if you slow down jamies gone alex set off across the grass marching into the teeth of the rain she tried to make out swat agents among the shrubs and trees but she saw none she started to look back but dr tarver shouted faster she was almost jogging now kaiser had to be panicking eldon tarver had turned the tactical situation inside out reinforcements could not have arrived yet so kaiser was limited to the agents hed brought in the chopper hed probably posted one or two on this side of the house no more right now they would be describing the strange parade a baggageladen woman leading a ghost toward the lake she was on the pier now the impact of her feet echoed up from the whitecaps beneath the wood despite the hissing patter of the rain barring a mistake by a nervous sniper they would all reach the boathouse alive dr tarver had already proved that he would kill without hesitation and even if kaiser believed one of his men had a decent shot he wouldnt give the fire order from his point of view dr tarver had nowhere to run fifty square miles of water might seem like a lot of running room to a man with a speedboat but when you had a bell full of swat agents at your command it was nothing move your ass tarver shouted from behind her alex heard her cell phone ringing faintly as she ran but dr tarver didnt answer one of his earlier phrases replayed constantly in her mind stay at altitude until i give you the final position who could be coming to rescue tarver by air a foreign intelligence service that would be an act of war open the door shouted tarver shed reached the boathouse alex pushed through the door into fetid darkness the gleaming white carrera had already been lowered into the water it rolled on the waves that crashed under the mildewed walls load the cases into the stern shouted tarver go alex set down the larger pelican and climbed carefully into the pitching speedboat she stowed the white case back near the huge twin outboard motors now the other one she climbed out and retrieved the yellow case as she stowed it she reflected on how wellplanned this escape had been they had ordered these watertight cases long ago preparing for an eventuality just like this one even if the heavily laden pelicans went into the water they would float and in yellow and white they would be highly visible from the air move up into the bow dr tarver ordered still under the sheet with jamie alex unslung the kelty then walked forward to the cushioned area where people usually sat to drink beer or sunbathe while others waterskied a big hand shot out from beneath the sheet and jerked one of her wrists over the other hold them together tarver shouted two seconds later he whipped a long strip of duct tape around her wrists once they were restrained he used both hands and wrapped them so tightly that she feared they would go numb her cell phone was ringing again this time tarver answered change of plan kaiser im going for a cruise if your chopper moves within three hundred meters of my boat ill kill the boy without hesitation still under the bedsheet dr tarver got behind the wheel and cranked the carreras massive engines the entire craft shook with their power the bedsheet covered the throttle and then the boat was moving forward steadily gaining way as it moved out of the boathouse into the slashing rain the boat shuddered from the impact of waves against the bow but as the engines gained power the sharp craft began to leap from crest to crest alex tried to think clearly but no hope came to her kaiser probably thought tarver was making a fatal mistake alex knew better there was a helicopter out here somewhere waiting to swoop down and carry the doctor to freedom she wanted to signal kaiserthere had to be a sniper watching her through a scopebut tarver was looking right past her through the eyeholes of his ghost costume as naturally as she could she faced the windshield and hunched over as though shielding herself from the rain she saw the bell rise above the fennell house it climbed and climbed then banked and arrowed out over the lake tracking them steadily from six hundred meters out when dr tarver turned to look at the pursuing chopper alex pointed at him then stabbed her hand skyward and twirled her finger in a wide arc to indicate the motion of a rotor she prayed that a sniper was watching her through a scope but even if one was what were the chances that hed read her signal correctly hed probably think she was asking for aerial rescue by the fbi chopper dr tarver was bearing for a small island that lay a few hundred meters offshore only about forty meters long it was heavily wooded alex remembered fishing from it once with jamie and her father could it conceal a helicopter tarver gunned the throttles and the boat began to spend more time in the air than on the water when the little island was dead ahead he swerved to starboard circled to the far side and pulled underneath some overhanging trees hit the deck he shouted throwing off the bedsheet and pointing his pistol at alex do it she did soon she heard the whupwhupwhup of the fbi helicopter over the carreras idling engines kaiser was moving closer she knew he was torn between hanging back for safetys sake and fear that dr tarver would execute his hostages while kaiser stood helplessly by the rotor noise increased alex couldnt make out anything through the limbs above her but she knew kaiser was easing still closer her cell phone began to ring stay down tarver shouted alex flattened herself between the boat seats a moment later two gunshots crashed against her ears terrified for jamie she looked up and saw dr tarver fire a third shot into the choppy water beside the boat what the hell is he doing dr tarver crouched and opened a long narrow compartment in the deck of the boat it had been put there to stow skis but tarver pulled a highpowered rifle out of it from the ornate engraving on the stock alex recognized it as another weapon from her dead brotherinlaws collection what happened next occurred with the terrible inevitability of nightmares the fbi chopper dropped into sight a hundred meters from the boat dr tarver smiled then jumped up like a hunter coming out of a duck blind and fired five shots in quick succession black smoke billowed from the bells turbines even before the final shot struck home the ship began to yaw wildly in the air alex heard an explosion and then the chopper began dropping toward the water its rotors were still spinning the pilot was using their stored energy to try to reach the surface without shattering the spines of the agents seated behind him its too fast alex murmured picturing kaiser bracing himself in the doomed craft oh god the chopper slammed nosefirst into the whitecaps sending a column of spray high into the air mercifully there were no more explosions alex stood up to look for survivors in the water but she was thrown to the deck when the carrera sped from beneath the trees tarver had his cell phone in his hand and he was yelling over the roar of the engines theres an island just east of the rendezvous its small and oblong theres a downed chopper on one side ill be on the other stay clear of that chopper tarver hugged the perimeter of the island and soon they were idling in its lee the island shielded them from the wind but the rain still stung alexs face as she searched the dark sky jamie crouched on the deck holding his hands over his ears as though afraid that the madman he was tied to might start firing the rifle again alex hunted for something she could use to cut the rope that bound them together jamie was an excellent swimmer and she wouldnt hesitate to throw him overboard if she could but there was no blade in sight the whupwhup of rotors reached her again she froze was this tarvers accomplice or had kaiser summoned aerial reinforcements the highway patrol and the dea almost certainly had helicopters based in jackson not to mention the sheriffs departments of the surrounding counties she could hear the chopper descending through the black sky but no matter how hard she tried she couldnt see it the rotor noise grew to a roar and then a group of lights flashed on fifty meters above the boat no wonder she hadnt seen the damned thing it was dark gray almost indistinguishable from the sky as she watched the chopper descend hope died within her dr tarver was talking to the pilot on his cell phone carefully guiding him in the rotor blast drove her to the deck and static electricity crackled around the boat as dr tarver shouted above the thunder she suddenly realized why he hadnt cut the rope binding him to jamie with the fbi so close simply escaping was not enough tarver needed insurance to guarantee his survival jamie was it chapter the gray helicopter hovered next to the speedboat in the rain so low that whitecaps were washing over its skids a huge door slid back opening a space big enough for a squad of marines to rappel through at dr tarvers signal a black man leaped from the helicopter into the speedboat load those cases the doctor shouted pointing to the pelicans in the stern while the newcomer hustled to the back of the boat tarver slashed the rope binding him to jamie then wrapped the end still tied to jamies waist twice around his hand like a leash alex got to her feet waiting for a chance to do something anything tarver jammed his pistol into his waistband then pulled the highpowered rifle out of the ski locker and tossed it into the hovering chopper the black man had already loaded one case and was going back for the other dr tarver lifted jamie into the crook of his arm then planted his right foot on the gunwale of the boat and prepared to toss jamie into the rocking chopper aunt alex jamie screamed his face white with terror dont let them take me as jamie flailed against tarver alex lunged forward and grabbed for the pistol at the small of tarvers back her fingers closed around the butt then she was gazing up from the deck the left side of her face numb she saw a blurry image of a black man staring down at her with a gun in his hand sure that she was down for the count the man made two more trips to the stern of the boat as he stepped over alex for the last time the kelty pack in his hand she struggled onto one elbow then to her knees looking over the pitching gunwale she saw tarver grinning from the chopper door while the black man secured the cases inside jamie was nowhere in sight when dr tarver turned away to help the loader alex saw the chopper pilot and her breath caught in her throat it was the grayhaired man who had visited tarvers clinic yesterday in that frozen moment she realized he was also the army officer standing with tarver and the blonde in the vcp photograph in tarvers office then she saw jamie strapped into a seat behind the pilot his face a mask of fear alex saw the terrified eyes of grace on her deathbed dying with the awful knowledge that she was leaving her son in the care of a monster alex looked frantically around the boat but dr tarver had left her nothing not a flare gun not an ax he had even taken the key with him when the helicopter lifted into the sky she would be left alone in the roaring storm and jamie would be gone forever she screamed from the depths of her being a cry of utter failure and desolation as if on cue the chopper dipped its nose and began to rise twenty feet forty sixty as it rose the pilot kept the open door facing the boat and alex soon saw why dr tarver had picked up the rifle and was now kneeling in the door aiming at her chest some distant part of her brain screamed drop yet her body remained frozen if she could not fulfill her promise to grace what did her own fate matter she would watch jamie until he disappeared no matter what the cost if grace called her to account in some other world she could at least say she had done that waiting for the muzzle flash she saw a blur of white descend in front of dr tarvers face the bedsheet no that lay discarded on the deck behind her then she saw jamie his face beside the flapping whiteness hed thrown his little arms around dr tarvers neck as the black man appeared in the door and grabbed for jamie one of those little arms jerked something tight a drawstring alex realized the croker sack tarver began flailing his arms and the rifle flew out of the door the doctor looked like a scarecrow being jerked around by a mad puppeteer he swung back into the cabin lurching into the pilot the helicopter stopped ascending and began to pitch wildly in the air seventy feet above the lake the chopper spun through degrees as the door came around the yellow pelican case flew out followed by the black man he turned two long somersaults in the air then smacked the choppy surface of the lake when the helicopter came around the second time alex saw dr tarver in the door again he seized the white sack with both hands and tore it violently from his neck a thick black rope hung from one of his cheeks she shuddered as she realized it was one of the cottonmouths attached to the doctor by its twoinch fangs tarver ripped the snake away from his face and flung it into space the black serpent seemed to hang in the air twisting wildly then it fell as dr tarver turned back to the interior the chopper dipped fifteen feet and jamie shot from the open door like a cannonball alex screamed in horror but as jamie fell she realized that his was a controlled fall he wasnt flipping like the man who had gone before him he was dropping straight down feetfirst like a schoolboy showing off at a swimming hole he landed seventy yards from the boat and alex lost him in the chop she jumped behind the wheel then remembered that dr tarver had taken the key slamming her bound hands against the gunwale she ran to the stern hope flooded through her on the port side of the carrera was an emergency trolling motor bill had used it to quietly propel the boat around fishing holes a bracket allowed the electric motor to be lifted out of the water when not in use two cables connected it to a battery on the stern deck alex looked back toward the spot where jamie had fallen the helicopter was descending over it her first thought was jamie but then she realized they were after the fallen case she ran her hands along the head of the trolling motor until she found the power switch then she lifted the bracket so that the propeller emerged from the water and protruded just above the gunwale she knew she could steer the boat with bound hands but she would be useless once she reached jamie when she hit the start switch the prop instantly spun into a black blur she held her taped wrists over the whirring prop and yanked her forearms as far apart as they would go slightly stretching the duct tape with every molecule of her instinct rebelling she lowered the tape onto the edge of the prop the ripping whine of a weed eater assaulted her eardrums and a red mist filled the air she tumbled onto the deck the force of the prop had kicked her hands into her face knocking her backward but when she looked down at her bloody wrists only a shred of tape remained intact yanking her arms apart she got to her feet and thrust the spinning prop down into the water the speedboat slowly moved forward alex jumped behind the wheel and aimed the bow toward the spot where she believed jamie had landed her left hand was covered with blood the prop had gouged deep into that wrist chewing up veins and exposing a radiant white carpal bone she forced herself to look away she didnt care how much blood she lost so long as she had the strength to pull jamie out of the water when she reached him ahead and to her right the gray helicopter had settled just above the surface of the lake dr tarver was straddling its left skid trying desperately to pluck the heavy yellow case from the waves alex had reached the spot where she thought jamie had fallen but she saw no sign of him twenty meters away dr tarver heaved the yellow case into the belly of the chopper as he did a big wave sloshed inside the machine almost instantly the chopper bellied and another wave flung itself inside obviously panicked the pilot dipped his rotors to the right venting the water from the door and lifting the chopper six feet above the waves this maneuver dumped dr tarver into the lake the pilot ascended another ten feet and hovered there as though uncertain what to do he had tarvers bag and cases did he really need the man apparently so as alex slowly circled in search of jamie the chopper settled back to the surface low enough for dr tarver to climb onto the skid and into the cabin this time the nose tilted forward and the chopper beat its way powerfully into the air fifty feet a hundred higher alex was searching for jamie again when the crack of rifle fire echoed over the water two shotsfive an explosion reverberated off the shore behind her the helicopter had risen high enough for kaisers snipers to get an angle on it alex glanced up only a moment but it was enough to see the chopper plummeting toward the lake black smoke pouring from its engine afraid that it might crash on top of her she steered away at the last moment the pilot flared and the chopper hit the waves with a strange whump not twentyfive meters from her she steered in everwider circles trying to control her fear what part of jamie might she see first a tangle of reddish hair a silver tennis shoe jamie she shouted astonished that she hadnt called out until now maybe im in shock she thought looking down at the growing pool of blood around her feet jamie jamie its aunt alex nothing the trolling motor was maddeningly slow she glanced to her right tarvers helicopter had already sunk to its engine cowling jamie she screamed answer me here shouted a weak voice over here that wasnt jamie it was either tarver or his pilot then she saw the doctors bald head moving through the water with surprising speed he disappeared behind a wave then shouted again i have him alex jamies over here help us she knew it was probably a trick that dr tarver might still have a gun but she had to be sure that he hadnt found jamie ducking behind the gunwale she slowly turned the bloodslickened wheel taking the carrera in a wide circle that would carry her nearer the doctor seconds later her heart thumped her sternum and her pulse began to race jamie was floating faceup in the heaving waves and tarver was swimming toward him he would reach jamie long before alex could get there with the boat instead of veering toward them alex continued her circle which carried her out of dr tarvers line of sight a rush of instinct so powerful that she could not ignore it told her that eldon tarver was about to enter her element for six weeks she had been playing catchup following cold clues that led nowhere even after shed gotten the doctor in her sights he had always been three steps ahead but this would be different this was a negotiation as the boat circled she ran to the stern and searched for the fuel line there a transparent hose no bigger than her little finger the aorta of a human was hardly bigger and this was the main artery of the boat she yanked it loose and gasoline began running onto the stern deck she went back to the wheel and steered toward dr tarver who was now holding jamie in a lifeguards crosschest carry the boy appeared to be unconscious when alex was thirty feet away she ran back to the stern and switched off the trolling motor lets talk shouted tarver we dont have much time as she moved back to the bow a memory flashed into alexs head she saw bill fennell on the fourth of july yanking up a seat cushion to get at some tools she stopped tucked her fingers under that same seat and pulled the seat cushion popped free in the small compartment below she saw a screwdriver a roll of electrical tape a set of allen wrenches and some copper wire no knife no flare gun shit what are you doing shouted tarver i want to make a deal im hurt alex yelled back bleeding badhang on she pulled off her soaked shirt and wrapped it tightly around her mangled wrist then she took the screwdriver from the compartment and slid it underneath the makeshift bandage i want the boat tarver shouted alex looked up the boat had drifted closer to the doctor she ducked below the gunwale i want jamie tarver stroked nearer holding jamies head above the water then id say we have a deal she shook her head you have a gun i know you do i lost it in the crash alex shook her head again no gun no boat dr tarvers right hand stopped treading water dipped under the surface then reappeared holding an automatic throw it away alex yelled she saw rage in his eyes but he threw the gun into the waves get out of the boat he bellowed i have the key when youre out ill swim to the transom and get in no cried alex swim away from jamie first hell sink she turned and snatched up a life ring one of the few things tarver had left in the boat she tossed it to him put that under his arms then swim away seeing no alternative dr tarver struggled to push jamies body into the life ring as he worked alex saw that the dark purple mark on the left side of his face was not his deformity as she had thought but the livid swelling of a snakebite all right dr tarver shouted swim away obviously reluctant to give up his leverage dr tarver released jamie and swam quickly toward the stern of the boat jump out he shouted still suspicious alex pulled off her shoes and stripped off her jeans wet jeans could quickly drown you in water like this she climbed onto the gunwale and dropped into the cold water as she breaststroked toward jamie she sensed movement to her left dr tarver had not climbed into the boat he was kicking toward jamie again she started to swim freestyle but tarver still got there first as alex stared in disbelief he put his big hand on top of jamies head and shoved him right through the life ring deep under the water save him now he snarled alex couldnt see jamie but he didnt appear to be struggling dr tarver held him under as easily as he might an infant she thought of pulling out the screwdriver but that was no solution shed never overpower tarver facetoface the answer struck her with the force of revelation as she dove beneath the waves her fathers voice echoed in her head when your backs against the wall do the unexpected thats how you stay alive she kicked deeper deeper until she was fifteen feet below the surface then she opened her eyes and looked up all she could make out was a dark blur against the gray surface as she floated slowly upward a tentacle of darkness swept past her eyes she grabbed it it was an anklethe smooth ankle of a boy knowing that tarver was braced for a fight she expelled all the air from her lungs and jerked the ankle straight down then swam toward the bottom with all her strength with a rush of joy she felt jamies body come with her after a few seconds of kicking she started trying to tow him laterally but her oxygen was disappearing fast she had to surface as she kicked upward she saw a splash above then a black shape sweeping down toward her trailing bubbles switching jamies ankle to her left hand she drew the screwdriver from her bandage and waited when the shadow reached for her she kicked upward and stabbed with savage force the tool struck something but the shadow didnt stop a powerful hand seized her throat alex flung her arm wide and stabbed from the side an explosion of bubbles enveloped her tarvers big body thrashed like a wounded sharks and then his hand let go hope surged through her urging her to a final blow she yanked back on the handle of her weapon but the screwdriver wouldnt pull free terrified that shed lose jamie she released the tool and tried to swim clear but now her air was truly gone lungs burning she grabbed jamie beneath both arms and kicked for the gray light above she broke through the waves and saw the boat bobbing fifteen meters away she was shifting jamie to a lifeguards carry when dr tarver surfaced directly in front of her his eyes shone like those of a man in the grip of a religious vision but something about his mouth was wrong it sagged the way graces had after her stroke alex had no idea how to keep hold of jamie and fight tarver in the waves nor had she the strength to do it but when tarvers hand rose from the water it did not reach for her the hand was open and it moved to the side of his head as though searching for a wound alex and the doctor understood the horror of his plight at the same moment the handle of the screwdriver protruded from tarvers left ear where the metal shaft had been buried to the hilt tarvers eyes widened as his hand closed around the handle he seemed about to jerk the screwdriver free but then some flicker of knowledge overrode his instinct his hand dropped into the water and he looked over his shoulder with a last wild look into alexs eyes he turned and began swimming awkwardly toward the boat alex turned in the water and started kicking toward the island it appeared to be fifty or sixty meters away not a difficult swim under normal conditions but now potentially lethal her burning lungs and blurred vision told her shed lost more blood than she knew still she kicked on through the battering waves forty meters thirty her leaden limbs began to sink jamies face was blue but she could no longer kick she knew then that they might die within a few meters of the shore an image of grace rose into her mind and then her father then her mother lying unconscious in the hospital were the last she thought helplessly jamie and me she tried to kick but there was nothing left she kissed jamies cheek and prayed for the strength to hold his head above the surface while she drowned her mouth was full of water when she heard a male voice barking orders kaiser she shoved jamie higher trying to kick with dead legs then a powerful arm swept around her propelling them both toward shore someone dragged jamie from her arms she was dimly aware of someone counting chest compressions a blessedly warm hand touched her face and she opened her eyes john kaiser knelt above her looking anxiously into her face can you hear me alex she nodded is there anyone else in the boat she shook her head jamie she gasped is he alive as if in answer there was a fit of coughing beside her then the sound of a boy crying disable the boat shouted kaiser getting to his feet fire at the engine no alex cried remembering the disconnected fuel line which from the roar of the engines tarver must have reconnected her cry was drowned by the crack of rifle fire she rose onto her elbow and tried to shout stopthe fuel what called kaiser moving back to her but the rifle cracked again and the stern of the fleeing carrera erupted into flame a figure leaped onto the starboard gunwale but before it could jump clear the speedboat blew apart alex collapsed in the mud rain falling steadily on her face she tried to explain about the pelican cases but her voice was lost in the squawk of radios kaisers barked orders and shouts about a man in the water the pilot of the doctors helicopter none of it mattered now she rolled onto her side and saw jamie lying beside her staring at her with wide eyes but it was grace looking out through those eyesand no longer with despair when jamie held out a shivering hand alex pulled him to her burying his face in her chest she had kept her promise at last epilogue two weeks later alex slowed the corolla and told jamie to watch for a gravel road on the left they were driving down a deserted gray road through an endless tunnel of oak trees are you sure you know where youre going asked jamie i think so it wasnt that long ago that i was here i stood with him on that big bridge we just went over jamie took off his seat belt got onto his knees on the seat and propped his elbow on the terracotta jar between them careful said alex sorry jamie leaned forward and pressed his forehead against the windshield i think i see it is that a road it is eagle eyes jamie was staring anxiously at the narrow gap in the trees man its dark in there alex slowed to a stop then turned left onto deeply rutted gravel chris told me that bad outlaws used to hide out on this road when asked jamie a long time ago or like now the car jounced so hard that his head hit the roof ow sorry said alex like two hundred years ago oh jamie had lost all interest alex almost regretted coming the washedout road was virtually impassable without a fourwheel drive after fifty yards she had to give up and park unsure how she would ever get back to the trace proper come on she said from here we walk jamie looked surprised but he got out alex lifted the clay jar off the seat locked the door and led jamie along the gravel road that quickly turned to sand the air was close and muggy and horseflies dived around their faces thirsty for blood this sucks said jamie i dont think theres anything down here have a little faith huh youre a tough guy she walked a few more yards then stopped listening do you hear that jamie stopped too whats that sound alex smiled water she broke into a trot and jamie ran alongside her a moment later they broke out of the trees into bright sunlight that flashed like diamonds from the surface of a broad clear stream hey called a male voice we thought youd given up alex shielded her eyes against the sun and looked down the course of the stream a hundred feet away chris and ben shepard sat on a fallen log facing a small campfire the smell of cooking meat drifted on the wind jamie yelped and started sprinting across the sand alex followed more slowly by the time she reached the fire ben and jamie had charged into the creek and were splashing fifty yards downstream searching for arrowheads and dinosaur bones chris got up and gave her a welcoming hug whats in the jar he asked smiling she pulled off the clay lid and lifted out a bottle of chilled white wine my contribution she said raising the tone a little bit chris laughed and took the bottle i hope you brought a corkscrew she smiled screwoff cap he did the honors then filled two styrofoam cups they sat on the log a few feet apart and sipped slowly hows ben doing she asked at length chris looked down the creek he has some bad nights hes sleeping with me for now but overall hes doing really well im glad chris looked at her i think ben knew thora better than i did alex had suspected this from the start children see whats there not what we pretend to be what about jamie she smiled hes much better i think he misses will kilmer more than he misses his father will makes him think of his grandfather my dad chris picked up a stick and poked the fire how are you doing alex asked physically or otherwise both not too bad physically im still having some strange symptoms but pete connolly thinks its a reaction to the antidote drug dr tarvers notes mention similar reactions in some of the patients at his free clinic alex had not been made privy to all the details of dr tarvers work chris had been treated by an army doctor authorized to administer injections taken from one of the vials in dr tarvers captured pelican cases that vial represented chriss only hope for neutralizing the cancercausing virus that tarver had injected into him fbi director roberts had repeatedly assured her that dr tarvers notes had been studied intensively by some of the best virologists in the country and that they felt confident chris would recover without a trace of the virus in his system that was easy for director roberts to say of course he wasnt the one who had been injected but chris had been given more technical information than she and he seemed confident that he would recover his health in time alex held up her glass in a silent toast he touched hers and they drank what about otherwise alex asked softly day by day penn cage has helped me a lot how so he lost his wife to cancer when he was thirtyseven ben and annie have become good friends i think she helps him a lot with his why me issues i could use some help with those sometimes alex confessed yeah chris leaned over and refilled her cup hows the custody thing coming jamies mine no doubt the judge upheld the clause in the original will im jamies godmother and the will made it clear that if both grace and bill died i should raise jamie so thats that have you thought any more about where youre going to go the director offered me washington again as a hostage negotiator alex nodded my old job back thats what you wanted isnt it i thought it was but a couple of days ago i got another offer chriss eyes narrowed what the sac in new orleans asked if i could be assigned to his office in the same capacity chris raised his eyebrows is john kaiser behind that she nodded i think kaiser has a lot of influence down there anyway theres a lot happening in new orleans now crime is really out of hand sounds like a great place to raise a kid alex smiled ruefully i know kaiser and jordan live across lake pontchartrain though its really nice over there and its the south you know i think its time for me to come back home chris was looking steadily at her i think youre right she looked back at him for a while then reached into her pocket and brought out a small plastic case whats that he asked its the original minidv of thora and lansing on the balcony chris scowled and shook his head whyd you bring it here not to upset you it was in wills things but i figure its yours chris was staring into the fire again i thought you might want to pay shane lansing back chris reached out for the tape she handed it to him lansings a bastard he said but hes got four kids if he makes a hell of his own life so be it i wont be the one to break up his family chris dropped the tape into the fire as the plastic melted a harsh toxic odor rose from the flames they stood and moved a few steps away leave the past in the past alex asked he nodded his eyes on hers you could try that too you know without warning he raised his fingers to her face and touched the cluster of scars around her right eye alex flinched and started to pull back but something steadied her and she endured it you hated thoras beauty didnt you he said softly his fingers exploring the discolored flesh shivering within she nodded without speaking thora was perfect on the outside chris said but insideshe was ugly selfish and cruel that doesnt make this easier he looked down into her face you must know those scars dont matter she smiled wistfully but they do i know because there was a time when i didnt have them and people treated me differently he leaned forward and pressed his lips to the worst scar a purplish ridge of tissue beneath her temple like this so deeply was alex moved that she felt driven to turn away but chris held her in place i asked you a question he said maybe she whispered covering her mouth with a shaking hand something like that a highpitched scream echoed over the water they both looked downstream ben and jamie were racing up the creek splashing water high above their heads as they drew near jamies right arm was held high and ben was pointing at it as they ran i think theyve found something chris said looks like it chris let his hand fall then took her hand in his and led her across the warm sand lets go see what it is alex wiped her eyes with her free hand and followed him into the cool clear water acknowledgments as always i am indebted to many individuals for their help in the writing of this novel i am constantly amazed and gratified to see
