lois mcmaster bujold the warriors apprentice chapter one the tall and dour noncom wore imperial dress greens and carried his communications panel like a field marshals baton he slapped it absently against his thigh and raked the group of young men before him with a gaze of dry contempt challenging all part of the game miles told himself he stood in the crisp autumn breeze and tried not to shiver in his shorts and running shoes nothing to put you off balance like being nearly naked when all about you look ready for one of emperor gregors reviews although in all fairness the majority here were dressed the same as himself the noncom proctoring the tests merely seemed like a oneman crowd miles measured him wondering what conscious or unconscious tricks of body language he used to achieve that air of icy competence something to be learned there you will run in pairs the noncom instructed he did not seem to raise his voice but somehow it was pitched to carry to the ends of the lines another effective trick miles thought it reminded him of that habit of his fathers of dropping his voice to a whisper when speaking in a rage it locked attention the timing of the five kilometer run begins immediately upon completion of the last phase of the obstacle course remember it the noncom began counting off pairs the eliminations for officers candidacy in the barrayaran imperial military service took a gruelling week five days of written and oral examinations were behind miles now the hardest part was over everybody said there was almost an air of relaxation among the young men around him there was more talking and joking in the group exaggerated complaints about the difficulty of the exams the withering wit of the examining officers the poor food interrupted sleep surprise distractions during the testing selfcongratulatory complaints these among the survivors they looked forward to the physical tests as a game recess perhaps the hardest part was overfor everyone but miles he stood to his full height such as it was and stretched as if to pull his crooked spine out straight by force of will he gave a little upward jerk of his chin as if balancing his toolarge head a head meant for a man over six feet on his justunderfivefoot frame and narrowed his eyes at the obstacle course it began with a concrete wall five meters high topped with iron spikes climbing it would be no problem there was nothing wrong with his muscles it was the coming down that worried him the bones always the damn bones kosigan kostolitz the noncom called passing in front of him miless brows snapped down and he gave the noncom a sharp upward glance then controlled his gaze to a blank straightness the omission of the honorific before his name was policy not insult all classes stood equal in the emperors service now a good policy his own father endorsed it grandfather bitched to be sure but that unreconstructed old man had begun his imperial service when its principle arm was horse cavalry and each officer trained his own military apprentices to have addressed him in those days as kosigan without the vor might have resulted in a duel now his grandson sought entrance to a military academy off planet style and training in the tactics of energy weapons wormhole exits and planetary defense and stood shoulder to shoulder with boys who would not have been permitted to polish his sword in the old days not quite shoulder to shoulder miles reflected dryly stealing a sidelong glance up at the candidates on either side of him the one he had been paired with for the obstacle course whats his name kostolitz caught the glance and looked back down with illconcealed curiosity miless eye level gave him a fine opportunity to study the fellows excellent biceps the noncom signalled fall out for those not running the obstacle course immediately miles and his companion sat on the ground ive been seeing you around all week offered kostolitz what the hell is that thing on your leg miles controlled his irritation with the ease of long practice god knew he did stand out in a crowd particularly this crowd at least kostolitz did not make hex signs at him like a certain decrepit old countrywoman down at vorkosigan surleau in some of the more remote and undeveloped regions on barrayar like deep in the dendarii mountains in the vorkosigans own district infanticide was still practiced for defects as mild as a harelip despite sporadic efforts from the more enlightened centers of authority to stamp it out he glanced down at the pair of gleaming metal rods paralleling his left leg between knee and ankle that had remained secretly beneath his trouser leg until this day leg brace he replied polite but unencouraging kostolitz continued to stare what for temporary i have a couple of brittle bones there keeps me from breaking them until the surgeons quite sure im done growing then i get them replaced with synthetics thats weird commented kostolitz is it a disease or what under the guise of shifting his weight he moved just slightly farther from miles unclean unclean thought miles wildly should i ring a bell i ought to tell him its contagiousi was sixfootfour this time last year he sighed away the temptation my mother was exposed to a poison gas when she was pregnant with me she pulled through all right but it wrecked my bone growth huh didnt they give you any medical treatment oh sure ive had an inquisitions worth thats why i can walk around today instead of being carried in a bucket kostolitz looked mildly revolted but stopped trying to sidle subtly upwind how did you ever get past the medicals i thought there was a minimum height rule it was waived pending my test results oh kostolitz digested this miles returned his attention to the test ahead he should be able to pick up some time on that bellycrawl under the laser fire good he would need it on the five kilometer run lack of height and a permanent limp from a left leg shorter after more fractures than he could remember by a good four centimeters than his right would slow him down no help for it tomorrow would be better tomorrow was the endurance phase the herd of longlegged gangling boys around him could unquestionably beat him on the sprint he fully expected to be anchor man on the first kilometer leg tomorrow probably the second as well but after kilometers most would be flagging as the real pain mounted i am a professional of pain kostolitz he thought to his rival tomorrow after about kilometer ill ask you to repeat those questions of yoursif you have the breath to spare bloody hell lets pay attention to business not this dink a five meter dropperhaps it would be better to go around take a zero on that part but his overall score was bound to be relatively poor he hated to part with a single point unnecessarily and at the very beginning too he was going to need every one of them skipping the wall would cut into his narrow safety margin you really expect to pass the physicals asked kostolitz looking around i mean above the th percentile no kostolitz looked baffled then what the hells the point i dont have to pass it just make something near a decent score kostolitzs eyebrows rose whose ass do you have to kiss to get a deal like that gregor vorbarras there was an undercurrent of incipient jealousy in his tone classconscious suspicion miless jaw clamped let us not bring up the subject of fathers how do you plan to get in without passing kostolitz persisted eyes narrowing his nostrils flared at the scent of privilege like an animal alert for blood practice politics miles told himself that too should be in your blood like war i petitioned miles explained patiently to have my scores averaged instead of taken separately i expect my writtens to bring up my physicals that far up youd need a damn near perfect score thats right miles snarled kosigan kostolitz another uniformed proctor called they entered the starting area its a little hard on me you know kostolitz complained why it hasnt got a thing to do with you none of your business at all miles added pointedly were put in pairs to pace each other how will i know how im doing oh dont feel you have to keep up with me miles purred kostolitzs brows lowered with annoyance they were chivvied into place miles glanced across the parade ground at a distant knot of men waiting and watching a few military relatives and the liveried retainers of the handful of counts sons present today there was a pair of hardlooking men in the blue and gold of the vorpatrils his cousin ivan must be around here somewhere and there was bothari tall as a mountain and lean as a knife in the brown and silver of the vorkosigans miles raised his chin in a barely perceptible salute bothari meters away caught the gesture and changed his stance from at ease to a silent parade rest in acknowledgment a couple of testing officers the noncom and a pair of proctors from the course were huddled together at a distance some gesticulations a look in miless direction a debate it seemed it concluded the proctors returned to their stations one of the officers started the next pair of boys over the course and the noncom approached miles and his companion he looked uneasy miles schooled his features to cool attention kosigan the noncom began voice carefully neutral youre going to have to take off the leg brace artificial aids not permitted for the test a dozen counterarguments sprang up in miless mind he tightened his lips on them this noncom was in a sense his commanding officer miles knew for certain that more than physical performance was being evaluated today yes sir the noncom looked faintly relieved may i give it to my man asked miles he threatened the noncom with his eyesif not im going to stick you with it and youll have to cart it around the rest of the daysee how conspicuous it makes you feel certainly sir said the noncom the sir was a slip the noncom knew who he was of course a small wolfish smile slid across miless mouth and vanished miles gave bothari a high sign and the liveried bodyguard trotted over obediently you may not converse with him the noncom warned yes sir acknowledged miles he sat on the ground and unclipped the muchloathed apparatus good a kilo less to carry he tossed it up to bothari who caught it onehanded and squirmed back to his feet bothari correctly offered him no hand up seeing his bodyguard and the noncom together the noncom suddenly bothered miles less the proctor looked shorter somehow and younger even a little soft bothari was taller leaner much older a lot uglier and considerably meanerlooking but then bothari had been a noncom himself when this proctor had been a toddler narrow jaw hooked beak of a nose eyes of a nondescript color set too close together miles looked up at his liveried retainers face with a loving pride of possession he glanced toward the obstacle course and let his eyes pass over botharis bothari glanced at it too pursed his lips tucked the brace firmly under his arm and gave a slight shake of his head directed apparently at the middle distance miless mouth twitched bothari sighed and trotted back to the waiting area so bothari advised caution but then botharis job was to keep him intact not advance his careerno unfair miles chided himself no one had been of more service in the preparations for this frantic week than bothari hed spent endless time on training pushing miless body to its toosoonfound limits unflaggingly devoted to his charges passionate obsession my first command thought miles my private army kostolitz stared after bothari he identified the livery at last it seemed for he looked back at miles in startled illumination so thats who you are he said with a jealous awe no wonder you got a deal on the tests miles smiled tightly at the implied insult the tension crawled up his back he groped for some suitably scathing retort but they were being motioned to the starting mark kostolitzs deductive faculty crunched on it seemed for he added sardonically and so thats why the lord regent never made the bid for the imperium time mark said the proctor now and they were off kostolitz sprinted ahead of miles instantly youd better run you witless bastard because if i can catch you im going to kill youmiles galloped after him feeling like a cow in a horse race the wall the bloody wallkostolitz was grunting halfway up it when miles arrived at least he could show this workingclass hero how to climb he swarmed up it as if the tiny toe and finger holds were great steps his muscles poweredoverpoweredby his fury to his satisfaction he reached the top ahead of kostolitz he looked down and stopped abruptly perched gingerly among the spikes the proctor was watching closely kostolitz caught up with miles his face suffused with effort a vor scared of heights kostolitz gasped with a grinning glare over his shoulder he flung himself off hit the sand with an authoritative impact recovered his balance and dashed off precious seconds would be wasted climbing down like some arthritic little old ladyperhaps if he hit the ground rollingthe proctor was staringkostolitz had already reached the next obstaclemiles jumped time seemed to stretch itself as he plummeted toward the sand especially to allow him the full sick savor of his mistake he hit the sand with the familiar shattering crack and sat blinking stupidly at the pain he would not cry outat least the detached observer in the back of his brain commented sardonically you cant blame it on the bracethis time youve managed to break both of them his legs began to swell and discolor mottled white and flushed he pulled himself along until they were stretched out straight and bent over a moment hiding his face in his knees face buried he permitted himself one silent rictus scream he did not swear the vilest terms he knew seemed wholly inadequate to the occasion the proctor awakening to the fact that he was not going to stand up started toward him miles pulled himself across the sand out of the path of the next pair of candidates and waited patiently for bothari he had all the time in the world now miles decided he definitely didnt like the new antigrav crutches even though they were worn invisibly inside his clothing they gave his walk a slithery uncertainty that made him feel spastic he would have preferred a good oldfashioned stick or better yet a swordstick like captain koudelkas that one could drive into the ground with a satisfying thunk at each step as if spearing some suitable enemykostolitz for example he paused to gather his balance before tackling the steps to vorkosigan house minute particles in their worn granite scintillated warmly in the autumn morning light in spite of the industrial haze that hung over the capital city of vorbarr sultana a racket from farther down the street marked where a similar mansion was being demolished to make way for a modern building miles glanced up to the highrise directly across the street a figure moved against the roofline the battlements had changed but the watchful soldiers still stalked along them bothari looming silently beside him bent suddenly to retrieve a lost coin from the walkway he placed it carefully in his left pocket the dedicated pocket one corner of miless mouth lifted and his eyes warmed with amusement still the dowry of course said bothari serenely his voice was deep bass monotonous in cadence one had to know him a long time to interpret its expressionlessness miles knew every minute variation in its timbre as a man knows his own room in the dark youve been pinching tenthmarks for elena as long as i can remember dowries went out with the horse cavalry for gods sake even the vor marry without them these days this isnt the time of isolation miles made his mockery gentle in tone carefully fitted to botharis obsession bothari after all had always treated miless ridiculous craze seriously i mean her to have everything right and proper you ought to have enough saved up to buy gregor vorbarra by now said miles thinking of the hundreds of small economies his bodyguard had practiced before him over the years for the sake of his daughters dowry shouldnt joke about the emperor bothari depressed this random stab at humor firmly as it deserved miles sighed and began to work his way cautiously up the steps legs stiff in their plastic immobilizers the painkillers hed taken before hed left the military infirmary were beginning to wear off he felt unutterably weary the night had been a sleepless one sitting up under local anesthetics talking and joking with the surgeon as he puttered endlessly piecing the minute shattered fragments of bone back together like an unusually obstreperous jigsaw puzzle i put on a pretty good show miles reassured himself but he longed to get off stage and collapse just a couple more acts to go what kind of fellow are you planning to shop for miles probed delicately during a pause in his climb an officer bothari said firmly miless smile twisted so thats the pinnacle of your ambition too sergeant he inquired silently not too soon i trust bothari snorted of course not shes only he paused the creases deepening between his narrow eyes times gone by his mutter trailed off miles negotiated the steps successfully and entered vorkosigan house bracing for relatives the first was to be his mother it seemed that was no problem she appeared at the foot of the great staircase in the front hall as the door was opened for him by a uniformed servantcumguard lady vorkosigan was a middleaged woman the fiery red of her hair quenched by natural grey her height neatly disguising a few extra kilos weight she was breathing a bit heavily probably had run downstairs when he was spotted approaching they exchanged a brief hug her eyes were grave and unjudgemental father here he asked no he and minister quintillian are down at headquarters armwrestling with the general staff about their budget this morning he said to give you his love and tell you hed try to be here for lunch he ahhasnt told grandfather about yesterday yet has he noi really think you should have let him though its been rather awkward this morning ill bet he gazed up at the stairs it was more than his bad legs that made them seem mountainous well lets get the worst over with first upstairs is he in his rooms although he actually took a walk in the garden this morning im glad to say mm miles started working his way upstairs lift tube said bothari oh hell its only one flight surgeon said youre to stay off them as much as possible miless mother awarded bothari an approving smile which he acknowledged blandly with a murmured milady miles shrugged grudgingly and headed for the back of the house instead miles said his mother as he passed dont ah hes very old hes not too well and he hasnt had to be polite to anybody in yearsjust take him on his own terms all right you know i do he grinned ironically to prove how unaffected he proposed to be her lips curved in return but her eyes remained grave he met elena bothari coming out of his grandfathers chambers his bodyguard greeted his daughter with a silent nod and won for himself one of her rather shy smiles for the thousandth time miles wondered how such an ugly man could have produced such a beautiful daughter every one of his features was echoed in her face but richly transmuted at eighteen she was tall like her father fully six feet to his sixandahalf but while he was whipcord lean and tense she was slim and vibrant his nose a beak hers an elegant aquiline profile his face too narrow hers with the air of some perfectly bred aristocratic sighthound a borzoi or a greyhound perhaps it was the eyes that made the difference hers were dark and lustrous alert but without his constantly shifting unsmiling watchfulness or the hair his greying clipped in his habitual military burr hers long dark straightshining a gargoyle and a saint by the same sculptor facing each other across some ancient cathedral portal miles shook himself from his trance her eyes met his briefly and her smile faded he straightened up from his tired slouch and produced a false smile for her hoping to lure her real one back not too soon sergeant oh good im so glad youre here she greeted him its been gruesome this morning has he been crotchety no cheerful playing strato with me and paying no attentiondo you know i almost beat him telling his war stories and wondering about youif hed had a map of your course hed have been sticking pins in it to mark your imaginary progress i dont have to stay do i no of course not elena twitched a relieved smile at him and trailed off down the corridor casting one disquieted look back over her shoulder miles took a breath and stepped across general count piotr vorkosigans inner threshold chapter two the old man was out of bed shaved and crisply dressed for the day he sat up in a chair gazing pensively out the window overlooking his back garden he glanced up with a frown at the interrupter of his meditations saw that it was miles and smiled broadly ah come boy he gestured at the chair miles guessed elena had recently vacated the old mans smile became tinged with puzzlement by god have i lost a day somewhere i thought this was the day you were out on that kilometer trot up and down mt sencele no sir you havent lost a day miles eased into the chair bothari set another before him and pointed at his feet miles started to lift them but the effort was sabotaged by a particularly savage twinge of pain yeah put em up sergeant miles acquiesced wearily bothari helped him place the offending feet at the medically correct angle and withdrew strategically miles thought to stand at attention by the door the old count watched this pantomime understanding dawning painfully in his face what have you done boy he sighed lets make it quick and painless like a beheading jumped off a wall in the obstacle course yesterday and broke both my legs washed myself out of the physical tests completely the otherswell they dont matter now so you came home so i came home ah the old man drummed his long gnarled fingers once on the arm of the chair ah he shifted uncomfortably in his seat and thinned his lips staring out the window not looking at miles his fingers drummed again its all the fault of this damned creeping democratism he burst out querulously a lot of imported offplanet nonsense your father did not do barrayar a service to encourage it he had a fine opportunity to stamp it out when he was regentwhich he wasted totally as far as i can see he trailed off in love with offplanet notions offplanet women he echoed himself more faintly i blame your mother you know always pushing that egalitarian tripe oh come on miles was stirred to object mothers as apolitical as you can get and still be conscious and walking around thank god or shed be running barrayar today ive never seen your father cross her yet well well it could have been worse the old man shifted again twisting in his pain of spirit as miles had in his pain of body miles lay in his chair making no effort to defend the issue or himself the count could be trusted to argue himself down taking both parts in a little time we must bend with the times i suppose we must all bend with the times shopkeepers sons are great soldiers now god knows i commanded a few in my day did i ever tell you about the fellow when we were fighting the cetagandans up in the dendarii mountains back behind vorkosigan surleaubest guerilla lieutenant i ever had i wasnt much older than you then he killed more cetagandans that year his father had been a tailor a tailor back when it was all cut and stitched by hand hunched over all the little detailing he sighed for the irretrievable past what was the fellows name tesslev supplied miles he raised his eyebrows quizzically at his feet perhaps i shall be a tailor then im built for it but theyre as obsolete as counts now tesslev yes that was it he died horribly when they caught his patrol brave man brave man silence fell between them for a time the old count spotted a straw and clutched at it was the test fairly administered you never know these dayssome plebian with a personal ax to grind miles shook his head and moved quickly to cut this fantasy down before it had a chance to grow and flower quite fair it was me i let myself get rattled didnt pay attention to what i was doing i failed because i wasnt good enough period the old man twisted his lips in sour negation his hand closed angrily and opened hopelessly in the old days no one would have dared question your right in the old days the cost of my incompetence would have been paid in other mens lives this is more efficient i believe miless voice was flat well the old man stared unseeingly out the window welltimes change barrayar has changed it underwent a world of change between the time i was ten and the time i was twenty and another between the time i was twenty and forty nothing was the same and another between the time i was forty and eighty this weak degenerate generationeven their sins are watered down the old pirates of my fathers day could have eaten them all for breakfast and digested their bones before lunch do you know i shall be the first count vorkosigan to die in bed in nine generations he paused gaze still fixed and whispered half to himself god ive grown weary of change the very thought of enduring another new world dismays me dismays me sir said miles gently the old man looked up quickly not your fault boy not your fault you were caught in the wheels of change and chance just like the rest of us it was pure chance that the assassin chose that particular poison to try and kill your father he wasnt even aiming for your mother youve done well despite it wewe just expected too much of you thats all let no one say you have not done well thank you sir the silence lengthened unbearably the room was growing warm miless head ached from lack of sleep and he felt nauseous from the combination of hunger and medications he clambered awkwardly to his feet if youll excuse me sir the old man waved a hand in dismissal yes you must have things to do he paused again and looked at miles quizzically what are you going to do now it seems very strange to me we have always been vor the warriors even when war changed with the rest of it he looked so shrunken down in his chair miles pulled himself together into a semblance of cheerfulness well you know theres always the other aristocratic line to fall back on if i cant be a service grunt ill be a town clown i plan to be a famous epicure and lover of women more fun than soldiering any day his grandfather fell in with his humor yes i always envied the breedgo to boy he smiled but miles felt it was as forced as his own it was a lie anywaydrone was a swear word in the old mans vocabulary miles collected bothari and made his own escape miles sat hunched in a battered armchair in a small private parlor overlooking the street side of the great old mansion feet up eyes closed it was a seldom used room there was a good chance of being left alone to brood in peace he had never come to a more complete halt a drained blankness numb even to pain so much passion expended for nothinga lifetime of nothing stretching endlessly into the futurebecause of a split seconds stupid angry selfconsciousness there was a throatclearing noise behind him and a diffident voice hi miles his eyes flicked open and he felt suddenly a little less like a wounded animal hiding in its hole elena i gather you came up from vorkosigan surleau with mother last night come on in she perched near him on the arm of another chair yes she knows what a treat it is for me to come to the capital i almost feel like shes my mother sometimes tell her that it would please her do you really think so she asked shyly absolutely he shook himself into alertness perhaps not a totally empty future she chewed gently on her lower lip large eyes drinking in his face you look absolutely smashed he would not bleed on elena he banished his blackness in selfmockery leaning back expansively and grinning literally too true ill get over it you ahheard all about it i suppose yes did um it go all right with my lord count oh sure im the only grandson hes got after all puts me in an excellent positioni can get away with anything did he ask you about changing your name he stared what to the usual patronymic hed been talking about when youoh she cut herself off but miles caught the full import of her half revelation oh howhen i became an officer was he finally planning to break down and allow me my heirs names sweet of himseventeen years after the fact he stifled a sick anger beneath an ironic grin i never understood what that was all about what my namemiles naismith after my mothers father instead of piotr miles after both it all goes back to that uproar when i was born apparently after my parents had recovered from the soltoxin gas and they found out what the fetal damage was going to beim not supposed to know this by the waygrandfather was all for an abortion got in a big fight with my parentswell with mother i suppose and father caught in the middleand when my father backed her up and faced him down he got huffy and asked his name not be given me he calmed down later when he found i wasnt a total disaster he smirked and drummed his fingers on the chair arm so he was thinking of swallowing his words was he perhaps its just as well i washed out he might have choked he closed his teeth on further bitterness and wished he could call back his last speech no point in being more ugly in front of elena than he already was i know how hard you studied for it iim sorry he feigned a surface humor not half as sorry as i am i wish you could have taken my physicals between us wed make a hell of an officer something of the old frankness they had shared as children escaped her lips suddenly yes but by barrayaran standards im more handicapped than youim female i wouldnt even be permitted to petition to take the tests his eyebrows lifted in wry agreement i know absurd with what your fathers taught you all youd need is a course in heavy weapons and you could roll right over ninetenths of the fellows i saw out there think of itsergeant elena bothari she chilled now youre teasing just speaking as one civilian to another he half apologized she nodded dark agreement then brightened with remembered purpose oh your mother sent me to get you for lunch ah he pushed himself to his feet with a sibilant grunt theres an officer no one disobeys the admirals captain elena smiled at the image yes now she was an officer for the betans and no one thinks shes strange or criticizes her for wanting to break the rules on the contrary shes so strange nobody even thinks of trying to include her in the rules she just goes on doing things her own way i wish i were betan said elena glumly oh make no mistakeshes strange by betan standards too although i think you would like beta colony parts of it he mused ill never get off planet he eyed her sapiently whats got you down she shrugged oh well you know my father hes such a conservative he ought to have been born two hundred years ago youre the only person i know who doesnt think hes weird hes so paranoid i knowbut its a very useful quality in a bodyguard his pathological suspiciousness has saved my life twice you should have been born two hundred years ago too no thanks id have been slain at birth well there is that she admitted anyway just out of the blue this morning he started talking about arranging my marriage miles stopped abruptly and glanced up at her really what did he say not much she shrugged he just mentioned it i wishi dont know i wish my mother were alive ah well theres always my mother if you want somebody to talk to oror me you can talk to me cant you she smiled gratefully thanks they came to the stairs she paused he waited he never talks about my mother anymore you know hasnt since i was about twelve he used to tell me long storieswell long for himabout her i wonder if hes beginning to forget her i shouldnt think so i see him more than you do hes never so much as looked at another woman miles offered reassuringly they started down the stairs his aching legs did not move properly he had to do a kind of penguin shuffle to achieve the steps he glanced up at elena selfconsciously and grasped the rail firmly shouldnt you be taking the lift tube she asked suddenly watching his uncertain placement of his feet dont you start treating me like a cripple too he glanced down the railings gleaming helix they told me to stay off my legs didnt specify how he hopped up on the bannister and shot her a wicked grin over his shoulder her face reflected mixed amusement and horror miles you lunatic if you fall off that youll break every bone in your body he slid away from her picking up speed rapidly she cantered down the stairs after him laughing he lost her around the curvature his grin died as he saw what awaited him at the bottom on hell he was going too fast to brake what the watch out he tumbled off the railing at the bottom of the staircase into the frantic clutch of a stocky greyhaired man in officers dress greens they both scrambled to their feet as elena arrived out of breath on the tessellated pavement of the front hall miles could feel the anguished heat in his face and knew it was scarlet the stocky man looked bemused a second officer a tall man with captains tabs on the collar of his uniform leaned on a walking stick and gave a brief surprised laugh miles collected himself coming moreorless to attention good afternoon father he said coolly he gave a little aggressive lift to his chin defying anyone to comment on his unorthodox entrance admiral lord aral vorkosigan prime minister of barrayar in the service of emperor gregor vorbarra formerly lord regent of same straightened his uniform jacket and cleared his throat good afternoon son only his eyes laughed im ahglad to see your injuries were not too serious miles shrugged secretly relieved to be spared more sardonic comments in public the usual excuse me a moment ah good afternoon elena koudelkawhat did you think of those ship cost figures of admiral hessmans i thought they went by awfully fast replied the captain you thought so too eh do you think hes hiding something in them perhaps but what his party budget is the contractor his brotherinlaw or sheer slop peculation or merely inefficiency ill put illyan on the first possibilityi want you on the second put the squeeze on those numbers theyll scream they were screaming today dont believe it i used to do those proposals myself when i was on the general staff i know how much garbage goes into them theyre not really hurting until their voices go up at least two octaves captain koudelka grinned and bowed himself out with a brief nod at miles and elena and a very sketchy salute miles and his father were left looking at each other neither wishing to be the first to open the issue that lay between them as if by mutual agreement lord vorkosigan said only well am i late for lunch just been called i think sir let us go in then he made a little abortive lift of his arm as if to offer his injured son assistance but then clasped his hands tactfully behind his back they walked on side by side slowly miles lay propped up in bed still dressed for the day with his legs stretched out correctly before him he eyed them distastefully rebellious provincesmutinous troopsquisling saboteurs he should get up one more time and wash and change to night clothes but the effort required seemed heroic no hero he he was reminded of that fellow grandfather told about who accidentally shot his own horse out from under himself in the cavalry chargecalled for another and then did it again so his own words it appeared had set sergeant bothari thinking in just the channel miles least desired elenas image turned before his inner eyethe delicate aquiline profile great dark eyescool length of leg warm flare of hipshe looked he thought like a countess in a drama if only he could cast her in the role in reality but such a count an aristocrat in a play to be sure the deformed were invariably cast as plotting villains in barrayaran drama if he couldnt be a soldier perhaps he had a future as a villain ill carry the wench off he muttered experimentally dropping his voice half an octave and lock her in my dungeon his voice returned to its normal pitch with a regretful sigh except i havent got a dungeon it would have to be the closet grandfathers right we are a reduced generation anyway theyd just rent a hero to rescue her some tall piece of meatkostolitz maybe and you know how those fights always come out he slid to his feet and pantomimed across the room kostolitzs swords againstsaymiless morningstar a morningstar was a proper villainous weapon it gave the concept of ones personal space some real authority stabbed he died in elenas arms as she swooned in griefno shed be in kostolitzs arms celebrating miless eye fell on an antique mirror clasped in a carven stand capering dwarf he growled he had a sudden urge to smash it with his naked fists shattered glass and blood flyingbut the sound would bring the hall guard and packs of relatives and demands for explanation he jerked the mirror around to face the wall instead and flopped onto the bed lying back he gave the problem more serious attention he tried to imagine himself rightly and properly asking his father to be his gobetween to sergeant bothari horrific he sighed and writhed vainly for a more comfortable position only seventeen too young to marry even by barrayaran standards and quite unemployed nowit would be years probably before he would be in a sufficiently independent position to offer for elena against parental backing surely she would be snapped up long before then and elena herself what was in it for her what pleasure to be climbed all over by an ugly twisted shrimpto be stared at in public in a world where native custom and imported medicine combined ruthlessly to eliminate even the mildest physical deformitydoubly stared at because of their ludicrous contrast could the dubious privileges of an obsolete rank more drained of meaning with each passing year make up for that a rank totally without meaning off barrayar he knewin eighteen years of residence here his own mother had never come to regard the vor system as anything other than a planetwide mass hallucination there came a double rap upon his door authoritatively firm courteously brief miles smiled ironically sighed and sat up come in father lord vorkosigan poked his head around the carved doorframe still dressed its late you should be getting some rest somewhat inconsistently he let himself in and pulled up a desk chair turning it around and sitting astride it arms comfortably athwart its back he was still dressed himself miles noted in the dress greens he wore every working day now that he was but prime minister and not regent and therefore titular commander of the armed forces miles wondered if the old admirals uniform was still correct or had it simply grown to him i ah his father began and paused he cleared his throat delicately i was wondering what your thinking was now for your next step your alternate plans miless lips tightened and he shrugged there never were any alternate plans id planned to succeed more fool i lord vorkosigan tilted his head in negation if its any consolation you were very close i talked to the selection board commander today do youwant to know your score on the writtens i thought they never released those just an alphabetical list in or out lord vorkosigan spread his hand offering miles shook his head let it go it doesnt matter it was hopeless from the beginning i was just too stiffnecked to admit it not so we all knew it would be difficult but i would never have let you put that much effort on something i thought impossible i must have inherited the neck from you they exchanged a brief ironic nod well you couldnt have had it from your mother lord vorkosigan admitted shes notdisappointed is she hardly you know her lack of enthusiasm for the military hired killers she called us once almost the first thing she ever said to me he looked fondly reminiscent miles grinned in spite of himself she really said that to you lord vorkosigan grinned back oh yes but she married me anyway so perhaps it wasnt all that heartfelt he grew more serious its true though if i had any doubts about your potential as an officer miles stiffened inwardly it was perhaps in that area to kill a man it helps if you can first take away his face a neat mental trick handy for a soldier im not sure you have the narrowness of vision required you cant help seeing all around youre like your mother you always have that clear view of the back of your own head never knew you for narrow sir ah but i lost the trick of it thats why i went into politics lord vorkosigan smiled but the smile faded to your cost im afraid the remark triggered a painful memory sir asked miles hesitantly is that why you never made the bid for the imperium that everyone was expecting because your heir was a vague gesture at his body silently implied the forbidden term deformed lord vorkosigans brows drew together his voice dropped suddenly to near a whisper making miles jump who has said so nobody miles replied nervously his father flung himself out of his chair and snapped back and forth across the room never he hissed let anyone say so it is an insult to both our honors i gave my oath to ezar vorbarra on his deathbed to serve his grandsonand i have done so period end of argument miles smiled placatingly i wasnt arguing lord vorkosigan looked around and gave vent to a short chuckle sorry you just hit my jitter trigger not your fault boy he sat back down controlled again you know how i feel about the imperium the witchs christening gift accursed try telling them that though he shook his head surely gregor cant suspect you of ambition youve done more for him than anyone right through vordarians pretendership the third cetagandan war the komarr revolthe wouldnt even be here today lord vorkosigan grimaced gregor is in a rather tender state of mind at the moment just come to full powerand by my oath it is real powerand itching after sixteen years of being governed by what he refers to privately as the old geezers to try its limits i have no wish to set myself up as a target oh come on gregors not so faithless no indeed but he is under a great many new pressures that i can no longer protect he cut himself off with a fistclosing gesture just alternate plans which brings us i hope back to the original question miles rubbed his face tiredly pressing fingertips against his eyes i dont know sir you could said lord vorkosigan neutrally ask gregor for an imperial order what shove me into the service by force by the sort of political favoritism youve stood against all your life miles sighed if i were going to get in that way i should have done it first before failing the tests nowno no but lord vorkosigan went on earnestly you have too much talent and energy to waste on idleness there are other forms of service i wanted to put an idea or two to you just to think on go ahead officer or not you will be count vorkosigan someday he held up a hand as miles opened his mouth to object someday you will inevitably have a place in the government always barring revolution or some other social catastrophe you will represent our ancestral district a district which has frankly been shamefully neglected your grandfathers recent illness isnt the only reason ive been taken up with the press of other work and before that we both pursued military careers tell me about it miles thought wearily the end result is there is a lot of work to be done there now with a bit of legal training a lawyer miles said aghast you want me to be a lawyer thats as bad as being a tailor beg pardon asked lord vorkosigan missing the connection never mind something grandfather said actually i hadnt planned to mention the idea to your grandfather lord vorkosigan cleared his throat but given some ground in government principles i thought you might ah deputize for your grandfather in the district government was never all warfare even in the time of isolation you know sounds like youve been thinking about it for a while miles thought resentfully did you ever really believe i could make the grade father he looked at lord vorkosigan more doubtfully theres not anything youre not telling me is there sir about yourhealth or anything oh no lord vorkosigan reassured him although in my line of work you never know from one day to the next i wonder thought miles warily what else is going on between gregor and my father i have a queasy feeling im getting about ten percent of the real story lord vorkosigan blew out his breath and smiled well im keeping you from your rest which you need at this point he rose i wasnt sleepy sir do you want me to get you anything to help lord vorkosigan offered cautiously tender no i have some painkillers they gave me at the infirmary two of those and ill be swimming in slow motion miles made flippers of his hands and rolled his eyes back lord vorkosigan nodded and withdrew miles lay back and tried to recapture elena in his mind but the cold breath of political reality blown in with his father withered his fantasies like frost out of season he swung to his feet and shuffled to his bathroom for a dose of his slowmotion medicine two down and a swallow of water all of them whispered something from the back of his brain and you could come to a complete stop he banged the nearly full container back onto the shelf his eyes gave back a muted spark from the bathroom mirror grandfather is right the only way to go down is fighting he returned to bed to relive his moment of error on the wall in an endless loop until sleep relieved him of himself chapter three miles was awakened in a dim grey light by a servant apprehensively touching his shoulder lord vorkosigan lord vorkosigan the man murmured miles peered through slitted eyes feeling thick with sleep as though moving under water what hourand why was the idiot miscalling him by his fathers title new was he no cold consciousness washed over him and his stomach knotted as the full significance of the mans words penetrated he sat up head swimming heart sinking what theyyour father requests you dress and join him downstairs immediately the mans tumbling tongue confirmed his fear it was the hour before dawn yellow lamps made small warm pools within the library as miles entered the windows were bluegrey cold translucent rectangles balanced on the cusp of night neither transmitting light from without nor reflecting it from within his father stood halfdressed in uniform trousers shirt and slippers talking in a grave undertone with two men their personal physician and an aide in the uniform of the imperial residence his fathercount vorkosiganlooked up to meet his eyes grandfather sir asked miles softly the new count nodded very quietly in his sleep about two hours ago he felt no pain i think his fathers voice was low and clear without tremor but his face seemed more lined than usual almost furrowed set expressionless the determined commander situation under control only his eyes and only now and then through a passing trick of angle held the look of some stricken and bewildered child the eyes frightened miles far more than the stern mouth miless own vision blurred and he brushed the foolish water from his eyes with the back of his hand in a brusque angry swipe god damn it he choked numbly he had never felt smaller his father focused on him uncertainly i he began hes been hanging by a thread for months you know that and i cut that thread yesterday miles thought miserably im sorry but he said only yes sir the funeral for the old hero was nearly a state occasion three days of panoply and pantomime thought miles wearily whats it all for proper clothing was produced hastily in somber correct black vorkosigan house became a chaotic stagingarea for forays into public setpieces the lyinginstate at vorhartung castle where the council of counts met the eulogies the procession which was nearly a parade thanks to the loan from gregor vorbarra of a military band in dress uniform and a contingent of his purely decorative horse cavalry the interment miles had thought his grandfather was the last of his generation not quite it seemed for the damndest set of ancient creaking martinets and their crones in black like flapping crows came creeping from whatever woodwork theyd been lurking in miles grimly polite endured their shocked and pitying stares when introduced as piotr vorkosigans grandson and their interminable reminiscences about people hed never heard of whod died before he was born and of whomhe sincerely hopedhe would never hear again even after the last spadeful of dirt had been packed down it was not ended vorkosigan house was invaded that afternoon and evening by hordes ofyou couldnt call them wellwishers exactly he reflectedbut friends acquaintances military men public men their wives the courteous the curious and more relatives than he cared to think about count and countess vorkosigan were nailed downstairs social duty was always yoked for his father to political duty and so was doubly inescapable but when is cousin ivan vorpatril arrived in tow of his mother lady vorpatril miles determined to escape to the only bolthole left not occupied by enemy forces ivan had passed his candidacy exams miles had heard he didnt think he could tolerate the details he plucked a couple of gaudy blooms from a funeral floral display in passing and fled by lift tube to the top floor and refuge miles knocked on the carved wood door whos there elenas voice floated through faintly he tried the enamel patterned knob found it unlocked and snaked a hand waving the flowers around the door her voice added oh come in miles he bobbed around the door lean in black and grinned tentatively she was sitting in an antique chair by her window how did you know it was me miles asked well it was either you ornobody brings me flowers on their knees her eye lingered a moment on the doorknob unconsciously revealing the height scale used for her deduction miles promptly dropped to his knees and quickmarched across the rug to present his offering with a flourish voila he cried surprising a laugh from her his legs protested this abuse by going into painful cramping spasms ah he cleared his throat and added in a much smaller voice do you suppose you could help me up these damn gravcrutches oh dear elena assisted him on to her narrow bed made him put his legs out straight and returned to her chair miles looked around the tiny bedroom is this closet the best we can do for you i like it i like the window on the street she assured him its bigger than my fathers room here she tested the flowers scent a musty green odor miles immediately regretted not sorting through to find some of the more perfumy kind she looked up at him in sudden suspicion miles where did you get these he flushed faintly guilty borrowed em from grandfather believe me theyll never be missed its a jungle down there she shook her head helplessly youre incorrigible but she smiled you dont mind he asked anxiously i thought youd get more enjoyment from them than he would at this point just so nobody thinks i filched them myself refer them to me he offered grandly he jerked up his chin she was gazing into the flowers delicate structure more somberly now what are you thinking sad thoughts honestly my face might as well be a window not at all your face is more likelike water all reflections and shifting lightsi never know whats lurking in the depths he dropped his voice at the end to indicate the mystery of the depths elena smiled derisively then sighed seriously i was just thinkingive never put flowers on my mothers grave he brightened at the prospect of a project do you want to we could slip out the backload up a cart or twonobodyd notice certainly not she said indignantly this is quite bad enough of you she turned the flowers in the light from the window silvered from the chill autumn cloudiness anyway i dont know where it is oh how strange as fixated as the sergeant is on your mother id have thought hed be just the pilgrimmage type maybe he doesnt like to think about her death though youre right about that i asked him about it once to go and see where shes buried and so on and it was like talking to a wall you know how he can be yes very like a wall particularly when it falls on someone a theorizing gleam lit miless eye maybe its guilt maybe she was one of those rare women who die in childbirthshe did die about the time you were born didnt she he said it was a flyer accident oh but another time he said shed drowned hm the gleam deepened to a persistent smoulder if shed ditched her flyer in a river or something they could both be true or if he ditched it elena shivered miles caught it and castigated himself inwardly for being an insensitive clod oh sorry didnt mean toim in a gruesome mood today im afraid he apologized its all this blasted black he flapped his elbows in imitation of a carrion bird he lapsed into introspective quiet for a time meditating on the ceremonies of death elena fell in with his silence gazing wistfully down on the darkly glittering throng of barrayars upper class passing in and out four floors below her window we could find out he said suddenly startling her from her reverie what where your mothers buried and we wouldnt even have to ask anyone how he grinned swinging to his feet im not going to say youd go all wobbly on me like that time we went spelunking down at vorkosigan surleau and found the old guerilla weapons cache youll never get another chance in your life to drive one of those old tanks you know she made doubtful noises apparently her memory of the incident was vivid and awful even though she had avoided being caught in the landslide but she followed they entered the darkened downstairs library cautiously miles paused to brace the duty guard outside it with an offcolor smirk lowering his voice confidentially suppose you could sort of rattle the door if anyone comes corporal wed ahrather not have any surprise interruptions the duty guards return smirk was knowing of course lord milord vorkosigan he eyed elena with fresh speculation one eyebrow quirking miles elena whispered furiously as the door swung closed cutting off the steady murmur of voices clink of glass and silver soft tread of feet from piotr vorkosigans wake that penetrated from nearby rooms do you realize what hes going to think evil to him who evil thinks he flung gaily over his shoulder just so he doesnt think of this he palmed the lock to the comconsole with its doublescrambled links to military headquarters and the imperial residence that sat incongruously before the carved marble fireplace elenas mouth fell open in astonishment as its force screen parted a few passes of his hands brought the holovid plates to life i thought that was top security she gasped tis but captain koudelka was giving me a little tutoring on the side before when i was a bitter smile a jerk of the wrist studying he used to tap into the battle computersthe real ones at headquartersand run simulations for me i thought he might not have remembered to unkey me he was halfabsorbed entering a tattoo of complex directions what are you doing she asked nervously entering captain koudelkas access code to get military records ye gods miles dont worry about it he patted her hand were in here necking remember nobodys likely to come in here tonight but captain koudelka and he wont mind that we cant miss thought id start with your fathers service record ah here the holovid plate threw up a flat screen and began displaying written records theres bound to be something about your mother on it that we can use to unravel he paused sitting back puzzled the mystery he flipped through several screens what elena agitated thought id peek into near the time you were borni thought hed quit the service just before right right did he ever say he was involuntarily medically discharged no she peered over his shoulder thats funny it doesnt say why tell you whats funnier his entire record for most of the preceding year is sealed your time and the code on itvery hot i cant crack it without triggering a doublecheck which would endyes thats captain illyans personal mark i definitely dont want to talk to him he quailed at the thought of accidentally summoning the attention of barrayars chief of imperial security definitely croaked elena staring at him in fascination well lets do some timetravelling miles pattered on back back your father doesnt seem to have gotten along too well with this commodore vorrutyer fellow elena perked with interest was that the same as the admiral vorrutyer who was killed at escobar um yes ges vorrutyer hm bothari had been the commodores batman it appeared for several years miles was surprised hed had the vague impression that bothari had served under his father as a ground combat soldier since the beginning of time botharis service with vorrutyer ended in a constellation of reprimands black marks discipline parades and sealed medical reports miles conscious of elena staring over his shoulder whipped past these quickly oddly inconsistent some bizarrely petty were marked with ferocious punishments others astonishingly serioushad bothari really held an engineering tech at plasmaarcpoint in a lavatory for sixteen hours and for gods sake whydisappeared into the medical reports and resulted in no discipline at all going farther into the past the record steadied a lot of combat in his twenties commendations citations for being wounded more commendations excellent marks in basic training recruiting records recruiting was a lot simpler in those days miles said enviously oh are my grandparents on that asked elena eagerly he never talks about them either i gather his mother died when he was rather young hes never even told me her name marusia miles sounded out peering fuzzy photostat thats pretty said elena sounding pleased and his fathers whoops thought miles the recopied photostat was not so fuzzy that he couldnt make out the blunt uncapitalized unknown printed in some forgotten clerks hand miles swallowed realizing at last why a certain insulting epithet seemed to get under botharis skin when all others were allowed to roll off patiently disdained maybe i can make it out elena offered misinterpreting his delay the screen went blank at a twitch of his hand konstantine miles declared firmly without hesitation same as his but both his parents were dead by the time he joined the service konstantine bothari junior elena mused hm miles stared into the blank screen and suppressed an urge to scream with frustration another damned artificial social wedge driven between himself and elena a father who was a bastard was about as far from being right and proper for a young barrayaran virgin as anything he could think of and it was obviously no secrethis father must know and god knew how many hundreds of other people besides equally obviously elena did not she was rightfully proud of her father his elite service his position of high trust miles knew how painfully hard she struggled sometimes for some expression of approval from the old stone carving how strange to realize that pain might cut both waysdid bothari then dread the loss of that scarcelyacknowledged admiration well the sergeants semisecret was safe with him he flipped fastforward through the years of botharis life still no sign of your mother he said to elena she must be under that seal damn and i thought this was going to be easy he stared thoughtfully into space try hospital records deaths birthsyou sure you were born here in vorbarr sultana as far as i know several minutes of tedious search produced records on a fair number of botharis none related to the sergeant or elena in any way ah ha miles broke out suddenly i know what i havent tried imp mil they dont have an obstetrics department elena said doubtfully but if an accidentsoldiers wife and all thatmaybe she was rushed to the nearest facility and the imperial military hospital was it he crooned over the machine searching searching huh did you find me she asked excitedly noi found me he flipped over screen after screen of documentation what a scramble it must have been making military research clean up after its own product lucky for me theyd imported those uterine replicatorsyes there they arethey could never have tried some of those treatments in vivo theyd have killed mother theres good old dr vaagenah ha so he was in military research before makes sensei guess he was their poison expert i wish id known more about this when i was a kid i could have agitated for two birthdays one when mother had the caesarian and one when they finally popped me out of the replicator which did they choose caesarian day im glad makes me only six months younger than you are otherwise youd be nearly a year olderand ive been warned about older women this babble won a smile at last and he relaxed a little he paused staring at the screen with slitted eyes then entered another search query thats weird he muttered what a secret military medical research projectwith my father as project director no less i never knew he was in research too said elena sounding enormously impressed he sure got around thats whats curious he was a staff tactician never had anything to do with research as far as i know a bynowfamiliar code appeared at his next inquiry blast another seal ask a simple question get a simple brick wall theres dr vaagen handinrubberglove with father vaagen must have been doing the actual work then that explains that i want under that seal damn it he whistled a soundless tune staring into space fingers drumming elena began to look dampened youre getting that mulish look she observed nervously maybe we should just let it go it doesnt really matter by now illyans marks not on this one it might be enough to elena bit her lip look miles its not really but he was already launched what are you doing trying one of fathers old access codes im pretty sure of it all but a few digits elena gulped jackpot miles cried softly as the screen began disgorging data at last he read avidly so thats where those uterine replicators came from they brought them back from escobar after the invasion failed the spoils of war by god seventeen of them loaded and working they must have seemed like really high tech in their day i wonder if we looted them elena paled milesthey werent doing human experiments or or anything like that were they surely your father wouldnt have countenanced i dont know dr vaagen can be pretty um onetrack about his research relief eased his voice oh i see what was going on look here the holoscreen began scrolling yet another file in midair he waved his fingers through it they were all sent to the imperial service orphanage they must have been some children of our men killed at escobar elenas voice tensed children of men killed at escobar but where are their mothers they stared at each other but weve never had any women in the service except for a few civilian medtechs began miles elenas long fingers closed urgently on his shoulder look at the dates he scrolled the file again miles she hissed yes i see it he stopped the screen female infant released to the custody of admiral aral vorkosigan not sent to the orphanage with the rest the datemiles thats my birthday he unpeeled her fingers yes i know dont crush my collarbone please could it be me is it me her face tightened with hope and dismay iits all numbers you see he said cautiously but theres plenty of medical identificationfootprints retinal bloodtypestick your foot over here elena hopped about removing shoes and hose miles helped her place her right foot over the holovid plate he restrained himself with a twitching effort from running a hand up that incredible silken length of thigh blooming from her rumpled skirts skin like an orchid petal he bit his lips pain pain would help him to focus damn tight trousers anyway he hoped she wouldnt notice setting up the optical laser check helped his focus rather better a flickering red light played over her sole for a few seconds he set the machine to comparing whorls and ridges allowing for the change from infant to adultmy god elena it is you he preened if he couldnt be a soldier perhaps he had a future as a detective elenas dark gaze transfixed him but what does it mean her face congealed suddenly dont i havewas iam i some kind of clone or manufactured she blinked suddenly liquid eyes and her voice trembled i dont have a mother no mother and it was all just the triumph of his successful identification seeped out of him at her distress clod now hed turned her dream mother into a nightmareno it was her own flying imagination that was doing that uh uhno certainly not what an idea youre obviously your fathers daughterno insult intendedit just means your mother was killed at escobar instead of here and furthermore he sprang up to declaim dramatically this makes you my longlost sister huh said elena bewildered sure oranyway theres a th chance that we came out of the same replicator he spun about her conjuring farce against her terrors my lth twin sister it must be act v take heart this means youre bound to marry the prince in the next scene she laughed through her tears the door rattled ominously the corporal outside declaimed with unnecessary volume good evening sir shoes my shoes give me back my stockings hissed elena miles thrust them at her killed the comconsole and sealed it with one frantic fluid motion he catapulted onto the sofa grabbed elena about the waist and carrying her down with him she giggled and swore at him struggling with her second shoe one tear was still making a glistening track down her cheek he slipped a hand up into her shining hair and bent her face toward his we better make this look good i dont want to arouse captain koudelkas suspicions he hesitated his grin fading into seriousness her lips melted onto his the lights flicked on they sprang apart he peered up over her shoulder and forgot for a moment how to exhale captain koudelka sergeant bothari and count vorkosigan captain koudelka looked suffused a slight upward curl escaping from one corner of his mouth as it from enormous inward pressure he glanced sideways at his companions and tamped it out the sergeants craggy face was icy the count was darkening rapidly miles finally found something to do with all the air hed taken in all right he said in a firm didactic tone now after grant me this boon on the next line you say with all my heart and much it joys me too to see you are become so penitent he glanced up most impenitently at his father good evening sir are we taking up your space we can go practice elsewhere yes lets elena squeaked picking up her cue with alacrity she produced a rather inane smile for the three adults as miles towed her safely past captain koudelka returned the smile with all his heart the count somehow managed to smile at her and frown menacingly at miles at the same time the sergeants frown was democratically universal the duty guards smirk broadened to a muffled snicker as they fled down the hall cant miss eh elena snarled out of the corner of her mouth at miles as they rose up the lift tube he executed a pirouette in midair shamelessly a strategic withdrawal in good order what more can you ask for being outgunned outnumbered and outranked we were just practicing that old play very cultural who could possibly object i think im a genius i think youre an idiot she said fiercely my other stocking is hanging over the back of your shoulder oh he twisted his neck for a look and plucked off the filmy clinging garment he held it out to her with a sickly apologetic smile i guess that didnt look too good she glared at him and snatched it back and now im going to get lectured athe treats every male that comes near me like a potential rapist anywayhell probably forbid me to speak to you too now or send me back to the country forever her eyes were swimming for their lives they reached the door and on top of that heshes lied to me about my mother she fled into her bedroom slamming the door so hard that she came close to taking off a few fingers from the hand miles was raising in protest he leaned against the door and called through the heavy carved wood anxiously you dont know that theres undoubtedly some perfectly logical explanationill get it figured out go away her muffled wail came back he shuffled uncertainly around the hall for a few more minutes hoping for a second chance but the door remained uncompromisingly blank and silent after a time he became conscious of the stiff figure of the floor duty guard at the end of the corridor the man was politely not looking at him the prime ministers security detail was after all among the most discreet as well as the most alert available miles swore under his breath and shuffled back to the lift tube chapter four miles ran into his mother in the back passage downstairs have you seen your father lately heart countess vorkosigan asked him yes unfortunately he went into the library with captain koudelka and the sergeant sneaking off for a drink she analyzed wryly with his old troopers well i cant blame him hes so tired its been a ghastly day and i know he hasnt gotten enough sleep she looked him over penetratingly how have you been sleeping miles shrugged all right mm id better go catch him before he has more than oneethanol has an unfortunate tendency to make him blunt and that eggsucker count vordrozda just arrived in company with admiral hessman hell have trouble ahead if those two are getting in bed together i shouldnt think the far right could muster that much support with all the old soldiers solidly behind father oh vordrozdas not a rightist at heart hes just personally ambitious and hell ride any pony thats going his way hes been oozing around gregor for months anger sparked in her grey eyes flattery and innuendo oblique criticisms and these nasty little barbs stuck in all the boys self doubtsive watched him at work i dont like him she said positively miles grinned i never would have guessed but surely you dont have to worry about gregor his mothers habit of referring to the emperor as if he were her rather backward adopted child always tickled him in a sense it was true as the former regent had been gregors personal as well as political guardian during his minority she grimaced vordrozdas not the only one who wouldnt hesitate to corrupt the boy in any area he could sink his claws intomoral political what you willif he thought it would advance himself one centimeter and damn the long range good of barrayaror of gregor for that matter miles recognized this instantly as a quote from his mothers sole political oracle his father i dont know why these people cant write a constitution oral lawwhat a way to try and run an interstellar power this was homegrown opinion pure betan fathers been in power so long said miles equably i think it would take a gravity torpedo blast to shift him out of office thats been tried remarked countess vorkosigan growing abstracted i wish hed get serious about retiring weve been lucky so far her eye fell on him wistfully mostly shes tired too miles thought the politicking never stops she added staring at the floor not even for his fathers funeral she brightened wickedly nor do his relations if you see him before i do tell him lady vorpatrils looking for him thatll make his dayno better not wed never be able to find him then miles raised his brows what does aunt vorpatril want him to do for her now well ever since lord vorpatril died shes been expecting him to stand in loco parentis to that idiot ivan which is fine up to a point but she nailed me a while ago when she couldnt find aralseems she wants aral to stand the boy up in a corner somewhere and brace him forerswiving the servant girls which ought to embarrass them both thoroughly ive never understood why these people wont clip their kids tubes and turn them loose at age twelve to work out their own damnation like sensible folk you may as well try to stop a sandstorm with a windsock she went off toward the library muttering her favorite swearword under her breath barrayarans wet darkness had fallen outside turning the windows into dim mirrors of the subdued and mannered revelry within vorkosigan house miles stared into his own reflection in passing dark hair grey eyes pale shadowed face features too sharp and strongly marked to satisfy aesthetics and an idiot to boot the hour reminded him of dinner probably cancelled due to the press of events he determined to forage among the canapes and collect enough to sustain a strategic retreat back to his bedroom for the rest of the evening he peered around a hall arch to be sure none of the dreaded geriatric set were nearby the room appeared to contain only middleaged people he didnt know he nipped over to a table and began stuffing food into a fine fabric napkin stay away from those purple things a familiar affable voice warned in a whisper i think theyre some kind of seaweed is your mother on a nutrition kick again miles looked up into the open annoyingly handsome face of his second cousin ivan vorpatril ivan too held a napkin filled close to capacity his eyes looked slightly hunted a peculiar bulge interrupted the smooth lines of his brandnew cadets uniform jacket miles nodded toward the bulge and whispered in astonishment are they letting you carry a weapon already hell no ivan flicked the jacket open after a conspiratorial glance around probably for lady vorpatril its a bottle of your fathers wine got it from one of the servants before hed poured it into those ittybitty glasses sayany chance of you being my native guide to some outoftheway corner of this mausoleum the duty guards dont let you wander around by yourself upstairs the wine is good the food is good except for those purple things but my god the company at this party miles nodded agreement in principle even though he was inclined to include ivan himself in the category of my god the company all right you pick up another bottle of wine that should be enough to anesthetize him to tolerance and ill let you hide out in my bedroom thats where i was going anyway meet you by the lift tube miles stretched out his legs on his bed with a sigh as ivan pooled their picnic and opened the first bottle of wine ivan emptied a generous third of the bottle into each of the two bathroom tumblers and handed one to his crippled cousin i saw old bothari carrying you off the other day ivan nodded toward the injured legs and took a refreshing gulp grandfather miles thought would have had a fit to see that particular vintage treated so cavalierly he took a more respectful sip himself by way of libation to the old mans ghost even though grandfathers tart assertion that miles couldnt tell a good vintage from last tuesdays washwater was not far off the mark too bad ivan went on cheerfully youre really the lucky one though oh muttered miles closing his teeth on a canape hell yes training starts tomorrow yknow so ive heard ive got to report to my dormitory by midnight at the latest thought i was going to spend my last night as a free man partying but instead i got stuck here mother yknow but tomorrow we take our preliminary oaths to the emperor and by god if ill let her treat me like a boy after that he paused to consume a small stuffed sandwich think of me out running around in the rain at dawn tomorrow while youre tucked away all cozy in here oh i will miles took another sip and another only two breaks in three years ivan rambled on between bites i might as well be a condemned prisoner no wonder they call it service servitude is more like it another gulp to wash down a meatstuffed pastry but your time is all your ownyou can do whatever you want with it every minute agreed miles blandly neither the emperor nor anyone else demanded his service he couldnt sell itcouldnt give it away ivan blessedly fell silent for a few minutes refueling after a time he said hesitantly no chance of your father coming up here is there miles jerked his chin up what youre not afraid of him are you ivan snorted the man turns entire general staffs to pudding for gods sake im just the emperors rawest recruit doesnt he terrify you miles considered the question seriously not exactly no not in the way you mean ivan rolled his eyes heavenward in disbelief actually added miles thinking back to the recent scene in the library if youre trying to duck him this might not be the best place tonight oh ivan swirled his wine in the bottom of his cup ive always had the feeling he doesnt like me he added glumly oh he doesnt mind you said miles taking pity at least as you appear on his horizon at all although i think i was fourteen before i found out that ivan wasnt your middle name miles cut himself off thatidiot ivan was beginning a lifetime of imperial service tomorrow luckymiles was emphatically not he took another gulp of wine and longed for sleep they finished the canapes and ivan emptied the first bottle and opened the second there came an authoritative double knock on the door ivan sprang to his feet oh hell thats not him is it a junior officer said miles is required to stand and salute when a senior officer enters not hide under the bed i wasnt thinking of hiding under the bed said ivan stung just in the bathroom dont bother i guarantee therell be so much covering fire youll be able to retreat totally unnoticed miles raised his voice come it was indeed count vorkosigan he pinned his son with eyes cold and grey as a glacier on a sunless day and began without preamble miles what did you do to make that girl cr he broke off as his gaze passed over ivan standing at attention like a man stuffed count vorkosigans voice returned to a more normal growl oh hell i was hoping to avoid tripping over you tonight figured youd be getting safely drunk in a corner on my wine ivan saluted nervously sir uncle aral did um did my mother speak with you sir yes count vorkosigan sighed ivan paled miles realized ivan did not see the amusement in the hooded set of his fathers eyelids miles ran a finger pensively around the lip of the empty wine bottle ivan has been commiserating me upon my injuries sir ivan nodded confirmation i see said count vorkosigan drylyand miles felt he really did the coldness sublimated altogether count vorkosigan sighed again and addressed ivan in a tone of gentle rhetorical complaint going on fifty years of military and political service and what am i a boogeyman used to frighten boys into good behaviorlike the baba yaga who only eats the bad little children he spread his arms and added sardonically boo consider yourself chastised and take yourself off go boy yes sir ivan saluted again looking decidedly relieved and stop saluting me count vorkosigan added more sharply youre not an officer yet he seemed to notice ivans uniform for the first time as a matter of fact yes sir no sir ivan began to salute again stopped himself looked confused and fled count vorkosigans lips twitched and i never thought id be grateful to ivan miles mused you were saying sir he prompted it took count vorkosigan a moment to collect his thoughts after the diversion provided by his young relative he opened again more quietly why was elena crying son you werent ah harassing her were you no sir i know what it looked like but it wasnt ill give you my word if you like not necessary count vorkosigan pulled up a chair i trust you were not emulating that idiot ivan but ahyour mothers betan sexual philosophy has its placeon beta colony perhaps here too someday but i should like to emphasize that elena bothari is not a suitable test case why not said miles suddenly count vorkosigan raised his eyebrows i mean miles explained quickly why should she be soso constrained she gets duennad to death she could be anything shes bright and shes shes goodlooking and she could break me in halfwhy shouldnt she get a better education for instance the sergeant isnt planning any higher education for her at all everything hes saved is for dowry and he never lets her go anyplace shed get more out of travelhell shed appreciate it a thousand times more than any other girl i know he paused a little breathless count vorkosigan pursed his lips and ran his hand thoughtfully across the chair back this is all very true but elenameans enormously more to the sergeant than i think you are aware she is a symbol to him of everything he imagines im not sure how to put this she is an important source of order in his life i owe it to him to protect that order yes yes right and proper i know said miles impatiently but you cant owe everything to him and nothing to her count vorkosigan looked disturbed and began again i owe him my life miles and your mothers in a very real sense everything ive been and done for barrayar in the last eighteen years is owed to him and i owe him your life twice over since then and so my sanitywhat there is of it as your mother would say if he chooses to call in that debt theres no bottom to it he rubbed his lips introspectively alsoit wont hurt to emphasize this anywayid much prefer to avoid any kind of scandal in my household at the moment my adversaries are always groping for a handle on me some lever to move me i beg you will not let yourself become one and what the hell is going on in the government this week miles wondered anew not that anybodys likely to tell me lord miles naismith vorkosigan occupation security risk hobbies falling off walls disappointing sick old men to death making girls cry he longed to patch things up with elena at least but the only thing he could think of that might put her imaginationgenerated terrors to rest would be actually finding that blasted grave and as near as he could figure it had to be on escobar mixed in with those of the six or seven thousand war dead left behind so long ago between opening his mouth and speaking the plan possessed him the result was that he forgot what hed been about to say and sat with his mouth open a moment count vorkosigan raised his eyebrows in courteous inquiry what miles finally said instead was has anyone heard from grandmother naismith lately count vorkosigans eyes narrowed curious that you should mention her your mother has spoken of her quite frequently in the last few days makes sense under the circumstances although grandmothers such a healthy old birdall betans expect to live to be i guess they think its one of their civil rights miless betan grandmother seven wormhole jumps and three weeks travel time away by the most direct routevia escobar a carefully chosen commercial passenger liner might well include a layover at escobar time for a little tourismtime for a little research it could be done subtly enough even with bothari hanging over his shoulder what could be more natural than for a boy interested in military history to make a pilgrimage to the cemeteries of his emperors soldiers maybe even burn a death offering sir he began do you suppose i could and son count vorkosigan began at the same moment how would you like to deputize for your mother i beg your pardon and go ahead sir i was about to say continued the count that this might be a very opportune time for you to visit your grandmother naismith again its been what almost two years since you were to beta colony and while betans may expect to live to be well you never know miles untangled his tongue and managed not to lurch what a wonderful idea uhcould i take elena there went the eyebrows again what miles swung to his feet and shuffled back and forth across the room unable to contain his outpouring of schemes in stillness give elena a trip offplanet my god hed be a hero in her eyes a sheer two meters tall like vorthalia the bold yes surewhy not bothari will be with me anywaywho could be a more right and proper chaperone than her own father who could object bothari said count vorkosigan bluntly i cant imagine him warming to the thought of exposing elena to beta colony after all hes seen it and coming from you ah just at the moment im not at all sure hed perceive it as a proper invitation mm shuffle turn shuffle flash then i wont invite her ah count vorkosigan relaxed wise im sure ill have mother invite her lets see him object to that count vorkosigan emitted a surprised laugh underhanded boy but his tone was approving miless heart lifted this trip idea was really hers wasnt it sir miles said wellyes count vorkosigan admitted but in fact i was glad she suggested it it wouldease my mind to have you safe on beta colony for the next few months he rose you must excuse me duty calls i have to go feel up that rampant creeper vordrozda for the greater glory of the empire his expression of distaste spoke volumes frankly id rather be getting drunk in a corner with that idiot ivanor talking to you his fathers eyes were warm upon him your work comes first of course sir i understand that count vorkosigan paused and gave him a peculiar look then you understand nothing my work has been a blight on you from the very beginning im sorry sorry it made such a mess for you mess of you thought miles say what you really mean damn it i never meant it to be so a nod and he withdrew apologizing to me again thought miles miserably for me he keeps telling me im all rightand then apologizing inconsistent father he shuffled back and forth across the room again and his pain burst into speech he flung his words against the deaf door ill make you take back that apology i am all right damn it ill make you see it ill stuff you so full of pride in me therell be no room left for your precious guilt i swear by my word as vorkosigan i swear it father his voice fell to a whisper grandfather somehow i dont know how he took another turn around his chamber collapsing back into himself cold and desperately sleepy a mess of crumbs an empty wine bottle an open full one silence talking to yourself in an empty room again i see he whispered a very bad sign you know his legs hurt he cradled the second bottle and took it with him to lie down chapter five well well well said the sleek betan customs agent in sarcastic simulation of good cheer if it isnt sergeant bothari of barrayar and what did you bring me this time sergeant a few nuclear antipersonnel mines overlooked in your back pocket a maser cannon or two accidentally mixed up with your shaving kit a gravitic imploder slipped somehow into your boot the sergeant answered this sally with something between a growl and a grunt miles grinned and dredged his memory for the agents name good afternoon officer timmons still working the line are you i thought for sure youd be in administration by now the agent gave miles a somewhat more courteous nod of greeting good afternoon lord vorkosigan well civil service you know he sorted through their documents and plugged a data disc into his viewer your stunner permits are in order now if you will please step one at a time through this scanner sergeant bothari frowned at the machine glumly and sniffed disdain miles tried to catch his eye but he was studiously finding something of interest in midair somewhere on the suspicion miles said elena and i first i think elena passed through with a stiff uncertain smile like a person holding still too long for a photograph then continued to look eagerly around even if it was only a rather bleak underground customs entry port it was another planet miles hoped beta colony would make up for the disappointing fizzle of the escobar layover two days of records searches and trudging through neglected military cemeteries in the rain pretending to bothari a passion for historical detail had produced no maternal grave or cenotaph after all elena had seemed more relieved than disappointed by the failure of their covert search you see she had whispered to miles father didnt lie to me you have a hyper imagination the sergeants own bored reaction to the tour clinched the argument miles conceded and yet it was his hyper imagination maybe the less they found the more queasy miles became were they looking in the wrong armys cemetery miless own mother had changed allegiances to return to barrayar with his father maybe botharis romance had not taken so prosperous a turn but if that were so should they even be looking in cemeteries maybe he should be hunting elenas mother in the comm link directory he did not quite dare suggest it he wished he had not been so intimidated by the conspiracy of silence surrounding elenas birth to refrain from pumping countess vorkosigan well when they returned home he would screw up his courage and demand the truth of her and let her wisdom guide him as to how much to pass on to botharis daughter for now miles stepped after elena through the scanner enjoying her air of wonder and looking forward like a magician to pulling beta colony out of a hat for her delight the sergeant stepped through the machine it gave a rude blat agent timmons shook his head and sighed you never give up do you sergeant ah if i may interrupt said miles the lady and i are cleared are we not receiving a nod he retrieved their stunners and his own travel documentation ill show elena around the shuttleport then while you two are discussing your er differences you can bring the luggage when he gets done with it sergeant meet you in the main concourse you will not began bothari well be perfectly all right miles assured him airily he grasped elenas elbow and hustled her off before his bodyguard could marshall further objections elena looked back over her shoulder is my father really trying to smuggle in an illegal weapon weapons i expect so said miles apologetically i dont authorize it and it never works but i guess he feels undressed without deadly force if the betans are as good at spotting everyone elses goods as they are at spotting ours we really dont have anything to worry about he watched her sideways as they entered the main concourse and had the satisfaction of seeing her catch her breath golden light at once brilliant and comfortable spun down from a huge high vault upon a great tropical garden dark with foliage vibrant with flowers and birds murmurous with fountains its like stepping into a giant terrarium she commented i feel like a little horned hopper exactly he agreed the silica zoo maintains it one of their extended habitats they strolled toward an area given over to small shops he steered elena carefully along trying to pick out things she might enjoy and avoid catastrophic culture shock that sexaids shop for example was probably a little too much for her first hour on the planet no matter how attractive the pink when she blushed however they spent a pleasant few minutes in a most extraordinary pet store his good sense barely restrained him from making her an awkward present of a large ruffed tau cetan beaded lizard bright as jewelry that caught her eye it had rather strict dietary requirements and besides miles was not quite sure if the kilo beast could be housebroken they wandered along a balcony overlooking the great garden and he bought them rational ice creams instead they sat on the bench lining the railing to eat everything seems so free here elena said licking her fingers and looking around with shining eyes you dont see soldiers and guards all over the place a womana woman could be anything here depends on what you mean by free said miles they put up with rules wed never tolerate at home you should see everyone fall into place during a power outage drill or a sandstorm alarm they have no margin fori dont know how to put it social failures elena gave him a baffled smile not understanding but everyone arranges their own marriages but did you know you have to have a permit to have a child here the first one is free but after that thats absurd she remarked absently how could they possibly enforce it she evidently felt her question to be rather bold for she took a quick glance around to be sure the sergeant was nowhere near miles echoed her glance permanent contraceptive implants for the women and hermaphrodites you need the permit to get it removed its the custom at pubertya girl gets her implant and her ears pierced and her er um miles discovered he was not immune to pinkness himselfhe went on in a rush her hymen cut all on the same visit to the doctor theres usually a family partysort of a rite of passage thats how you can tell if a girls available the ears he had her entire attention now her hands stole to her earrings and she went not merely pink but red miles are they going to think im well its just thatif anyone bothers you i mean if your father or i arent around dont be afraid to tell them to take themselves off they will they dont mean it as an insult here but i figured id better warn you he gnawed a knuckle eyes crinkling you know if you intend to walk around for the next six weeks with your hands over your ears she replaced her hands hastily in her lap and glowered at him it can get awfully peculiar i know he offered apologetically a scorching memory of just how peculiar disturbed him for a moment he had been fifteen on his yearlong school visit to beta colony and hed found himself for the first time in his life with what looked like unlimited possibilities for sexual intimacy this illusion had crashed and burned very quickly as he found the most fascinating girls already taken the rest seemed about equally divided among good samaritans the kinkycurious hermaphrodites and boys he did not care to be an object of charity and he found himself too barrayaran for the last two categories although betan enough not to mind them for others a short affair with a girl from the kinkycurious category was enough her fascination with the peculiarities of his body made him in the end more selfconscious than the most open revulsion he had experienced on barrayar with its fierce prejudice against deformity anyway after finding his sexual parts disappointingly normal the girl had drifted off the affair had ended for miles in a terrifying black depression that had deepened for weeks culminating at last late one night in the third and most secret time the sergeant had saved his life he had cut bothari twice in their silent struggle for the knife exerting hysterical strength against the sergeants frightened caution of breaking his bones the tall man had finally achieved a grip that held him and held him until he broke down at last weeping his selfhatred into the sergeants bloodied breast until exhaustion finally stilled him the man whod carried him as a child before he first walked at age four then carried him like a child to bed bothari treated his own wounds and never referred to the incident again age fifteen had not been a very good year miles was determined not to repeat it his hand tightened on the balcony railing in a mood of objectless resolve objectless like himself therefore useless he frowned into the black well of this thought and for a moment even beta colonys glitter seemed dull and grey four betans stood nearby arguing in a vociferous undertone miles turned half around to get a better view of the speakers past elenas elbow elena began to speak something about his abstraction he shook his head and held up a hand begging silence she subsided watching him curiously damn it a heavy man in a green sarong was saying i dont care how you do it but i want that lunatic pried out of my ship cant you rush him the woman in the uniform of betan security shook her head look calhoun why should i risk my peoples lives for a ship thats practically scrap anyway its not as if he was holding hostages or something i have a salvage team tied up waiting thats collecting timeandahalf for overtime hes been up there three dayshes got to sleep sometime or take a leak or some goddamn thing argued the civilian if hes as hoppedup crazy as you claim nothing would be more likely to trigger his blowing it than a rush wait him out the security woman turned to a man in the dovegrey and black uniform of one of the larger commercial spacelines silver hair in his sideburns echoed the triple silver circles of his pilots neurological implant on midforehead and temples or talk him out you know him hes a member of your union cant you do anything with him oh no you dont objected the pilot officer youre not shoving this one off on me he doesnt want to talk to me anyway hes made that clear youre on the board this year you ought to have some authority with himthreaten to revoke his pilots certification or something arde mayhew may still be in the brotherhood but hes two years in arrears on his dues his license is on shaky ground already and frankly i think this episode is going to cook it the whole point of this bananarama in the first place is that once the last of the rg ships goes for scrap the pilot officer nodded toward the bulky civilian he isnt going to be a pilot anymore hes been medically rejected for a new implantit wouldnt do him any good even if he had the money and i know damn well he doesnt he tried to borrow rent money from me last week at least he said it was for rent more likely for that swill he drinks did you give it to him asked the woman in the blue uniform of shuttleport administration wellyes replied the pilot officer moodily but i told him it was absolutely the last anyway he frowned at his boots then burst out id rather see him go out in a blaze of glory than die of being beached i know how id feel if i knew id never make a jump again he compressed his lips defensiveaggressive at the shuttleport administration all pilots are crazy muttered the security woman comes from getting their brains pierced so miles eavesdropped shamelessly fascinated the man they were discussing was a fellowfreak it seemed a loser in trouble a wormhole jump pilot with an obsolete coupler system running through his brain soon to be technologically unemployed holed up in his old ship fending off the wrecking crewshow miles wondered a blaze of traffic hazards you mean complained the shuttleport administrator if he makes good on his threats therell be junk pelting all through the inner orbits for days wed have to shut downclean it up she turned to the civilian completing the circle and youd better believe it wont be charged to my department ill see your company gets the bill if i have to take it all the way to jusdep the salvage operator paled then went red your department permitted that hotwired freakhead access to my ship in the first place he snarled he said hed left some personal effects she defended we didnt know he had anything like this in mind miles pictured the man huddled in his dim recess stripped of allies like the last survivor of a hopeless seige his hand clenched unconsciously his ancestor general count selig vorkosigan had raised the famous seige of vorkosigan surleau with no more than a handful of picked retainers and subterfuge it was said elena he whispered fiercely stilling her restlessness follow my lead and say nothing hm she murmured startled ah good miss bothari youre here he said loudly as if he had just arrived he gathered her up and marched up to the group he knew he confused strangers as to his age at first glance his height led them to underestimate it at second his face slightly dark from a tendency to heavy beard growth in spite of close shaving and prematurely set from long intimacy with pain led them to overestimate hed found he could tip the balance either way at will by a simple change of mannerisms he summoned ten generations of warriors to his back and produced his most austere smile good afternoon ladies gentlemen he hailed them four stares greeted him variously nonplussed his urbanity almost crumpled under the onslaught but he held the line i was told one of you could tell me where to find pilot officer arde mayhew who the devil are you growled the salvage operator apparently voicing the thought of them all miles bowed smoothly barely restraining himself from swirling an imaginary cape lord miles vorkosigan of barrayar at your service this is my associate miss bothari i couldnt help overhearingi believe i might be of assistance to you all if you will permit me beside him elena raised puzzled eyebrows at her new if vague official status look kid began the shuttleport administrator miles glanced up from lowered brows shooting her his best imitation general count piotr vorkosigan military glare sir she corrected herself jush uhjust what do you want with pilot officer mayhew miles gave an upward jerk of his chin i have been commissioned to discharge a debt to him selfcommissioned about ten seconds ago somebody owes money to arde asked the salvage operator amazed miles drew himself up looking offended not money he growled as though he never touched the sordid stuff its a debt of honor the shuttleport administrator looked cautiously impressed the pilot officer pleased the security woman looked dubious the salvage operator looked extremely dubious how does that help me he asked bluntly i can talk pilot officer mayhew out of your ship said miles seeing his path opening before him if youll provide me with the means of meeting him face to face elena gulped he quelled her with a narrow sideways flick of a glance the four betans looked one to another as if responsibility could be shuffled off by eye contact finally the pilot officer said well what the hell does anybody have a better idea in the control chair of the personnel shuttle the greyhaired senior pilot officer spokeonce againinto his comconsole arde arde this is van answer me please ive brought up somebody to talk things over with you hes going to come on board all right arde youre not going to do anything foolish now are you silence was his sole reply is he receiving you asked miles his comconsole is whether hes got the volume turned up or is there or awake oror alive is anybodys guess im alive growled a thick voice suddenly from the speaker making them both start there was no video but you wont be van if you try to board my ship you doublecrossing son of a bitch i wont try promised the senior pilot officer just mister uh lord vorkosigan here there was a moody silence if the staticspattered hiss could be so described he doesnt work for that bloodsucker calhoun does he asked the speaker suspiciously he doesnt work for anybody van soothed not for the mental health board nobodys going to get near me with a damn dart gunill blow us all to hell first hes not even betan hes a barrayaran says hes been looking for you another silence then the voice uncertain querulous i dont owe any barrayaransi dont think i dont even know any barrayarans there was an odd feeling of pressure and a gentle click from the exterior of the hull as they came in contact with the old freighter the pilot waved a finger by way of signal at miles and miles made the hatch connections secure ready he called you sure you want to do this whispered the pilot officer miles nodded it had been a minor miracle escaping the protection of bothari he licked his lips and grinned enjoying the exhilaration of weightlessness and fear he trusted elena would prevent any unnecessary alarm planetside miles opened the hatch there was a puff of air as the pressure within the two ships equalized he stared into a pitchdark tunnel got a hand light on the rack there the pilot officer pointed provided miles floated cautiously into the tube the darkness skulked ahead of him hiding in corners and cross corridors and crowding in behind him as he passed he threaded his way toward the navigation and communications room where his quarry was presumed to be lurking the distance was actually shortthe crews quarters were small most of the ship being given over to cargo spacebut the absolute silence gave the journey a subjective stretch zerogee was now having its usual effect on making him regret the last thing hed eaten vanilla he thought i should have had vanilla there was a dim light ahead spilling into the corridor from an open hatch miles cleared his throat loudly as he approached it might be better not to startle the man all things considered pilot officer mayhew he called softly and pulled himself to the door my name is miles vorkosigan and im looking forlooking for what the devil was he looking for oh well wing it im looking for desperate men he finished in style pilot officer mayhew sat strapped in his pilots chair in a mournful huddle clutched in his lap were his pilots headset a halffull liter squeeze bottle of a gurgling liquid of a brilliant and poisonous green and a box hastily connected by a spaghettimass of wiring to a halfgutted control panel and topped by a toggle switch quite as fascinating as the toggle box was a dark slender and by betan law very illegal little needle gun mayhew blinked puffed and redrimmed eyes at the apparition in his doorway and rubbed a handstill holding the lethal needlerover a threeday beard stubble oh yeah he replied vaguely miles was temporarily distracted by the needler how did you ever get that through betan customs he asked in a tone of genuine admiration ive never been able to carry so much as a slingshot past em mayhew stared at the needler in his hand as if hed just discovered it like a wart grown unnoticed bought it at jacksons whole once ive never tried to take it off the ship i suppose theyd take it away from me if i tried they take everything away from you down there he sighed miles eased into the room and arranged himself crosslegged in midair in what he hoped was a nice nonthreatening sort of listening posture how did you ever get into this fix he asked with a nod around that included the ship the situation and mayhews lapfull of objects mayhew shrugged rotten luck ive always had rotten luck that accident with the rg it was the moisture from those busted amphor tubes that soaked those dal bags that swelled and split the bulkhead and started the whole thing the port cargo master didnt even get a slap on the wrist damn it what i did or didnt have to drink wouldnt have made a damn bit of difference he sniffed and drew a sleeve across his flushed face looking alarmingly as if he were about to weep it was a very disturbing thing to see in a man pushing miles estimated forty years of age mayhew took a swig from his bottle instead then with some dim remnant of courtesy offered it to miles miles smiled politely and took it should he grab this chance to dump it out in the interests of sobering mayhew up there were drawbacks to the idea in free fall it would have to be dumped into something else if he were not to spend his visit dodging flying blobs of whateveritwas hard to make it look like an accident while he mulled he sampled it in the interests of scientific inquiry he barely managed not to choke it into free fall atomized thick green herbal sweet as syruphe nearly gagged on the sweetnessperhaps pure ethanol but what was the rest of it it burned down his esophagus making him feel suddenly like an animated display of the digestive system with all the different parts picked out in colored lights respectfully he wiped the mouthpiece on his sleeve and handed the bottle to its owner who tucked it back under his arm thanks miles gasped mayhew nodded so how miles aspirated then cleared his throat to a more normal tone what are you planning to do next what are you demanding demanding said mayhew next i dontim just not going to let that cannibal calhoun murder my ship there isntthere isnt any text he rocked the box with the toggle switch on his lap a miserable madonna have you ever been red he asked suddenly miles had a confused vision of ancient earth political parties no im vor he said not sure if that was the right response but it seemed not to matter mayhew soliliquized on red the color red pure light i was once on the jump to some little hole of a place called hespari ii theres no experience in life like a jump if youve never ridden the lights in your braincolors no mans ever put a name tothere are no words for it better than dreams or nightmaresbetter than a womanbetter than food or drink or sleep or breathand they pay us for it poor deluded suckers with nothing under their skulls but protoplasm he peered blurrily at miles oh sorry nothing personal youre just not a pilot i never took a cargo to hespari again he focused on miles a little more clearly say youre a mess arent you not as much of a mess as you are miles replied frankly nettled mm the pilot agreed he passed his bottle back curious stuff thought miles whatever was in it seemed to be counteracting the usual effect ethanol had on him of putting him to sleep he felt warm and energetic as if it flowed right down to his fingers and toes it was probably how mayhew had kept awake for three days alone in this deserted can so miles went on scornfully you havent got a battle plan you havent asked for a million betan dollars in small unmarked slips or threatened to drop the ship through the roof of the shuttleport or taken hostages oror anything constructive at all youre just sitting up here killing time and your bottle and wasting your opportunities for want of a little resolve or imagination or something mayhew blinked at this unexpected point of view by god van told the truth for once youre not from the mental health board i could take you hostage he offered placatingly swinging the needler toward miles no dont do that said miles hastily i cant explain buttheyd overreact down there its a bad idea oh the needlers aim drifted off but anyway dont you see he tapped his headset attempting to explain what i want they cant give me i want to ride the jumps and i cant not any more only in this ship i gather this ship is going for scrap his despair was flat unexpectedly rational just as soon as i cant stay awake any more thats a useless attitude scoffed miles apply a little logic to the problem at least i mean like this you want to be a jump pilot you can only be a jump pilot for an rg ship this is the last rg ship ergo what you need is this ship so get it be a pilotowner run your own cargos simple see may i have some more of that stuff please one got used to the ghastly taste quite quickly miles found mayhew shook his head clutching his despair and his toggle box to him like a familiar comforting childs toy i tried ive tried everything i thought i had a loan it folded and anyway calhoun outbid me oh miles passed the bottle back feeling deflated he gazed at the pilot to whom he was now floating at right angles well all i know is you cant give up shursurrender besmirches the honor of the vor he began to hum a little a snatch of some halfremembered childhood ballad the seige of silver moon it had a vor lord in it he recalled and a beautiful witchwoman who rode in a magic flying mortar they had pounded their enemies bones in it at the end gimme another drink i want to think if thou wilt swear thyself to me thy leige lord true to thee ill be huh said mayhew miles realized hed been singing aloud albeit softly nothing sorry he floated in silence a few minutes longer thats the trouble with the betan system he said after a time nobody takes personal responsibility for anyone its all these faceless fictional corporate entitiesgovernment by ghosts what you need is a leige lord to take sword in hand and slice through all the red tape just like vorthalia the bold and the thicket of thorns what i need is a drink said mayhew glumly hm oh sorry miles handed the bottle back an idea was forming up in the back of his mind like a nebula just starting to contract a little more mass and it would start to glow a pro to star i have it he cried straightening out suddenly and accidentally giving himself an unwanted spin mayhew flinched nearly firing his needler through the floor he glanced uncertainly at the squeeze bottle no i have it he corrected miles overcame the spin wed better do this from here the first principle of strategynever give up an advantage can i use your comconsole what for i said miles grandly am going to buy this ship and then i shall hire you to pilot it mayhew stared in bewilderment looking from miles to the bottle and back you got that much money mm well i have assets a few minutes work with the comconsole brought the salvage operators face on the screen miles put his proposition succinctly calhouns expression went from disbelief to outrage you call that a compromise he cried at cost and backed byim not a damned real estate broker mr calhoun said miles sweetly may i point out the choice is not between my note and this ship the choice is between my note and a rain of glowing debris if i find out youre in collusion with that never met him before today miles disclaimed whats wrong with the land asked calhoun suspiciously besides being on barrayar i mean its like fertile farm country miles answered not quite directly wooded centimeters of rain a year that ought to fetch a betan barely kilometers from the capital downwind fortunately for the capital and i own it absolutely just inherited it from my grandfather recently go ahead and check it through the barrayaran embassy check the climate plats this rainfallits not all on the same day or something is it of course not replied miles straightening indignantly not easy in free fall ancestral landits been in my family for ten generations you can believe ill make every effort to cover that note before ill let my home ground fall from my hands calhoun rubbed his chin irritably cost plus he suggested ten percent twenty ten or ill let you deal directly with pilot officer mayhew all right groaned calhoun ten percent done it was not quite that easy of course but thanks to the efficiency of the betans planetary information network a transaction that would have taken days on barrayar was completed in less than an hour right from mayhews control room miles was cannily reluctant to give up the tactical bargaining advantage possession of the toggle box gave them and mayhew after his first astonishment had worn off became silent and loathe to leave look kid he spoke suddenly about halfway through the complicated transaction i appreciate what youre trying to do butbut its just too late you understand when i get downside theyre not going to just be laughing this off securityll be waiting at the docking bay with a patrol from the mental health board right beside em theyll slap a stunnet over me so fastyoull see me in a month or two walking around smiling youre always smiling after the mhb gets done he shook his head helplessly its just too late its never too late while youre breathing snapped miles he did the freefall equivalent of pacing the room shoving off from one wall turning in midair and shoving off from the opposite wall a few dozen turns thinking i have an idea he said at last ill wager it would buy time time enough at least to come up with something bettertrouble is since youre not barrayaran youre not going to understand what youre doing and its serious stuff mayhew looked thoroughly baffled huh its like this thump spin turn straighten thump if you were to swear fealty to me as an armsman simple taking me for your liege lordits the most straightforward of our oath relationshipsi might be able to include you under my class iii diplomatic immunity anyway i know i could if you were a barrayaran subject of course youre a betan citizen in any case im pretty sure we could tie up a pack of lawyers and several days trying to figure out which laws take precedence i would be legally obligated for your bed board dress armamenti suppose this ship could be classed as your armamentyour protection in the event of challenge by any other leigemanthat hardly applies here on beta colonyoh theres a passel of stuff about your family anddo you have a family by the way mayhew shook his head that simplifies things thump spin turn straighten thump meanwhile neither security nor the mhb could touch you because legally youd be like a part of my body mayhew blinked that sounds screwy as hell where do i sign how do you register it all you have to do is kneel place your hands between mine and repeat about two sentences it doesnt even need witnesses although its customary to have two mayhew shrugged all right sure kid thump spin turn straighten thump allrightsurekid i thought you wouldnt understand it what ive described is only a tiny part of my half of the bargain your privileges it also includes your obligations and a ream of rights i have over you for instancejust one forinstanceif you were to refuse to carry out an order of mine in the heat of battle i would have the right to strike off your head on the spot mayhews jaw dropped you realize he said at last the mental health boards going to drop a net over you too miles grinned sardonically they cant because if they tried i could cry havoc to my liege lord for protection and id get it too hes pretty touchy about who does what to his subjects oh thats another angle if you become a liegeman to me it automatically puts you into a relationship with my leige lord kind of a complicated one and his and his and his i suppose said mayhew i know all about chains of command well no thats as far as it goes im sworn directly to gregor vorbarra as a vassal secundus miles realized he might as well be talking gibberish for all the meaning his words were conveying whos this gregguy asked mayhew the emperor of barrayar miles added just to be sure he understood oh typical betan thought miles they dont study anybodys history but earths and their own think about it anyway its not something you should just jump into when the last voiceprint had been recorded mayhew carefully disconnected the toggle boxmiles held his breathand the senior pilot officer returned to convey them planetside the senior pilot officer addressed miles with a shade more respect in his voice i had no idea you were from such a wealthy family lord vorkosigan that was a solution to the problem i certainly hadnt anticipated but perhaps one ship is just a bauble to a barrayaran lord not really said miles im going to have to do some hustling to cover that note my family used to be well off i admit but that was back in the time of isolation between the economic upheavals at the end of it and the first cetagandan war we were pretty much wiped out financially he grinned a little you galactics got us coming and going my greatgrandfather on the vorkosigan side when the first galactic traders hit us thought he was going to make a killing in jewelsyou know diamonds rubies emeraldsthe galactics seemed to be selling them so cheaply he put all his liquid assets and about half his chattels into them well of course they were synthetics better than the naturals and cheap as dirtuh sandand the bottom promptly dropped out of the market taking him with it im told my greatgrandmother never forgave him he waved vaguely at mayhew who becoming conditioned passed over his bottle miles offered it to the senior pilot officer who rejected it with a look of disgust miles shrugged and took a long pull amazingly pleasant stuff his circulatory system as well as his digestive now seemed to be glowing with rainbow hues he felt he could go days without sleep unfortunately most of the land he sold was around vorkosigan surleau which is pretty drynot by your standards of courseand the land he kept was around vorkosigan vashnoi which was the better whats unfortunate about that asked mayhew well because it was the principal seat of government for the vorkosigans and because we owned about every stick and stone in itit was a pretty important industrial and trade centerand because the vorkosigans were uh prominent in the resistance the cetagandans took the city hostage its a long story buteventually they destroyed the place its now a big glass hole in the ground you can still see a faint glow in the sky on a dark night twenty kilometers off the senior pilot officer brought the little shuttle smoothly into its dock hey said mayhew suddenly that land you had around vorkosigan whateveryousaid vashnoi have hundreds of square kilometers of it and mostly downwind yes is that the same his face was lighting like the sun coming up after a long dark night is that the same land you mortgaged to he began to laugh delightedly under his breath they disembarked is that what you pledged to that sandcrawler calhoun in return for my ship caveat emptor bowed miles he checked the climate plat he never thought to check the radioactivity plat he probably doesnt study anybody elses history either mayhew sat down on the docking bay laughing so hard that he bent his forehead nearly to the floor his laughter had more than an edge of hysteriaseveral days without sleep after all kid he cried have a drink on me i mean to pay him you understand explained miles the hectares he chose would make an unaesthetic hole in the map for some descendant of mine in a few hundred years when it cools off but if he gets greedy or pushy about collectingwell hell get what he deserves three groups of people were bearing down upon them bothari had escaped customs at last it appeared for he led the first group his collar was undone and he looked decidedly ruffled uh oh thought miles it looks like hes had a stripsearchthats guaranteed to put him in a ferocious mood he was followed by a new betan security patrolman and a limping betan civilian miles had never seen before who was gesticulating and complaining bitterly the man had a livid bruise on his face and one eye was swelling shut elena trailed seeming on the verge of tears the second group was led by the shuttleport administrator and included now a number of other officials the third group was headed by the betan security woman she had two burly patrolmen and four medical types in her wake mayhew glanced from right to left and sobered abruptly the betan security men had their stunners in hand oh kid he muttered the security men were fanning out mayhew scrambled to his knees oh kid its up to you arde said miles quietly do it the botharis arrived the sergeant opened his mouth miles dropping his voice cut across his beginning roarby god it was an effective trickattention please sergeant i require your witness pilot officer mayhew is about to make oath the sergeants jaw tightened like a vise but he came to attention put your hands between mine ardelike thatand repeat after me i arde mayhewis that your full legal name use that thendo testify i am an unsworn freeman and take service under lord miles naismith vorkosigan as an armsman simplego ahead and say that part mayhew did so rolling his eyes from left to right and will hold him as my leige commander until my death or his releases me that repeated miles said rather quickly as the crowd closed in i miles naismith vorkosigan vassal secundus to emperor gregor vorbarra do accept your oath and pledge you the protection of a leige commander this by my word as vorkosigan all doneyou can get up now one good thing thought miles its diverted the sergeant completely from whatever he was about to say bothari found his voice at last my lord he hissed you cant swear a betan i just did miles pointed out cheerfully he bounced a bit feeling quite unusually pleased with himself the sergeants glance passed across mayhews bottle and narrowed on miles why arent you asleep he growled the betan patrolman gestured at miles is this the man the betan security officer from the original shuttleport group approached mayhew had remained on his knees as if plotting to crawl off under cover of the fire overhead pilot officer mayhew she cried you are under arrest these are your rights you have a right to the bruised civilian interrupted pointing at elena screw him this woman assaulted me there were a dozen witnesses damn it i want her charged shes vicious elena had her hands over her ears again lower lip stuck out but trembling slightly miles began to get the picture did you hit him she nodded but he said the most horrible thing to me my lord said bothari reproachfully it was very wrong of you to leave her alone in this place the security woman began again pilot officer mayhew you have a right i think she cracked the orbit of my eye moaned the bruised man im going to sue miles shot elena a special reassuring smile dont worry ill take care of it you have a right yelled the security woman i beg your pardon officer brownell miles interrupted her smoothly pilot officer mayhew is now my leigeman as his leige commander any charges against him must be addressed to me it will then be my duty to determine their validity and issue the orders for the appropriate punishments he has no rights but the right to accept challenge in single combat for certain categories of slander which are a bit complicated to go into now obsolete too since dueling was outlawed by imperial edict but these betans wont know the differenceso unless you happen to be carrying two pairs of swords and are prepared to say offer an insult to pilot officer mayhews mother you will simply have toahcontain yourself timely advice the security woman looked as if she were about to explode mayhew gave a hopeful nod smiling weakly bothari stirred uneasily eyes flicking on an inventory of men and weapons in the mob gently thought miles lets take it gently get up arde it took some persuading but the security officer finally checked with her superiors about miless bizarre defense of pilot officer mayhew at that point as miles had hoped and foreseen proceedings broke down in a morass of untested interplanetary legal hypotheses that threatened to engulf the barrayaran embassy and the betan state department on everascending levels of personnel elenas case was easier the outraged betan was directed to take his case to the barrayaran embassy in person there miles knew it would be swallowed up in an endless moebius loop of files forms and reports kept especially for such occasions by the extremely competent staff the forms included some particularly creative ones that had to be roundtripped on the sixweek journey back to barrayar itself and were guaranteed to be sent back several times for minor errors in execution relax miles whispered in an aside to elena theyll bury that guy in files so deep youll never see him again it works great with betanstheyre perfectly happy because all the time they think theyre doing something to you just dont kill anybody my diplomatic immunity doesnt go that far the exhausted mayhew was swaying on his feet by the time the betans gave way miles feeling like an old sea raider after a successful looting spree bore him off two hours muttered bothari weve only been in this bloody place two bloody hours chapter six miles dear his grandmother greeted him with a peck on the cheek as regulation as a salute youre rather latetrouble in customs again are you very tired from your trip not a bit he bounced on his heels missing free fall and its unconstrained motion he felt like taking a fifty kilometer run or going dancing or something the botharis looked weary though and pilot officer mayhew was nearly green the pilot officer after the briefest introduction was shipped off to the spare bedroom in mrs naismiths apartment to wash take his choice of toosmall or toolarge borrowed pajamas and fall unconscious across the bed as though slugged with a mallet miless grandmother fed the survivors dinner and as miles had hoped seemed quite taken with elena elena was having an attack of shyness in the presence of the admired countess vorkosigans mother but miles was fairly sure the old woman would soon bring her out of it elena might even pick up a little of her betan indifference to barrayaran class distinctions might it ease the oppressive constraint that seemed to have been growing between himself and elena ever since they had ceased to be children it was the damn vorsuit he wore miles thought there were days it felt like armor archaic clanking encrusted and spiked uncomfortable to wear impossible to embrace give her a can opener and let her see what a pale soft miserable slug this gaudy shell enclosesnot that that would be any less repellenthis thoughts buried themselves in the dark fall of elenas hair and he sighed he realized his grandmother was speaking to him i beg your pardon maam i said she repeated patiently between bites one of my neighborsyou remember him mr hathaway who works at the recycling centeri know you met him when you were here to school oh yeah sure him he has a little problem that we thought you might be able to help with being barrayaran hes sort of been saving it for you since we knew you were coming he thought if you werent too tired you might even go with him tonight since it is starting to be rather disturbing i really cant tell you all that much about him myself said hathaway staring out over the vast domed arena that was his special charge miles wondered how long it would take to get used to the smell except that he says hes a barrayaran he disappears from time to time but he always comes back ive tried to persuade him to go to a shelter at least but he didnt seem to like the idea lately i havent been able to get near him you understand hes never tried to hurt anybody or anything but you never know what with his being a barrayaran and alloh sorry hathaway miles and bothari picked their way across the treacherous and uneven footing oddshaped objects in the piles tended to turn unexpectedly tripping the unwary all the detritus of high tech awaiting apotheosis as the next generation of betan ingenuity gleamed out amid more banal and universal human rubbish oh damn it cried hathaway suddenly hes gone and lit a fire again a small curl of grey smoke was rising a hundred meters away i hope hes not burning wood this time i just cannot convince him how valuablewell at least it makes him easy to find a low place in the piles gave an illusion of a sheltered space a thin darkhaired man in his late twenties was hunched glumly over a tiny fire carefully arranged in the bottom of a shallow parabolic antenna dish a makeshift table that had started life as a computer desk console was evidently now the mans kitchen for it held some flat pieces of metal and plastic now doing duty as plates and platters a large carp its scales gleaming redgold lay gutted and ready for cooking upon it dark eyes black smudges of weariness beneath them flashed up at the clank of their approach the man scrambled to his feet grabbing what appeared to be a homemade knife miles couldnt tell what it was made of but it was clearly a good one if it had done the job on the fish botharis hand automatically checked his stunner i think he is a barrayaran muttered miles to bothari look at the way he moves bothari nodded agreement the man held his knife properly like a soldier left hand guarding the right ready to block a snatch or punch an opening for the weapon he seemed unconscious of his stance hathaway raised his voice hey baz i brought you some visitors all right no uh look hathaway slid down a pile of rubble closer but not too close i havent bothered you have i i let you hang around in my center for days on end its all right as long as you dont carry anything outthats not wood is it oh all right ill overlook it this time but i want you to talk to these guys i figure you owe me all right anyway theyre barrayarans baz glanced up at them sharply his expression a strange mixture of hunger and dismay his lips formed a silent word miles read it home im silhouetted thought miles lets get down where he can see the light on my face he picked his way down beside hathaway baz stared at him youre no barrayaran he said flatly im half betan miles replied feeling no desire to go into his medical history just then but i was raised on barrayar its home home whispered the man barely audibly youre a long way from home miles upended a plastic casing from somethingorotherit had some wires hanging out of it giving it a sad disembowelled airand seated himself bothari took up position above on the rubble within comfortable pouncing distance did you get stuck here or something do you ahneed some help getting home no the man glanced away frowning his fire had burned down he placed a metal grill from an air conditioner over it and laid his fish on top hathaway eyed these preparations with fascination what are you going to do with that dead goldfish eat it hathaway looked revolted look misterall you have to do is report to a shelter and get carded and you can have all the protein slices you wantany flavor clean and fresh from the vats nobody has to eat a dead animal on this planet really whered you get it anyway baz replied uneasily out of a fountain hathaway gasped in horror those displays belong to the silica zoo you cant eat an exhibit there were lots of them i didnt think anybody would miss one it wasnt stealing i caught it miles rubbed his chin thoughtfully gave a little upward jerk of his head and pulled pilot officer mayhews green bottle which he had brought along on a lastminute impulse from under his jacket baz started at the movement then relaxed when he saw it was no weapon by barrayaran etiquette miles took a swallow firsthe made it a small one this timewiped the mouthpiece on his sleeve and offered it to the thin man drink with dinner its goodmakes you feel less hungrydries up your sinuses too tastes like horsepiss and honey baz frowned but took the bottle thanks he took a drink and added in a strangled whisper thanks baz slipped his dinner onto a cover plate from a tubecar wheel and sat crosslegged amid the junk to pick out the bones care for any no thanks just had dinner dear god i should think not cried hathaway ah said miles changed my mind just a taste baz held out a morsel on the point of his knife botharis hands twitched miles lipped it off campfashion and chomped it down with a sardonic smile at hathaway baz waved the bottle at bothari would your friend he cant excused miles hes on duty bodyguard whispered baz he looked again at miles with that strange expression fear and something else what the hell are you nothing you need be afraid of whatever youre hiding from it isnt me you can have my word on that if you wish vor breathed baz youre vor well yes and what the hell are you nobody he picked rapidly at his fish miles wondered how long it had been since his last meal hard to be nobody in a place like this miles observed everybody has a number everybody has a place to benot many interstices to be nobody in it must take a lot of effort and ingenuity you said it baz agreed around a mouthful of goldfish this is the worst place ive ever been youve got to keep moving around all the time you do know said miles tentatively the barrayaran embassy will help you get home if you want of course you have to pay it back later and theyre pretty strict about collectingtheyre not in the business of giving free rides to hitchhikersbut if youre really in trouble no it was almost a cry it echoed faintly across the enormous arena baz lowered his voice selfconsciously no i dont want to go home sooner or later ill pick up some kind of job at the shuttleport and ship off someplace better theres got to be something turn up soon if you want work said hathaway eagerly all you have to do is register at ill get something my own way baz cut him off harshly the pieces were falling into place baz doesnt want to register anywhere miles explained to hathaway coolly didactic up until now baz is something i thought impossible on beta colony hes a man who isnt here hes passed across the information network without a blip he never arrivednever passed through customs and ill bet that was one hell of a neat trickas far as the computers are concerned has not eaten or slept or purchasedor registered or been cardedand he would rather starve than do so for pitys sake why asked hathaway deserter commented bothari laconically from above ive seen the look miles nodded i think youve hit it sergeant baz sprang to his feet youre service security you twisty little bastard sit down miles overrode him not stirring im not anybody im just not quite as good at it as you are baz hesitated miles studied him seriously all the pleasure suddenly gone out of the excursion in a wash of cold ambiguity i dont supposeyeomanno lieutenant yes growled the man an officer yes miles chewed his lip disturbed was it in the heat baz grimaced reluctantly technically hm a deserter strange beyond comprehension for a man to trade the envied splendor of the service for the worm of fear riding in his belly like a parasite was he running from an act of cowardice or another crime or an error some horrible lethal mistake technically miles had a duty to help nail the fellow for service security but he had come here tonight to help the man not destroy him i dont understand said hathaway has he committed a crime yes a bloody serious one desertion in the heat of battle said miles if he gets extradited home the penaltys quartering technically that doesnt sound so bad hathaway shrugged hes been quartered in my recycling center for two months it could hardly be worse whats the problem quartering said miles uhnot domiciled cut in four pieces hathaway stared shocked but that would kill him he looked around and wilted under the triple unified and exasperated glares of the three barrayarans betans said baz disgustedly i cant stand betans hathaway muttered something under his breath miles caught bloodthirsty barbarians so if youre not service security baz finished sitting back down you may as well shove off theres nothing you can do for me im going to have to do something miles said why imim afraid ive inadvertently done you a disservice mr mryou may as well tell me your name jesek mr jesek you see im um under the scrutiny of security myself just by meeting you ive endangered your cover im sorry jesek paled why is service security watching you not the ss imperial security im afraid the breath went out of the deserter as from a body blow and his face drained utterly he bent over his head pressed to his knees as if to counteract a wave of faintness a muffled whimpergod he stared up at miles what did you do boy miles said sharply i havent asked you that question mr jesek the deserter mumbled some apology i cant let him know who i am thought miles or hell be off like a shot and run straight into my security socalled safety neteven as it is lt croye or his minions from the barrayaran embassy security staff are going to start looking this guy over theyll go wild when they find hes the invisible man no later than tomorrow if they give him the routine check ive just killed this manno what did you do in the service before miles groped for time and thought i was an engineers assistant construction weapons systems the mans voice steadied no jump ship engines some weapons systems i try to get tech work on private freighters but most of the equipment im trained in is obsolete in this sector harmonic impulse engines necklin color drivehard to come by ive got to get farther out away from the main economic centers a small high hm escaped miles do you know anything about the rg class freighters sure ive worked a couple necklin drive theyre all gone now though not quite a discordant excitement shivered through miles i know one its going to be making a freight run soon if it can get a cargo and crew jesek eyed him suspiciously is it going someplace that doesnt have an extradition treaty with barrayar maybe my lord botharis voice was edged with agitation youre not considering harboring this deserter well miles voice was mild technically i dont know hes a deserter ive merely heard some allegations he admitted it bravado perhaps inverted snobbery are you hankering to be another lord vorloupulous asked bothari dryly miles laughed and sighed bazs mouth twisted hathaway begged to be let in on the joke its barrayaran law again miles explained our courts are not kindly disposed to those who maintain the letter of the law and violate its spirit the classic precedent was the case of lord vorloupulous and his cooks did he run a chain of restaurants asked hathaway floundering dont tell me thats illegal on barrayar too oh no this was at the end of the time of isolation almost a hundred years ago emperor dorca vorbarra was centralizing the government and breaking the power of the counts as separate governing entitiesthere was a civil war about it one of the main things he did was eliminate private armies what they used to call livery and maintenance on old earth each count was stripped down to twenty armed followersbarely a bodyguard well lord vorloupulous had a feud going with a few neighbors for which he found this allotment quite inadequate so he hired on cooks socalled and sent them out to carve up his enemies he was quite ingenious about arming them butcher knives instead of short swords and so on there were plenty of recently unemployed veterans looking for work at the time who werent too proud to give it a try miless eyes glinted amusement the emperor naturally didnt see it his way dorca marched his regular army by then the only one on barrayar on vorloupulous and arrested him for treason for which the sentence wasstill ispublic exposure and death by starvation so the man with cooks was condemned to waste away in the great square of vorbarr sultana and to think they always said dorca vorbarra had no sense of humor bothari smiled grimly and baz chuckled hathaways laugh was more hollow charming he muttered but it had a happy ending miles went on hathaway brightened the cetagandans invaded us about that point and lord vorloupulous was released by the cetagandans lucky commented hathaway no by emperor dorca to fight the cetagandans you understand he wasnt pardonedthe sentence was merely delayed when the first cetagandan war was over he would have been expected to show up to complete it but he died fighting in battle so he had an honorable death after all thats a happy ending hathaway shrugged oh well baz miles noted had become silent and withdrawn again miles smiled at him experimentally he smiled back awkwardly looking younger for it miles made his decision mr jesek im going to make you a proposition which you can take or leave that ship i mentioned is the rg the jump pilot officers name is arde mayhew if you can disappeari mean really disappearfor the next couple of days and then get in touch with him at the silica shuttleport hell see that you get a berth on his ship outbound why should you help me at all mrlord mr naismith for all practical purposes miles shrugged call it a fancy for seeing people get second chances its something theyre not very keen on at home home bazs eyes echoed silently again wellit was good to hear the accent again for a little time i might just take you up on that he remembered to be cagey or i might not miles nodded retrieved his bottle motioned to bothari and withdrew they threaded their way back across the recycling center with an occasional muted clank when miles looked back jesek was a shadow melting toward another exit miles became conscious of a profound frown from sergeant bothari he smiled wryly and kicked over a control casing from some junked industrial robot lying skeletally athwart a mound of other rubble would you have had me turn him in he asked softly but youre service to the bone i suppose you would so would my father i guesshes so allfired stringent about the law no matter how ghastly the consequences bothari grew still notalways my lord he retreated into a suddenly neutral silence miles whispered elena detouring from a nocturnal trip to the bathroom from the bedroom she was sharing with mrs naismith arent you ever going to bed its almost morning not sleepy he entered yet another inquiry on his grandmothers comconsole it was true he still felt fresh and preternaturally alert it was just as well for he was plugged into a commercial network of enormous complexity ninety percent of success seemed to lie in asking the right questions tricky but after several hours work he seemed to be getting the hang of it besides with mayhew in the spare bedroom im doomed to the couch i thought my father had the couch he ceded it to me with a smile of grim glee he hates the couch he slept on it all the time i went to school here hes blamed every ache twinge and lower back pain hes had ever since on it even after two years it couldnt possibly be old age creeping up on him oh no elena strangled a giggle she leaned over his shoulder for a look at the screen the light from it silvered her profile and the scent of her hair falling forward dizzied him finding anything she asked miles entered three wrong directions in a row swore and refocused his attention yes i think so there were a lot more factors to be taken into account than i realized at first but i think ive found something he retrieved his fumbled data and waved his finger through the holoscreen that is my first cargo the screen displayed a lengthy manifest agricultural equipment she analyzed bound forwhatever is felice its a country on tau verde iv wherever that is its a fourweek runive been costcalculating fuel and supplies and the logistics of it in generaleverything from spare parts to toilet paper thats not whats interesting though whats interesting is that with that cargo i can pay for the trip and clear my debt to calhoun well inside the time limit on my note his voice went small im afraid i uh underestimated the time id need for the rg to run enough cargos to cover my note a little a lot well quite a lot badly the ship costs more to run than id realized when i finally went to add up all the real numbers he pointed to a figure but thats what theyre offering for transport cod felice and the cargos ready to go immediately her eyebrows drew down in awed puzzlement pay for the whole ship in one run but thats wonderful but he grinned but but why hasnt somebody else snapped up this cargo it seems to have been sitting in the warehouse a long time clever girl he crooned encouragingly go on i see they only pay on delivery but maybe thats normal yes he spread the word out like butter anything else she pursed her lips somethings weird indeed his eyes crinkled something is as you say weird do i have to guess because if i do im going back to bed she stifled a yawn ah welltau verde iv is in a war zone at the moment it seems there is a planetary war in progress one of the sides has the local wormhole exit blockednot by their own people it seems to be a somewhat industrially backward placetheyve hired a mercenary fleet and why has this cargo been mouldering in a warehouse so long because none of the big shipping companies will carry into a war zonetheir insurance lapses that goes for most of the little independents as well but since im not insured it does not go for me he smirked elena looked doubtful is it dangerous crossing the blockade if you cooperate on their stopand search in this case i think so the cargo happens to be addressed to the other side of the fray would the mercenaries seize it i mean robotic combines or whatever couldnt be classed as contrabanddont they have to abide by interstellar conventions her doubt became wariness he stretched still smiling youve almost got it what is beta colonys most noted export well advance technology of course weapons and weapons systems her wariness became dismay oh miles agricultural equipment he snickered ill bet anyway theres this felician who claims to be the agent for the company purchasing the equipmentthats another tipoff that they should have a man personally shepherding this cargo throughim going to go see him first thing in the morning as soon as the sergeant wakes up and mayhew id better take mayhew chapter seven miles reviewed his troops before pressing the buzzer to the hotel room even in civilian dress there was no mistaking the sergeant for anything but a soldier mayhewwashed shaved rested fed and dressed in clean new clotheslooked infinitely better than yesterday but still straighten up arde advised miles and try to look professional weve just got to get this cargo i thought betan medicine was advanced enough to cure any kind of hangover its bound to make a bad impression on this guy if you walk around clutching your stomach grm muttered mayhew but he did return his hands to his sides and come moreorless to attention youll find out kid he added in a tone of bitter clairvoyance and youre going to have to stop calling me kid miles added youre my armsman now youre supposed to address me as my lord you really take that stuff seriously one step at a time its like a salute miles explained you salute the uniform not the man being vor isis like wearing an invisible uniform you can never take off look at sergeant botharihes called me my lord ever since i was born if he can you can youre his brotherinarms now mayhew looked up at the sergeant bothari looked back his face saturnine in the extreme miles had the impression that had bothari been a more expressive man he would have made a rude noise at the concept of mayhew as his brotherinarms mayhew evidently received the same impression for he straightened up a little more and bit out yes my lord miles nodded approval and pressed the buzzer the man who answered the door had dark almond eyes high cheekbones skin the color of coffee and cream and bright coppercolored hair tightly curled as wire cropped close to his head his eyes searched the trio anxiously widening a little at miles he had only seen miless face that morning over the viewscreen mr naismith im carle daum come in damn closed the door behind them quickly and fussed at the lock miles deduced theyd just passed through a weapons scan and the felician was sneaking a peek at his readout the man turned back with a look of nervous suspicion one hand automatically touching his right hip pocket his gaze did not linger elsewhere in the little hotel room and botharis lips twitched satisfaction at daums unconscious revelation of the weapon he must watch for legal stunner most likely thought miles but you never know wont you sit down the felician invited his speech had a soft and curious resonance to miless ear neither the flat nasal twang heavy on the rs of the betans nor the clipped cold gutturals of barrayar bothari indicated he would prefer to stand and took up position to daums right uncomfortably far over in the felicians peripheral vision miles and mayhew sat before a low table daum sat across from them his back to a window actually a viewscreen bright with a panorama of mountains and a lake from some other world the wind that really howled far overhead would have scoured such trees to sticks in a day the window silhouetted daum while revealing his visitors expressions in full light miles appreciated the choice of views well mr naismith began daum tell me something about your ship what is its cargo capacity its an rg class freighter it can easily handle twice the mass of your manifest assuming those figures you put into the com system are quite correct daum did not react to this tiny bait instead he said im not very familiar with jump ships is it fast pilot officer mayhew miles prodded huh oh uh do you mean acceleration steady just steady we boost a little longer and get there nearly as fast in the end is it very maneuverable mayhew stared mr daum its a freighter daums lips compressed with annoyance i know that the question is the question is miles interrupted can we either outrun or evade your blockade the answer is no you see ive done my homework frustration darkened daums face then we seem to be wasting each others time so much time lost he began to rise the next question is is there another way to get your cargo to its destination yes i believe said miles firmly daum sat back tense with mistrust and hope go on youve done as much yourself already in the betans comm system camouflage i believe your cargo can be camouflaged well enough to pass a blockade inspection but well have to work together on it and somewhat more franklyah miles made a calculation based on the felicians age and bearing major daum the man twitched ah ha thought miles nailed him on the first try he compressed this internal crow to a suave smile if youre a pelian spy or an oseran mercenary i swear ill kill you daum began botharis eyelids drooped in a pose of deceptive calm im not said miles although it would be a great ploy if i were load up you and your weapons take you halfway and make you get out and walki appreciate your need for caution what weapons said daum attempting belatedly to regain his cover what weapons echoed mayhew in a frantic nearsilent whisper to miless ear your plowshares and pruning hooks then said miles tolerantly but i suggest we end the game and get to work i am a professional and if you buy that i have this nice farmland on barrayar for sale and so obviously are you or you wouldnt have gotten this far mayhews eyes widened under the guise of shifting in his seat miles kicked him preemptively in the ankle make a note he thought next time wake him earlier and brief him better although getting the pilot officer functional that morning had been rather like trying to raise the dead miles was not sure he could have succeeded earlier youre a mercenary soldier said daum ah said miles he had meant to imply a professional shipmasterbut might this be even more attractive to the felician what do you think major bothari stopped breathing a moment mayhew however looked suddenly dismayed so thats what you meant yesterday he murmured recruiting miles who had meant nothing of a kind in his facetious crack about looking for desperate men murmured back of course in a tone of maximum offhandedness surely you realized daum looked doubtfully at mayhew but then his gaze fell on bothari bothari maintained parade rest and an expression of remarkable blankness belief hardened in daums eyes by god he muttered if the pelians can hire galactics why cant we he raised his voice how many troops are in your outfit what ships do you have oh hellnow what miles extemporized like mad major daum i didnt mean to mislead you bothari breathed gratefully miles saw from the corner of his eye im uhdetached from my outfit at the moment theyre tied up on another contract i was just visiting beta colony for uh medical reasons so i have only myself and ah my immediate staff and a ship my fleet could spare here to offer you but were expected to operate independently in my bunch exhale sergeant please exhale so since it will be a little time yet before i can rejoin them and i find your problem tactically interesting my services are yours daum nodded slowly i see and by what rank should i address you miles nearly appointed himself admiral on the spot captain yeoman he wondered wildly lets just leave it at mr naismith for now he suggested coolly a centurion without his hundred men is after all a centurion in name only at the moment we need to be dealing with realities do we ever whats the name of your outfit miles freeassociated frantically the dendarii mercenaries it fell trippingly from the tongue at least daum studied him hungrily ive been tied down in this damn place for two months looking for a carrier that would haul me that i could trust if i wait much longer could be delay will destroy the purpose of my mission as certainly as any betrayal mr naismith ive waited long enoughtoo long im going to take a chance on you miles nodded satisfaction as if he had been concluding such transactions all of a somewhat longer life than he actually possessed then major daum i undertake to get you to tau verde iv my word on it the first thing i need is more intelligence tell me all you know about the oseran mercenaries blockade procedures it was my understanding my lord said bothari severely as they left daums hotel for the slidewalk that pilot officer mayhew here was to transport your cargo you didnt tell me anything about going along yourself miles shrugged elaborately casual there are so many variables so much at stakeive just got to be on the spot its unfair to dump it all on ardes shoulders i mean would you bothari apparently caught between his disapproval of his leige lords getrichquick scheme and his low opinion of the pilot officer gave a noncommittal grunt which mayhew chose not to notice miless eyes glinted besides itll put a little excitement in your life sergeant it has to be dull as dirt following me around all day id be bored to tears i like being bored said bothari morosely miles grinned secretly relieved at not being taken more strictly to task for his dendarii mercenaries outbreak well the brief moment of fantasy was probably harmless enough the three of them found elena stalking back and forth across mrs naismiths living room two bright spots of color burned in her cheeks her nostrils flared and she was muttering under her breath she transfixed miles with an angry glare as he entered betans she bit out in a voice of loathing this only let him half off the hook whats the matter he inquired cautiously she took another turn around the room stifflegged as if trampling bodies underfoot that awful holovid she glowered how can theyoh i cant even describe it ah ha she found one of the pornography channels thought miles well it had to happen eventually holovid he said brightly how could they permit such horrible slanders on admiral vorkosigan and prince serg and our forces i think the producer should be taken out and shot and the actorsand the scriptwriterwe would at home by god not the pornography channel evidently uh elenajust what have you been looking at his grandmother was seated with a fixed nervous smile in her float chair i tried to explain that its fictionalizedyou know to make the history more dramatic elena gave vent to an ominous rattling hiss miles gave his grandmother a pleading look the thin blue line mrs naismith explained cryptically oh ive seen that one said mayhew its a rerun miles recalled the docudrama vividly himself it had first been released two years ago and had contributed its mite to making his school visit to beta colony the sometimes surreal experience it had been miless father thencommodore vorkosigan had begun the aborted barrayaran invasion of beta colonys ally escobar years ago as a staff officer he had ended upon the catastrophic deaths of the cocommanders admiral vorrutyer and crown prince serg vorbarra as commander of the armada his brilliant retreat was still cited as exemplary in the military annals of barrayar the betans naturally took a different view of the affair the blue in the title of the docudrama referred to the color of the uniform worn by the betan expeditionary force of which captain cordelia naismith had been a part itsits elena turned to miles there isnt any truth in itis there well said miles equable from years of practice in coming to terms with the betan version of history some but my mother says they never wore the blue uniforms until the war was practically over and she swears up and down privately that she didnt murder admiral vorrutyer but she wont say who did protests too much i think all my father will ever say about vorrutyer is that he was a brilliant defensive strategist ive never been quite sure what to make of that since vorrutyer was in charge of the offense all my mother says about him is that he was a bit strange which doesnt sound too bad until i reflect that shes a betan theyve never said a word against prince serg and father was on his staff and knew him so i guess the betan version of him is mainly a crock of war propaganda our greatest hero cried elena the emperors fatherhow dare they well even on our side consensus seems to be that we were overreaching ourselves to try and take escobar on top of komarr and sergyar elena turned to her father as the resident expert you served with my lord count at escobar sir tell her a toss of her head indicated mrs naismith it isnt so i dont remember escobar replied the sergeant stonily in a tone unusually flat and unencouraging even for him no point to that he jerked one large hand thumb hooked in his belt toward the holovid viewer it was wrong for you to see that the tension in botharis shoulders disturbed miles and the set look about his eyes anger over an ephemeral holovid which she had seen before and ignored as readily as miles had elena paused diverted and confused dont remember but something clicked in miless memorythe medical discharge at last accounted for i didnt realizewere you wounded at escobar sergeant no wonder hes twitchy about it then botharis lips moved about the beginning of the word wounded yes he muttered his eyes shifted away from miles and elena miles gnawed his lip head wound he inquired in a burst of surmise botharis gaze shifted back to miles quellingly mm miles permitted himself to be quelled hugging this new prize of information to himself a head wou nd would account for much that had long bemused him in his leigeman taking the hint miles changed the subject firmly be that as it may he swept elena a courtly bowwhatever happened to plumed hats for meni got my cargo elenas irritation vanished instantly in pleased interest oh grand and have you figured out how to get it past the blockade yet working on it would you care to do some shopping for me supplies for the trip put the orders in to the ship chandlersyou can do it from here on the comconsole grandmotherll show you how arde has a standard list we need everythingfood fuel cells emergency oxygen firstaid suppliesand at the best price you can get this thing is going to wipe out my travel allowance so anything you can saveeh he gave his draftee his most encouraging smile as if the offer of two full days locked in struggle with the electronic labyrinth of betan business practices was a high treat elena looked doubtful ive never outfitted a ship before itll be easy he assured her airily just bang into ityoull have it figured out in no time if i can do it you can do it he zipped lightly over this argument giving her no time to reflect on the fact that he had never outfitted a ship either figure for pilot officer engineer the sergeant me and major daum for eight weeks and maybe a little margin but not too muchremembering the budget we boost the day after tomorrow all rightwhen she snapped to full alertness thunder in the crimp of her black winging eyebrows what about me youre not leaving me behind while you metaphorically miles slunk behind bothari and waved a white flag thats up to your father and grandmother of course shes welcome to stay with me said mrs naismith faintly but milesyou just got here oh i still mean to make my visit maam miles reassured her well just reschedule our return to barrayar its not like i had toto get back in time for school or anything elena stared at her father tightlipped with silent pleading bothari blew out his breath his gaze turning calculatingly from his daughter to mrs naismith to the holovid viewer then inward to what thoughts or memories miles could not guess elena barely restrained herself from hopping up and down in agitation milesmy lordyou can order him to miles flicked a hand palmout and gave a tiny shake of his head signalling wait mrs naismith glanced at elenas anxiety and smiled thoughtfully behind her hand actually dear it would be lovely having you all to myself for a time like having a daughter again you could meet young peoplego to partiesi have some friends over in quartz who could take you deserttrekking im too old for the sport myself now but im sure youd enjoy it bothari flinched quartz for example was beta colonys principle hermaphrodite community and although mrs naismith herself typified hermaphrodites as people who are pathologically incapable of making up their minds she bristled in patriotic betan defense of them at botharis open barrayaran revulsion to the sex and bothari had personally carried miles home unconscious from more than one betan party as for miless nearly disastrous deserttrek miles shot his grandmother a look of thanks from crinkling eyes she acknowledged it with a puckish nod and smiled blandly at bothari bothari was unamused not ironically unamused befitting the interplay as his guerilla warfare with mrs naismith on the subject of miless cultural mores usually was but genuinely enraged an odd knot formed in miless stomach he came to a species of attention querying his bodyguard with puzzled eyes she goes with us bothari growled elena nearly clapped her hands in triumph although mrs naismiths list of proposed treats had plainly eroded her resolve not to be left sitting in the baggage train when the troops moved out but botharis eyes raked past his daughter unresponsively lingered for a last frown at the holovid and met milessbelt buckle excuse me my lord illpatrol the hall until youre ready to leave again he exited stiffly great hands all bone and tendon vein and corded muscle held halfcurled by his sides yes go thought miles and see if you can patrol up your selfcontrol out there overreacting a tad arent you admittedly nobody likes having their tail twisted whew said mayhew as the door closed what bit him oh dear said mrs naismith i hope i didnt offend him but she added under her breath the hypocritical old stick hell come down miles promised just leave him alone for a while meantime theres work to do you heard the man elena supplies for a crew of two and a supercargo of four the next hours were a blur of motion to prepare an eightweek run for the old ship within that time limit would have been mindboggling for an ordinary cargo but crammed atop that were extras needed for the camouflage scheme these included a partial cargo of hastily purchased items to provide them with a real manifest in which to embed the false and supplies needed for rearranging the cargo hold bulkheads flung aboard to wait the actual work to be done en route most vital and correspondingly expensive were the extremely advanced betan mass detector jammers to be run off the ships artificial gravity and with which miles hoped they would foil the oseran mercenaries cargo check it had taken all the simulated political weight miles could muster on the basis of his fathers name to convince the betan company representative that he was a qualified purchaser of the new and still partially classified equipment the mass jammers came with an astonishingly lengthy file of instructions miles studying them in bewilderment began to have qualms over baz jeseks qualifications as an engineer these gave way as the hours passed to even more frantic doubts about whether the man was going to show at all the level of liquid in mayhews green bottle now wholly expropriated by miles dropped steadily and miles sweated sleeplessly the betan shuttleport authorities miles found were not sympathetic to the suggestion that their stiff usage fees be paid on credit he was forced to strip himself of his entire travel allowance it had seemed a wildly generous one back on barrayar but in the suction of these new demands it vanished literally overnight growing creative miles turned in his firstclass return ticket to barrayar upon one of the betterknown commercial spacelines for a thirdclass one then botharis then elenas then all three were exchanged for tickets on a line miles had never heard of then with a low guilty mutter of ill buy everybody new ones when we get backor run a cargo to barrayar on the rg he cashed them in entirely at the end of two days he found himself teetering atop a dizzying financial structure compounded of truth lies credit cash purchases advances on advances shortcuts a tiny bit of blackmail false advertising and yet another mortgage on some more of his glowinthedark farmland supplies were loaded daums cargo a fascinating array of oddshaped anonymous plastic crates was put aboard jesek showed systems were checked and jesek was instantly put to work juryrigging vital repairs luggage scarcely opened was stuffed back together and sent back up some goodbyes were said others carefully avoided miles had dutifully reported to bothari that hed talked to lieutenant croye it wasnt miless fault if bothari neglected to ask what hed said at last they stood in silica shuttleport docking bay ready to go waldo handling fee stated the betan shuttleport cargo master threehundredten betan dollars foreign currencies not accepted he smiled pleasantly like a very courteous shark miles cleared his throat nervously stomach churning he mentally reviewed his finances daums resources had been stripped in the last two days indeed if something miles had overheard was correct the man was planning to leave his hotel bill unpaid mayhew had already put everything he had into emergency repairs on the ship miles had even floated one loan from his grandmother courteously shed called it her investment just like the golden hind shed said some kind of ass anyway miles had reflected in a moment of quavering doubt he had accepted rawly embarrassed but too harried to forgo the offer miles swallowedperhaps it was pride going down that made that lumptook sergeant bothari aside and lowered his voice uh sergeanti know my father made you a travel allowance botharis lips twisted thoughtfully and he gave miles a penetrating stare he knows he can kill this scheme right here miles realized and return to his life of boredomgod knows my fatherd back him up he loathed wheedling bothari but added i could repay you in eight weeks two for onefor your left pocket my word on it bothari frowned its not necessary for you to redeem your word to me my lord that was prepaid long ago he looked down at his leige lord hesitated a long moment sighed then dolefully emptied his pockets into miless hands thanks miles smiled awkwardly turned away then turned back uhcan we keep this between you and me i mean no need to mention it to my father an involuntary smile turned one corner of the sergeants mouth not if you pay me back he murmured blandly and so it was done what a joy miles thought to be a military ship captainjust bill it all to the emperor they must feel like a courtesan with a charge card not like us poor working girls he stood in the nav and com room of his own ship and watched arde mayhew far more alert and focused than miles had ever seen him before complete the traffic control checklist in the screen the glimmering ochre crescent of beta colony turned beneath them you are cleared to break orbit came the voice of traffic control a wave of dizzy excitement swept through miles they were really going to bring this off uh just a minute rg the voice added you have a communication pipe it up said mayhew settling under his headset this time a frantic face appeared on the viewscreen not one miles wanted to see he braced himself quelling guilt lieutenant croye spoke urgently tense my lord is sergeant bothari with you not just this second why the sergeant was below with daum already beginning to tear out bulkheads who is with you just pilot officer mayhew and myself miles found he was holding his breath so close croye relaxed just a little my lord you could not have known this but that engineer you hired is a deserter from imperial service you must shuttle down immediately and find some pretext for him to accompany you make sure the sergeant is with youthe man must be regarded as dangerous well have a betan security patrol waiting at the docking bay and also he glanced aside at something what the devil did you do to that tav calhoun fellow hes here at the embassy howling for the ambassador mayhews eyes widened in alarm uh said miles tachycardia thats what it was called could yearolds have heart attacks lieutenant croye that transmission was extremely garbled could you repeat he shot mayhew an imploring glance mayhew gestured at a panel croye began his message again starting to look disturbed miles opened the panel and stared at a spidery maze of wires his head seemed to swim dizzily in panic so close youre still garbled sir said miles brightly here ill fix it oh damn he pulled six tiny wires at random the screen dissolved in sparkling snow croye was cut off in midsentence boost arde cried miles mayhew needed no urging beta colony wheeled away beneath them quite dizzy and nauseated blast it this wasnt free fall he sat abruptly on the deck weak from the near disaster no it was something more he had a paranoid flash about alien plagues then realized what was happening to him mayhew stared looking first alarmed then sardonically understanding its about time that stuff caught up with you he remarked and keyed the intercom sergeant bothari would you report to nav and com please your uh lord needs you he smiled acidly at miles who was beginning to seriously repent some of the harsh things hed said to mayhew three days ago the sergeant and elena appeared elena was saying everythings so dirty the medical cabinet doors just came off in my hands and bothari snapped to alertness at miless hunched huddle and quizzed mayhew with angry eyes his creme de meth just wore off mayhew explained drops you in a hurry doesnt it kid miles mumbled an inarticulate groan bothari growled something exasperatedly under his breath about deserve picked him up and slung him unceremoniously over his shoulder well at least hell stop bouncing off the walls and give us all a break said mayhew cheerfully ive never seen anybody overrev on that stuff the way he did oh was that liquor of yours a stimulant asked elena i wondered why he didnt fall asleep couldnt you tell chuckled mayhew not really miles twisted his head to take in elenas upsidedown worried face and smile in weak reassurance sparkly black and purple whirlpools clouded his vision mayhews laughter faded my god he said hollowly you mean hes like that all the time chapter eight miles extinguished his welding tool and pushed back his safety goggles done he glanced with pride back up the neat seam that sealed the last false bulkhead into place if i cant be a soldier he thought perhaps i have a future as an engineers assistant about time i got some use out of being a shrimp he called back over his shoulder you can pull me out now hands grasped his booted ankles and dragged him out of the crawl space try your black box now baz he suggested sitting up and stretching cramped muscles daum watched anxiously over the engineers shoulder as he began once again to dryrun the check procedure jesek walked back and forth beside the bulkhead scanning at last finally for the first time in seven trials all the lights on his probe remained green a smile lit his tired face i think weve done it according to this theres nothing behind that wall but the next wall miles grinned at daum i gave you my word id get it together in time did i not daum grinned back relieved youre lucky you dont own a faster ship the intercom buzzed in the cargo hold uh my lord came mayhews voice it had an edge that popped miles instantly to his feet trouble arde were coming up on the jump to tau verde in about two hours theres something out here i think you and the major ought to have a look at blockaders this side of the exit theyd have no legal authority no its a buoy of a sort mayhew sounded distinctly unhappy if you were expecting this i think you might have told me back in a few minutes baz miles promised and well help you rearrange the cargo in here more artistically maybe we could pile up a bunch against that first seam i welded its not that bad jesek reassured him ive seen professional work with more slop in nav and com miles and daum found mayhew staring aggrieved at a screen readout what is it arde asked miles oseran warning buoy they have to have it for the regular merchant shipping lanes its supposed to prevent accidents and misunderstandings in case anybody doesnt know whats going on on the other sidebut this time theres a twist listen to this he flipped on the audio attention attention to all commercial military or diplomatic shipping planning to enter tau verde local space warning you are entering a restricted military area all entering traffic without exception is subject to search and seizure for contraband any noncooperation will be construed as hostile and the vessel subjected to confiscation or destruction without further warning proceed at your own risk upon emergence into tau verde local space all vessels will be approached and boarded for inspection all wormhole jump pilot officers will be detained at this time until their vessel completes its contact with tau verde iv and returns to the jump point pilot officers will be permitted to rejoin their vessels upon completion of the outbound inspection hostages damn it groaned daum theyre taking hostages now and a very clever choice of hostages added miles through his teeth especially for a culdesac like tau verde taking your jump pilot traps you like a bug in a bottle if youre not a good little tourist there you just might not be allowed to go home this is new you say they werent doing it five months ago said daum i havent had word from home since i got out but this means the fighting must still be going on at least he stared intently into the viewscreen as if he could see through the invisible gateway to his home the message went on into technicalities and ended by order of admiral yuan oser commanding oseran free mercenary fleet under contract to the legal government of pelias tau verde iv legal government daum spat angrily pelians damned selfaggrandizing criminals miles whistled soundlessly and stared into the wall if i really were a nervous entrepreneur trying to unload that oddlot of crap down there what would i do he wondered i wouldnt be happy about dropping my pilot buti sure wouldnt be arguing with a disruptor bellmuzzle meek we are going to be meek said miles forcefully they hesitated half a day on the near side of the exit to put the finishing touches on the arrangement of the cargo and rehearse their roles miles took mayhew aside for a closed debate witnessed by bothari alone he opened bluntly studying the pilots unhappy face well arde do you want to back out can i the pilot asked hopefully im not going to order you into a hostage situation if you choose to volunteer i swear not to abandon you in it well im already sworn as your leige lord but i dont expect you to know what happens if i dont volunteer once we jump to tau verde local space wed have no effective way of resisting a demand for your surrender so i guess we apologize to daum for wasting his time and money turn around and go home miles sighed if calhoun was at the embassy for the reason i think when we left hes probably started legal proceedings to repossess the ship by now he tried to lighten his voice i expect well end up back where we began the day i met you only more broke maybe i can find some way to make up daums losses to him miles trailed off in penitent thought what if began mayhew he looked at miles curiously what if theyd wanted say sergeant bothari instead of me what would you have done then oh id go in said miles automatically then paused the air hung empty waiting for explanation thats different the sergeant isis my leigeman and im not asked mayhew ironically the state department will be relieved there was a silence im your leige lord replied miles at last soberly what you are is a question only you can answer mayhew stared into his lap and rubbed his forehead tiredly one finger unconsciously caressing a silver circle of his implant contact he looked up at miles then an odd hunger in his eyes that reminded miles for a disquieting instant of the homesick baz jesek i dont know what i am anymore said mayhew finally but ill make the jump for you and the rest of the horsing around a queasy wavering dizzinessa few seconds static in the mindand the wormhole jump to tau verde was done miles hovered impatiently in nav and com waiting for mayhew whose few seconds had been biochemically stretched to subjective hours to crawl out from under his headset he wondered again just what it was pilots experienced threading a jump that their passengers did not and where did they go the one ship in ten thousand that jumped and was never seen again take a wormhole jump to hell was an old curse one almost never heard in a pilots mouth mayhew swung his headset stretched and let out his breath his face seemed grey and lined drained from the concentration of the jump that was a shitkicker he muttered then straightened grinned and met miless eye thatll never be a popular run let me tell you kid interesting though miles did not bother to correct the honorific letting mayhew rest he slid into the comconsole himself and punched up a view of the outside world well he muttered after a few moments where are they dont tell me we got the party ready and the guest of honors not comingare we in the right place he demanded anxiously of mayhew mayhew raised his eyebrows kid at the end of a wormhole jump youre either in the right place or youre a bucket of quarks smeared between antares and oz but he checked anyway seems to be it was a full four hours before a blockade ship finally approached them miless nerves stretched taut its slow approach seemed freighted with deliberate menace until voice contact was made the mercenary communication officers tone of sleepy boredom then put it in its true light they were sauntering desultorily a boarding shuttle was launched miles hovered in the shuttle hatch corridor scenarios of possible disasters flashing through his mind daum has been betrayed by a quisling the war is over and the side were expecting to pay us has lost the mercenaries have turned pirate and are going to steal my ship some klutz has dropped and broken their mass detector and so theyre going to physically measure all our interior volumes and they wont add up this last notion once it occurred to him seemed so likely that he held his breath until he spotted the mercenary technician in charge of the instrument among the boarders there were nine of them all men all bigger than miles and all lethally armed bothari unarmed and unhappy about it stood behind miles and inspected them coldly there was something motley about them the greyandwhite uniforms they werent particularly old but some were in disrepair others dirty but were they too busy to waste time on nonessentials or merely too lazy to keep up appearances at least one man seemed outoffocus leaning against a wall drunk on duty recovering from wounds they bore an odd variety of weapons stunners nerve disruptors plasma arcs needlers miles tried to add them up and evaluate them the way bothari would hard to tell their working condition from the outside all right a big man shouldered through the bunch whos in charge of this hulk miles stepped forward im naismith the owner sir he stated trying to sound very polite the big man obviously commanded the boarders and perhaps even the cruiser judging from his rank insignia the mercenary captains eyes flicked over miles a quirk of an eyebrow a shrug of contemptuous dismissal clearly categorized miles as no threat thats just what i want miles reminded himself firmly good the mercenary heaved a sigh of ennui all right shorty lets get this over with is this your whole crew he gestured to mayhew and daum flanking bothari miles lidded his eyes against a flash of anger my engineers at his station sir he said hoping he was achieving the right tone of a timid man anxious to please search em the big man directed over his shoulder bothari stiffened miles met his look of annoyance with a quelling shake of his head bothari submitted to being pawed over with an obvious illgrace that was not lost on the mercenary captain a sour smile slid over the mans face the mercenary captain split his crew into three search parties and gestured miles and his people ahead of him to nav and com his two soldiers began spotchecking everything that would come apart even disassembling the padded swivel chairs leaving all in disarray they went on to the cabins where the search took on the nature of a ransacking miles clenched his teeth and smiled meekly as his personal effects were dumped pellmell on the floor and kicked through these guys have got nothing worth having captain auson muttered one soldier sounding savagely disappointed wait heres something miles froze appalled at his own carelessness in collecting and concealing their personal weapons he had overlooked his grandfathers dagger he had brought it more as a memento than a weapon and halfforgotten it at the bottom of a suitcase it was supposed to date back to count selig vorkosigan himself the old man had cherished it like a saints relic although clearly not a weapon to tip the balance of the war on tau verde iv it had the vorkosigan arms inlaid in cloisonne gold and jewels on the hilt miles prayed the pattern would be meaningless to a nonbarrayaran the soldier tossed it to his captain who withdrew it from its lizard skin sheath he turned it in the light bringing out the strange watermark pattern on the gleaming bladea blade that had been worth ten times the price of the hilt even in the time of isolation and was now considered priceless for its quality and workmanship among connoisseurs captain auson was evidently not a connoisseur for he merely said huh pretty resheathed itand jammed it in his belt hey miles checked himself halfway through a boiling surge forward meek meek he tamped his outrage into a form fitting his supposed betan persona im not insured for this sort of thing the captain snorted tough luck shorty but he mulled on miles in a moment of curious doubt backpedal thought miles dont i at least get a receipt he asked plaintively auson snickered a receipt thats a good one the soldiers grinned nastily miles controlled his ragged breathing with an effort well he choked out at least dont let it stand wet itll rust if its not properly dried after each use cheap pot metal growled the mercenary captain he ticked it with a fingernail it rang like a bell maybe i can get a good stainless blade put on that fancy hilt miles went green auson gestured to bothari open that case there bothari as usual glanced at miles for confirmation auson frowned irritably stop looking at shorty you take your orders from me bothari straightened and raised an eyebrow sir he inquired dulcetly of miles meek damn it sergeant miles thought and sent the message by a slight compression of his lips obey this man mr bothari he replied a little too sharply bothari smiled slightly yes sir having established the pecking order in a form more to his taste he at last unlocked the case with precise insulting deliberation auson swore under his breath the mercenary captain herded them to a final rendezvous in what the betans called the rec room and the barrayarans called the wardroom now he said you will produce all your offplanet currency contraband what cried mayhew outraged how can money be contraband hush arde hissed miles just do it auson might well be telling the truth miles realized foreign currency was just what daums people needed to buy such things as offplanet weaponry and military advisors or it might simply be the holdup it appeared no matterjudging from the lack of excitement of all hands daums cargo had escaped them and that was all that counted miles secreted triumph in his heart and emptied his pockets thats all said auson disbelievingly as they placed their final offerings in a little pile on the table before him were a little shorbroke at the moment miles explained until we get to tau verde and make some sales shit muttered auson his eyes bored exasperatedly into miles who shrugged helplessly and produced his most inane smile three more mercenaries entered pushing baz and elena before them got the engineer said the captain tiredly i suppose hes broshort too he glanced up and saw elena his look of boredom vanished instantly and he came smoothly to his feet well thats better i was beginning to think they were all freaks and fright masks here business before pleasure thoughyou carrying any nontau verdan currency honey elena glanced uncertainly at miles i have some she admitted looking surprised why out with it then miles she queried miles unclenched his aching jaw give him your money elena he ordered in a low tone auson glowered at miles youre not my frigging secretary shorty i dont need you to transmit my orders i dont want to hear any more backchat from you hear miles smiled and nodded meekly and rubbed one sweating palm against his trouser seam where a holster wasnt elena bewildered laid five hundred betan dollars on the table botharis eyebrows drew down in astonishment whered you get all that whispered miles as she stepped back countessyour mother gave it to me she whispered back she said i should have some spending money of my own on beta colony i didnt want to take so much but she insisted auson counted it and brightened so youre the banker eh honey thats a bit more reasonable i was beginning to think you folks were holding out on me he cocked his head looking her over and smiling sardonically people who hold out on me always come to regret it the money vanished along with a meager haul of other small valuable items he checked their cargo manifest this right he asked the leader of the party who had come in with elena and baz all the cases we busted open checked replied the soldier they made the most awful mess down there elena gritted under her breath to miles sh never mind the mercenary captain sighed and began sorting through their various identification files at one point he grinned and glanced up at bothari then elena miles sweated auson finished the check and leaned back casually in his seat before the computer console regarding mayhew glumly you the pilot officer eh he inquired unenthusiastically yes sir replied mayhew wellcoached in meekness by miles betan yes sir are younever mind youre betan that answers the question more frigging weirds per capita than any other he trailed off you ready to go mayhew glanced at miles uncertainly damn it cried auson i asked you not shorty bad enough that ill have to look at you over the breakfast table for the next few weeks hed give me indigestion yeah smile you little mutant this last to miles i bet youd like to cut my liver out miles smoothed his face worried he had been so sure hed looked meek maybe it was bothari no sir he said brightly blinking for a meek effect the mercenary captain glared at him a moment then muttered aw the hell with it and rose his eye fell on elena again and he smiled thoughtfully elena frowned back auson looked around tell you what shorty he said in a benevolent tone you can keep your pilot ive had about all the betans i can take lately mayhew sighed relief under his breath miles relaxed secretly delighted the mercenary captain waved at elena ill take her instead go pack your things honey frozen silence auson smiled at her invitingly you wont be missing a thing by not seeing tau verde believe me you be a good girl you might even get your money back elena turned dilated eyes toward miles my lord she said in a small uncertain voice it was not a slip of the tongue she had a right to call for protection from her leige lord it grieved him that she had not called miles instead botharis stillness was utter his face blank and hard miles stepped up to the mercenary captain his meekness slipping badly the agreement was you were to hold our pilot officer he stated in a flat voice auson grinned wolfishly i make my own rules she goes she doesnt want to if you dont want the pilot officer choose another dont worry about it shorty shell have a good time you can even have her back on the way outif she still wants to go with you i said choose another the mercenary captain chuckled and turned away miless hand closed around his arm the other mercenaries watching the show didnt even bother to draw weapons ausons face lit with happiness and he swung around hes been itching for this miles realized well so have i the contest was brief and unequal a clutch a twist a ringing blow and miles was slammed facedown on the deck the metallic tang of blood filled his mouth as an afterthought a deliberatelyaimed boot to his belly doubled him over where he lay and assured that he wouldnt be rebounding to his feet in the immediate future miles curled in agony cheek pressed to the friction matting thank god it wasnt the ribcage he thought incoherently through a haze of rage pain and nausea he squinted at the boots spread aggressively beyond his nose toes must be steellined the mercenary captain wheeled around hands on hips well he demanded of miless crew silence and stillness all looked to bothari who might have been stone auson disappointed spat disgustedlyeither he wasnt aiming at miles or he missedand muttered aw the hell with it this tubs not worth confiscating anyway lousy fuel efficiency he raised his voice to his crew all right load up lets go come on honey he added to elena taking her firmly by the upper arm the five mercenaries unhinged themselves from their various postures of languid observation and prepared to follow their captain out the door elena glanced back over her shoulder to meet miless flaming eyes her lips parted in a little ah of understanding and she stared at auson with cold calculation now sergeant cried miles and launched himself at his chosen mercenary still shaken from his encounter with the captain in an inspiration of rare prudence he picked the one he had seen propping up the wall earlier the room seemed to explode a chair which no one had seen the sergeant unfasten from its moorings flew across the room to smash into the mercenary carrying the nerve disruptor before he even began to draw miles occupied with his own tackle heard but did not see the sergeants second victim go down with a meaty resonating unh daum too reacted instantly disarming his man neatly and tossing the stunner to an astonished mayhew mayhew stared at it a second woke up and fumbled it right way round and fired unfortunately it was out of charge a needler went off wildly its projectile exploded against a far wall miles put his elbow with all his strength into his mans stomach and had his earlier hypothesis confirmed when the man folded gagging and retching unquestionably drunk miles dodged emesis and at last achieved a strangle hold he put the pressure on full power for the first time in his life to his surprise the man jerked but a few times and went still is he surrendering miles wondered dizzily and pulled the head back by the hair for a look at the face the man was unconscious a mercenary bouncing off bothari stumbled past mayhew who at last found a use for the stunner blackjacking the man to his knees mayhew hit him a couple more times rather experimentally bothari hurtling past paused to say disgustedly not like that grab the stunner and smash the man flat with one accurately placed blow the sergeant then proceeded to assist daum with his second and it was over but for some yelling by the door accompanying a muffled cracking noise the mercenary captain his nose gouting blood was down on the floor with elena atop him thats enough elena said bothari placing the bellmuzzle of a captured nerve disruptor against the mans temple no sergeant miles cried the yelling stopped abruptly and auson rolled fearwhitened eyes toward the gleaming weapon i want to break his legs too cried elena angrily i want to break every bone in his body ill shorty him when im done hes going to be one meter tall later promised bothari daum found a functioning stunner and the sergeant put the mercenary captain temporarily out of his misery then proceeded systematically around the room to make sure of the rest we still have three more out there my lord he reminded miles unh miles acknowledged crawling to his feet and the eleven or so in the other ship he thought think you and daum can ambush and stun em yes but bothari hefted the nerve disruptor in his hand may i suggest my lord that it may be preferable to kill soldiers in battle than prisoners after it may not come to that sergeant said miles sharply the full chaotic implications of the situation were just beginning to dawn on him stun em then wellfigure out something else think quickly my lord suggested bothari and vanished out the door moving with uncanny silence daum chewed his lip worriedly and followed miles was already starting to think sergeant he called after them softly keep one conscious for me very good my lord miles turned back slipping a little in a spatter of blood from the mercenary captains nose and stared at the sudden slaughterhouse god he muttered now what do i do with em chapter nine elena and mayhew stood waiting looking at him expectantly miles suddenly realized he had not seen baz jesek in the fightwait there he was pinned against the far wall his dark eyes were like holes in his milky face his breathing ragged are you hurt baz miles cried in concern the engineer shook his head but did not speak their eyes met and jesek looked away miles knew then why he hadnt noticed him were outnumbered two or three to one miles thought frantically i cant spare a trained fighting man to funkgot to do something right now elena arde he spoke go out in the corridor and close the door until i call you they obeyed looking baffled miles walked up to the engineer how do i do a heart transplant he wondered in the dark by feel without anesthetics he moistened his lips and spoke quietly weve got no choice we have to capture their ship now the best shot is to take their shuttle make them think its their own people coming back that can only be done in the next few minutes the only chance of escape for any of us is to take them before they get a squeak out im going to assign the sergeant and daum to take their nav and com room and prevent that the next most vital section is engineering with all the overrides jesek turned his face away like a man in pain or grief miles went on relentlessly youre clearly the man for that one so im assigning it to you and miles took a breath and elena the engineer turned his face back if possible more drained than before oh no mayhew and i will float stunning anything that moves thirty minutes from now it will all be over one way or another jesek shook his head i cant he whispered look youre not the only one whos terrified im scared witless jeseks mouth twisted you dont look scared you didnt even look scared when that mercenary pig decked you you just looked pissed thats because ive got forward momentum theres no virtue in it its just a balancing act i dont dare stop the engineer shook his head again helplessly and spoke through his teeth i cant ive tried miles barely kept his lips from curling back in a snarl of frustration wild threats cascaded through his mindno that wasnt right surely the cure for fear was not more fear im drafting you miles announced abruptly what i claim you imim confiscating you im seizing your propertyyour training that isfor the war effort this is totally illegal but since youre under a death sentence anyway who cares get down on your knees and put your hands between mine jeseks mouth fell open you cantim notnobody but one of the emperors designated officers can swear a vassal and i was already sworn to him when i got my commissionand forsworn when he broke off or a count or a counts heir miles cut in i admit the fact that youre previously sworn to gregor as an officer puts a wrinkle in it well just have to change the wording around a bit you re not jesek stared what the hell are you anyway who are you i dont even want to talk about it but i really am a vassal secundus to gregor vorbarra and i can take you for a leigeman and im going to right now because im in a hell of a hurry and we can work out the details later youre a lunatic what the bloody hell do you think this is going to do distract you thought milesand its working already maybe but im a vor lunatic down the engineer fell to his knees staring in disbelief miles captured his hands and began repeat after me i bazil jesek do testify i am am am a forsworn military vassal of gregor vorbarra but i take service anyway underunder bothari will be hot as hell if i break security under this lunatic in front of memake that this vor lunaticas an armsman simple and will hold him as my leige commander until my death or his releases me jesek looking hypnotized repeated the oath verbatim miles began i uhi better skip that parti a vassal secundus to emperor gregor vorbarra do accept your oath and pledge you the protection of a leigecommander this by my word aswell by my word there you now have the dubious privilege of following my orders to the letter and addressing me as my lord only youd better not do it in front of bothari until i get a chance to break the news to him gently oh and one more thing the engineer looked the question bewildered youre home for what its worth jesek shook his head dizzily and staggered to his feet was that real wellits a little irregular but from what ive read of our history i cant help feeling its closer to the original than the official version there was a knock on the door daum and bothari had a prisoner his hands fastened behind him he was the pilot officer by the silver circles on his temples and midforehead miles supposed that was why bothari had picked himhe was bound to know all the recognition codes the defiant set of the mercenarys head gave miles a queasy premonition of trouble baz take elena and the major and start hauling these guys to hold the one with nothing in it they might wake up and get creative so weld the door shut on em then unseal our own weapons cache get the stunners and plasma arcs and check out the mercenary shuttle well meet you there in a few minutes when elena dragged out the last unconscious body by the anklesit was the mercenary captain and she was noticeably not careful what his head bumped on the waymiles shut the door and turned to his prisoner held by bothari and mayhew you know he addressed the man apologetically i sure would appreciate it if we could skip all the preliminaries and go straight to your codes it would save a lot of grief the mercenarys lips curled at this sardonicsour sure it wouldfor you no truth drugs eh too bad shortyyoure out of luck bothari tensed eyes strangely alight miles restrained him with a small movement of one finger not yet sergeant miles sighed youre right he said to the mercenary we have no drugs im sorry but we still must have your cooperation the mercenary snickered stick it shorty we dont mean to kill your friends miles added hopefully just stun them the man raised his head proudly times on my side whatever you can dish out i can take if you kill me i cant talk miles motioned bothari aside this is your department sergeant he said in a low voice seems to me hes right what do you think of trying to board them blind no codes couldnt be any worse than if he gave us a false one we could skip this a nervous wave of his hand indicated the mercenary pilot it would be better with the codes stated the sergeant uncompromisingly safer i dont see how we can get them i can get them you can always break a pilot if you will give me a free hand my lord the expression on botharis face disturbed miles the confidence was all right it was the underlying air of anticipation that put knots in his guts you must decide now my lord he thought of elena mayhew daum and jesek who had followed him to this placewho wouldnt be here but for him go ahead sergeant you may wish to wait in the corridor miles shook his head bellysick no i ordered it ill see it through bothari inclined his head as you will i need the knife he nodded toward the dagger miles had retrieved from the unconscious mercenary captain and hung on his belt miles reluctantly drew it and handed it over botharis face lightened a little at the beauty of the blade its tensile flexibility and incredible sharpness they dont make them like that anymore he muttered what are you planning to do with it sergeant miles wondered but did not quite dare ask if you tell him to drop his trousers im going to stop this session right now codes or no codes they returned to their prisoner who was standing easy still casually defiant miles tried one more time sir i beg you to cooperate the man grinned i just dont buy you shorty im not afraid of a little pain i am afraid thought miles he stepped aside hes yours sergeant hold him still said bothari miles grasped the prisoners right arm mayhew looking puzzled held the left the mercenary took in botharis face and his grin slipped one edge of botharis mouth turned upward in a smile miles had never seen before and immediately hoped he would never see again the mercenary swallowed bothari placed the tip of the dagger against the side of the silver button on the mans right temple and wriggled it a little to slip it beneath the edge the mercenarys eyes shifted right gone whiterimmed you wouldnt dare he whispered a drop of blood ringed the circle in a quick blink the mercenary inhaled sharply and began wait bothari twisted the knife sideways grasped the button between the thumb and fingers of his free hand and yanked a ululating scream broke from the mercenarys throat he lunged convulsively from miless and mayhews grasp and fell to his knees mouth open eyes gone huge in shock bothari dangled the implant before the mans eyes hairfine wires hung like broken spider legs from the silver button body he twirled it with a glittering gleam and a spatter of blood thousands of betan dollars worth of viral circuitry and microsurgery turned instantly to trash mayhew watching went the color of oatmeal at this incredible vandalism the breath went out of him in a tiny moan he turned his back and went to lean against the wall in a corner after a moment he bent over stifling vomiting i wish he hadnt witnessed that thought miles i wish id kept daum instead i wish bothari squatted down to his victims level face to face he raised the knife again and the mercenary pilot recoiled to bash into the wall and slide into a sitting position unable to retreat farther bothari placed the daggers point against the button on the mans forehead pain is not the point he whispered hoarsely he paused then added even more quietly begin the man found his tongue abruptly pouring out betrayal in his terror there was thought miles no question of clever subterfuge in the information tripping frantically out of his mouth miles overcame his own trembling belly to listen intently carefully thoroughly that nothing be lost or missed or wasted unbearable that this sacrifice should be wasted when the man began to repeat himself bothari pulled him cringing to his feet and frog marched him to the shuttle hatch corridor elena and the others stared uncertainly at the mercenary a trickle of blood threading down from his gored temple but asked no questions at the slightest prodding from bothari the captured pilot officer hasty and barely coherent explained the internal layout of the light cruiser bothari pushed him aboard and strapped him in a seat where he collapsed and burst into shocking sobs the others looked away from the prisoner uneasily and chose seats as far from him as possible mayhew sat gingerly before the manual controls of the shuttle and flexed his fingers miles slid in beside him are you going to be able to fly this thing yes my lord miles took in his shaken profile you going to be all right yes my lord the shuttles engines whined to life and they kicked away from the side of the rg did you know he was going to do that mayhew demanded suddenly lowvoiced he glanced back over his shoulder at bothari and his prisoner not exactly mayhews lips tightened crazy bastard look arde you better keep this straight murmured miles what bothari does on my orders is my responsibility not his the hell you say i saw the look on his face he enjoyed that you didnt miles hesitated then repeated himself with a different emphasis hoping to make mayhew understand what bothari does is my responsibility ive known it for a long time so i dont excuse myself he is psychotic then hissed mayhew he keeps himself together but understandif you have a problem about him you see me mayhew swore under his breath youre a pair all right miles studied the mercenary craft in the forward screens as they approached it was a swift and powerful small warship wellarmed there was a bravura brilliance to its lines that suggested illyrican make it was named appropriately the ariel no question that the lumbering rg would have had no chance of escaping it he felt a twinge of envy at its deadly beauty then realized with a start that if things went as planned he was about to own it or at least possess it but the ambiguity of the methods poisoned his pleasure leaving only a dry cold nervousness they came up without challenge or incident on the ariels shuttle hatch and miles floated aft to assist jesek with locking on bothari bound his prisoner more securely to his seat and loomed up beside miles miles decided not to waste time arguing with him about precedence all right miles conceded to his wordless demand you first but im next my reaction time will be quicker if my attention is not divided my lord miles snorted exasperation oh very well you then dno then baz the engineers eyes met his then daum me elena and mayhew bothari approved this schedule with a halfnod the shuttle hatch sighed open and bothari slipped through jesek took a breath and followed miles paused only to whisper elena keep baz moving forward as fast as you can dont let him stop from the ship ahead he heard an exclamationwho the hell and the quiet buzz of botharis stunner then he was through into the corridor only one he asked bothari taking in the crumpled greyandwhite form on the floor so far replied the sergeant we seem to have retained surprise good lets keep it split and move out bothari and daum melted down the first cross corridor jesek and elena headed in the opposite direction elena cast one look backward jesek did not excellent miles thought he and mayhew took the third direction and stopped before the first closed door mayhew stepped forward in a kind of wobbly aggressiveness me first my lord he said god its contagious thought miles go ahead mayhew swallowed and raised his plasma arc uh wait a second arde miles pressed the palm lock the door slid open smoothly he whispered apologetically if its not locked you risk welding it shut that way oh said mayhew he gathered himself and burst through the aperture with a kind of war whoop fanning the room with his stunner then stopped it was a storage area and empty but for a few plastic crates strapped into place no sign of the enemy miles poked his head in for a glance around and stepped back thoughtfully you know he said as they started back up the corridor it might be better if we dont yell going in its startling its bound to be a lot easier to hit people if theyre not jumping around and ducking behind things they do it that way on the vids mayhew offered miles who had originally been planning his own first rush very much along the lines just demonstrated and for much the same reason cleared his throat i guess it just doesnt look very heroic to sneak up behind somebody and shoot them in the back i cant help thinking it would be more efficient though they went up a lift tube and came to another door miles tried the palm lock and again the door slid open revealing a darkened chamber a dormitory with four bunks three of them occupied miles and mayhew tiptoed in and took up cantmiss positions miles closed his fist and they both fired at once he fired again as the third figure began to lurch up from its bedclothes reaching for a weapon hung in a holster by its bunk huh said mayhew women that captain was a pig i dont think theyre prisoners said miles switching on the light for a quick confirmation look at the uniforms theyre part of the crew they withdrew miles very sober perhaps elena had not been in as much danger as the mercenary captain had led them to believe too late now a low voice floated around the corner growling damn it i warned that dumb sonofabitch the speaker followed at a gallop scowling and buckling on a holster belt and ran headlong into them the mercenary officer reacted instantly turning the accidental collision into a tackle mayhew received a kick to the abdomen miles was slammed into the wall and found himself in a clutching scrambling fight for possession of his own arsenal stun him arde he cried muffled by an elbow to his teeth mayhew crawled after the stunner rolled over and fired the mercenary slumped and the nimbus of the bolt took miles dizzily to his knees definitely better to catch them asleep miles mumbled wonder if theres any more like himher it said mayhew definitely rolling the hermaphrodite soldier over to reveal the chiseled features of what could have been either a handsome young man or a strongfaced woman tangled brown hair framed the face and fell across the forehead betan by the accent makes sense miles gasped and struggled back to his feet i think he clutched the wall head pounding queercolored lights scrambling his vision being stunned was not as painless as it looked we better keep moving he leaned gratefully on mayhews supporting arm a dozen more chambers were checked without flushing further quarry they came eventually to nav and com to find two bodies piled by the door and bothari and daum in calm possession engineering reports secure bothari said at once upon seeing them they stunned four that makes seven we got four said miles thickly can you get their computers to cough up a roster and see if that adds up to the total already done my lord said bothari relaxing a little they all seem to be accounted for good miles moreorless fell into a station chair rubbing his twicebattered mouth botharis eyes narrowed are you well my lord caught a little stunner flash ill be all right miles forced himself to focus what next i suppose wed better get these guys locked up before they wake up botharis face became masklike they outnumber us three to one and are technically trained trying to keep them all prisoner is bloody dangerous miles looked up sharply and held botharis eye ill figure something out he bit out each word emphatically mayhew snorted what else can you do push em out the airlock the silence that greeted this joke turned his expression to sick dismay miles shoved to his feet as soon as weve got em nailed down wed better start both ships boosting for the rendezvous the oserans are bound to start looking for their missing ship pretty soon even if they didnt get a distress signal out maybe major daums people can take these guys off our hands eh he nodded to daum who gave a how should i know shrug miles left on rubbery legs to find engineering the first thing miles noticed upon entering the engineering section was the empty socket in the wall for the first aid kit fear flashed through him and he searched the room for elena surely bothari would have reported casualtieswait there she was the bandager not the bandagee jesek was slumped heavily in a station chair and elena was applying something to a burn on his upper arm the engineer was smiling up at elena with a quite fatuous miles thought expression of gratitude the smile ignited to a grin when he saw miles he stoodsomewhat to elenas annoyance as she was trying to fasten the bandage at the timeand gave miles a snappy barrayaran regulation service salute engineering is secured my lord he intoned and then gulped a giggle stifling hysteria miles realized elena pushed him exasperatedly back into his chair where another strangled giggle escaped him miles caught elenas eye how did it go your first combat experience ah he nodded toward jeseks arm we didnt run into anybody on the way down lucky i guess she explained we caught them by surprise coming through the door and stunned two right away a third one had a plasma arc and he ducked down behind those conduits over there then this woman jumped me a wave indicated an unconscious form in grey and white disposed on the deck which probably saved my life because the one with the plasma arc couldnt fire when we were all tangled up wrestling for my stunner she smiled at jesek with enthusiastic admiration baz charged him and knocked him out i got a choke on mine and then baz stunned her and it was all over that took some nerve charging a plasma arc with a stunner the mercenary only got one shot offthats what happened to bazs arm i dont think i would have dared would you miles walked around the room during this recitation mentally reconstructing the action he stirred the inert body of the former plasma arc wielder with the toe of his boot and thought of his own tally for the dayone tottering drunk and two sleeping women jealousy twinged he cleared his throat thoughtfully and looked up no id probably have taken my own plasma arc and tried to burn through the brackets on that overhead light bar and drop it on him then either nail him after he was smashed or else stun him as he jumped out from under oh said elena jeseks grin faded slightly i didnt think of that miles kicked himself mentally asswhat kind of commander tries to score points off a man who needs build up a damned shortsighted one obviously this mess was only beginning he amended himself immediately i might not have either under fire its deceptively easy to secondguess somebody when youre not in the heat yourself you did extremely well mr jesek jeseks face sobered the edge of hysterical glee faded but left a residue of straightness in his spine thank you my lord elena went off to examine one of the unconscious mercenaries and he added to miles in a low voice how did you know how did you know i couldhell i didnt even know myself i thought i could never face fire again he stared voraciously at miles as though he were some mystic oracle or talisman i always knew miles lied cheerfully from the first time i met you its in the blood you know theres more to being vor than the right to tack a funny syllable on the front of your name i always thought that was a load of manure said jesek frankly now he shook his head in wonderment miles shrugged concealing secret agreement well you carry my shovel now thats for damn sure and speaking of workwere going to stuff all these guys into their own brig until we decide uh how to dispose of them is that wound going to incapacitate you or can you make this ship go pretty soon jesek stared around theyve got some pretty advanced systems he began doubtfully his eye fell on miles standing straight as his limitations would allow before him and his voice firmed yes my lord i can miles feeling quite maniacally hypocritical gave the engineer a firm commanders nod copied from observations of his father at staff conferences and the dinner table it seemed to work quite well for jesek collected himself and began an orienting survey of the systems around him miles paused on the way out the door to repeat the instructions for confining the prisoners to elena she cocked her head at him when he finished and how was your first combat experience she inquired softly truculent he grinned involuntarily educational very educational ahdid you two happen to yell charging through the door here she blinked sure why just a theory im working on he swept her a bow of goodhumored mockery and exited the shuttle hatch corridor was lonely and quiet but for the soft susurrations of air circulation and other life support systems miles ducked through the dim shuttle tube and free of the artificial gravity field of the larger ships deck floated forward the mercenary pilot officer was still tied where theyd left him his head and legs lolling in that strange bobbing fashion nullgee gave one miles cringed at the thought of having to explain the mans wound miless calculations about how to keep the man under control on the way to the brig were shattered when he came in view of his face the mercenarys eyes were rolled back his jaw slack his face and forehead were mottled and flushed and scorchingly hot to miless hesitant touch his hands were waxen and icy fingernails empurpled pulse thready and erratic horrified miles scrabbled at the knots binding him then impatiently drew his dagger and cut the cords miles patted his face on the side away from the dried streak of blood but couldnt rouse him the mercenarys body stiffened suddenly and began to jerk and tremble flailing in free fall miles ducked and swore but his voice squeezed upwards to a squeak and he clamped his jaw on it sickbay then get the man to sickbay find the medtech and try to wake him up or failing that get bothari most experienced in first aid miles wrestled the pilot officer through the shuttles hatch when he stepped from free fall into gravity he suddenly found out just how much the man weighed miles first tried to maneuver under him for a shoulder carry to the imminent danger of his own bone structure he staggered a few steps then tried dragging him by the shoulders then the mercenary began to convulse again miles gave up and ran for sickbay and an antigrav stretcher cursing the whole way tears of frustration and fear in his voice it took time to get there time to find the stretcher time to find bothari on the ships intercom and order him in a clipped fierce voice to report to sickbay with the medtech time to run back through the empty ship with the lift unit to the shuttle hatch corridor when miles got there the pilot officer had stopped breathing his face was as waxy as his hands his lips purpleblue as his nails and the dried blood looked like a smear of colored chalk dark and opaque frantic haste made miless fingers seem thick and clumsy as he fitted the unit around the mercenaryhe refused to think of it as the mercenarys bodyand floated him off the floor bothari arrived at sickbay as miles was positioning the mercenary over an examining table and releasing the lift unit whats the matter with him sergeant asked miles urgently bothari glanced over the still form hes dead he said flatly and turned away not yet damn it cried miles weve got to be able to do something to revive him stimulantsheart massagecryostasisdid you find the medtech yes but she was too heavily stunned to rouse miles swore again and began ransacking drawers for recognizable medications and equipment they were disorganized the labels on the outside having apparently no relation to the contents it wont do any good my lord said bothari watching him impassively youd need a surgeon stroke miles rocked back on his heels at last understanding what he had just seen he pictured the implant wires ripped through the mans brain sliding against the rubbery covering of a major artery slicing a fine groove in the heartstressed tubule then the weakness propagated with every pulse until catastrophic failure filled the tissues with the killing hemorrhage did this little sickbay even have a cryogenic chamber miles hastened around the room and into the next searching the freezing process would have to be started immediately or brain death would be too far advanced to be reversednever mind that he had only the vaguest idea of how patients were prepared for freezing or how to operate the device or there it was a portable a gleaming metal chamber on a float pallet looking faintly like some deepsea probe miless heart seemed to fill his throat he approached it its power pack was empty its gas canisters read fully discharged and its control computer was laid open like some crudely dissected biological specimen out of order bothari stood at rest awaiting orders do you require anything further my lord i would feel easier if i could supervise the weapons search of the prisoners myself he gazed on the corpse with indifferent eyes yesno miles walked around the examining table at a distance his eye was drawn to the dark clot on the pilot officers right temple what did you do with his implant nexus bothari looked mildly surprised and checked his pockets i still have it my lord miles held out his hand for the crushed silver spider it weighed no more than the button it resembled its smooth surface concealing the complexity of the hundreds of kilometers of viral circuitry packed within bothari frowned a little watching his face one casualty is not bad for an operation of this nature my lord he offered his life saved many and not just on our side ah said miles dry and cold ill keep that in mind when i come to explain to my father how it was we happened to torture a prisoner to death bothari flinched after a silence he reiterated his interest in the ongoing weapons search and miles released him with a tired nod ill be along shortly miles puttered nervously around sickbay for a few more minutes avoiding looking at the examining table at last moved by an obscure impulse he fetched a basin water and a cloth and washed the dried blood from the mercenarys face so this is the terror he thought that motivates those crazy massacres of witnesses one reads about i understand them now i liked it better when i didnt he drew his dagger and trimmed the trailing wires from the silver button and pressed it carefully back into place on the pilot officers temple after until daum came looking for him with some request for orders he stood and meditated on the still waxen features of the thing theyd made but reason seemed to run backwards conclusions swallowed in premises and premises in silence until in the end only silence and the unanswerable object remained chapter ten miles gestured the injured mercenary captain ahead of him into sickbay with a little jab of his nerve disruptor the deadly weapon seemed unnaturally light and easy in his hand something that lethal should have more heft like a broadsword wrong for murder to be so potentially effortlessone ought to at least have to grunt for it he would have felt happier with a stunner but bothari had insisted that miles present a front of maximum authority when moving prisoners about saves argument hed said the miserable captain auson with two broken arms nose a swollen blot on his face did not look very argumentative but the catlike tension and calculating flicks of glance of ausons first officer the betan hermaphrodite lieutenant thorne reconciled miles to botharis reasoning he found bothari leaning with deceptive casualness against a wall within and the mercenaries frazzledlooking medtech preparing for her next customers miles had deliberately saved auson for last and toyed with a pleasantly hostile fantasy of ordering the captains arms when set immobilized in some anatomically unlikely position thorne was seated to have a cut over one eye sealed and to receive an injection against stunnerinduced migraine the lieutenant sighed as the medication took effect and looked at miles with less squinting curiosity who the hell are you people anyway miles arranged his mouth in what he hoped would be taken for a smile of urbane mystery and said nothing what are you going to do with us thorne persisted good question he thought he had returned to cargo hold to find their first batch of prisoners well along to having one of the bulkheads apart and escape manufactured miles voiced no objection when bothari prudently had them all stunned again for transport to the ariels brig there miles found the chief engineer and her assistants had nearly managed to sabotage the magnetic locks in their cells miles rather desperately had them all stunned again bothari was right it was an intrinsically unstable situation miles could hardly keep the whole crew stunned for a week or more crammed in their little prison without doing them serious physiological damage miless own people were spread too thinly manning both ships guarding the prisoners around the clockand fatigue would soon multiply error botharis murderous and final solution had a certain logic to it miles supposed but his eye fell on the silent sheeted form of the mercenary pilot officer in the corner of the room and he shivered inwardly not again he suppressed jittering panic at his abruptly enlarged troubles and angled for time it would be a favor to admiral oser to put you out now and let you walk home he answered thorne are they all like you out there thorne said stonily the oserans are a free coalition of mercenaries most captains are captainowners miles swore genuinely surprised thats not a chain of command thats a damned committee he stared curiously at auson a shot of pain killer was at last unlocking the big mans attention from his own body and he glowered back is your crew sworn to you then or to admiral oser miles asked him sworn i hold the contracts of everybody on my ship if thats what you mean auson growled everybody he frowned at thorne whose nostrils grew pinched my ship corrected miles ausons mouth rippled in a silent snarl and he glared at the nerve disruptor but as bothari had predicted did not argue the medtech laid the deposed captains arm in a brace and began working over it with a surgical hand tractor auson paled and became more withdrawn miles felt a slight twinge of empathy you are without a doubt the sorriest excuse for soldiers i have seen in my career miles declaimed trolling for reactions one corner of botharis mouth twitched but miles ignored that one its a wonder youre all still alive you must choose your foes very carefully he rubbed his own stillaching stomach and shrugged well i know you do auson flushed a dull red and looked away just trying to stir up a little action weve been on this damned blockade duty a frigging year stir up action thorne muttered disgustedly you would i have you now the certainty reverberated like a bell in miless mind his idle dreams of revenge upon the mercenary captain vaporized in the heat of a new and more breathtaking inspiration his eye nailed auson and he rapped out sharply how long has it been since your last general fleet inspection auson looked as if it had belatedly occurred to him that he ought to be limiting this conversation to names ranks and serial numbers but thorne replied a year and a half miles swore with feeling and raised his chin aggressively i dont think i can take any more of this youre going to have one now bothari maintained an admirable stillness against the wall but miles could feel his eyes boring through his shoulderblades with his sharpest whatthehellareyoudoingnow look miles did not turn what the hell said auson echoing botharis silence are you talking about who are you i had you pegged for a smuggler for sure when you let us shake you down without a squeak but ill swear we didnt miss he surged to his feet causing botharis disruptor to snap to the aim his voice edged upward in frustration you are a smuggler damn it i cant be that wrong was it the ship itself whod want it what the hell are you smuggling he cried plaintively miles smiled coldly military advisors he fancied he could see the hook of his words set in the mercenary captain and his lieutenant now to run in the line miles began inspection with some relish in the sickbay itself since he was fairly sure of his ground there at disruptor point the medtech produced her official inventory and began turning out drawers under miless intent eye with a sure instinct miles focused first on drugs capable of abuse and immediately turned up some nicely embarrassing discrepancies next was equipment miles itched to get to the cryogenic chamber but his sense of showmanship held it for last there were enough other breakdowns some of his grandfathers more acerbic turns of phrase suitably edited had turned the medtechs face to chalk by the time they arrived at the piece de resistance and just how long has this chamber been out of commission medtech six months she muttered the repairs engineer kept saying hed get to it she added defensively at miless frown and raised eyebrows and you never thought to stir him up or more properly ask your superior officers to do so it seemed like there was plenty of time we havent used and in that six months your captain never once even ran an inhouse inspection no sir miles swept auson and thorne with a gaze like a dash of cold water then let his eye deliberately linger on the covered form of the dead man time ran out for your pilot officer how did he die asked thorne sharply like a sword thrust miles parried with a deliberate misunderstanding bravely like a soldier horribly like an animal sacrifice his thought corrected imperative they dont figure that out but im sorry he added impulsively he deserved better the medtech was looking at thorne stricken thorne said gently the cryo chamber wouldnt have done much good for a disruptor blast to the head anyway cela but the next casualty miles interposed might be some other injury excellent that the excessively observant lieutenant had evolved a personal theory as to how the pilot officer happened to be dead without a mark on him miles was vastly relieved not least because it freed him of having to dishonorably burden the medtech with a guilt not rightfully hers i will send you the engineering technician later today miles went on i want every piece of equipment in here operating properly by tomorrow in the meantime you can start putting this place in an order more like a military sickbay and less like a broom closet is that understood medtech he dropped his voice to a whisper like the hiss of a whip the medtech braced to attention and cried yes sir auson was flushed thornes lips were parted in an expression very like appreciation they left her pulling out drawers with trembling hands miles motioned the two mercenaries ahead of him down the corridor and fell behind for an urgent whispered conference with bothari you going to leave her unguarded bothari muttered disapprovingly madness shes too busy to bolt with luck i may even be able to keep her too busy to run an autopsy on that pilot officer quick sergeant if i want to fake a general fleet inspection wheres the best place to dig up dirt on this ship anywhere no really the next stop has got to look bad i cant fake the technical stuff have to wait till baz is ready for a break in that case try crews quarters suggested bothari but why i want those two to figure were some sort of mercenary superoutfit ive got an idea how to keep them from combining to retake their ship theyll never buy it they will buy it theyll love it theyll eat it up dont you see it saves their pride we beat themfor now which do you think theyd rather believe that were great or that theyre a bunch of screwups isnt it plain just watch he skipped a silent dance step composed his face to a mask of sternness and strode after his prisoners his boots ringing like iron down the corridor the crews quarters were from miless point of view a delight bothari did the disassembling his instinct for turning up evidence of slovenly habits and concealed vices was uncanny miles supposed hed seen it all in his time when bothari uncovered the expected bottles of the ethanol addict auson and thorne took it as a matter of course evidently the man was a known and tolerated borderline functional the two kavaweed dopers however seemed to be a surprise to all miles promptly confiscated the lot he left another soldiers remarkable collection of sexual aids in situ however merely inquiring of auson with a quirk of an eyebrow if he were running a cruiser or a cruise ship auson fumed but said nothing miles cordially hoped the captain might spend the rest of the day thinking up scathing retorts too late to use miles studied ausons and thornes own chambers intently for clues to their owners personalities thornes interestingly came closest to passing inspection auson appeared to brace himself for a rampage when they came at last to his own cabin miles smiled silkily and had bothari put everything away after inspection in better order than hed found it it was all those years as an officers batman perhaps when they were done the room appeared quite transformed from the evidence or lack thereof auson himself appeared to have no serious vices beyond a natural indolence exacerbated by boredom into laziness the collection of exotic personal weapons picked up during this tour made an impressive pile miles had bothari examine and test each one he made an elaborate show of noting each substandard item and checking it off against a list of the owners exhilarated and inspired he waxed wonderfully sarcastic the mercenaries squirmed they inspected the arsenal miles took a plasma arc from a dusty rack closing his hand over the control readouts on the grip do you store your weapons charged or uncharged uncharged muttered auson craning his neck slightly miles raised his eyebrows and swung the weapon to point at the mercenary captain finger tightening on the trigger auson went white at the last instant miles flicked his wrist slightly to the left and sent a bolt of energy sizzling past ausons ear the big man recoiled as a molten backsplash of plastic and metal sprayed from the wall behind him uncharged sang miles i see a wise policy im sure both officers flinched as they exited miles heard thorne mutter told you so auson growled wordlessly miles braced baz privately before they began in engineering you are now he told him commander bazil jesek of the dendarii mercenaries chief engineer youre rough and tough and you eat slovenly engineering technicians for breakfast and youre appalled at what theyve done to this nice ship its actually not too bad near as i can tell said baz better than i could do with such an advanced set of systems but how am i going to make an inspection when they know more than i do theyll spot me right away no they wont remember youre asking the questions theyre answering them say hm and frown a lot dont let it start going the other way lookdidnt you ever have an engineering commander who was a real sonofabitch that everybody hatedbut who was always right baz looked confusedly reminiscent there was lieutenant commander tarski we used to sit around thinking up ways to poison him most of them werent very practical all right imitate him theyll never believe me i cantive never beeni dont even have a cigar miles thought a second dashed off and galloped back moments later with a package of cheroots abstracted from one of the mercenarys quarters but i dont smoke worried baz just chew on it then probably better if you dont light it god knows what it might be spiked with now theres an idea for poisoning old tarski that might have worked miles pushed him along all right youre an air polluting sonofabitch and you dont take i dont know for an answer if i can do it he uncorked his argument of desperation you can do it baz paused straightened bit off the end of the cheroot and spat it bravely on the deck he eyed it a moment i slipped on one of those damned disgusting things once nearly broke my neck tarski right he clenched the cheroot between his teeth at an aggressive angle and marched into the main engineering bay miles assembled the entire ships company in their own briefing room and took center stage bothari elena jesek and daum waited in the wings posted in pairs at each exit lethally armed my name is miles naismith i represent the dendarii free mercenary fleet never heard of it called a bold heckler from the blur of faces around miles miles smiled acidly if you had heads would roll in my security department we do not advertise recruitment is by invitation only frankly his gaze swept the crowd making eye contact linking each face one by one to its name and personal possessions if what ive seen so far represents your general standards but for our assignment here youd have gone right on not hearing of us auson thorne and the chief engineer subdued and weary from fourteen hours of being draggedrakedover every weld weapon tool data bank and supply room from one end of the ship to the other had scarcely a twitch left in them but auson looked wistful at the thought miles paced back and forth before his audience radiating energy like a caged ferret we do not normally draft recruits particularly from such dismal raw material after yesterdays performance i personally would have no compunction at disposing of you all by the swiftest means just to improve the military tone of this ship he scowled upon them fiercely they looked nervous uncertain was there just the slightest hangdog shuffle there onward but your lives have been begged for you upon a point of honor by a better soldier than most of you can hope to be he glanced pointedly at elena who prepared raised her chin and stood in a sort of parade rest indicating to all the source of this unusual mercy actually miles wondered if she wouldnt have personally shoved auson at least out the nearest airlock but having cast her in the role of commander elena bothari my executive officer and unarmed combat instructor it had occurred to him that he had the perfect setup for a fast round of good guybad guy and so i have agreed to the experiment to put it in terms you are familiar withformer captain auson has yielded your contracts to me that stirred them into outraged murmuring a couple of them rose from their seats a dangerous precedent fortunately they hesitated as if uncertain whether to start for miless throat first or captain ausons before the ripple of motion could become an unstoppable tidal wave bothari brought his disruptor to aim with a good loud slap against his other hand botharis lips were drawn back in a canine grimace and his pale eyes blazed the mercenaries lost the moment the ripple died those who had risen sat back down carefully their hands resting plainly and demurely upon their knees damn thought miles enviously i wish i could muster that much menace the trick of it alas was that it was not a trick at all botharis ferocity was palpably sincere elena aimed her nerve disruptor in a white nervous grip her eyes wide but then an obviously nervous person with a lethal weapon has a brand of menace all their own and more than one mercenary spared a glance from the sergeant to the other possible source of crossfire a male mercenary attempted a prudent placating smile palms out elena snarled under her breath and the smile winked out hastily miles raised his voice and overrode the lingering whispers of confusion by dendarii regulation you will all start at the same rankthe lowest recruittrainee this is not an insult every dendarii including myself has started there your promotions will be by demonstrated abilitydemonstrated to me due to your previous experience and the needs of the moment your promotions will probably be much more rapid than usual what this means in effect is that any one of you could find yourself the brevet captain of this ship within weeks the murmur became suddenly thoughtful what this meant in effect thought miles was that he had just succeeded in dividing all the lowerranking echelons from their former seniors he nearly grinned as ambition visibly lit a scattering of faces and had he ever lit a fire under those seniorsthorne and auson stared at each other in edgy speculation your new training will begin immediately those not assigned to training groups this shift will temporarily recommence their old duties any questions he held his breath his scheme pivoted on the point of a pin he would know in a minute whats your rank asked a mercenary miles decided to stay flexible you may address me as mr naismith there let them build theories on that then how do we know who to obey asked the original hardeyed heckler miles bared his teeth in a scimitar smile well if you disobey one of my orders ill shoot you on the spot you figure it out he drummed his fingers lightly on his holstered nerve disruptor some of botharis aura seemed to have rubbed off on him for the heckler wilted a mercenary held up her hand serious as a child at school yes trainee quinn when do we get copies of the dendarii regulations miless heart seemed to stop he hadnt thought of that one it was such a reasonable requestthe sort of commander miles was trying to pass himself off as should know his regs by heart or sleep with them under his pillow or something he produced a drymouthed smile and croaked boldly tomorrow ill have copies distributed to everyone copies of what ill figure something out there was a silence then another voice from the back popped up what kind of insurance package does the the dendariis have do we get a paid vacation and another do we get any perqs whats the pay scale and yet another will our pensions carry over from our old contracts is there a retirement plan miles nearly bolted from the room confounded by this spate of practical questions he had been prepared for defiance disbelief a concerted unarmed rush he had a sudden maniac vision of vorthalia the bold demanding a wholelife policy from his emperor at swords point he gulped down total confusion and forged ahead ill distribute a brochure he promisedhe had a vague idea that sort of information came in brochureslater as for fringe benefits he barely managed to turn a glassy stare into an icy one i am permitting you to live further privileges will have to be earned he surveyed their faces confusion yes that was what he wanted dismay division and most of all distraction perfect let them swirled upsidedown in this gush of flimflam forget that their primary duty was to retake their own ship forget it for just a week keep them too busy to think for just a week a week was all he needed after that theyd be daums problem there was something else in their faces though he could not quite put his finger on it no matterhis next task was to get off stage gracefully and get them all moving and get a minute alone with bothari commander elena bothari has a list of your assignments see her on your way out attention he put a snap in his voice they shuffled raggedly to their feet as if the posture were but dimly remembered dismissed yes before they came up with any more bizarre questions and his invention failed him he caught a snatch of sotto voce conversation as he marched out homicidal runt lunatic yes but with a commander like that theres a chance i might survive my next battle he recognized the somethingelse in their faces suddenlyit was that same unnerving hunger he had seen in mayhews and jeseks it generated an unaccountable coldness in the pit of his belly he motioned sergeant bothari aside do you still have that old copy of the barrayaran imperial service regs that you used to carry around botharis bible it was miles had sometimes wondered if the sergeant had ever read another book yes my lord bothari gave him a fishy stare as if to say now what miles sighed relief good i want it what for dendarii fleet regulations bothari looked poleaxed youll never ill run it through the computer make a copygo through and chop out all the cultural references change the namesit shouldnt take too long my lordthose are the old regulations the flat bass voice was almost agitated when those gutless slugs get a look at the old discipline parades miles grinned yeah if they saw the specs for those leadlined rubber hoses theyd probably faint dead away dont worry ill update them as i go along your father and the general staff did that fifteen years ago it took them two years well thats what happens with committees bothari shook his head but told miles where to find the old data disc among his things elena joined the conference looking nervous but impressive miles thought like a thoroughbred horse ive got them divided up into groups by your list she reported now what go ahead and take your group to the gym now and start the physed class general conditioning then start teaching them what your fathers taught you ive never taught anybody before he smiled up at her willing confidence into her face her eyes her spine look you can probably kill the first two days just having them demonstrate what they know on each other while you stand around and say um and hm and god help us and things like that the important thing isnt to teach them anything but to keep them busy wear them out dont give them time to think or plan or combine their forces its only for a week if i can do it he said manfully you can do it ive heard that before somewhere she muttered and you sergeanttake your group and start them on weapons drills if you run out of barrayaran drills the oseran standard procedures are in the computers you can filch some of them ride them baz will be running his people into the ground down in engineeringspring cleaning like theyve never had before and after ive gotten these regs straightened around we can start quizzing them on those too tire em out my lord said the sergeant sternly there are twenty of them and four of us at the end of the week who do you think is going to be tireder he slipped into vehemence my first responsibility is your hide damn it im thinking of my hide believe me and you can best cover my hide by going out there and making them believe im a mercenary commander youre not a commander youre a bloody holovid director muttered bothari the editing job on the imperial regulations proved larger and more grueling than miles had anticipated even the wholesale slaughter of such chapters as those detailing instructions for purely barrayaran ceremonies such as the emperors birthday review left an enormous mass of material miles slashed into it gutting almost as fast as he could read it was the closest look he had ever given to military regulations and he meditated on them deep in the night cycle organization seemed to be the key to get huge masses of properly matched men and material to the right place at the right time in the right order with the swiftness required to even grasp survivalto wrestle an infinitely complex and confusing reality into the abstract shape of victoryorganization it seemed might even outrank courage as a soldierly virtue he recalled a remark of his grandfathersmore battles have been won or lost by the quartermasters than by any general staff it had been apropos a classic anecdote about a quartermaster who had issued the young guerilla generals troops the wrong ammunition i had him hung by his thumbs for a day grandfather had reminisced but prince xav made me take him down miles fingered the dagger at his waist and removed five screens of regulations about shipmounted plasma weapons obsolete for a generation his sclera were red and his cheeks hollow and grey with beard stubble at the end of the night cycle but he had boiled his plagarization down into a neat fierce little handbook for getting everybodys weapons pointed in the same direction he pressed it into elenas hands to be copied and distributed before staggering off to wash and change clothes the better to present a front of eagleeyed as opposed to pieeyed command before his new troops done he murmured to her does this make me a space pirate she groaned miles did his best to be seen everywhere that day cycle he reinspected sickbay and gave it a grudging pass he observed both elenas and the sergeants classes trying to look as if he were noting every mercenarys performance with stern appraisal and not in truth nearly falling asleep on his feet he squeezed time for a private conversation with mayhew now manning the rg alone to bring him up to date and bolster his confidence in the new scheme for holding the prisoners he drew up some superficial written tests of his new dendarii regulations for elena and bothari to administer the mercenary pilot officers funeral was in the afternoon ship time miles made it a pretext for a rigorous inspection of the mercenaries personal gear and uniforms a proper parade for the sake of example and courtesy he turned himself and the botharis out in the best clothes they had from his grandfathers funeral their somber brilliance artistically complimented the mercenaries crisp greyand whites thorne pale and silent observed the sharp turnout with a strange gratitude miles was rather pale and silent himself and breathed an inward sigh of relief when the pilot officers body was at last safely cremated his ashes scattered in space miles allowed auson to conduct the brief ceremonies unhindered his most soaring thespian hypocrisy miles felt was not up to taking over this function he withdrew afterward to the cabin he had appropriated telling bothari he wanted to study the oserans real regulations and procedures but his concentration was failing him odd flashes of formless movement occurred in his peripheral vision he lay down but could not rest he resumed pacing with his uneven stride notions for finetuning his prisoner scheme tumbling through his brain but then escaping him he was grateful when elena interrupted him with a status report he confided to her rather randomly a half dozen of his new ideas then asked her anxiously do they seem to be buying it im not sure how im coming across are they going to accept orders from a kid she grinned major daum seems to have taken care of that angle apparently he bought what you told him daum what did i tell him about your rejuvenation treatment my what he seems to think you were on leave from the dendarii to go to beta colony for a rejuvenation treatment isnt that what you told him hell no miles paced i told him i was there for medical treatment yesthought it would account for this a vague wave of his hand indicating the peculiarities of his body combat injuries or something butthere isnt any such thing as a betan rejuvenation treatment thats just a rumor its their public health system and the way they live and their genetics you may know it but a lot of nonbetans dont daum seems to think youre not only older but er a lot older well naturally he believes it then if he thought it up himself miles paused bel thorne must know better though bels not contradicting it she smirked i think it has a crush on you miles rubbed his hands through his hair and over his numb face baz must realize this rejuvenation rumor is nonsense too better caution him not to correct anybody though it works to my advantage i wonder what he thinks i am i thought hed have figured it out by now oh baz has his own theory iits my fault really fathers always so worried about political kidnappers i thought id better lead baz astray good what kind of fairy tale did you cook up for him i think youre right about people believing things they make up themselves i swear i didnt plant any of this i just didnt contradict it he knows youre a counts son since you swore him in as an armsmanarent you going to get in trouble for that miles shook his head ill worry about that if we live through this just so he doesnt figure out which counts son well i think you did a good thing it seems to mean a lot to him anyway he thinks youre about his age your father whoever he was disinherited you and exiled you from barrayar to she faltered to get you out of sight she finished raising her chin bravely ah said miles a reasonable theory he came to the end of a circuit in his pacing and stood absorbed apparently by the bare wall in front of him you mustnt blame him for it i dont he smiled a quick reassurance and paced again you have a younger brother who has usurped your rightful place as heir he grinned in spite of himself baz is a romantic hes an exile himself isnt he she asked quietly father doesnt like him but he wont say why she looked at him expectantly i wont either then itsits not my business but hes your leigeman now all right so it is my business i just wish it werent but baz will have to tell you himself she smiled at him i knew youd say that oddly the nonanswer seemed to content her how did your last combat class go i hope they all crawled out on their hands and knees she smiled tranquilly very nearly some of the technical people act like they never expected to do that kind of fighting others are awfully goodive kind of got them working on the klutzy ones thats just right he approved eagerly conserve your own energy expend theirs youve grasped the principle she glowed in his praise youve got me doing so many things ive never done before new people things id never dreamed of yes he stumbled im sorry i got you into this nightmare ive been demanding so much of youbut ill get you out my word on it dont be scared her mouth set in indignation im not scared wellsome but i feel more alive than ive ever been you make anything seem possible the longedfor admiration in her eyes perturbed him it was too much like hunger elenathis whole thing is balanced on a hoax if those guys out there wake up and realize how badly they have us outnumbered well crash like he cut himself off that wasnt what she needed to hear he rubbed his eyes fingertips pressing hard against them and paced its not balanced on a hoax she said earnestly you balance it isnt that what i said he laughed shakily she studied him through narrowed eyes when was the last time you slept oh i dont know ive lost track with the ships on different clocks that reminds me got to get them on the same clock ill switch the rg thatll be easier well all keep oseran time it was before the jump anyway a day before the jump have you had dinner dinner lunch lunch was there lunch i was getting things ready for the funeral i guess she looked exasperated breakfast i ate some of their field rations when i was working on the regs last nightlook im short i dont need as much as you overgrown types he paced on her face grew sober miles she said and hesitated how did that pilot officer die he looked well not all right but he was alive in the shuttle did he jump you his stomach did a rollercoaster flop my god do you think i murdered but he had surely as surely as if he had held a disruptor to the mans head and fired he had no desire to detail the events in the rgs wardroom to elena they looped in his memory violent images flashing over and over botharis crime his crime a seamless whole miles are you all right her voice was alarmed he realized he was standing still with his eyes shut tears were leaking between the lids miles sit down youre hyper cant sit down if i stop ill he resumed his circuit limping mechanically she stared at him her lips parted then shut her mouth abruptly and slammed out the door now he had frightened her offended her perhaps even sabotaged her carefully nurtured confidence he swore at himself savage he was sinking in a black and sucking bog gluey viscous terror sapping his vital forward momentum he waded on blindly elenas voice again bouncing off the walls i think youll have to sit on him ive never seen him this bad miles looked up into the precious ugly face of his personal killer bothari compressed his lips and sighed right ill take care of it elena eyes wide with concern but mouth calm with confidence in bothari withdrew bothari grasped miles by the back of the collar and belt frogmarched him over to the bed and sat him down firmly drink oh hell sergeantyou know i cant stand scotch tastes like paint thinner i will said bothari patiently hold your nose and pour it down your throat if i have to miles took in the flinty face and prudently choked down a slug from the flask which he recognized vaguely as confiscated from mercenary stock bothari with matteroffact efficiency stripped him and slung him into bed drink again blech it burned foully down his throat now sleep cant sleep too much to do got to keep them moving wonder if i can fake a brochure i suppose deathgild is nothing but a primitive form of life insurance at that elena cant possibly be right about thorne hope to god my father never finds out about thissergeant you wont i thought of a docking drill with the rg his protests trailed off to a mumble and he rolled over and slept dreamlessly for sixteen hours chapter eleven a week later he was still in command miles took to haunting the mercenary ships control room as they neared their destination daums rendezvous was a rare metals refinery in the systems asteroid belt the factory was a mobile of chaotic structures strung together by girdering and powersats winged by its vast solar collectors junkyard art a few lights winked picking out bright reflections and leaving the rest in charitable dimness too few lights miles realized as they approached the place looked shut down an off shift not likely it represented too large an investment to let stand idle for the sake of its masters biology by rights the smelteries should be operating around the clock to feed the war effort tow ships with ore chunks should be jockeying for docking space outgoing freighters should be wheeling away with their military escorts in a trafficcontrol minuet are they still answering your recognition codes correctly miles asked daum he barely kept himself from shifting from foot to foot yes but daum looked strained he doesnt like the looks of this either miles thought shouldnt a strategically important installation like this be more actively guarded surely the pelians and the oserans have got to be trying to knock it out where are your picket ships i dont know daum moistened his lips and stared into the screen we have a live transmission now sir the mercenary communications officer reported a felician colonel appeared in the viewscreen fehun thank god cried daum the tension melted in his face miles let out his breath for a horrible moment hed been crushed by a vision of being unable to unload his prisoners along with daums cargo and then what he was quite as exhausted by the week as bothari had predicted and looked forward with a shiver of relief to its ending lieutenant thorne coming on station smiled and gave miles a neat salute miles pictured the look on thornes face when the masquerade and betrayal were at last revealed his ballooning anticipation turned to lead in his stomach he returned the salute and concealed his queasiness by turning to watch daums conversation maybe he could arrange to be elsewhere when the trap was sprung made it daum was saying where is everybody this place looks deserted there was a flash of static and the military figure in the screen shrugged we drove off an attack by the pelians a few weeks ago the solar collectors were damaged were awaiting the repair crews now how are things at home have we freed barinth yet another flash of static the colonel seated behind his desk nodded and said the war is going well the colonel had a tiny sculpture on his desk miles noticed a mosaic horse cleverly formed of assorted scrap electronic parts soldered together no doubt by some refinery technician in his off hours miles thought of his grandfather and wondered what kind of horses they had on felice had they ever slipped back enough technologically to have used horse cavalry great daum chortled avid upon his fellow felicians face i took so long on beta i was afraidso were still in business ill buy you a drink when we get in you old snake and well toast the premier together how is miram static the family is well the colonel said gravely static stand by for docking instructions miles stopped breathing the little horse which had been on the colonels right hand was now on his left yes agreed daum happily and we can carry on without all this garbage on the channel is that you making the white noise there was another blat of static our communications equipment was damaged in an attack by the pelians a few weeks ago now the horse was back on the right white fuzz on the screen stand by for docking instructions now the left miles felt like screaming instead he motioned the communications officer to kill the channel its a trap miles said the instant they were off transmission what daum stared fehun benar is one of my oldest friends he wouldnt betray you havent been talking to colonel benar youve been having a synthesized conversation with a computer but his voiceprint oh it really was benarprerecorded something on his desk was flipping around between those blasts of static they were being deliberately transmitted to cover the discontinuitiesalmost careless of somebody they probably recorded his responses in more than one session pelians grunted thorne cant do anything right daums tan skin greyed he wouldnt betray they probably had a fair amount of time to prepare there are miles took a breath there are lots of ways to break a man i bet there was an attack by the pelians a few weeks agoonly it wasnt driven off it was over then surrender inevitable the rg and its cargo would be confiscated daum taken prisoner of war miles and his leigepeople interned if they werent shot outright barrayaran security would ransom him eventually miles supposed with all due scandal then the betan calhoun with godknewwhat civil charges then home at last to explain it all before the ultimate tribunal his father miles wondered if he waived his class iii diplomatic immunity on beta colony could he be jailed there instead but no the betans didnt jail offenders they cured them daums eyes were wide his mouth taut yes he hissed convinced what do we do sir youre asking me thought miles wildly help help help he stared around at the faces in the room daum elena baz the mercenary technicians thorne and auson they gazed back with interested confidence as if he were a goose about to lay a golden egg bothari leaned against the wall his stance for once devoid of suggestions theyre asking why our transmission was interrupted reported the communications officer urgently miles swallowed and produced his first cockatrice pipe them some gooey music he ordered and put a technical difficultiesplease stand by sign on the video the communications officer grinned and snapped to obey well that took care of the next ninety seconds auson his arms still immobilized looked as sick as miles felt doubtless he was not looking forward to explaining his humiliating capture to his admiral thorne was crackling with suppressed excitement the lieutenant is about to get revenge for this week mused miles miserably and knows it thorne was standing at attention orders sir my god thought miles dont they realize theyre free and more wildly with new rocketing hopethey followed me home dad can i keep them thorne experienced knew the ship soldiers and equipment intimately not with facile surface gloss but with true depth more vital still thorne had forward momentum miles stood straight as he could and barked so trainee thorne you think youre fit to command a warship eh thorne came to a stiffer attention chin raised eagerly sir weve been presented with a most interesting little tactical exercisethat was the phrase his father had used to describe the conquest of komarr miles recalledim going to give you the chance at it we can keep the pelians on hold for about one more minute as a commander how would you handle this miles folded his arms and tilted his head in the style of a particularly intimidating proctor from his candidacy exams trojan horse said thorne instantly ambush their ambush and take the station from withinyou do want it captured intact dont you ah said miles faintly that would be fine he dredged his mind rapidly for some likelysounding militaryadvisortype noises but they must have some ships concealed around here somewhere what do you propose to do about them once youve committed yourself to defending an immobile base is the refinery even armed it can be in a few hours daum put in with the maser scramblers weve got in the hold of the rg cannibalize the powersatstime permitting even repair the solar collectors to charge them maser scramblers muttered auson i thought you said you were smuggling military advisors miles quickly raised his voice and overrode this remember that personnel are in short supply and definitely not expendable right now particularly dendarii officers thorne bore a thoughtful look miles was momentarily terrified that hed overdone his critiqueing causing thorne to throw the problem back on him convince me then trainee thorne that taking a base is not tactically premature miles invited hastily yes sir well the defending ships we need to worry about are almost certainly oseran the pelian shipbuilding capacity is way under parthey dont have the biotech for jump ships at all and we have all the oseran codes and procedures but they dont know a thing about our dendarii ones i think iwe can take them our dendarii miless mind echoed very well trainee thorne go ahead he ordered in a fine loud decisive voice i wont interfere unless you get in over your head he shoved his hands in his pockets by way of emphasis also to keep from biting his nails take us into dock then without tipping them off thorne said ill ready the boarding party may i have commander jesek and commander bothari miles nodded sergeant bothari sucked in his breath but said nothing dutyglued to miless back thorne dazzled with visions of captaincy dashed out followed by the drafted advisors elenas face shone with excitement baz rolled a rather soggy cigar stump between his teeth and strode after her eyes gleaming unreadably there was color in his face miles noted auson stood downcast face furrowed with anger shame and suspicion theres a mutiny looking for a place to happen thought miles he lowered his voice for the big mans ear alone may i point out youre still on the sick list trainee auson auson waggled his arms i couldve had these off day before yesterday damn it may i also point out that while ive promised trainee thorne a command i have not said of what ship an officer must be able to obey as well as command to each his own test to each his own reward ill be watching you too theres only one ship youre full of assumptions a bad habit youre full of auson shut his mouth with a snap and gave miles a long thoughtful stare tell them were ready for docking instructions miles nodded to daum miles itched to be part of the fight but discovered to his dismay the mercenaries had no space armor small enough to fit him bothari grunted frank relief miles then thought of going along in a simple pressure suit if not at the front of the rush then at least at the rear bothari nearly choked at the suggestion i swear ill knock you down and sit on you if you go near those suits he snarled insubordination sergeant miles hissed back bothari glanced up the line at the mercenaries assembling in the armory to be sure he was not overheard im not hauling your body back to barrayar to dump at my lord counts feet like something the bloody cat caught the sergeant traded a driven glare for miless irritated frown miles in dim recognition of a man pushed to his limit backed down grudgingly what if id passed my officers training exams he asked you couldnt have stopped me from this sort of thing then id have retired bothari muttered while i still had my honor miles grinned involuntarily and consoled himself with checking equipment and weapons for those who were going the week of vigorous repair and refurbishment had clearly paid unexpected dividends the combat group seemed to gleam with wicked efficiency now miles thought we shall see if all this beauty is more than skin deep he took particular care over elenas armor bothari arranged her comm leads himself before attaching her helmet unnecessary business concealing most necessary rapid whispered instructions about how to handle herself in the onlyhalffamiliar equipment for gods sake hang back miles told her youre supposed to be observing everybodys efficiency and reporting to me anyway which you cant do if youre he swallowed the rest of his sentence grisly visions of all the ways a beautiful woman could get mangled in combat skidding through his brain if youre in front he substituted surely hed been out of his scattered wits to let thorne claim her her features were framed in the helmet hair drawn back and hidden so that the strong structure of her face sprang out half knight half nun her cheekbones were emphasized by the winged cheekpieces ivory skin glowing in the tiny colored lights of her helmet readouts her lips were parted in exhilaration they curved at him yes my lord her eyes were bright and fearless thank you and more quietly her gloved hand tightening on his arm for emphasis thank you milesfor the honor she had not quite mastered the touch of the servos and mashed his flesh to the bone miles who would not have moved to destroy the moment if shed accidentally torn his arm off smiled back with no more than a blink of pain god what have i done he thought she looks like a valkyrie he dropped back for a quick word with baz do me a favor commander jesek would you stick close to elena and make sure she keeps her head down shes uh a little excited absolutely my lord jesek nodded emphatically id follow her anywhere um said miles that hadnt been exactly what hed meant to convey my lord baz added then hesitated and lowered his voice this ah commander businessyou didnt mean that as a real promotion did you it was for show right he jerked his head toward the mercenaries now being counted off into assault groups by thorne its as real as the dendarii mercenaries miles replied not quite able to manage an outright lie to his leigeman bazs eyebrows lifted and what does that mean well my faa person i knew once said that meaning is what you bring to things not what you take from them he was talking about vor as it happened miles paused then added carry on commander jesek bazs eyes glinted amusement he came to attention and returned miles an ironic deliberate salute yes siradmiral naismith miles dogged by bothari returned to the mercenaries tactics room to monitor the battle channels alongside auson and the communications officer daum remained posted in the control room with the engineering technician who was substituting for the dead pilot to guide them into the docking station now miles really did chew his nails auson clicked the plastic immobilizers on his arms together in a nervous tattoo the limit of their motion they caught each other looking sideways simultaneously what would you give to be out there shorty miles hadnt realized his anguish was so transparent he did not even bother to be offended by the nickname about fifteen centimeters of height captain auson he replied wistfully frank the breath of a genuine laugh escaped the mercenary officer as if against his will yeah his mouth twisted in agreement oh yeah miles watched fascinated as the communications officer began pulling in telemetry from the assault groups battle armor the holovid screen split to display sixteen individuals readouts at once was a confettilike confusion he framed a cautious remark hoping to get more information without revealing his own ignorance very nice you can see and hear what each of your men are seeing and hearing miles wondered which information bits were the key ones a trained person could tell at a glance he was sure where was it built ive ahnever seen this particular model illyrica said auson proudly the system came with the ship one of the best you can buy ah which one is commander bothari what was her suit number six shes at the upper right of the screen see theres the suit number keys for visual audio their suittosuit battle channels our shiptosuit battle channelswe can actually control the servos on any suit right from here both miles and bothari studied the display intently wouldnt that be a bit confusing for the individual to be suddenly overridden miles asked well you dont do that too often its supposed to be for things like operating the suit medkits pulling back the injured to tell the truth im not completely sold on that function the one time i was on this end and tried to pull out a wounded man his armor was so damaged by the blast that got him it barely worked at all i lost most of the telemetryfound out why when we mopped up his head had been blown off id spent twenty frigging minutes walking a corpse back through the airlocks how often have you used the system miles asked auson cleared his throat well twice actually bothari snorted miles raised an eyebrow we were on that damned blockade duty so long auson hastened to explain everybody likes a bit of easy work sure but maybe we were on it too long that was my impression too miles agreed blandly auson shifted uncomfortably and returned his attention to his tactics displays they were on the verge of docking the assault groups were poised ready the rg was maneuvering into a parallel bay lagging behind the pelians had cannily instructed the warship to dock first no doubt planning to pick off the unarmed freighter at their leisure miles wished desperately that hed had some prearranged code by which to warn mayhew still manning the freighter alone what was up but without scrambled communications channels he risked tipping their hand to the listening pelians hopefully thornes surprise attack would pull whatever troops were waiting away from the rg the moments silence seemed to stretch unbearably miles finally managed to pick out the medical readouts from the battle armor elenas pulse rate was an easy beats a minute jeseks beside her was running about miles wondered what his own was something astronomical by the feel of it does the opposition have anything like this asked miles suddenly an idea beginning to boil up in his mind perhaps he could be more than an impotent observer the pelians dont some of the more advanced ships in ourin the oseran fleet do that pocket dreadnought of captain tungs for instance betanbuilt auson emitted an envious sigh hes got everything miles turned to the communications officer are you picking up anything like that from the other side anybody waiting in the docking bay in battle armor its scrambled said the communications officer but id guess our reception committee to run about thirty individuals botharis jaw tightened at this news thorne getting this asked miles of course are they picking up ours only if theyre looking for it said the communications officer they shouldnt be were tightbeamed and scrambled too two to one muttered auson unhappily nasty odds lets try and even it up said miles he turned to the communications officer can you break their codes get into their telemetry you have the oseran codes dont you the communications officer looked suddenly thoughtful it doesnt work exactly that way but his sentence trailed off in his absorption with his equipment ausons eye lit you thinking of taking over their suits walking them into walls having them shoot each other the light went out ah helltheyve all got manual overrides the second they figure out whats going on theyll cut us off it was a nice idea though miles grinned we wont let them figure it out then well be subtle you think too much in terms of brute force trainee auson now brute force has never been my strong suit got it the communications officer cried the holovid plates threw up a second display beside the first theres ten of them over there with fullfeedback armor the rest seem to be pelianstheir armor only has comm links but there are the ten ah beautiful here sergeant take over our monitors miles moved to the new station and stretched his fingers like a concert pianist about to play now ill show you what i mean what we want to do is simulate a lot of little tiny suit malfunctions he zeroed in on one soldier medical telemetryphysiological supportthere observe he pinpointed the reservoir from the mans pilot relief tube already half full must be a nervous sort of fellow he set it to backwash at full power and checked the audio transmitter savage swearing filled the air briefly overridden by a snarl calling for radio silence now there is one distracted soldier and theres not a thing he can do about it until he gets somewhere he can take the suit off auson beside him choked with laughter you deviousminded little bastard yes yes he pounded his feet in lieu of his hands and swung about in his own seat he called up the readings from another soldier pecking out the commands slowly with his few working fingertips remember cautioned miles subtle auson still cackling muttered right he bent over his control panel there there he sat up grinning every third servo command now operates on a halfsecond time lag and his weapons will fire ten degrees to the right of where he aims them very good miles applauded wed better save the rest until theyre in critical positions not tip our hand with too much too soon right the ship was moving closer closer to the docking station the enemy troops were preparing to board through the normal flex tubes suddenly thornes assault groups exploded from the dockside airlocks magnetic mines were hastily fired onto the station hull where they flared like sparks burning holes in a rug thornes mercenaries jumped the gap and poured through the enemys radio silence burst into shocked chaos miles hummed over his readouts an enemy officer turned her head to look over her shoulder calling orders to her platoon miles promptly locked the helmet in its position of maximum torsion and the oserans head perforce with it he picked out another soldier in a corridor his own people had not yet reached and locked his suits builtin heavyduty plasma arc into fullon fire flared wildly from the mans hand at his surprised reflexive recoil spraying floor ceiling and comrades miles paused to glance over to elenas readouts a corridor was flowing past at high speed on the visual it spun wildly as she used her suits jets to brake the artificial gravity was evidently now shut down in the docking station an automatic air seal had clanged shut blocking the corridor she stopped her spin aimed and blasted a hole in it with her plasma arc she flung herself through it as at the same moment an enemy soldier on the other side did likewise they met in a confused scrambling grapple servos screaming at the overload demands miles searched frantically for the enemy among the ten readouts but he was a pelian miles had no access to his suit his heart pounded in his ears there was another view of the fight between elena and the pelian on the screens miles had a dizzy sense of being in two places at once as if his atman had left his body then realized he was looking at them through another oserans suit the oseran was raising his weapon to firehe couldnt miss miles called up the mans medkit and fired every drug in it into the mans veins at once the audio transmitted a shuddering gasp the heartbeat readout jumped crazily and then registered fibrillation another figurebazin the ariels armor rolled through the gash in the air seal firing as he flew the plasma washed over the oseran interrupting transmission sonofabitch auson screamed suddenly at miless elbow where in hell did he come from miles thought at first he was referring to the armored soldier then followed the direction of ausons gaze to another screen showing space opposite the docking station looming up behind them was a large oseran warship chapter twelve miles swore in frustration of course oseran fullfeedback space armor logically implied an oseran monitor nearby he should have realized it instantly fool he was to have simply assumed the enemy was being directed from inside the docking station he ground his teeth in chagrin he had totally forgotten in the overwhelming excitement of the attack in his particular terror for elena the first principle of larger commands dont get balled up in the little details it was no consolation that auson appeared to have forgotten it too the communications officer hastily abandoned the game of suit sabotage and returned to his proper post theyre calling for surrender sir he reported miles licked dry lips and cleared his throat ahsuggestions trainee auson auson gave him a dirty look its that snob tung hes from earth and never lets you forget it he has four times our shielding and firepower three times our acceleration three times our crew and thirty years experience i dont suppose youd care to consider surrender youre right miles said after a moment i dont care for it the assault on the docking station was nearly over thorne and company were already moving into adjoining structures for the moppingup victory swallowed so swiftly by defeat unbearable miles groped vainly in the pit of his inspiration for a better idea its not very elegant he said at last but were at such incredibly short range its at least possiblewe could try to ram them auson mouthed the words my ship he found his voice my ship the finest technology illyrica will sell and you want to use it for a frigging medieval battering ram shall we boil some oil and fling it at em while were at it throw a few rocks his voice went up an octave and cracked i bet they wouldnt expect it offered miles a little quelled ill strangle you with my bare hands auson trying to raise them rediscovered the limits of his motion uh sergeant miles called retreating before the rapidly breathing mercenary captain bothari uncoiled from his chair his narrow eyes mapped auson coldly like a coroner planning his first cut its got to be at least tried miles reasoned not with my ship you dont you little ausons language sputtered into body language his balance shifted to free one foot for a karate kick my god look cried the communications officer the rg torpid massive was rolling away from the docking station its normal space drives blared at full power giving it the usual acceleration of an elephant swimming in molasses auson dropped unheeded from miless attention the rg loaded has four times the mass of that pocket dreadnought he breathed which is why it flies like a pig and costs a fortune in fuel to move yelled auson that pilot officer of yours is crazy if he thinks he can outrun tung go arde cried miles jumping up and down perfect youll pin him right up against that smelting unit hes not began auson sonofabitch he is tung like auson was apparently late in divining the bulk freighters true intentions verniers began to flare to rotate the warship into position to thrust toward open space the dreadnought got one shot off which was absorbed with little visible effect in the freighters cargo area then almost in slow motion with a kind of crazy majesty the rg lumbered into the warshipand kept going the dreadnought was nudged into the huge smeltery projecting equipment and surface housings snapped and spun off in all directions action calling for reaction after an aching moment the smeltery heaved back a wave of motion passed down its adjoining structures like a giants game of crackthewhip smashed edges of the dreadnought were caught up on the smeltery thoroughly entangled gaudy chemical fires gouted here and there into the vacuum the rg drifted off miles stood before the tactics room screen and stared in stunned fascination as half the freighters outer hull delaminated and peeled into space the rg was the final detail to be mopped up in the capture of the metals refinery thornes commandos smoked the last of the oserans out of their crippled ship and cleared the outlying structures of resisters and refugees the wounded were sorted from the dead prisoners taken under guard booby traps detected and deactivated atmosphere restored in key areas then at last the manpower and shuttles could be spared to warp the old freighter into the docking station a smudged figure in a pressure suit stumbled out of the flex tube into the loading bay theyre bent theyre bent cried mayhew to miles pulling off his helmet his hair stuck out in all directions plastered by dried sweat baz and elena strode up to him looking with their helmets off like a pair of dark knights after the tournament elenas hug pulled the pilot off his feet from mayhews suffused look miles guessed she was still having a little trouble with her servos it was great arde she laughed congratulations added baz that was the most remarkable tactical maneuver ive ever seen beautifully calculated trajectoryyour impact point was perfect you hung him up royally but without structural damageive just been over itwith a few repairs weve captured ourselves a working dreadnought beautiful said mayhew calculated youre as crazy as he is he pointed at miles as for damagelook at it he waved over his shoulder in the direction of the rg baz says they have the equipment to rig some sort of hull repairs at this station miles soothed itll delay us here for a few more weeks which i dont like any more than you do but it can be done god help us if anybody asks us to pay for it of course but with luck i should be able to commandeer you dont understand mayhew waved his arms in the air theyre bent the necklin rods the body of the jump drive as the pilot and his viral control circuitry was its nervous system was the pair of necklin field generator rods that ran from one end of the ship to the other they were manufactured miles recalled to tolerances of better than one part in a million are you sure said baz the housings you can stand in the housings and look up the rods and see the warp actually see it they look like skis mayhew wailed baz let his breath trickle out in a hiss between his teeth miles although he thought he already knew the answer turned to the engineer any chance of repairing baz and mayhew both gave miles much the same look by god youd try wouldnt you said mayhew i can see you down there now with a sledgehammer jesek shook his head regretfully no my lord my understanding is the felicians arent up to jump ship production on either the biotech or the engineering side replacement rods would have to be importedbeta colony would be closestbut they dont manufacture this model any more they would have to be specially made and shipped andwell i estimate it would take a year and cost several times the original value of the rg ah said miles he stared rather blankly through the plexiports at his shattered ship couldnt we take the ariel began elena break through the blockade and she stopped and flushed slightly oh sorry the murdered pilots ghost breathed a cold laugh in miless ear a pilot without a ship he muttered under his breath a ship without a pilot cargo not delivered no money no way home he turned curiously to mayhew why did you do it arde you could have just surrendered peaceably youre betan theyd have to have treated you all right mayhew looked around the docking bay not meeting miless eyes seemed to me that dreadnought was about to blow you all into the next dimension true so sowellit didnt seem to me a a right and proper armsman ought to be sitting on his ass while that was going on the ship itself was the only weapon i had so i aimed it and he mimed a trigger with his finger and fired it he then inhaled and added with more heat but you never warned me never briefedi swear if you ever pull a trick like that again ill ill a ghostly smiled tinged botharis lips welcome to my lords servicearmsman auson and thorne appeared at the other end of the docking bay ah there he is with the whole inner circle said auson they bore down upon miles thorne saluted i have the final totals now sir umyes go ahead trainee thorne miles pulled himself to attentiveness on our side two dead five injured injuries not too serious but for one bad plasma burnshell be needing a pretty complete facial regeneration when we get to proper medical facilities miless stomach contracted names dead deveraux and kim the head burn was elliuh trainee quinn go on the enemys total personnel were from the triumph captain tungs shiptwenty commandos the rest technical supportand pelians of whom were military personnel and the rest techs sent to restart the refinery twelve dead injured moderatetosevere and a dozen or so minor injuries equipment losses two suits of space armor damaged beyond repair five repairable and the damages to the rg i guess thorne glanced up through the plexiports mayhew sighed mournfully we captured in addition to the refinery itself and the triumph two pelian innersystem personnel carriers ten station shuttles eight twoman personal flitters and those two empty ore tows hanging out beyond the crews quarters uhone pelian armed courier appears to haveuhgotten away thornes litany trailed off the lieutenant appeared to be watching miless face anxiously for his reaction to this last bit of news i see miles wondered how much more he could absorb he was growing numb go on on the bright side theres a bright side thought miles weve found a little help for our personnel shortage problem we freed felician prisonersa few military types but mostly refinery techs kept working at gunpoint until their pelian replacements could arrive a couple of them are a little messed up how so miles began then held up a hand later illill be making a complete inspection yes sir the rest are able to help out major daums pretty happy has he been able to get in contact with his command yet no sir miles rubbed the bridge of his nose between thumb and forefinger and squeezed his eyes shut to contain the throbbing in his head a patrol of thornes weary commandos marched past moving a batch of prisoners to a more secure location miless eye was drawn to a squat eurasian of about fifty in torn oseran greyandwhites in spite of his battered and discolored face and painful limp he maintained a hardedged alertness that one looks like he could walk through walls without space armor miles thought the eurasian stopped abruptly auson he cried i thought you were dead he towed his captors toward miless group miles gave the anxious guard a nod of permission auson cleared his throat hello tung how did they take your ship without the prisoner began and stopped as he assimilated thornes armor ausonsin light of his immobilized arms decorativesidearm their lack of guards his expression of amazement changed to hot disgust he struggled for words i might have known he choked at last i might have known oser was right to keep you two clowns as far away from the real combat as possible only the comedy team of auson and thorne could have captured themselves ausons lips curled back in a snarl thorne flashed a thin razoredged smile hold your tongue tung it called and added in an aside to miles if you knew how many years ive been waiting to say that tungs face flushed a dark bronzepurple and he shouted back sit on it thorne youre equipped for it they both lunged forward simultaneously tungs guards clubbed him to his knees auson and miles grabbed thornes arms miles was lifted off his feet but between them they managed to check the betan hermaphrodite miles intervened may i point out captain tung that theahcomedy team has just captured you if half my commandos hadnt been trapped by that sprung bulkhead tung began hotly auson straightened and smirked thorne stopped flexing on its feet united at last thought miles by the common enemy miles breathed a small ha as he spotted his opportunity to finally put the disbelieving and suspicious auson in the palm of his hand who the hell is that little mutant tung muttered to his guard miles stepped forward in fact you have done so well trainee thorne that i have no hesitation in confirming you in your brevet command congratulations captain thorne thorne swelled auson wilted all the old shame and rage crowding in his eyes miles turned to him you have also served trainee auson miles said thinking overlooking that understandable small mutiny in the tactics room even while on the sick list and for those who also serve there is also a reward he gestured grandly out the plexiport where a freefall crew with cutting torches was just beginning to untangle the triumph from its entrapment there is your new command sorry about the dents he dropped his voice and perhaps next time you will not be so full of assumptions auson turned about waves of bewilderment astonishment and delight breaking in his face bothari pursed his lips in appreciation of miless feudal ploy auson in command of his own ship must eventually wake to the fact that it was his own ship auson subordinate to thorne must always be a potential focus for disaffection but auson in command of a ship held from miless hands became ipso facto miless man never mind that tungs ship in either of their hands was technically grand theft of the most grandiose tung took just slightly longer than auson to understand the drift of the conversation he began to swear miles did not recognize the language but it was unmistakably invective miles had never seen a man actually foam at the lips before see that this prisoner gets a tranquillizer miles ordered kindly as tung was dragged away an aggressive commander miles thought covetously thirty years experiencei wonder if i can do anything with him miles looked around and added see the medtech and get those things taken off your arms captain auson yes sir auson substituted a sharp nod for a curtailed attempt at a salute and marched off head held high thorne followed to oversee further intelligence gathering from prisoners and the freed felicians an engineering tech in want of supervision descended upon them instantly to carry off jesek she grinned proudly at miles would you say weve earned our combat bonus today sir combat bonus miles wondered blankly he gazed around the station thinly spread but energetic activities of consolidation met his eye wherever he turned i should think so trainee mynova sir she paused shyly some of us were wonderingjust what is our pay schedule going to be biweekly or monthly pay schedule of course his charade must continuehow long he glanced out at the rg bent bent and full of undelivered cargo unpaid for hed have to keep going somehow until they at least made contact with felician forces monthly he said firmly oh she said sounding faintly disappointed ill pass the word along sir what if were still here in a month my lord asked bothari as she left with jesek it could get uglymercenaries expect to be paid miles rubbed his hands through his hair and quavered with desperate assertiveness ill figure something out can we get anything to eat around here asked mayhew plaintively he looked drained thorne popped back up at miless elbow about the counterattack sir miles spun on his heel where he demanded looking around wildly thorne looked slightly taken aback oh not yet sir miles slumped relieved please dont do that to me captain thorne counterattack im thinking sir theres bound to be one on account of the escaped courier if nothing else shouldnt we start planning for it oh absolutely planning yes you ahhave an idea to present do you miles prodded hopefully several sir thorne began to detail them with verve miles realized he was absorbing about one sentence in three very good captain miles interrupted well uh have a senior officers meeting afterafter inspection and you can present them to everybody thorne nodded contentedly and dashed off saying something about setting up a telecom listening post miless head spun the jumbled geometries of the refinery its ups and downs chosen apparently at random did nothing to decrease his sense of disorientation and it was all his every rusty bolt dubious weld and stoppedup toilet in it elena was observing him anxiously whats the matter miles you dont look happy we won a true vor miles told himself severely does not bury his face in his leigewomans breasts and cryeven if he is at a convenient height for it chapter thirteen miless first tour of his new domain was rapid and exhausting the triumph was about the only encouraging part of it bothari lingered to go over the arrangements for keeping the horde of new prisoners secure with the overworked patrol assigned to that detail never had miles seen a man wish more passionately to be twins he halfexpected bothari to go into mitosis on the spot the sergeant grudgingly left elena to be miless substitute bodyguard once out of sight miles instead put elena to work as a real executive officer taking notes he did not trust even his own quick memory with the mass of new detail a combined sickbay had been set up in the refinerys infirmary as the largest facility the air was dry and cold and stale like all recycled air sweet with scented antiseptics overlaying a faint tang compounded of sweat excrement burnt meat and fear all medical personnel were drafted from the new prisoners to treat their own wounded requiring yet a couple more of miless thinlyspread troops as guards they in turn were sucked in by the needs of the moment as assistant corpsmen miles watched tungs efficient surgeon and staff at work and let this pass limiting himself to a quiet reminder to the guards of their primary duty so long as tungs medicos stayed busy it was probably safe miles was unnerved by the catatonic colonel benar and the two other felician military officers who lay listlessly barely responding to their rescue such little wounds he thought observing the slight chafing at wrists and ankles and tiny discolorations under their skins marking hypospray injection points by such little wounds we kill men the murdered pilot officers ghost perched on his shoulder like a pet crow stirred and ruffled itself in silent witness ausons medtech borrowed tungs surgeon for the delicate placement of plastiskin that was to serve elli quinn for a face until she could be senthow whento some medical facility with proper regenerative biotech you dont have to watch this miles murmured to elena as he stood discreetly by to observe the procedure elena shook her head i want to why why do you ive never seen it anyway it was my bill she paid its my duty as her commander well then its mine too i worked with her all week the medtech unwrapped the temporary dressings skin nose ears lips gone subcutaneous fat boiled away eyes glazed white and burst scalp burned offshe tried to speak a clotted mumble miles reminded himself that her pain nerves had been blocked he turned his back abruptly hand sneaking to his lips and swallowed hard i guess we dont have to stay were not really contributing anything he glanced up at elenas profile which was pale but steady how long are you going to watch he whispered and silently to himself for gods sake it might have been you elena until theyre done she murmured back until i dont feel her pain anymore when i look until im hardenedlike a real soldierlike my father if i can block it from a friend certainly i ought to be able to block it from the enemy miles shook his head in instinctive negation look can we continue this in the corridor she frowned but then took in his face pursed her lips and followed him without further argument in the corridor he leaned against the wall swallowing saliva and breathing deeply should i fetch a basin no ill be all right in a minute i hope the minute passed without his disgracing himself women shouldnt be in combat he managed finally why not said elena why is that she jerked her head toward the infirmary any more horrible for a woman than a man i dont know miles groped your father once said that if a woman puts on a uniform shes asking for it and you should never hesitate to fireodd streak of egalitarianism coming from him but all my instincts are to throw my cloak across her puddle or something not blow her head off it throws me off the honor goes with the risk argued elena deny the risk and you deny the honor i always thought you were the one barrayaran male i knew whod allow that a woman might have an honor that wasnt parked between her legs miles floundered a soldiers honor is to do his patriotic duty sure or hers or hers all rightbut all this isnt serving the emperor were here for tav calhouns ten percent profit margin or anyway we were he gathered himself to continue his tour then paused what you said in thereabout hardening yourself she raised her chin yes my mother was a real soldier too and i dont think she ever failed to feel anothers pain not even her enemys they were both silent for long after that the officers meeting to plan for the counterattack was not so difficult as miles had feared they took over a conference chamber that had belonged to the refinerys senior management the breathtaking panorama out the plexiports swept the entire installation miles growled and sat with his back to it he quickly slid into the role of referee controlling the flow of ideas while concealing his own dearth of hard factual information he folded his arms and said um and hm but only very occasionally god help us because it caused elena to choke thorne and auson daum and jesek and the three freed felician junior officers who had not been braindrained did the rest although miles found he had to steer them gently away from ideas too much like those just demonstrated not to work for the pelians it would help a great deal major daum if you could reach your command miles wound up the session thinking how can you have misplaced an entire country for gods sake as a last resort perhaps a volunteer in one of those station shuttles could sneak on down to the planet and tell them were here eh well keep trying sir daum promised some enthusiastic soul had found quarters for miles in the most luxurious section of the refinery previously reserved like the elegant conference chamber for senior management unfortunately the housekeeping services had been rather interrupted in the past few weeks miles picked his way among personal artifacts from the last pelian to camp in the executive suite overlaying yet another strata from the felician he had evicted in his turn strewn clothing empty ration wrappings data discs halfempty bottles all well stirred by the flipflops in the artificial gravity during the attack the data discs when examined proved all light entertainment no secret documents no brilliant intelligence coups miles could have sworn the variegated fuzzy patches growing on the bathroom walls moved when he was not looking directly at them perhaps it was an effect of fatigue he was careful not to touch them when he showered he set the lights to maximum uv when he was done and sealed the door reminding himself sternly that he had not demanded the sergeants nocturnal company on the grounds that there were things in his closet since he was four aching for sleep he crawled into clean underwear brought with him bed was a nullgee bubble warmed womblike by infrared nullgee sex miles had heard was one of the high points of space travel hed never had a chance to try it personally ten minutes of attempting to relax in the bubble convinced him he never would either although when heated the smells and stains that permeated the chamber suggested that a minimum of three people had tried it there before him recently he crawled out nastily and sat on the floor until his stomach stopped trying to turn itself inside out so much for the spoils of victory there was a splendid view out the plexiports of the rg s corrugated gaping hull occasionally stress would release in some tortured flake of metal and it would snap off spontaneously to stir the smattering of other wrinkled bits clinging to the ship like dandruff miles stared at it for a time then decided to go see if sergeant bothari still had that flask of scotch the corridor outside his executive suite ended in an observation deck a crystal and chrome shell arched by the sweep of hardedged stars in their powdered millions furthermore it faced away from the refinery attracted miles wandered toward it elenas voice raised in a wordless cry shot him out of somnolence into an adrenalin rush it came from the observation deck miles broke into his uneven run he swarmed up the catwalk and spun onehanded around a gleaming upright the dimmed observation deck was upholstered in royalblue velvet that glowed in the starlight liquidfilled settees and benches in odd curving shapes seemed to invite the indolent recliner baz jesek was spreadeagled backward over one with sergeant bothari atop him the sergeants knees ground into the engineers stomach and groin and the great hands knotted about bazs neck twisting bazs face was maroon his frantic words strangled inchoate elena her tunic undone galloped around the pair hands clenching and unclenching in despair of daring to physically oppose bothari no father no she cried had bothari caught the engineer trying to attack her hot jealous rage shook miles dashed immediately by cold reason elena of all women was capable of defending herself the sergeants paranoias had seen to that his jealousy went ice green he could let bothari kill baz elena saw him milesmy lord stop him miles approached them get off him sergeant he ordered bothari his face yellow with rage glanced sideways then back to his victim his hands did not slacken miles knelt and laid his hand lightly on the corded muscles of botharis arm he had the sick feeling it was the most dangerous thing he had done in his life he dropped his voice to a whisper must i give my orders twice armsman bothari ignored him miles closed his hands tightly around the sergeants wrist you dont have the strength to break my grip bothari snarled out of the corner of his mouth i have the strength to break my own fingers trying miles murmured back and threw all his weight into his pull his fingernails went white in a moment his brittle joints would start to snap the sergeants eyes squeezed shut his breath hissing in and out past his stained teeth then with an oath he sprang off baz and shook free of miles he turned his back chest heaving blind eyes lost in infinity baz writhed off the bench and fell to the carpet with a thump he gulped air in a hoarse liquid choke and spat up blood elena ran to him and cradled his head in her lap heedless of the mess miles staggered up and stood catching his breath all right he said at last whats going on here baz tried to speak but it came out a gurgling bark elena was crying no help there damn it sergeant caught her nuzzling that coward bothari growled still with his back to them he is not a coward elena yelled hes as good a soldier as you he saved my life today she turned to miles surely you saw it my lord on your monitors there was an oseran with a servoaim locked on mei thought it was all overbaz shot him with his plasma arc tell him she was talking about the oseran he had slain with his own medkit miles realized baz had cooked a corpse unknowing i saved you miles cried inwardly it was me it was me thats right sergeant he heard himself saying you owe her life to your brother armsman that one is no brother to me by my word i say he is its not properits not righti have to make it right it has to be perfect bothari swung around narrow jaw working in his life miles had never seen bothari more agitated ive put too much strain on him lately he thought remorsefully too much too fast too outofcontrol baz croaked out words no dishonor elena hushed him and lurched to her feet to face bothari fiercely you and your military honor well ive faced fire and ive killed a man and it was nothing but butchery any robot could have done it there was nothing to it its all a sham a hoax a lie a big puton your uniform doesnt awe me any more do you hear botharis face was dark and rigid miles made shushing motions at elena hed no objection to growing independence of spirit but god in heaven her timing was terrible couldnt she see it no she was too tangled up in her own pain and shame and the new ghost clinging to her shoulder she had not mentioned that shed killed a man earlier but miles knew there were reasons one might choose not to he needed baz he needed bothari he needed elena and he needed them all working together to get them home alive not then what he ached to cry out of his own anguish and anger but what they needed to hear the first thing elena and bothari needed was to be parted until tempers cooled lest they tear out each others hearts as for bazelena said miles help baz to the infirmary see that the medtech checks him for internal injuries yes my lord she replied emphasizing the official nature of the order with his title for botharis benefit presumably she levered baz to his feet and pulled his arm across her shoulders with an awkward venomous glower at her father botharis hands twitched but he said nothing and made no move miles escorted them down the catwalk bazs breathing was growing slightly more regular he saw with relief i think id better stay with the sergeant he murmured to elena you two going to make it all right thanks to you said elena i tried to stop him but i was afraid i couldnt do it she blinked back last tears better this way everybodys edgy too tired him too you know he almost asked her for a definition of nuzzling but stopped himself she bore baz off with tender murmurs that drove miles wild he bit back his frustration and mounted again to the observation deck bothari still stood grievously blank and inward miles sighed you still have that scotch sergeant bothari started from his reverie and felt his hip pocket he handed the flask silently to miles who gestured at the benches they both sat the sergeants hands dangled between his knees his head lowered miles took a swallow and handed the flask over drink bothari shook his head but then took it and did so after a time he muttered you never called me armsman before i was trying to get your attention my apologies silence and another swig its the right title why were you trying to kill him you know how badly we need techs a long pause hes not a right one not for her deserter he wasnt trying to rape her it was a statement no lowly no i suppose not you never know miles gazed around the crystal chamber gorgeous in the sparked darkness superb spot for a nuzzle and more but those long white hands were down at the infirmary probably laying cold compresses or something on bazs brow while he sat here getting drunk with the ugliest man in the system what a waste the flask went back and forth again you never know bothari reiterated and she must have everything right and proper you see that dont you my lord dont you see it of course but please dont murder my engineer i need him all right damn techs always coddled miles let this pass as an old service reflex complaint bothari had always seemed part of his grandfathers generation somehow although in fact he was a couple of years younger than miless father miles relaxed slightly at this sign of a return to botharis normalwell usualstate of mind bothari slipped into a reclining position on the carpet shoulders against the settee my lord he added after a time youd see to it if i were killedthat she was taken care of right the dowry and an officer a fit officer and a real gobetween a proper baba to make the arrangements antique dream thought miles hazily im her leigelord by right of your service he pointed out gently it would be my duty if i could only turn that duty to my own dreams some dont pay much attention to their duty any more bothari muttered but a vorkosiganvorkosigans never fail damn right miles mumbled mm said bothari and slid down a little farther after a long silence bothari spoke again if i were killed you wouldnt leave me out there would you my lord huh miles tore his attention from trying to make new constellations he had just connected the dots into a figure dubbed mentally cavalryman they leave bodies in space sometimes cold as hell god cant find them out there no one could miles blinked he had never known the sergeant concealed a theological streak look whats all this all of a sudden about getting killed youre not going to the count your father promised me bothari raised his voice slightly to override him id be buried at your lady mothers feet at vorkosigan surleau he promised didnt he tell you er the subject never came up his word as vorkosigan your word uh right then miles stared out the chambers transparency some saw stars it seemed and some saw the spaces between them cold you planning on heaven sergeant as my ladys dog blood washes away sin she swore it to me he trailed off gaze never leaving the depths presently the flask slipped from his fingers and he began to snore miles sat crosslegged watching over him a small figure in his underwear against the black immensity and very far from home fortunately baz recovered quickly and was back on the job the next day with the aid of a neck brace to ease his lacerated cervicals his behavior to elena was painfully circumspect whenever miles was around offering no further spur to his jealousy but of course where miles was there also was bothari which perhaps accounted for it miles began by flinging all their meager resources into getting the triumph operational overtly to fight the pelians privately he figured it was the only thing around big enough and fast enough for them to all pile into and successfully run like hell tung had two jump pilots one of them at least might be persuaded to jump them out of tau verde local space altogether miles contemplated the consequences of turning up back at beta colony in a stolen warship with a kidnapped pilot officer twenty or so unemployed mercenaries a herd of bewildered refugee technicians and no money for tav calhounor even for betan shuttleport landing fees the blanket of his class iii diplomatic immunity seemed to shrink to a bare fig leaf miless attempt to throw himself into the placement and powering up of a selection of weapons from the rg s hold alongside the technicians was constantly interrupted by people wanting directions or orders or organization or most frequently authorization to seize some piece of refinery equipment or resource or leftover military supplies for me work at hand miles blithely authorized anything put in front of him earning a reputation for brilliant decisiveness his signaturenaismithwas developing into a nicely illegible flourish the personnel shortage was not unfortunately amenable to like treatment double shifts that became triple shifts tended to end in loss of efficiency from exhaustion miles took a stab at another approach two bottles of felician wine quality unknown a bottle of tau cetan liqueur pale orange not green fortunately two nylon and plastic folding camp stools a small and flimsy plastic table a halfdozen silvery strippacks of felician delicaciesmiles hoped they were delicaciesexact composition mysterious the last gleanings of nonrotted fresh fruit from the refinerys damaged hydroponics section it ought to be enough miles loaded botharis arms with the looted picnic gathered up the overflow and marched off toward the prison section mayhew raised an eyebrow as they passed him in a corridor where are you going with all that courting arde miles grinned courting the pelians had left a makeshift brig a storage area hastily vented plumbed and partitioned into a series of tiny bleak metal boxes miles would have felt more guilty about locking human beings in them if it had not been a case of turnabout they surprised captain tung hanging by one hand from the overhead light fixture and working as yet vainly on levering its cover apart with a flattened snap torn from his uniform jacket good afternoon captain miles addressed the dangling ankles with sunny good cheer tung scowled down upon him estimation in his eyes measured bothari found the sum of the calculation not in his favor and dropped to the floor with a grunt the guard locked the door again behind them what were you going to do with it if you got it apart miles asked curiously looking up tung swore at him like a man spitting then clamped into recalcitrant silence bothari set up the table and stools dumped out the groceries and leaned against the wall by the door skeptical miles sat down and opened a bottle of wine tung remained standing do join me captain miles invited cordially i know you havent had supper yet i was hoping we might have a little chat i am ky tung captain oseran free mercenary fleet i am a citizen of the peoples democracy of greater south america earth my social duty number is t this chat is over tungs lips flattened together in a granite slit this is not an interrogation miles amplified which would be far more efficiently conducted by the medical staff anyway see ill even give you some information he rose and bowed formally permit me to introduce myself my name is miles naismith he gestured at the other stool do please sit down i spend enough time with a crick in my neck tung hesitated but finally sat compromising by making it on the edge of his seat miles poured wine and took a sip he groped for one of his grandfathers wine connoisseur phrases as a conversation opener but the only one that sprang to his memory was thin as piss which didnt seem exactly inviting he wiped the lip of the plastic cup on his sleeve instead and pushed it toward tung observe no poison no drugs tung folded his arms the oldest trick in the book you take the antidote before you come in oh said miles yes i suppose i could have done that he shook a packet of rather rubbery protein cubes out between them and eyed them almost as dubiously as tung did ah meat he popped one in his mouth and chewed industriously go ahead ask me anything he added around a mouthful tung struggled with his resolve then blurted my troops how are they miles promptly detailed a list by full name of the dead and of the wounded and their current medical status the rest are under lock and key as you are excuse me from mapping their exact locations for youjust in case you can do more with that light than i think you can tung sighed sadness and relief and absently helped himself to a protein cube sorry things got so messy miles apologized i realize how it must burn you to have your opponent blunder to victory id have preferred something neater and more tactical myself like komarr but i had to take the situation as i found it tung snorted who wouldnt who do you think you are lord vorkosigan miles inhaled a lungful of wine bothari abandoned the wall to pound him not very helpfully on the back and glare suspiciously at tung but by the time miles had regained his breath he had regained his balance he mopped his lips i see you mean admiral aral vorkosigan of barrayar you ah confused me a bithes count vorkosigan now oh yeah still alive is he remarked tung interested very much so have you ever read his book on komarr book oh the komarr report yes id heard it had been picked up by a couple of military schools offplanetoff barrayar that is ive read it eleven times tung said proudly most succinct military memoir ive ever seen the most complex strategy laid out logically as a wiring diagrampolitics economics and alli swear the mans mind must operate in five dimensions and yet i find most people havent heard of it it should be required readingi test all my junior officers on it well ive heard him say that war is the failure of politicsi guess theyve always been a part of his strategic thinking sure when you get to that level tungs ears pricked heard i didnt think hed done any interviewsdo you happen to remember where and when you saw it can copies be had ah miles trod a thin line it was a personal conversation youve met him miles had the unnerving sensation of suddenly acquiring half a meter of height in tungs eyes well yes he admitted cautiously do you knowhas he written anything like the komarr report about the escobar invasion tung asked eagerly ive always felt it should be a companion volumedefensive strategy next to offensiveget the other half of his thinking like sri simkas two volumes on walshea and skya iv miles placed tung at last a military history nut he knew the type very very well he suppressed an exhilarated grin i dont think so escobar was a defeat after all he never talks about it muchi understand maybe a touch of vanity there mm allowed tung it was an amazing book though everything that seemed so totally chaotic at the time revealed this complete inner skeletonof course it always seems chaotic when youre losing it was miless turn to prick his ears at the time were you at komarr yes i was a junior lieutenant in the selby fleet that komarr hiredwhat an experience twentythree years ago now seemed like every natural weak point in mercenaryemployer relations got blown up in our facesand that was before the first shot was even fired vorkosigans intelligence pathfinders at work we learned later miles made encouraging noises and proceeded to pump this unexpected spring of reminiscence for all it was worth pieces of fruit became planets and satellites variously shaped protein bits became cruisers couriers smart bombs and troop carriers defeated ships were eaten the second bottle of wine introduced other well known mercenary battles miles frankly hung on tungs words selfconsciousness forgotten tung leaned back at last with a contented sigh full of food and wine and emptied of stories miles knowing his own capacity had been nursing his own wine to the limits of politeness he swirled the last of it around in the bottom of his cup and essayed a cautious probe it seems a great waste for an officer of your experience to sit out a good war like this locked in a box tung smiled i have no intention of staying in this box ahyes but there may be more than one way to get out of it dont you see now the dendarii mercenaries are an expanding organization theres a lot of room for talent at the top tungs smiled soured you took my ship i took captain ausons ship too ask him if hes unhappy about it nice tryahmr naismith but i have a contract a fact that unlike some i remember a mercenary who cant honor his contract when its rough as well as when its smooth is a thug not a soldier miles fairly swooned with unrequited love i cannot fault you for that sir tung eyed him with amused tolerance now regardless of what that ass auson seems to think i have you pegged as a hotshot junior officer in over his headand sinking fast seems to me its you not i whos going to be looking for a new job soon you seem to have at least an average grasp of tacticsand you have read vorkosigan on komarrbut any officer who can get auson and thorne hitched together to plow a straight line shows a genius for personnel if you get out of this alive come see mei may be able to find something on the exec side for you miles sat looking at his prisoner in openmouthed appreciation of a chutzpah worthy of his own actually it sounded pretty good he sighed regret you honor me captain tung but im afraid i too have a contract pigwash beg pardon if you have a contract with felice it beats me where you got it i doubt daum was authorized to make any such agreement the felicians are as cheap as their counterparts the pelians we could have ended this war six months ago if the pelians had been willing to pay the piper but nothey chose to economize and only buy a blockade and a few installations like this oneand for that they act like theyre doing us a favor peh frustration edged his voice with disgust i didnt say my contract was with felice said miles mildly tungs eyes narrowed in puzzlement good the mans evaluations were entirely too close to the truth for comfort well keep your tail down son tung advised in the long run more mercenaries have had their asses shot off by their contractors than by their enemies miles took his leave courteously tung ushered him out with the panache of a genial host is there anything else you need asked miles a screwdriver said tung promptly miles shook his head and smiled regretfully as the door was closed on the eurasian damned if im not tempted to send him one said miles to bothari im dying to see what he thinks he can do with that light just what did all that accomplish asked bothari he burned up your time with ancient history and didnt give away anything miles smiled nothing unimportant chapter fourteen the pelians attacked from the ecliptic opposite the sun taking advantage of the scattered masses of the asteroid belt for what cover they provided they came decelerating telegraphing their intention to capture not destroy and they came alone without their oseran employees miles laughed delight under his breath as he limped through the scramble of men and equipment in the refinery docking station corridors the pelians could scarcely be following his pet scenario more closely if hed given them their orders himself there had been some argument when hed insisted on placing his farthest outlying pickets and his major weapons on the belt and not the planet side of the refinery but it was inevitable barring subterfuge a tactic currently exhausted it was the pelians only hope of gaining a measure of surprise a week ago it would have done them some good miles dodged some of his galloping troops hurrying to their posts pray god he would never find himself on foot in a retreat he might as well volunteer for the rear guard in the first place and save being trampled by his own side as well as by the enemy he dashed through the flex tube into the triumph the waiting soldier clanged the lock shut behind him and hastily blew off the tube seals as hed guessed he was the last aboard he made his way to the tactics room as the ship maneuvered free of the refinery the triumphs tactics room was noticeably larger than the ariels and quite as sleek miles quailed at the number of empty padded swivel chairs a scant half of ausons old crew even augmented by a few volunteer refinery techs made scarcely a skeleton crew for the new ship holograph displays were up and working in all their bright confusion auson looked up from trying to man two stations at once with relief in his eyes glad you made it my lord miles slid into a station chair me too but pleasejust mr naismith no my lord auson looked puzzled the others all call you that yes but umits not just a courtesy it denotes a specific legal relationship you wouldnt call me my husband even if you heard my wife do so eh so what have we got out here looks like maybe ten little shipsall pelian local stuff auson studied his readouts worry creasing his broad face i dont know where our guys are this sort of thing should be just their style miles correctly interpreted our guys to mean ausons former comrades the oserans the slip of tongue did not disturb him auson was committed now miles glanced sideways at him and thought he knew exactly why the pelians hadnt brought their hired guns for all the pelians knew to the contrary an oseran ship had turned on them miless eyes glittered at the thought of the dismay and distrust that must now be reverberating through the pelian high command their ship dove in a high arc toward their attackers miles keyed nav and com you all right arde for flying blind deaf dumb and paralyzed not bad mayhew said manual piloting is a pain its like the machine is operating me it feels awful keep up the good work miles said cheerfully remember were more interested in herding them into range of our stationary weapons than in knocking them off ourselves miles sat back and regarded the everchanging displays i dont think they quite realize how much ordinance daum brought theyre just repeating the same tactics the felician officers reported they used the last time of course it worked once the lead pelian ships were just coming into range of the refinery miles held his breath as though it could force his people to hold their fire they were spread lonely thin and nervous out there there were more weapons in place than miles had personnel to man them even with computercontrolled fireespecially since control systems had been plagued with bugs during installation that were still not all worked out baz had labored to the last instantwas still laboring for all miles knew and elena alongside him miles wished he could have justified keeping her beside himself instead the lead pelian spewed a glittering string of dandelion bombs arcing toward the solar collectors not again miles groaned inwardly seeing two weeks repairs about to be wasted the bombs puffed into their thousands of separate needles space was suddenly laced with threads of fire as the defense weaponry labored to knock them out should have fired an instant sooner the pelian ship itself exploded into pelting debris as someone on miless side scored a direct perhaps lucky hit a portion of the debris continued on its former track and speed almost as dangerous in its mindless momentum as the clever guided weapons the ships coming up behind it began to peel and swerve shocked out of their beeline complacency auson and thorne in their respective ships now swung in from either side like a pair of sheepdogs gone mad and attacking their flock miles beat his fist on the panel before him in a paroxysm of joy at the beauty of the formation if only hed had a third warship to completely box their flanks none of the pelians would make it home to complain as it was they were squeezed into a flat layer carefully precalculated to present its maximum target area to the refinerys defenses auson beside him shared his enthusiasm lookatem lookatem right down the gullet just like you claimed they wouldand gamad swore you were crazy to strip the solar sideshorty youre a frigging genius miless thrill was mitigated by the sober reflection of what names hed have earned by guessing wrong relief made him dizzy he leaned back in the station chair and let out a long long breath a second pelian ship burst into oblivion and a third a numeral buried in a crowded corner of miless readouts flipped quietly from a minus to a plus figure ah ha miles pointed weve got em now theyre starting to accelerate again they re breaking off the attack their momentum gave the pelians no choice but to sweep through the refinery area but all their attention now was on making it as fast a trip as possible thorne and auson swung in behind to speed them on their way a pelian ship corkscrewed past the installation and firedwhat miless computers could present no interpretation of thebeam not plasma not laser not driven mass for which the central factory was able to generate some shielding the huge solar collectors necessarily being left to fend for themselves it was not immediately apparent what damage it had done or even if it were a hit strange miles closed his hand gently around the pelian ships representation in his hologram as if he could work sympathetic magic captain auson lets try and catch this one why bother hes scooting for home with his buddies miles lowered his voice to a whisper thats an order auson braced yes sir well it works sometimes miles reflected the communications officer achieved a fully scrambled channel to the ariel and the new objective was transmitted auson growing enthused chortled at the chance to try his new ships limits the ghost imager confusing the enemys aim with multiple targets proved particularly useful through it they discovered the mystery beams range limit and odd large time lag between shots recharging perhaps they bore down rapidly upon the fleeing pelian whats the script mr naismith auson inquired stoporweblastyou miles chewed his lip thoughtfully i dont think that would work id guess our problem is more likely to be keeping them from selfdestructing when we get close threats would fall flat im afraid theyre not mercenaries hm auson cleared his throat and busied himself with his displays miles suppressed a sardonic smile for the sake of tact and turned to his own readouts the computers presented him with a clairvoyant vision of overtaking the pelian then paused waiting politely on his merely human inspiration miles tried to think himself into the pelian captains skin he balanced time lag range and the speed with which they could close on the pelian at maximum redline boost its close he said watching his holograph the machine rendered a vivid and chilling display of what might happen if he missed bracketing his timing auson glanced over his shoulder at the miniature fireworks and muttered something about frigging suicidal which miles chose to ignore i want all our engineering people suited up and ready to board miles said at last they know they cant outrun us my guess is theyll rig some gotohell with a time delay all pile into their lifeboat shuttle and try to blow the ship up in our faces but if we dont waste time on the shuttle and are quick enough getting in the back door as they go out the side we might disarm it and takewhatever that wasintact ausons lips puckered in worried disapproval at this plan take all my engineers we could blast the shuttle out of its clamps when we get close enough to get the accuracytrap them all aboard and then try to board a manned warship with four engineers and myself miles interrupted no thanks besides cornering them just might trigger the sort of spectacular suicide move i want to prevent whatll i do if youre not quick enough getting their boobytrap disarmed a black grin stole over miless face improvise the pelians it appeared were not enough of a suicide squadron to spurn the thin chance of life their shuttle gave them into this narrow crack of time miles and his technicians slipped blasting their way crude but quick through the codecontrolled airlock miles cursed the discomfort of his overlarge pressure suit loose places rubbed and skidded on his skin cold sweat he discovered was a term with a literal meaning he glanced up and down the curving corridors of the unfamiliar dark ship the engineering techs parted at a run each to their assigned quadrant miles took a fifth and less likely direction to make a quick check of tactics room crews quarters and bridge for destructive devices and any useful intelligence left lying around blasted control panels and melted data stores met him everywhere he checked the time barely five minutes and the pelian shuttle would be safely beyond the range of say radiation from imploded engines a triumphant crow pierced his ears over his suit comm link ive done it ive done it cried an engineering tech they had rigged an implosion chain reaction brokenim shutting down now cheers echoed over the comm link miles sagged into a station chair on the bridge heart lumping then it seemed to stop he keyed his comm link for a general broadcast overriding and at volume i dont think we should assume there was only one boobytrap laid eh keep looking for at least the next ten minutes worried groans acknowledged the order for the next three minutes the comm links transmitted only ragged breathing miles dashing through the galley in search of the captains cabin inhaled sharply a microwave oven its control panel ripped out and hastily crosswired timer ticking away had a highpressure metal oxygen canister jammed into it the nutrition technicians personal contribution to the war effort apparently in two minutes it would have taken out the galley and most of the adjoining chambers miles tore it apart and ran on a tearstreaked voice hissed over the comm link oh shit oh shit where are you kat armory theres too many i cant get them all oh shit keep working were on our way miles taking the chance ordered the rest of his crew to the armory on the double and ran a true light guided him as he arrived overriding the infrared display on the inside of his helmet faceplate he swung into a storage chamber to find the tech crawling along a row of gleaming ordinance every dandelion bomb in here is set to go off she cried sparing one glance at him her voice shook but her hands never stopped patting out the reset codes miles lips parted in concentration watched over her shoulder and then began to repeat her movements on the next row the great disadvantage to crying in fear in a space suit miles discovered was that you could not wipe either your face or your nose although the sonic cleaners on the inside of the faceplate saved that valuable informative surface from a sneeze he sniffed surreptitiously his stomach sent up a throatburning acid belch his fingers felt like sausages i could be on beta colony right nowi could be home in bedi could be home under my bed another tech joined them miles saw out of the corner of his eye no one spared attention for social chitchat they worked together in silence broken only by the uneven rhythm of hyperventilation his suit reduced his oxygen flow in stingy disapproval of his state of mind bothari would never have let him join the boarding partymaybe he shouldnt have ordered him to duty at the refinery on to the next bomband the nextand thethere was no next finished kat rose and pointed to one bomb in the array three seconds three seconds and she burst into unabashed tears and fell on miles he patted her shoulder clumsily there therecry all you want youve earned it he killed his comm link broadcast momentarily and inhaled a powerful sniff miles tottered out of his newly captured ship into the refinery docking station clutching an unexpected prizea suit of pelian battle armor nearly small enough to fit him the plumbing not surprisingly was female but baz could surely convert it he spotted elena among his reception committee and held it up proudly look what i found she wrinkled her nose in puzzlement you captured a whole ship just to get a suit of armor no no the other thing thethe weapon whatever it was this is the ship whose shot penetrated your shieldingdid it hit anything what did it do one of the felician officers gloweredoddly at elena it punched a holewell not a holeright through the prison section it was losing air and she let them all out his people miles noticed were moving about in groups of three or more we havent got them half rounded up yet the felician complained theyre hiding all over the station elena looked distressed im sorry my lord miles rubbed his temples uh i suppose id better have the sergeant at my back then for a while when he wakes up what elena frowned at her boots he was guarding the prison section alone during the attackhe tried to stop me from letting them out tried and didnt succeed i shot him with my stunner im afraid hes going to be rather angryis it all right if i stick with you for a while miles pursed his lips in an involuntary silent whistle of course were any prisonersno wait he raised his voice commander bothari i commend your initiative you did the right thing we are here to accomplish a specific tactical objective not perpetrate mindless slaughter miles stared down the felician junior lieutenant whats his name gamad who shrank under his gaze he went on more quietly to elena were any prisoners killed two whose cells were actually penetrated by the electron orbital randomizer by the what baz called it an electron orbital randomizer andand eleven asphyxiated that i couldnt get to in time the pain in her eyes knifed him how many would have died if you hadnt released them we lost air in the whole section captain tung elena spread her hands hes around here somewhere i guess he wasnt among the thirteen ohone of his jump pilots was though and we havent found the other one yet is that important miless heart sank into his foaming stomach he wheeled to the nearest mercenary pass on this order at once prisoners are to be recaptured alive with as little injury as possible the woman hurried to obey if tungs on the loose youd better stick by me miles told elena dear god well i guess id better have a look at this hole that isnt a hole then where did baz come up with that jawbreaking name for it he said its a betan development from a few years back it never sold very well because all you have to do to defend from it is rephase the mass shieldinghe told me to tell you he was on it and should have the shields reprogrammed by tonight oh miles paused crushed so much for his fantasy of returning the mystery beam to barrayar to lay at the emperors feet captain illyan agog his father amazed hed pictured it as a splendid offering proof of his military prowess more like when the cat drags in a dead horned hopper to be chased off with brooms he sighed at least he had a suit of space armor now miles elena gamad and an engineering tech started toward the prison section several structures down the linked chain of the refinery elena fell in beside miles you look so tired hadnt you better uh take a shower and get some rest ah yes the stink of dried terror wellwarmed in a pressure suit he grinned up at her and tucked his helmet firmly under his arm like a beheaded ghost waitll you hear about my day what does major daum say about the defense nexus now i suppose id better get a full battle report from himhe at least seems to have his thinking straight miles eyed the back of the lieutenant in weary distaste lieutenant gamad whose hearing was evidently keener than miles had supposed glanced back over his shoulder major daums killed sir he and a tech were switching weapons posts and their flitter was hit by highspeed debrisnothing left didnt they tell you miles stopped short im the ranking officer here now the felician added it took three days to ferret out the escaped prisoners from all the corners of the refinery tungs commandos were the worst miles eventually resorted to closing off sections and filling them with sleep gas he ignored botharis irritated suggestion that vacuum would be more costeffective the bulk of the roundup duty fell naturally if unjustly to the sergeant and he was tight as a drawn bowstring with the tension of it when the final head count was made tung had seven of his men including his other pilot officer turned up missing so did a station shuttle miles moaned under his breath there was no choice now but to wait for the laggard felicians to come claim their cargo he began to doubt whether the shuttle dispatched to try and reach tau verde before the counterattack had ever made it through the oserancontrolled space between perhaps they should send another with a draftee not a volunteer this time miles had his candidate all picked out lieutenant gamad swollen with his newly inherited seniority was inclined to challenge miless authority over the refinery technically it was true felician property after daums cool get thejobdone intensity miles suffered him ungladly gamad was quashed however when he overheard one of miless mercenaries address him as admiral naismith miles was so delighted with the effect of the ersatz title on gamad that he let it pass unchecked unfortunately it spread he found himself unable to retrieve the careful neutrality of mr naismith thereafter gamad was saved on the eighth day after the counterattack when a felician local space cruiser finally appeared on the monitors miless mercenaries twitchy and suspicious after repeated ambushes were inclined to obliterate it first and sift the remains for positive id after but miles at last established a measure of trust and the felicians came meekly to dock two large businesslike plastic crates on a float pallet riveted miless attention when the felician officers entered the refinery conference chamber the crates bore a pleasant resemblance in size at least to old sea pirates treasure chests miles lost himself in a brief fantasy of glittering diadems gold coins and ropes of pearls alas that such gaudy baubles were treasures no more crystallized viral microcircuits data packs dna splices blank drafts on major planetary agricultural and mining futures such was the tepid wealth men schemed upon in these degenerate days of course there was still artwork miles touched the dagger at his belt and was warmed as by an old mans handclasp he decided he would probably settle for a few of those blank drafts the pinched and harried felician paymaster was speaking must have major daums manifest first and physically check each item for damage in transit the felician cruiser captain nodded wearily see my chief engineer and draft as much help as you need but make it quick the captain turned a bloodshot and irritated eye on gamad trailing obsequiously havent you found that manifest yet or daums personal papers im afraid he may have had them on him when he was hit sir the captain growled and turned to miles so youre this mad galactic mutant ive been hearing about miles drew himself up i am not a mutant captain he drawled the last word out in his fathers most sarcastic style then took hold of his temper the felician clearly hadnt slept much the last few days i believe you have some business to conduct yes mercenaries must have their pay i suppose sighed the captain and physically check each item for damage in transit miles prodded with a pointed nod at the boxes take care of him paymaster the captain ordered and wheeled out all right gamad show me this grand strategy of yours bazs eyes smoked excuse me my lord but i think id better join them ill go with you offered mayhew he clicked his teeth together gently as if nibbling for a jugular go ahead miles turned to the paymaster who sighed and shoved a data cartridge into the tabletop viewer nowmr naismith is that correct may i see your copy of the contract please miles frowned uneasily major daum and i had a verbal agreement forty thousand betan dollars upon safe delivery of his cargo to felice this refinery is felician territory now the paymaster stared astonished a verbal agreement a verbal agreement is no contract miles sat up a verbal agreement is the most binding of contracts your soul is in your breath and therefore in your voice once pledged it must be redeemed mysticism has no place it is not mysticism its a recognized legal theory on barrayar miles realized thats the first ive heard of it major daum understood it perfectly well major daum was in intelligence he specialized in galactics im just accounting office you refuse to redeem your dead comrades word but you are real service no mercenary the paymaster shook his head i have no idea what youre babbling about but if the cargo is right youll be paid this isnt jacksons whole miles relaxed slightly very well the paymaster was no vor nor anything like one counting his payment in front of him was not likely to be taken as a mortal insult lets see it the paymaster nodded to his assistant who uncoded the locks miles held his breath in happy anticipation of more money than hed seen in one pile in his life the lids swung up to reveal stacks and stacks of tightly bundled particolored pieces of paper there was a long long pause miles slid off his legswinging perch on the conference table and picked out a bundle each contained perhaps a hundred identical brightly engraved compositions of pictures numbers and letters in a strange cursive alphabet the paper was slick almost sleazy he held one piece up to the light what is it he asked at last the paymaster raised his eyebrows paper currency its used commonly for money on most planets i know that what currency is it felician millifenigs millifenigs it sounded faintly like a swear word whats it worth in real money betan dollars or say barrayaran imperial marks who uses barrayaran marks the paymasters assistant muttered in puzzlement the paymaster cleared his throat as of the annual listing millifenigs were pegged at per betan dollar on the betan exchange he recited quickly wasnt that almost a year ago what are they now the paymaster found something to look at out the plexiports the oseran blockade has prevented us from learning the current rate of exchange yeah well what was the last figure you had then the paymaster cleared his throat again his voice became strangely small because of the blockade you understand almost all the information about the war has been sent by the pelians the rate please we dont know the last rate miles hissed the paymaster jumped we really dont sir last we heard felician currency had been uh he was almost inaudible dropped from the exchange miles fingered his dagger and just what are thesemillifenigs he would have to experiment he decided to find just the right degree of venom to pronounce that word backed by the paymaster raised his head proudly the government of felice the one thats losing this war right the paymaster muttered something you are losing this war are you not losing the high orbitals was just a setback the paymaster explained desperately we still control our own airspace millifenigs snorted miles millifenigs well i want betan dollars he glared at the paymaster the paymaster replied as one goaded in pride and turning at bay there are no betan dollars every cent of it yes and every flake of other galactic currencies we could round up was sent with major daum to buy that cargo which i have risked my life delivering to you which he died delivering to us miles sighed recognizing an argument he could not win his most frenetic posturing would not wring betan dollars from a government that owned none millifenigs he muttered i have to go said the paymaster i have to initial the inventory miles flicked a hand at him tiredly yes go the paymaster and his assistant fled leaving him alone in the beautiful conference chamber with two crates of money that the paymaster didnt even bother to set guard demand receipt or see it counted merely confirmed its worthlessness miles piled a pyramid of the stuff before him on the conference table and laid his head on his arms beside it millifenigs he wandered momentarily in a mental calculation of its square area if laid out in singles he could certainly paper not only the walls but the ceiling of his room at home and most of the rest of vorkosigan house as well mother would probably object he idly tested its inflammability lighting one piece planning to hold it until it burned down to his fingertips to see if anything could hurt more than his stomach but the doorseals clapped shut at the scent of smoke a raucous alarm went off and a chemical fire extinguisher protruded from the wall like a red sardonic tongue fire was a real terror in space installations the next step he recalled would be the evacuation of the air from the chamber to smother the flames he batted the paper out hastily millifenigs he dragged himself across the room to silence the alarm he varied his financial structure by building a square fort with corner towers and an interior keep the gate lintel had a tendency to collapse with a slight rustle perhaps he could pass on pelian commercial shipping as a mentally retarded mutant with elena as his nurse and bothari as his keeper being sent to some offplanet hospitalor zooby rich relatives he could take off his boots and socks and bite his toenails during customs inspections but what roles could he find for mayhew and jesek and elli quinnliegesworn or not he owed her a face worse he had no credit hereand somehow he doubted the exchange rate between felician and pelian currency would be in his favor the door sighed open miles quickly knocked his fort into a more randomappearing pile and sat up straight for the benefit of the mercenary who saluted and entered a selfconscious smile was pasted under the mans avid eyes excuse me sir id heard a rumor that our pay had arrived miless lips peeled back in an uncontrollable grin he forced them straight as you see who after all could say what the exchange rate for millifenigs waswho could contradict any figure he chose to peg them at as long as his mercenaries were in space isolated from test markets no one of course when they did find out there might not be enough pieces of him to go around like the dismemberment of mad emperor yuri the mercenarys mouth formed an o at the size of the pile shouldnt you set a guard sir just so trainee nout good thinking ahwhy dont you go fetch a float pallet and secure this payroll inerthe usual place pick two trustworthy comrades to relieve you on guard duty around the clock me sir the mercenarys eyes widened youd trust me what could you do steal it and go buy a loaf of bread miles thought aloud he replied yes i would did you think i havent been evaluating your performance these past weeks he prayed hed got the mans name right yes sir right away sir the mercenary rendered him a perfectly unnecessary salute and danced out as if he had rubber balls in his boots miles buried his face in a pile of millifenigs and giggled helplessly very close to tears he saw the millifenigs bundled back up and trundled safely to cold storage then lingered in the conference chamber bothari should be seeking him out soon when done turning the last of the prisoners over to felician control the rg floating beyond the plexiports was getting some attention at last the hull was taking on the appearance of a halffinished patchwork quilt miles wondered if hed ever get up the nerve to ride in it without a pressure suit on and his helmet at his elbow jesek and mayhew found him still gazing pensively across the installation we set them straight the engineer declared planting himself beside miles savage contentment had replaced the burning indignation in his eyes hm miles broke free of his moody reverie set who straight about what the felicians and that greasy careerbuilder gamad about time somebody did that miles agreed absently he wondered what the rg might fetch if sold as an innersystem freighter not preferably for millifenigs or as scrap no he couldnt do that to arde here they come now hm the felicians were back the captain the paymaster and what looked like most of the ships officers plus some kind of space marine commander miles had not seen before from the captains deference to him in the doorway miles guessed he must be the ranking man a senior colonel perhaps or a young general gamad was notably absent thorne and auson brought up the rear this time the captain came to attention and saluted i believe i owe you an apology admiral naismith i did not fully understand the situation here miles grasped bazs arm and stood on tiptoe to his ear whispering urgently between his teeth baz what have you been telling these people just the truth baz began but there was no time for further reply the senior officer was stepping forward extending his hand how do you do admiral naismith i am general halify i have orders from my high command to hold this installation by whatever means necessary they shook hands and were seated miles took the head of the table by way of experiment the felician general seated himself earnestly and without demur on miless right there was some interesting jostling for seats farther down the line since our second ship was lost to the pelians on our way here mine is the unenviable task of doing so with menhalf my complement continued halify i did it with forty miles observed automatically what was the felician leading up to mine is also the task of stripping it of betan ordinance to send back with captain sahlin here to prosecute the war on what has unfortunately become the home front that will make it more complicated for you miles agreed until the pelians brought in galactics our two sides were fairly matched we thought we were on the verge of a negotiated settlement the oserans changed that balance so i understand what galactics can do galactics can surely undo we wish to hire the dendarii mercenaries to break the oseran blockade and clear local space of all offplanet forces the pelians he sniffed we can take care of ourselves im going to let bothari finish strangling baz a bold offer general i wish i could take you up on it but as you must know most of my forces are not here the general clasped his hands intensely before him on the table i believe we can hold out long enough for you to send for them miles glanced at auson and thorne down the expanse of darkly gleaming plastic not perhaps the best time to explain just how long a wait that would be we would have to run the blockade to do so and at the moment all my jump ships are disabled felice has three commercial jump ships left besides the ones that were trapped outside the blockade when it began one is very fast surely in combination with your warships you might get it through miles was about to make a rude reply when it hit himhere was escape being offered on a platter pile his leigepeople into the jump ship have thorne and auson run him through the blockade and thumb his nose to tau verde iv and all its denizens forever it was risky but it could be donewas in fact the best idea hed had all dayhe sat up smiling suavely an interesting proposition general he must not appear too eager just how do you propose to pay for my services the dendarii do not work cheaply im authorized to meet whatever terms you ask within reason of course general halify added prudently to put it bluntly general thats a load ofmillifenigs if major daum had no authority to hire outside forces neither do you they said by whatever means necessary the generals jaw set theyll back me id want a contract in writing signed by somebody who can properly be shaken downuh held responsible after retired generals incomes are not notoriously vast a spark of amusement flared briefly in halifys eye and he nodded youll get it we must be paid in betan dollars i understood you were fresh out if the blockade is broken we can get offplanet currencies again youll get them miles pressed his lips together firmly he must not break down into howls of laughter yet here he sat a man with an imaginary battle fleet negotiating for its services with a man with an imaginary budget well the price was certainly right the general extended his hand admiral naismith you have my personal word on it may i have yours his humor shattered in a thousand frozen shards swallowed in a cold vast emptiness that used to be his belly my word i understand it has some meaning to you you understand entirely too much my word i see he had never yet broken his word almost eighteen and he still preserved that virginity well there was a first time for everything he accepted the generals handclasp general halify ill do my best my word on it chapter fifteen the three ships dove and wove in an intricate evasion pattern around them twenty more darted as if hawks hunted in packs the three ships sparked blue red yellow then dissolved in a brilliant rainbow glare miles leaned back in his station chair in the triumphs tactics room and rubbed his bleary eyes scratch that idea he vented a long sigh if he couldnt be a soldier perhaps he had a future as a designer of fireworks displays elena drifted in munching a ration bar that looked pretty what was it miles held up a didactic finger i have just discovered my twentythird new way to get killed this week he waved toward the holograph display that was it elena glanced across the room to her father apparently asleep on the friction matting where is everybody catching sleep im just as glad not to have an audience while i attempt to teach myself firstyear tactics they might begin to doubt my genius she gave him an odd look mileshow serious are you about this blockade busting he glanced up to the outside screens which showed the same boring view of what might be called the backside of the metals refinery they had displayed since the ship had been parked after the counterattack the triumph was now being dubbed miless flagship with the arrival of the felician forces filling the refinerys crews quarters he had decamped secretly relieved from the squalid luxury of the executive suite to the more restful austerity of tungs former quarters i dont know its been two weeks since the felicians promised us that fast courier to leg on out of here and they havent produced it yet were going to at least have to break through the blockade he hastened to erase the worry in her face at least it gives me something to do while we wait this machine is more fun than chess or strato any day he hopped up and gestured her with a courtly bow toward the next station chair look ill teach you how to operate it show you a game or two youll be good well he introduced her to a couple of elementary tactics patterns demystifying them by calling them play captain koudelka and i used to play something like this she caught on quickly it had to be some kind of criminal injustice that ivan vorpatril was even now deeply engaged in officers training for which elena could not even be considered he went through his half of the patterns automatically while his mind circled again around his real life military dilemma this was just the sort of thing he would have been taught how to do at the imperial service academy he thought with an inward sigh there was probably a book on it he wished he had a copy he was getting mortally tired of having to reinvent the wheel every fifteen minutes although it was just barely possible there was no way for three small warships and a battered freighter to take out an entire mercenary fleet the felicians could offer little assistance beyond the use of the refinery as a base of course miless presence there benefited them at least as much as their support did him as pelianrepellant he glanced up at elena and pushed the importunate strategic hassles from his mind her strength and sharpness were blooming these days in her new challenges all shed ever needed was a chance it seemed baz shouldnt have it all his own way he glanced over to see if bothari was really asleep and screwed up his courage the tactics room with its swivel chairs was not wellarranged for nuzzling but he would try he went to her shoulder and leaned over it manufacturing some helpful instruction mr naismith blatted the intercom it was captain auson calling from nav and com put the outside channels on im coming down miles snapped out of his haze cursing silently whats up tungs back uh oh better scramble everybody i am whats he brought can you tell yet yes its strange hes standing just out of range in what looks like a pelian innersystem passenger ship maybe a little troopcarrier or something and saying he wants to talk with you probably a trick miles frowned mystified well pipe it down then but keep scrambling in moments the eurasians familiar face appeared larger than life bothari was now up at his usual post by the door silent as ever he and elena didnt talk much since the incident in the damaged prison section but then they never had how do you do captain tung we meet again i see the subtle vibrations of the ship changed as it powered up and began to move into open space we do indeed tung smiled tight and fierce is that job offer still open son the two shuttles sandwiched themselves together belly to belly like a pair of mismatched limpets in space midway between their mother ships there the two men met facetoface in privacy but for bothari tense and discreet just out of earshot and tungs pilot who remained equally discreetly aboard tungs shuttle my people are loyal to me said tung i can place them at your service every one you realize miles pointed out mildly that if you wished to retake your ship that would be an ideal ploy load my forces with yours and strike at will can you prove youre not a trojan horse tung sighed agreement only as you proved that memorable lunch was not drugged in the eating mm miles pulled himself back down into his seat in the gravityless shuttle as if he could so impose orientation on body and mind he offered tung a softdrink bulb which tung accepted without hesitation or comment they both drank miles sparingly his stomach was already starting to protest nullgee you also realize i cannot give you your ship back all i have to offer at the moment is a captured pelian puttputt and perhaps the title of staff officer yes i understand that youll have to work with both auson and thorne without bringing up um past frictions tung looked less than enthusiastic but he replied if i have to i can even do that he snapped a squirt of fruit juice out of the air practice thought miles enviously my payroll for the moment is entirely in felician millifenigs do you ahknow about millifenigs no but at a guess from the felicians strategic situation id suppose theyd make an eyecatching toilet paper thats about right miles frowned captain tung after going to a great deal of trouble to escape two weeks ago you have gone to what looks like an equal amount of trouble to return to join what can only be described as the losing side you know you cant have your ship back you know your pay is at best problematicali cant believe its all for my native charm why it wasnt that much trouble that delightful young ladyremind me to kiss her handlet me out observed tung that delightful young lady is commander bothari to you sir and considering what you owe her you can bloody well confine yourself to saluting her snapped miles surprising himself he swallowed a squirt of fruit drink to hide his confusion tung raised his eyebrows and smiled i see miles dragged his mind back to the present again why tungs face hardened because you are the only force in local space with a chance of giving oser a prick in the ass and just when did you acquire this motivation hard yes and inward he violated our contract in the event of losing my ship in combat he owed me another command miles jerked his chin up inviting tung to go on tungs voice lowered he had a right to chew me out yes for my mistakesbut he had no right to humiliate me before my people his hands were clenched ivoryknuckled on the arms of his seat his drink bulb floated away forgotten miless imagination filled in the picture admiral oser angry and shocked at this sudden defeat after a year of easy victories losing his temper mishandling tungs hot damaged pridefoolish that when it would have been so easy to turn that pride redoubled to his own serviceyes it rang true and so you come to my hand ahwith all your officers you say your pilot officer escape escape in tungs ship possible again escape from the pelians and oserans thought miles soberly its escape from the dendarii thats beginning to look difficult all all but my communications officer of course why of course oh thats right you dont know about his double life hes a military agent assigned to keep watch on the oseran fleet for his government i think he wanted to comeweve gotten to know each other pretty well these past six yearsbut he had to follow his primary orders tung chucked he apologized miles blinked is that sort of thing usual oh theres always a few scattered through all the mercenary organizations tung gave miles a sharp look havent you ever had any most captains throw them out as soon as they catch on but i like them theyre generally extremely welltrained and more trustworthy than most as long as youre not fighting anybody they know if id had occasion to fight the barrayarans god forbid or any of theirwell the barrayarans are not particularly troubled with alliesid have been sure to drop him off somewhere first b choked miles and swallowed the rest ye gods had he been recognized if the man were one of captain illyans agents almost certainly and what the devil had the man made of the recent events seen from the oseran point of view miles could kiss goodbye any hope of keeping his late adventures secret from his father then his fruit drink seemed to slosh viscous and nasty on the roof of his stomach damn nullgee hed better wind this up a mercenary admiral didnt need a reputation for space sickness to go with his more obvious disabilities miles wondered briefly how many key command decisions in history had been flicked out in the compelling urgency of some like biological necessity he stuck out his hand captain tung i accept your service tung took it admiral naismithit is admiral naismith now i understand miles grimaced so it would appear a halfsuppressed grin turned one corner of tungs mouth i see i shall be pleased to serve you son when he had left miles sat eyeing his drink bulb for a moment he gave it a squeeze and it snapped bright red fruit drink marinated his eyebrows chin and tunic front he swore under his breath and floated off in search of a towel the ariel was late thorne accompanied by arde and baz was supposed to be escorting the betan weapons through to feliciancontrolled airspace and then bringing the fast jump courier back and they were late it took two days for miles to persuade general halify to relinquish tungs old crew from their cells after that there was nothing to do but watch and wait and worry five days behind schedule both ships appeared in the monitors miles got thorne on the com and demanded with an edge in his voice the reason for the delay thorne positively smirked its a surprise youll like it can you meet us now in the docking bay a surprise god now what miles was at last beginning to sympathize with botharis stated taste for being bored he stalked to the docking bay nebulous plans for bracing his laggard subordinates rotating in his brain arde met him grinning and bouncing on his heels just stand right here my lord he raised his voice go ahead baz hup hup hup there came a great shuffling thumping from the flex tube out of it marched doubletime a ragged string of men and women some wore uniforms both military and civilian types others civilian clothes in a wild assortment of various planetary fashions mayhew directed them into a standard square formation where they stood moreorless to attention there was a group of a dozen or so blackuniformed kshatryan imperial mercenaries who formed their own tight little island in the sea of color on closer look their uniforms though clean and mended were not all complete odd buttons shiny seats and elbows lopworn boot heelsthey were long long from their distant home it seemed miless temporary fascination with them was shattered at the appearance of two dozen cetagandan ghemfighters variously dressed but all with full formal face paint freshly applied looking like an array of chinese temple demons bothari swore and clapped his hand to his plasma arc at the sight of them miles motioned him to parade rest freighter and passenger liner tech uniforms a whiteskinned whitehaired man in a feathered gstringmiles taking in the polished bandolier and plasma rifle he also bore was not inclined to smilea darkhaired woman in her thirties of almost supernatural beauty engrossed with directing a crew of four techsshe glanced toward him then frankly stared a very odd look on her face he stood a little straighter not a mutant maam he thought irritably when the flex tube emptied at last perhaps a hundred people stood before him in the docking bay miless head whirled thorne baz and arde all appeared at his elbow looking immensely pleased with themselves baz miles opened his hand in helpless supplication what is this jesek stood to attention dendarii recruits my lord did i ask you to collect recruits he had never been that drunk surely you said we didnt have enough personnel to man our equipment so i applied a little forward momentum to the problem andthere you are where the devil did you get them all felice there must be two thousand galactics trapped there by the blockade merchant ship personnel passengers business people techs a little of everything even soldiers theyre not all soldiers of course not yet ah miles cleared his throat handpicked are they well baz scuffed his boot on the deck and studied it as if looking for signs of wear i gave them some weapons to fieldstrip and reassemble if they didnt try to shove the plasma arc power cartridge in the nerve disruptor grip slot i hired em miles wandered up and down the rows bemused i see very ingenious i doubt i could have done better myself he nodded toward the kshatryans where were they going thats an interesting story put in mayhew they werent exactly trapped by the blockade seems some local felician magnate of the uh subeconomy had hired them for bodyguards a few years ago about six months back they botched the job rendering themselves unemployed theyll do about anything for a ride out of here i found them myself he added proudly i see ah bazcetagandans bothari had not taken his eyes from their gaudy fierce faces since they had exited the flex tube the engineer turned his hands palmoutwards theyre trained do they realize that some dendarii are barrayaran they know i am and with a name like dendarii any cetagandan would have to make the connection that mountain range made an impression on them during the great war but they want a ride out of here too that was part of the contract you see to keep the price downalmost everybody wants to be discharged outside felician local space i sympathize muttered miles the felician fast courier floated outside the docking station he itched for a closer look wellsee captain tung and arrange quarters for them all and uh training schedules yes keep them busy while heslipped away captain tung said thorne yes hes a dendarii now ive been doing some recruiting too should be just like a family reunion for youah bel he fixed the betan with a stern eye you are now comrades in arms as a dendarii i expect you to remember it tung thorne sounded more amazed than jealous oser will be foaming miles spent the evening running his new recruits dossiers into the triumphs computers by hand by himself and by choice the better to familiarize himself with his leigemens human grabbag they were in fact well chosen most had previous military experience the rest invariably possessed some arcane and valuable technical specialty some were arcane indeed he stopped his monitor to study the face of the extraordinarily beautiful woman who had stared at him in the docking bay what the devil had baz been about to hire a banking comm link security specialist as a soldier of fortune to be sure she might want offplanet badly enoughah never mind her resume explained the mystery she had once held the rank of ensign in the escobaran military space forces shed had an honorable medical discharge after the war with barrayar nineteen years ago medical discharges must have been a fad then miles mused thinking of botharis his amusement drained away and he felt the hairs on his arms stir great dark eyes clean square line of jawher last name was visconti typically escobaran her first name was elena no whispered miles to himself firmly not possible he weakened anyway not likely he read the resume again more carefully the escobaran woman had come to tau verde iv a year ago to install a comm link system her company had sold to a felician bank she must have arrived just days before the war started she listed herself as unmarried with no dependents miles swung around in his chair with his back to the screen then found himself sneaking another look from the corner of his eye she had been unusually young to be an officer during the escobarbarrayar warsome sort of precocious hotshot perhaps miles caught himself up ironically wondering when hed started feeling so middleaged but if she were just possibly his elenas mother how had she got mixed up with sergeant bothari bothari had been pushing forty then and looked much the same as now judging from vids miles had seen from his parents early years of marriage no accounting for taste maybe a little reunion fantasy blossomed in his imagination unbidden galloping ahead of all proof to present elena not merely with a grave but with her longedfor mother in the fleshto finally feed that secret hunger sharper than a thorn that had plagued her all her life twin to his own clumsy hunger to please his fatherthat would be a heroism worth stretching for better than showering her with the most fabulous material gifts imaginablehe melted at the picture of her delight and yetand yet it was only a hypothesis testing it might prove awkward he had realized the sergeant was not being strictly truthful when hed said he couldnt remember escobar but it might be partly so or this woman might be somebody else altogether he would make his test in private then and blind if he were wrong no harm done miles held his first full senior officers meeting the next day partly to acquaint himself with his new henchmen but mostly to throw the floor open to ideas for blockadebusting with all this military and exmilitary talent around there had to be someone who knew what they were doing more copies of the dendarii regulations were passed out and miles retired after to his appropriated cabin on his appropriated flagship to run me parameters of the felician courier through the computer one more time he had upped the couriers estimated passenger capacity for the twoweek run to beta colony from a crowded four to a squeezed five by eliminating several sorts of baggage and fudging the lifesupport backup figures as much as he dared surely there had to be something he could do to boost it to seven he also tried very hard not to think about the mercenaries waiting eagerly for his return with reinforcements and waiting and waiting they should not linger here any longer the triumphs tactics simulator had shown that thinking he could break the oserans with troops was pure megalomania still no he forced himself to think reasonably the logical person to leave behind was elli quinn of the slagged face she was no leigewoman of his really then a tossup between baz and arde taking the engineer back to beta colony would expose him to arrest and extradition leaving him here would be for his own good yessir never mind that he had been selflessly busting his tail for weeks to serve miless every military whim never mind what the oserans would do to all their deserters and everyone associated with them when they finally caught up with them as they inevitably must never mind that it would also most handily sever bazs romance with elena and wasnt that very possibly the real reason logic miles decided made his stomach hurt anyway it was not easy to keep his mind on his work just now he checked his wrist chronometer just a few more minutes he wondered if it had been silly to lay in that bottle of awful felician wine concealed now with four glasses in his cupboard he need only bring it out if if if he sighed and leaned back and smiled across the cabin at elena she sat on the bed in companionable silence screening a manual on weapons drills sergeant bothari sat at a small foldout table cleaning and recharging their personal weapons elena smiled back and removed her audio bug from her ear do you have your physical training program figured out for our uh new recruits he asked her some of them look like its been a while since theyve worked out regularly all set she assured him im starting a big group first thing next daycycle general halify is going to lend me the refinery crews gym she paused then added speaking of not working out for a whiledont you think youd better come too uh said miles good idea said the sergeant not looking up from his work my stomach it would be a good example to your troops she added blinking her brown eyes at him in feigned he was sure innocence whos going to warn them not to break me in half her eyes glinted ill let you pretend youre instructing them your gym clothes said the sergeant blowing a bit of dust out of the silvered bellmuzzle of a nerve disruptor and nodding to his left are in the bottom drawer of that wall compartment miles sighed defeat oh all right he checked his chronometer again any minute now the door of the cabin slid open it was the escobaran woman right on time good day technician visconti he began cheerfully his words died on his lips as she raised a needler and held it in both hands to aim dont anybody move she cried an unnecessary instruction miles at least was frozen in shock mouth open so she said at last hatred pain and weariness trembled her voice it is you i wasnt sure at first you she was addressing bothari miles guessed for her needler was aimed at his chest her hands shook but the aim never wavered the sergeant had caught up a plasma arc when the door slid open now incredibly his hand fell to his side weapon dangling he straightened slightly by the wall out of his firing semicrouch elena sat crosslegged an awkward position from which to jump her hand viewer fell forgotten to the bed the audio emitted a thin tinny sound small as an insect in the silence the escobaran womans eyes flicked for a moment to miles then back to their target i think youd better know admiral naismith just what you have hired for your bodyguard uh why dont you give me your needler and sit down and well talk about it he held out an open hand experimentally inviting hot shivers that began in the pit of his stomach were radiating outward his hand shook foolishly this wasnt the way hed rehearsed this meeting she hissed her needler swinging toward him he recoiled and her aim jerked back to bothari that one she nodded at the sergeant is an exbarrayaran soldier no surprise i suppose that he should have drifted into some obscure mercenary fleet but he was admiral vorrutyers chief torturer when the barrayarans tried to invade escobar but maybe you knew that her eyes seemed to peel miles like flensing knives for a moment a moment was quite a long time at the relativistic speed at which he was now falling ii he stammered he glanced at elena her eyes were huge her body tense to spring the admiral never raped his victims himselfhe preferred to watch vorrutyer was prince sergs catamite perhaps the prince was jealous he applied more inventive tortures himself though the prince was waiting since his particular obsession was pregnant women which i suppose vorrutyers group was obliged to supply miless mind screamed through a hundred unwanted connections no no no so there was such a thing as latent knowledge how long had he known not to ask questions he didnt want to hear the answers to elenas face reflected total outrage and disbelief god help him to keep it that way his stunner lay on botharis table across their mutual line of fire did he stand a chance of leaping for it i was eighteen years old when i fell into their hands just graduated no war lover but wishing to serve and protect my homethat was no war out there that was some personal hell growing vile in the barrayaran high commands unchecked power she was close to hysteria as if old cold dormant terrors were erupting in a swarm more overwhelming than even she had anticipated he had to shut her up somehow and that one her finger was tight on the trigger of the needler was their tool their best showmaker their pet the barrayarans refused to turn over their war criminals and my own government bargained away the justice that should have been mine for the sake of the peace settlements and so he went free to be my nightmare for the past two decades but mercenary fleets dispense their own justice admiral naismith i demand this mans arrest i dontits not began miles he turned to bothari his eyes imploring denialmake it not be truesergeant the explosion of words had spattered over bothari like acid his face was furrowed with pain brow creased with an effort ofmemory his eyes went from his daughter to miles to the escobaran and a sigh went out of him a man descending forever into hell vouchsafed one glimpse of paradise might have such a look on his face lady he whispered you are still beautiful dont goad her sergeant miles screamed silently the escobaran womans face contorted with rage and fear she braced herself a stream as of tiny silver raindrops sang from the shaking weapon the needles burst against the wall all around bothari in a whining shower of spinning razorsharp shards the weapon jammed the woman swore and scrabbled at it bothari leaning against the wall murmured rest now miles was not sure to whom miles sprang for his stunner as elena leaped for the escobaran elena struck the needler sliding across the room and had the womans arms hooked behind her twisting in their shoulder sockets with the strength of her terror and rage by the time hed brought the stunner to aim but the woman was resistless spent miles saw why as he spun back to the sergeant bothari fell like a wall toppling as if in pieces at the joints his shirt displayed four or five tiny drops of blood only scarcely a nosebleeds worth but they were obliterated in a sudden red flood from his mouth as he convulsed choking he writhed once on the friction matting vomiting a second scarlet tide across the first across miless hands lap shirt front as he scrambled on hands and knees to kneel by his bodyguards head sergeant bothari lay still watchful eyes stopped and open head twisted the blood flung from his mouth soaking into the friction matting he looked like some dead animal smashed by a vehicle miles patted botharis chest frantically but could not even find the pinhole entrance wounds five hitsbotharis chest cavity abdomen organs must be sliced and stirred to hamburger within why didnt he fire wailed elena she shook the escobaran woman wasnt it charged miles glanced at the plasma arcs readouts in the sergeants stiffening hand freshly charged bothari had just done it himself elena took one despairing look at her fathers body and snaked a hand around the escobaran womans throat catching her tunic her arm tightened across the womans windpipe miles rocked back on his heels his shirt trousers hands soaked in blood no elena dont kill her why not why not tears were swarming down her ravaged face i think shes your mother oh god he shouldnt have said that you believe those horrible things she raged at him unbelieveable lies but her hold slackened milesi dont even know what some of those words mean the escobaran woman coughed and twisted her head around to stare in astonishment and dismay over her shoulder this is that ones spawn she asked miles his daughter her eyes counted off the features of elenas face miles did too it seemed to him the secret sources of elenas hair eyes elegant bone structure stood before him you look like him her great brown eyes held a thin crust of distaste over a bog of horror id heard the barrayarans had used the fetuses for military research she eyed miles in confused speculation are you another but no you couldnt be elena released her and stood back once at the summer place at vorkosigan surleau miles had witnessed a horse trapped in a shed burn to death no one able to get near it for the heat he had thought no sound could be more heartpiercing than its death screams elenas silence was she was not crying now miles drew himself up in dignity no maam admiral vorkosigan saw them all safely delivered to an orphanage i believe all but elenas lips formed the word lies but there was no more conviction in her her eyes sucked at the escobaran woman with a hunger that terrified miles the door of the cabin slid open again arde mayhew sauntered in saying my lord do you want these assignmentsgod almighty he nearly tripped stopping short ill get the medtech hang on he dashed back out elena visconti approached botharis body with the caution one would use toward a freshlykilled poisonous reptile her eyes locked with miless from opposite sides of the barrier admiral naismith i apologize for inconveniencing you but this was no murder it was the just execution of a war criminal it was just she insisted her voice edged with passion it was her voice fell away it was no murder it was a suicide miles thought he could have shot you where you stood at any time he was that fast no her lips thinned in despair you call me a liar too or are you going to tell me i enjoyed it no he looked up at her across a vast gulf one meter wide i dont mock you butuntil i was four almost five years old i couldnt walk only crawl i spent a lot of time looking at peoples knees but if there was ever a parade or something to see i had the best view of anybody because i watched it from on top the sergeants shoulder for answer she spat on botharis body a spasm of rage darkened miless vision he was saved from a possibly disastrous action by the return of mayhew and the medtech the medtech ran to him admiral where are you hit he stared at her stupidly a moment then glanced down at himself realizing the red reason for her concern not me its the sergeant he brushed ineffectually at the cooling stickiness she knelt by bothari what happened was it an accident miles glanced up at elena where she stood just stood arms wrapped around herself as if she were cold only her eyes traveled back and forth from the sergeants crumpled form to the harsh straightness of the escobaran back and forth finding no rest his mouth was stiff he made it move by force of will an accident he was cleaning the weapons the needler was set on auto rapidfire two true statements out of three the escobaran womans mouth curled in silent triumph and relief she thinks i have endorsed her justice miles realized forgive me the medtech shook her head running a hand scanner over botharis chest whew what a mess a sudden hope rocketed through miles the cryo chamberswhats their status all filled sir after the counterattack when you triage for them howhow do you choose the least messedup ones have the best hope of revival they get first choice enemies last unless intelligence throws a fit how would you rate this injury worse than any ive got on ice now except two who are the two a couple of captain tungs people do you want me to dump one miles paused searching elenas face she was staring at botharis body as if he were some stranger wearing her fathers face who had suddenly unmasked her dark eyes were like deep caverns like graves one for bothari one for himself he hated the cold he muttered at last justget a morgue pack yes sir she exited unhurried mayhew wandered up to stare bemused and bewildered on the face of death im sorry my lord i was just beginning to like him in a kind of weird way yes thank you go away miles looked up at the escobaran woman go away he whispered elena was turning around and around between the dead and the living like a creature newly caged discovering that cold iron sears the flesh mother she said at last in a tiny voice not at all like her own you keep away from me the escobaran woman snarled at her lowvoiced and pale far away she gave her a look of loathing contemptuous as a slap and stalked out um said arde maybe you should come somewhere and sit down elena ill get you a a drink of water or something he plucked at her anxiously come away now theres a good girl she suffered herself to be led with one last look over her shoulder her face reminded miles of a bombedout city miles waited for the medtech in deathwatch for his first leigeman afraid and growing more so unaccustomed he had always had the sergeant to be afraid for him he touched botharis face the shaved chin was rough under his fingertips what do i do now sergeant chapter sixteen it was three days before he cried worried that he could not cry then in bed alone at night it came as a frightening uncontrollable storm lasting hours miles judged it a just catharsis but it kept repeating on succeeding nights and then he worried that it would not stop his stomach hurt all the time now but especially after meals which he therefore scarcely touched his sharp features sharpened further molding to his bones the days were a grey fog faces familiar and unfamiliar badgered him for directions to which his reply was an invariable laconic suit yourself elena would not talk to him at all he was stirred to fear she was finding comfort in bazs arms he watched her covertly anxious but she seemed not to be finding comfort anywhere after a particularly formless and inconclusive dendarii staff meeting arde mayhew took him aside miles had sat silent at the head of the table seemingly studying his hands while his officers voices had croaked on meaningless as frogs god knows whispered arde i dont know much about being a military officer he took an angry breath but i do know you cant drag and more people out on a limb with you like this and then go catatonic youre right miles snarled back you dont know much he stamped off stiffbacked but shaken inside with the justice of mayhews complaint he slammed into his cabin just in time to throw up in secret for the fourth time that week the second since botharis death resolve sternly to take up the work at hand immediately and no more nonsense and fall across his bed to lay immobile for the next six hours he was getting dressed men whod done isolated duty all agreed you had to keep the standards up or things went to hell miles had been awake three hours now and had his trousers on in the next hour he was either going to try for his socks or shave whichever seemed easier he contemplated the pigheaded masochism of the barrayaran habit of the daily shave versus say the civilized betan custom of permanently stunning the hair follicles perhaps hed go for the socks the cabin buzzer blatted he ignored it then the intercom elenas voice miles let me in he lurched to a sitting position nearly blacking himself out and called hastily come which released the voicelock she picked her way in across strewn clothing weapons equipment disconnected chargers rations wrappers and stared around wrinkling her nose in dismay you know she said at last if youre not going to pick this mess up yourself you ought to at least choose a new batman miles stared around too it never occurred to me he said humbly i used to imagine i was a very neat person everything just put itself away or so i thought you wouldnt mind mind what if i got a new batman why should i care miles thought it over maybe arde ive got to find something for him to do sooner or later now he cant jump anymore arde she repeated dubiously hes not nearly as slovenly as he used to be mm she picked up a handviewer that was lying upsidedown on the floor and looked for a place to set it but there was only one level surface in the cabin that held no clutter or dust miles how long are you going to keep that coffin in here it might as well be stored here as anywhere the morgues cold he didnt like the cold people are beginning to think youre strange let em think what they like i gave him my word once that id take him back to be buried on barrayar ifif anything happened to him out here she shrugged angrily why bother keeping your word to a corpse itll never know the difference im alive miles said quietly and id know she stalked around the cabin lips tight face tight whole body tightive been running your unarmed combat classes for ten days now you havent come to a single session he wondered if he ought to tell her about throwing up the blood no shed drag him off to the medtech for sure he didnt want to see the medtech his age the secret weakness of his bonestoo much would become apparent on a close medical examination she went on baz is doing double shifts reconditioning equipment tung and thorne and auson are running their tails off organizing the new recruitsbut its all starting to come apart everybodys spending all their time arguing with everybody else miles if you spend another week holed up in here the dendarii mercenaries are going to start looking just like this cabin i know ive been to the staff meetings just because i dont say anything doesnt mean im not listening then listen to them when they say they need your leadership i swear to god elena i dont know what for he ran his hands through his hair and jerked up his chin baz fixes things arde runs them tung and thorne and auson and their people do the fighting you keep them all sharp and in conditionim the one person who doesnt do anything real at all he paused they say what do you say what does it matter what i say you came they asked me to come you havent been letting anyone else in remember theyve been pestering me for days they act like a bunch of ancient christians asking the virgin mary to intercede with god a ghost of his old grin flitted across his mouth no only with jesus god is back on barrayar she choked then buried her face in her hands damn you for making me laugh she said muffled he rose to capture her hands and make her sit beside him why shouldnt you laugh you deserve laughter and all good things she did not answer but stared across the room at the oblong silver box resting in the corner at the bright scars on the far wall you never doubted her accusations she said at last not even for the first instant i saw a lot more of him than you ever did he practically lived in my back pocket for seventeen years yes her eyes fell to her hands now twisting in her lap i suppose i never did see more than glimpses he would come to the village at vorkosigan surleau and give mistress hysop her money once a monthhed hardly ever stay more than an hour looking three meters tall in that brown and silver livery of yours id be so excited i couldnt sleep for a day before or after summers were heaven because when your mother asked me up the lake to the summer place to play with you id see him all day long her hands tightened to fists and her voice broke and it was all lies faking glory while all the time underneath was thiscesspit he made his voice more gentle than he had ever known he could i dont think he was lying elena i think he was trying to forge a new truth her teeth were clenched and feral the truth is i am a madmans rapebred bastard my mother is a murderess who hates the very shape of my shadowi cant believe ive inherited no more from them than my nose and my eyes there it was the dark fear most secret he started in recognition and dove after it like a knight pursuing a dragon underground no youre not them you are you your own persontotally separateinnocent coming from you i think thats the most hypocritical thing ive ever heard huh what are you but the culmination of your generations the flower of the vor me he stared in astonishment the culmination of degeneration maybe a stunted weed he paused her face seemed a mirror of his own astonishment they do add up its true my grandfather carried nine generations on his back my father carried ten i carry elevenand i swear that last one weighs more than all the rest put together its a wonder im not squashed even shorter i feel like im down to about half a meter right now soon ill disappear altogether he was babbling knew he was babbling some dam had broken in him he gave himself over to the flood and boiled on down the sluice elena i love you ive always loved you she leaped like a startled deer he gasped and flung his arms around her no listen i love you i dont know what the sergeant was but i loved him too and whatever of him is in you i honor with all my heart i dont know what is truth and i dont give a damn anymore well make our own like he did he did a bloody good job i think i cant live without my bothari marry me he spent the last of his air shouting the last two words and had to pause for a long inhalation i cant marry you the genetic risks i am not a mutant look no gills he stuck his fingers into the corners of his mouth and spread it wide no antlers he planted his thumbs on either side of his head and wriggled his fingers i wasnt thinking of your genetic risks mine his your father must have known what he washell never accept look anybody who can trace a blood relationship with mad emperor yuri through two lines of descent has no room to criticize anybody elses genes your father is loyal to his class miles like your grandfather like lady vorpatrilthey could never accept me as lady vorkosigan then ill present them with an alternative ill tell them im going to marry bel thorne theyll come around so fast theyll trip over themselves she sat back helplessly and buried her face in his pillow shoulders shaking he had a moment of terror that hed broken her down into tears not break down build up and up and up but damn you for making me laugh she repeated damn you he galloped on encouraged and i wouldnt be so sure about my fathers class loyalties he married a foreign plebe after all he dropped into seriousness and you cannot doubt my mother she always longed for a daughter secretlynever paraded it so as not to hurt the old man of courselet her be your mother in truth oh she said as if he had stabbed her oh youll see when we get back to barrayar i pray to god she interrupted him voice intense i may never set foot on barrayar again oh he said in turn after a long pause he said we could live somewhere else beta colony it would have to be pretty quietly once the exchange rate got done with my incomei could get a job doingdoingdoing something and on the day the emperor calls you to take your place on the council of counts to speak for your district and all the poor sods in it where will you go then he swallowed struck silent ivan vorpatril is my heir he offered at last let him take the countship ivan vorpatril is a jerk oh hes not such a bad sort he used to corner me when my father wasnt around and try to feel me up what you never said i didnt want to start a big flap she frowned into the past i almost wish i could go back in time just to boot him in the balls he glanced sideways at her considerably startled yes he said slowly youve changed i dont know what i am anymore miles you must believe mei love you as i love breath his heart rocketed but i cant be your annex and crashed i dont understand i dont know how to put it plainer youd swallow me up the way an ocean swallows a bucket of water id disappear in you i love you but im terrified of you and of your future his bafflement sought simplicity baz its baz isnt it if baz had never existed my answer would be the same but as it happensi have given him my word you the breath went out of him in a habreak it he ordered she merely looked at him silently in a moment he reddened and dropped his eyes in shame you own honor by the ocean she whispered i have only a little bucketful unfair to jostle itmy lord he fell back across his bed defeated she rose are you coming to the staff meeting why bother its hopeless she stared down at him lips thinned and glanced across to the box in the corner isnt it time you learned to walk on your own feetcripple she ducked out the door just in time to avoid the pillow he threw at her her lips curving just slightly at this spasmodic display of energy you know me too bloody well he whispered ought to keep you just for security reasons he staggered to his feet and went to shave he made it to the staff conference barely and sagged into his usual seat at the head of the table it was a full meeting held therefore in the roomy refinery conference chamber general halify and an aide sat in tung and thorne and auson arde and baz and the five men and women picked to officer the new recruits ringed the table the cetagandan ghemcaptain sat opposite the kshatryan lieutenant their growing animosity threatening to equal the threeway rivalry among tung auson and thorne the two united only long enough to snarl at the felicians the professional assassin from jacksons whole or the retired tau cetan major of commandos who in turn sniped at the exoserans making the circle complete the alleged agenda for this circus was the preparation of the final dendarii battleplan for breaking the oseran blockade hence general halifys keen interest his keenness had been rather blunted this last week by a growing dismay the doubt in halifys eyes was an itch to miles spirit he tried to avoid meeting them bargain rates general miles thought sulkily to him you get what you pay for the first half hour was spent knocking down again three unworkable pet plans that had been advanced by their owners at previous meetings bad odds requirements of personnel and material beyond their resources impossibilities of timing were pointed out with relish by one half of miless group to the other with opinions of the advancers mentalities thrown in gratis this rapidly degenerated into a classic slanging match tung who normally suppressed such was one of the principals this time so it threatened to escalate indefinitely look damn it shouted the kshatryan lieutenant banging his fist on the table for emphasis we cant take the wormhole direct and we all know it lets concentrate on something we can do merchant shippingwe could attack that a counterblockade attack neutral galactic shipping yelped auson do you want to get us all hung hanged corrected thorne earning an ungrateful glare no see auson bulled on the pelians have little bases all over this system we could have a go at like guerilla warfare attacking and fading into the sands what sands snapped tung theres nothing to hide your ass behind out therethe pelians have our home address its a miracle they havent given up all hope of capturing this refinery and flung a halfc meteor shower through here already any plan that doesnt work quickly wont work at all what about a lightning raid on the pelian capital suggested the cetagandan captain a suicide squadron to drop a nuclear in there you volunteering sneered the kshatryan that might almost be worthwhile the pelians have a transshipping station in orbit around the sixth planet said the tau cetan a raid on that would take that electron orbital randomizer and youre an idiot ambush stray ships miless intestines writhed like mating snakes he rubbed his hands wearily over his face and spoke for the first time the unexpectedness of it caught their attention momentarily ive known people who play chess like this they cant think their way to a checkmate so they spend their time trying to clear the board of the little pieces this eventually reduces the game to a simplicity they can grasp and theyre happy the perfect war is a fools mate he subsided elbows on the table face in his hands after a short silence expectation falling into disappointment the kshatryan renewed the attack on the cetagandan and they were off again their voices blurred over miles general halify began to push back from the table no one noticed miless jaw drop behind his hands or his eyes widen then narrow to glints sonofabitch he whispered its not hopeless he sat up has it occurred to anyone yet that were tackling this problem from the wrong end his words were lost in the din only elena sitting in a corner across the chamber saw his face her own face turned like a sunflower toward him her lips moved silently miles not a shameful escape in the dark but a monument thats what he would make of this war yes he pulled his grandfathers dagger from its sheath and spun it in the air it came down and stuck pointfirst in the center of the table with a ringing vibration he climbed up on the table and marched to retrieve it the silence was sudden and complete but for a mutter from auson in front of whom the dagger had landed i didnt think that plastic would scratch miles yanked the dagger out resheathed it and strode up and down the tabletop his leg brace had developed an annoying click recently which hed meant to have baz fix now it was loud in the silence locking attention like a whisper good a click a club on the head whatever worked was fine by him it was time to get their attention it appears to have escaped you gentlemen ladies and others that the dendariis appointed task is not to physically destroy the oserans but merely to eliminate them as a fighting force in local space we need not blunt ourselves attacking their strengths their upturned faces followed him like iron filings drawn to a magnet general halify sank back in his seat bazs face and ardes grew jubilant with hope i direct your attention to the weak link in the chain that binds usthe connection between the oserans and their employers the pelians there is where we must apply our leverage my children he stood gazing out past the refinery into the depths of space a seer taken by a vision were going to hit them in the payroll the underwear came first soft smoothfitting absorbent then the connections for the plumbing then the boots the piezoelectric pads carefully aligned with points of maximum impact on toes heels the ball of the foot baz had done a beautiful job adjusting the fit of the space armor the greaves went on like skin to miless uneven legs better than skin an exoskeleton his brittle bones at last rendered technologically equal to anyones miles wished baz were by him at this moment to take pride in his handiwork although arde was doing his best to help miles ooze into the apparatus even more passionately miles wished himself in bazs place felician intelligence reported all still quiet on the pelian home front baz and his handpicked party of techs starring elena visconti must have penetrated the planetside frontier successfully and be moving into place for their blow the killing blow of miless strategy the keystone of his arching ambitions his heart had nearly broken sending them off alone but reason ruled a commando raid if it could be so called delicate technical invisible would not benefit from so conspicuous and lowtech a piece of baggage as himself he was better employed here with the rest of the grunts he glanced up the length of his flagships armory the atmosphere seemed a combination of locker room docking bay and surgeryhe tried not to think about surgeries his stomach twinged a probe of pain not now he told it later be good and i promise ill take you to the medtech later the rest of his attack group were arming and armoring themselves as he was techs checked out systems to a quiet undercurrent of colored lights and small audio signals as they probed here there the quiet undercurrent of voices was serious attentive concentrated almost meditative like an ancient church before the services began it was well he caught elenas eye two soldiers down the row from himself and smiled reassuringly as if he and not she were the veteran she did not smile back he probed his strategy as the techs did their systems the oseran payroll was divided into two parts the first was an electronic transfer payment of pelian funds into an oseran account in the pelian capital out of which the oseran fleet purchased local supplies miless special plan was for that the second half was in assorted galactic currencies primarily betan dollars this was the cash profit to be divided among osers captainowners to carry out of tau verde local space to their various destinations when their contracts at last expired it was delivered monthly to osers flagship on its blockade station miles corrected his thought with a small grinhad been delivered monthly they had taken the first cash payroll in midspace with devastating ease half of miless troops were oserans after all several had even done the duty before presenting themselves to the pelian courier as the oseran pickup had required only the slightest of adjustments in codes and procedures they were done and far out of range before the real oserans arrived the transcript of the subsequent dispatches between the pelian courier and the oseran pickup ship was a treasure for miles he kept it stored atop botharis coffin in his cabin beside his grandfathers dagger more to come sergeant he thought i swear it the second operation two weeks later had been crude by comparison a slugging match between the new more heavilyarmed pelian courier and miless three warships miles had prudently stepped aside and let tung direct it confining his comments to an occasional approving ah they gave up maneuvering to board upon the approach of four oseran ships the oserans were taking no chances with this delivery the dendarii had blasted the pelian and its precious cargo into its component atoms and fled the pelians had fought bravely miles burned them a deathoffering that night in his cabin very privately arde connected miless left shoulder joint and began to run through the checklist of rotational movements of all the joints from shoulder to fingertips his ring finger was running about weak arde opened the pressure plate under his left wrist and pinned the tiny powerup control his strategy by the third attempted hijacking it was clear the enemy was learning from experience oser sent a convoy practically to the planets atmosphere for the pickup miless ships hovering out of range had been unable to even get near miles was forced to use his aceinthehole tung had raised his eyebrows when miles asked him to send a simple paper message to his former communications officer please cooperate with all dendarii requests it read signed meaninglessly to the eurasian with the vorkosigan seal concealed in the hilt of miless grandfathers dagger the communications officer had been a fountain of intelligence ever since bad to so endanger one of captain illyans operatives worse to risk their best eye in the oseran fleet if the oserans ever figured out who had microwaved the money the mans life was surely forfeit to date though the oserans held only four packing cases of ashes and a mystery miles felt a slight change in gravity and vibration they must be moving into attack formation time to get his helmet on and make contact with tung and auson in the tactics room elenas tech fitted her helmet she opened her faceplate spoke to the tech they collaborated on some minor adjustment if baz was keeping his schedule this was surely miless last chance with her with the engineer out of the way there was no one to usurp his heros role the next rescue would be his he pictured himself blasting menacing pelians right and left pulling her out of some tactical holethe details were vague she would have to believe he loved her then his tongue would magically untangle hed finally find the right words after so many wrong ones her snowy skin would warm in the heat of his ardor and bloom again her face framed by her helmet was cold austere in profile the same blank winter landscape she had exhibited to the world since botharis death her lack of reaction worried miles true she had had her dendarii duties to distract her keep her movingnot like the selfindulgent luxury of his own withdrawal at least with elena visconti gone she was spared those awkward meetings in the corridors and conference rooms both women pretending fiercely to cold professionalism elena stretched in her armor and gazed pensively into the black hole of her plasma arc muzzle built into the right arm of her suit she slipped on her glove covering the blue veins like pale rivers of ice in her wrist her eyes made miles think of razors he stepped to her shoulder and waved away her tech the words he spoke werent any of the dozens he had rehearsed for the occasion he lowered his voice to whisper i know all about suicide dont think you can fool me she started and flushed frowned at him in fierce scorn snapped her faceplate shut forgive whispered his anguished thought to her it is necessary arde lowered miless helmet over his head connected his control leads checked the connections a lacework of fire netted knotted and tangled in miless gut damn but it was getting hard to ignore he checked his comm link with the tactics room commodore tung naismith here roll the vids the inside of his faceplate blurred with color duplicate readouts of the tactics room telemetry for the field commander only communications no servo links this time the captured pelian armor had none and the old oseran armor was all safely on manual override just in case somebody else out there was learning from experience last chance to change your mind tung said over the comm link continuing the old argument sure you wouldnt rather attack the oserans after the transfer farther from the pelian bases our intelligence on them is so much more detailed no we have to capture or destroy the payroll before the delivery taking it after is strategically useless not entirely we could sure use the money and how miles reflected glumly it would soon take scientific notation to register his debt to the dendarii a mercenary fleet could hardly burn money faster if the ships ran on steam power and the funds were shoveled directly into their furnaces never had one so little owed so much to so many and it grew worse by the hour his stomach oozed around his abdominal cavity like a tortured amoeba throwing out pseudopods of pain and the vacuole of an acid belch you are a psychosomatic illusion miles assured it the assault group formed up and marched to the waiting shuttles miles moved among them trying to touch each person call them by name give them some personal word they seemed to like that he ordered their ranks in his mind and wondered how many gaps there would be when this days work was done forgive he had run out of clever solutions this one was to be done the old hard way headon they moved through the shuttle hatch corridors into the waiting shuttle this must surely be the worst part waiting helplessly for tung to deliver them like cartons of eggs as fragile as messy when broken he took a deep breath and prepared to cope with the usual effects of zerogee he was totally unprepared for the cramp that doubled him over snatched his breath away drained his face to a paperwhiteness not like this it had never come on like this before he redoubled into a ball gasping lost his grasp on his gripstrap floated tree dear god it was finally happeningthe ultimate humiliationhe was going to throw up in a space suit in moments everyone would know of his hilarious weakness absurd for a wouldbe imperial officer to get spacesick absurd absurd he had always been absurd he had barely the presence of mind to hit his ventilator controls to full power with a jerk of his chin and kill his broadcastno need to treat his mercenaries to the unedifying sound of their commander retching admiral naismith came an inquiry from the tactics room your medical readouts look oddtelemetry check requested the universe seemed to narrow to his belly a wrenching rush gagging and coughing another another the ventilator could not keep up hed eaten nothing this day where was it all coming from a mercenary pulled him out of the air tried to help him straighten his clenched limbs admiral naismith are you all right he opened miless faceplate to miless gasp of no not in here sonofabitch the man jumped back and raised his voice to a piercing cry medtech youre overreacting miles tried to say ill clean it up myself dark clots scarlet droplets shimmering crimson globules floated past his confused eyes his secret spilled it appeared to be pure blood no he whimpered or tried to not now hands grasped him passed him back to the shuttle hatch he had entered moments before gravity pressed him to the corridor deckwho the devil had upped it to threegeehands pulled his helmet off plucked at his carefullydonned carapace he felt like a lobster supper his belly wrung itself out again elenas face nearly as white as his now circled above him she knelt tore off her servo glove and gripped his hand flesh to flesh at last miles truth is what you make it commander bothari he croaked as loud as he could a ring of frightened faces huddled around him his dendarii his people for them then all for them all take over i cant her face was pale with shock terrified god miles thought i must look just like bothari spilling his guts its not that bad he tried to tell her silverblack whorls sparkled in his vision blotting out her face no not yet leigelady you can you must ill be with you he writhed gripped by some sadistic giant you are true vor not i must have been changlings back there in those replicators he gave her a deaths head grin forward momentum she rose then determination crowding out the hot terror in her face the ice that had run like water transmuted to marble right my lord she whispered and more loudly right get back there let the medtechs do their job she drove away his admirers he was flipped efficiently onto a float pallet he watched his booted feet dark and distant hillocks waver before him as he was borne aloft feet first it would have to be feet first he barely felt the prick of the first iv in his arm he heard elenas voice raised tremblingly behind him all right you clowns no more games were going to win this one for admiral naismith heroes they sprang up around him like weeds a carrier he was seemingly unable to catch the disease he spread damn it he moaned damn it damn it damn it he repeated this litany like a mantra until the medtechs second sedative injection parted him from his pain frustration and consciousness chapter seventeen he wandered in and out of reality like being lost in the imperial residence when he was a boy trying various doors some leading to treasures others to broom closets but none to familiarity once he awoke to tung sitting beside him and worried about it shouldnt the mercenary be in the tactics room tung eyed him with affectionate concern you know son if youre going to last in this business you have to learn to pace yourself we almost lost you there it sounded like a good dictum perhaps hed have it calligraphed for the wall of his bedroom another time elena how had she come to sickbay hed left her in the shuttle nothing stayed where you put it damn it he mumbled apologetically things like this never happened to vorthalia the bold she raised a thoughtful eyebrow how do you know the histories of those times were all written by minstrels and poets you try and think of a word that rhymes with bleeding ulcer he was still dutifully trying when the greyness swallowed him again once he woke alone and called over and over for sergeant bothari but the sergeant didnt come its just like the man he thought petulantly underfoot all the time and then gone on long leave just when he needed him the medtechs sedative ended that bout with consciousness not in miless favor it was an allergic reaction to the sedative the surgeon told him later his grandfather came and smothered him with a pillow and tried to hide him under the bed bothari bloodychested and the mercenary pilot officer his implant wires somehow turned inside out and waving about his head like some strange brachiated coral watched his mother came at last and shooed away the deadly ghosts like a farm wife clucking to her chickens quick she advised miles calculate the value of e to the last decimal place and the spell will be broken you can do it in your head if youre betan enough miles waited eagerly all day for his father in this parade of hallucinatory figures he had done something extremely clever although he could not quite remember what and he ached for a chance at last to impress the count but his father never came miles wept with disappointment other shadows came and went the medtech the surgeon elena and tung auson and thorne arde mayhew but they were distant figures reflected on lead glass after he had cried for a long time he slept when he woke again the little private room off the sickbay of the triumph was clear and unwavering in outline but ivan vorpatril sat beside his bed other people miles groaned get to hallucinate orgies and giant cicadas and things what do i get relatives i can see relatives when im conscious its not fair ivan turned worriedly to elena who was perched on the end of the bed i thought the surgeon said the antidote would have cleared him out by now elena rose and bent over miles in concern long white fingers across his brow miles can you hear me of course i can hear you he suddenly realized the absence of another sensation hey my stomach doesnt hurt yes the surgeon blocked off some nerves during the repair operation you should be completely healed up inside within a couple of weeks operation he attempted a surreptitious peek down the shapeless garment he seemed to be occupying looking for he knew not what his torso seemed to be as smooth or lumpy as ever no important body parts accidentally snipped offi dont see any dotted lines he didnt cut it was all shoving things down your gullet and handtractor work except for installing the biochip on your vagus nerve a bit grotesque but very ingenious how long was i out three days you were three days the payroll raidbaz he lunged convulsively upward elena pushed him back down firmly we took the payroll baz is back with his whole group everythings fine except for you almost bleeding to death nobody dies of ulcers baz back where are we anyway docked at the refinery i didnt think you could die of ulcers either but the surgeons says holes in your body with blood pouring out are the same whether theyre on the inside or the outside so i guess you can youll get a full report she pushed him back down again looking exasperated but i thought youd better see ivan privately first without all the dendarii standing around uh right he stared in bewilderment at his big cousin ivan was dressed in civilian gear barrayaranstyle trousers a betan shirt but barrayaran regulation service boots do you want to feel me to see if im real ivan asked cheerfully it wouldnt do any good you can feel hallucinations too touch them smell them hear them miles shivered ill take your word for it but ivanwhat are you doing here looking for you did father send you i dont know how can you not know well he didnt talk to me personallylook are you sure captain dimir hasnt arrived yet or got any messages to you or anything he had all the dispatches and secret orders and things who captain dimir hes my commanding officer never heard of him or from him i think he works out of captain illyans department ivan added helpfully elena thought you might have heard something that you didnt have time to mention maybe no i dont understand it sighed ivan they left beta colony a day ahead of me in an imperial fast courier they should have been here a week ago how was it you traveled separately ivan cleared his throat well there was this girl you see on beta colony she invited me homei mean miles a betan i met her right there in the shuttleport practically the first thing wearing one of those sporty little sarongs and nothing else ivans hands were beginning to wave in dreamy descriptive curves miles hastened to cut off what he knew could be a lengthy digression probably trolling for galactics some betans collect them like a barrayaran getting banners of all the provinces ivan had such a collection at home miles recalled so what happened to this captain dimir they left without me ivan looked aggrieved and i wasnt even late how did you get here lieutenant croye reported youd gone to tau verde iv so i hitched a ride with a merchant vessel bound for one of those neutral countries down there the captain dropped me off here at this refinery miless jaw dropped hitcheddropped you offdo you realize the risks ivan blinked she was very nice about it ermotherly you know elena studied the ceiling coolly disdainful that pat on the ass she gave you in the shuttle tube didnt look exactly maternal to me ivan reddened anyway i got here he brightened and ahead of old dimir maybe i wont be in as much trouble as i thought miles ran his hands through his hair ivanwould it be too much trouble to begin at the beginning assuming there is one oh yeah i guess you wouldnt know about the big flap flap ivan youre the first word weve had from home since we left beta colony the blockade you knowalthough you seem to have passed through it like so much smoke the old bird was clever ill give her that i never knew older women could the flap miles rerouted him urgently yes well the first report we had at home from beta colony was that you had been kidnapped by some fellow who was a deserter from the service oh ye gods motherwhat did father they were pretty worried i guess but your mother kept saying that bothari was with you and anyway somebody at the embassy finally thought to talk with your grandmother naismith and she didnt think youd been kidnapped at all that calmed your mother down a lot and she um sat on your fatheranyway they decided to wait for further reports thank god well the next reports were from some military agent here in tau verde local space nobody would tell me what was in themwell nobody would tell my mother i guess which make sense when you think about it but captain illyan was running in circles between vorkosigan house and general headquarters and the imperial residence and vorhartung castle twentysix hours a day for while it didnt help that all the information they got was three weeks out of date either vorhartung castle murmured miles in surprise what does the council of counts have to do with this i couldnt figure it either but count henri vorvolk was pulled out of class at the academy three times to attend secret committee sessions at the counts so i cornered himseems there was some fantastic rumor going around that you were in tau verde local space building up your own mercenary fleet nobody knew whyat least i thought it was a fantastic rumor ivan stared around at the little sickbay cubicle at the ship it implied anyway your father and captain illyan finally decided to send a fast courier to investigate via beta colony i gather ahdid you happen to run across a fellow named tav calhoun while you were there oh yeah the crazy betan he hangs around the barrayaran embassyhe has a warrant for your arrest which he waves at whoever he can catch going in or out the guards wont let him in anymore did you actually talk to him briefly i told him there was a rumor youd gone to kshatryia really of course not but it was the farthest place i could think of the clan ivan said smugly should stick together thanks miles mulled this over i think he sighed i guess the best thing to do is wait for your captain dimir then he might at least be able to give us a ride home which would solve one problem he looked up at his cousin ill explain it all later but i have to know some things nowcan you keep your mouth shut a while nobody here is supposed to know who i really am a horrid thought shook miles you havent been going around asking for me by name have you no no just miles naismith ivan assured him we knew you were traveling with your betan passport anyway i just got here last night and practically the first person i met was elena miles breathed relief and turned to elena you say baz is out there ive got to see him she nodded and withdrew walking a wide circle around ivan sorry to hear about old bothari ivan offered when shed left whod have thought he could do himself in cleaning weapons after all these years still theres a bright sideyouve finally got a chance to make time with elena without him breathing down your neck so its not a dead loss miles exhaled carefully faint with rage and reminded grief he does not know he told himself he cannot know ivan one of these days somebody is going to pull out a weapon and plug you and youre going to die in bewilderment crying what did i say what did i say what did i say asked ivan indignantly before miles could go into detail baz entered flanked by tung and auson elena trailing the chamber was jammed they all seemed to be grinning like loons baz waved some plastic flimsies triumphantly in the air he was lit like a beacon with pride scarcely recognizable as the man miles had found five months ago cowering in a garbage heap the surgeon says we cant stay long my lord he said to miles but i thought these might do for a getwell wish ivan started slightly at the honorific and stared covertly at the engineer miles took the sheets of printing your missionwere you able to complete it like clockworkwell not exactly there were some bad moments in a train stationyou should see the rail system they have on tau verde iv the engineeringmagnificent barrayar missed something by going from horseback straight to air transport the mission baz the engineer beamed take a look those are the transcripts of the latest dispatches between admiral oser and the pelian high command miles began to read after a time he began to smile yes id understood admiral oser had a remarkable command of invective when er roused miless gaze crossed tungs blandly tungs eyes glinted with satisfaction ivan craned his neck what are they elena told me about your payroll heistsi take it you managed to mess up their electronic transfer too but i dont understandwont the pelians just repay when they find the oseran fleet wasnt credited miless grin became quite wolfish ah but they were creditedeight times over and now as i believe a certain earth general once said god has delivered them into my hand after failing four times in a row to deliver their cash payment the pelians have demanded the electronic overpayment be returned and oser miles glanced at the flimsies is refusing emphatically that was the trickiest part calculating just the right amount of overpayment too little and the pelians might have just let it go too much and even oser would have felt bound to return it but just the right amount he sighed and cuddled back happily into his pillow he would have to commit some or osers choicest phrases to memory he decided they were unique youll like this then admiral naismith auson bursting with news erupted at last four of osers independent captainowners took their ships and jumped out of tau verde local space in the last two days from the transmissions we intercepted i dont think theyll be coming back either glorious breathed miles oh well done he looked to elena pride there too strong enough even to nudge out some of the pain in her eyes as i thoughtintercepting that fourth payroll was vital to the success of the strategy well done commander bothari she glowed back at him hesitantly we missed you wetook lot of casualties i anticipated we would the pelians had to be laying for us by then he glanced at tung who was making a small shushing gesture at elena was it much worse than wed calculated tung shook his head there were moments when i was ready to swear she didnt know she was beaten there are certain situations into which you do not ask mercenaries to follow you i didnt ask anyone to follow me said elena they came on their own she added in a whispered aside to miles i just thought that was what boarding battles were like i didnt know it wasnt supposed to be that bad tung spoke to miless alarmed look we would have paid a higher price if she hadnt insisted youd put her in charge and refused to withdraw when i ordered then we would have paid much for nothingthat ratio works out to infinity i believe tung gave elena a nod of judicious approval which she returned gravely ivan looked rather stunned a lowvoiced argument penetrated from the corridor thorne and the surgeon thorne was saying youve got to this is vital thorne towed the protesting surgeon into the cubicle admiral naismith commodore tung osers here what with his whole fleetwhats left of ittheyre just out of range hes asking permission to dock his flagship that cant be said tung whos guarding the wormhole yes exactly cried thorne who they stared at each other in elated wild surmise miles sprang to his feet fought off a wave of dizziness clutched his gown behind him get my clothes he enunciated hawklike miles decided was the word for admiral oser greying hair a beak of a nose a bright penetrating stare fixed now on miles he had mastered the look that makes junior officers search their consciences miles thought he stood up under it and gave the real mercenary admiral a slow smile there in the docking bay the sharp cold recycled air was bitter in his nostrils like a stimulant you could get high on it surely oser was flanked by three of his captainemployees and two of his captainowners and their seconds miles trailed the whole dendarii staff elena on his right hand baz on his left oser looked him up and down damn he murmured damn he did not offer his hand but stood and spoke deliberate rehearsed cadences since the day you entered tau verde local space ive felt your presence in the felicians in the tactical situation turning under me in the faces of my own men his glance passed over tung who smiled sweetly even in the pelians we have been grappling in the dark we two at a distance long enough miless eyes widened my god is oser about to challenge me to single combat sergeant bothari help he jerked his chin up and said nothing i dont believe in prolonging agonies said oser rather than watch you enspell the rest of my fleet man by manwhile i still possess a fleet to offeri understand the dendarii mercenaries are looking for recruits it took miles a moment to realize he had just heard one of the most stiffnecked surrender speeches in history gracious we are going to be gracious as hell oh yes he held out his hand oser took it admiral oser your understanding is acute theres a private chamber where we can work out the details general halify and some felician officers were watching at a distance from a balcony overlooking the docking bay miless glance crossed halifys and so my word to you at least is redeemed miles marched across the broad expanse the whole herd all dendarii now strung out behind him lets see miles thought the pied piper of hamlin led all the rats into the riverhe looked backand all the children he led to a mountain of gold what would he have done if the rats and the children had been inextricably mixed chapter eighteen miles reclined on a liquidfilled settee in the refinerys darkside observation chamber hands behind his head and stared into the depths of a space no longer empty the dendarii fleet glittered and winked riding at station in the vacuum a constellation of ships and men in his bedroom at the summer place at vorkosigan surleau he had owned a mobile of space warships classic barrayaran military craft held in their carefully balanced arrangement by nearly invisible threads of great tensile strength invisible threads he pursed his lips and blew a puff of breath toward the crystalline windows as if he might set the dendarii ships circling and dancing nineteen ships of war and over troops and techs mine he said experimentally all mine the phrase did not produce a suitable feeling of triumph he felt more like a target in the first place it was not true the actual ownership of those millions of betan dollars worth of capital equipment out there was a matter of amazing complexity it had taken four solid days of negotiations to work out the details he had so casually waved his hand over in the docking bay there were eight independent captainowners in addition to osers personal possession of eight ships almost all had creditors at least ten percent of his fleet turned out to be owned by the first bank of jacksons whole famous for its numbered accounts and discreet services for all miles knew he was now contributing to the support of gambling rackets industrial espionage and the white slave trade from one end of the wormhole nexus to the other it seemed he was not so much the possessor of the dendarii mercenaries as he was their chief employee the ownership of the ariel and the triumph was made particularly complex by miless capture of them in battle tung had owned his ship outright but auson had been deeply in debt to yet another jacksons whole lending institution for the ariel oser when still working for the pelians had stopped payments after its capture and left the what was it calledluigi bharaputra and sons household finance and holding company of jacksons whole private limitedto collect on its insurance if any captain auson had turned pale upon learning that an inquiry agent from said company would be arriving soon to investigate the inventory alone was enough to boggle miless mind and when it came to the assorted personnel contractshis stomach would hurt if it still could before oser had arrived the dendarii had been due for a tidy profit from the felician contract now the profit for must be spread to support or more than the dendarii kept ballooning another free ship had arrived through the wormhole just yesterday having heard of them through godknewwhat rumor mill and excited wouldbe recruits from felice managed to turn up with each new ship from the planet the metals refinery was operating as a refinery again as control of local space fell into the hands of the felicians their forces were even now gobbling up pelian installations all over the system there was talk of rehiring to felice to blockade the wormhole in turn for the former underdogs the phrase quit while youre winning popped unbidden into miless mind whenever this subject came up the proposal secretly appalled him he itched to be gone from here before the whole house of cards collapsed he should be keeping reality and fantasy separate in his own mind at least even while mixing them as much as possible in others voices whispered from the catwalk reflected to his ear by some accident of acoustics elenas alto captured his attention you dont have to ask him were not on barrayar were never going back to barrayar but it will be like having a little piece of barrayar to take with us bazs voice gentle and amused as miles had never heard it followed a breath of home in airless places god knows i cant give you much of that right and proper your father wanted for you but all the pittance i can command shall be yours mm her response was unenthusiastic almost hostile all references to bothari seemed to fall on her like hammer blows to dead flesh these days a muffled thud that sickened miles but brought no response from elena herself they emerged from the catwalk baz close behind her he smiled at his leigelord in shy triumph elena smiled too but not with her eyes deep meditation she inquired lightly it looks more like staring out the window and biting your nails to me he struggled upright causing the settee to slither under him and responded in kind oh i just told the guard that to keep the tourists out i actually came up here for a nap baz grinned at miles my lord i understand in the absence of other relations that elenas legal guardianship has fallen to you whyso it has i havent had much time to think about it to tell you the truth miles stirred uneasily at this turn in the conversation not quite sure just what was coming right then as her leigelord and guardian i formally request her hand in marriage not to mention the rest of her his silly smile made miles long to kick him in the teeth oh and as my leigecommander i request your permission to marry uh that my sons may serve you lord bazs abbreviated version of the formula was only slightly scrambled youre not going to have any sons because im going to chop your balls off you lambstealing doublecrossing traitoroushe got control of himself before his emotion showed as more than a drawn lipless grin i see therethere are some difficulties he marshalled logical argument like a shieldwall protecting his craven naked rage from the sting of those two honest pairs of brown eyes elena is quite young of course he abandoned that line at the ire that lit her eye as her lips formed the soundless word you more to the point i gave my own word to sergeant bothari to perform three services for him in the event of his death to bury him on barrayar to see elena betrothed with all correct ceremony and ahto see her married to a suitable officer of the barrayaran imperial service would you see me forsworn baz looked as stunned as if miles had kicked him his mouth opened closed opened again butarent i your liegesworn armsman thats certainly the equal of an imperial officerhell the sergeant was an armsman himself hashas my service been unsatisfactory tell me how i have failed you my lord that i may correct it his astonishment turned to genuine distress you havent failed me miless conscience jerked the words from his mouth uh but of course youve only served me for four months now really a very short time although i know it seems much longer so much has happened miles floundered feeling more than crippled legless elenas furious glower had chopped him off at the knees how much shorter could he afford to get in her eyes he trailed off weakly this is all very sudden elenas voice dropped to a gravelled register of rage how dare you her voice burst in her indrawn breath like a wave formed again what do you owewhat can anybody owe that she asked referring miles realized to the sergeant i was not his chattel and i am not yours either dog in the manger bazs hand closed anxiously on her arm stemming the breakers crashing across miles elenamaybe this isnt the best time to bring it up maybe later would be better he glanced at miless stony face and winced confusion in his eyes baz youre not going to take this seriously come away well talk about it she forced her voice back to its normal timbre ill meet you at the bottom of the catwalk in a minute miles nodded a dismissal to baz for emphasis well the engineer left walking slowly and looking back over his shoulder in worry they waited by unspoken agreement until the soft sound of his steps had gone when she turned the anger in her eyes had been displaced by pleading dont you see miles this is my chance to walk away from it all start new fresh and clean somewhere else as far away as possible he shook his head hed have fallen to his knees if hed thought it would do any good how can i give you up youre the mountains and the lake the memoriesyou have them all when youre with me im at home wherever i am if barrayar was my right arm id take a plasma arc and burn it off your father and mother knew what he was all the time and yet they sheltered him what are they then the sergeant was doing all rightdoing well even until you were to be his expiation dont you see it what a sacrifice for his sins am i to form myself into the pattern of a perfect barrayaran maiden like trying to work a magic spell for absolution i could spend my whole life working out that ritual and not come to the end of it damn it not the sacrifice he tried to tell her the altar perhaps bah she began to pace leopardess on a short chain her emotional wounds seemed to work themselves open and bleed before his eyes he ached to staunch them dont you see he launched himself again passionate with conviction youd do better with me acting or reacting we carry him in us you cant walk away from him any more than i can whether you travel toward or away hell be the compass hell be the glass full of subtle colors and astigmatisms through which all new things will be viewed i too have a father who haunts me and i know she was shaken and shaking you make me she stated feel quite ill as she stalked away ivan vorpatril emerged from the catwalk ah there you are miles ivan circled warily around elena as they passed his hands moving in an unconscious protective gesture toward his crotch one corner of elenas mouth turned venomously upward and she tilted her head in a polite nod he acknowledged the greeting with a fixed and nervous smile so much thought miles sadly for his chivalrous plans to protect elena from ivans unwanted attentions ivan settled himself beside miles with a sigh have you heard anything from captain dimir yet not a thing are you sure they were coming to tau verde and not suddenly ordered somewhere else i dont see how a fast courier could be two weeks late oh god said ivan do you think thats possible im going to be in so much trouble i dont know miles tried to assuage his alarm your original orders were to find me and so far youre the only one who seems to have succeeded in carrying them out mention that when you ask father to get you off the hook ha muttered his cousin whats the use of living with a system of inherited power if you cant have a little nepotism now and then miles your father doesnt do favors for anybody he gazed out at the dendarii fleet and added elliptically thats impressive yknow miles was insensibly cheered do you really think so he added facetiously do you want to join it seems to be the hot new fashion around here ivan chuckled no thanks i have no desire to diet for the emperor vorloupulouss law yknow miless smile died on his lips ivans chuckle drained away like something going down the sink they stared at each other in stunned silence oh shit said miles at last i forgot about vorloupulouss law it never even crossed my mind surely nobody could interpret this as raising a private army ivan reassured him feebly not proper livery and maintenance i mean theyre not liegesworn to you or anythingare they only baz and arde said miles i dont know how barrayaran law would interpret a mercenary contract theyre not for life after allunless you happen to be killed who is that baz fellow anyway asked ivan he seems to be your righthand man i couldnt have done this without him he was an imperial service engineer before he miles choked himself off quit miles tried to guess what the laws might be about harboring deserters he hadnt after all originally intended to be caught doing so upon reflection his nebulous plan for returning home with baz and begging his father to arrange some sort of pardon began to feel more and more like a man falling from an aircraft making plans to land on that soft fluffy cloud rushing up below him what looked solid at a distance might well turn to fog at closer range miles glanced at ivan then he gazed at ivan then he stared at ivan ivan blinked back in innocent inquiry there was something about that cheerful frank face that made miles hideously uneasy you know miles said at last the more i think about your being here the weirder it seems dont you believe it said ivan i had to work for my passage that old bird was the most insatiable i dont mean your getting herei mean your being sent in the first place since when do they pull firstyear cadets out of class and send them on security missions i dont know i assumed they wanted somebody who could identify the body or something yes but theyve got almost enough medical data on me to build a new one that idea only makes sense if you dont think about it too hard look when a general staff admiral calls a cadet in the middle of the night and says go you go you dont stop to debate with him he wouldnt appreciate it wellwhat did your recorded orders say come to think or it i never saw my recorded orders i assumed admiral hessman must have given them to captain dimir personally miles decided his uneasiness stemmed from the number of times the phrase i assumed was turning up in this conversation there was something elsehe almost had it hessman hessman gave you your orders in person ivan said proudly hessman doesnt have anything to do with either intelligence or security hes in charge of procurement ivan this is getting screwier and screwier an admiral is an admiral this admiral is on my fathers shit list though for one thing hes count vordrozdas pipeline to imperial service headquarters and father hates his officers getting involved in party politics father also suspects him of peculating service funds some kind of sleightofhand in shipbuilding contracts at the time i left home he was itchy enough to put captain illyan on it personally and you know he wouldnt waste illyans talents on anything minor all thats way over my head ive got enough problems with navigational math it shouldnt be over your head oh as a cadet surebut youre also lord vorpatril if anything happened to me youd inherit the countship of our district from my father god forbid said ivan i want to be an officer and travel around and pick up girls not chase around through those mountains trying to collect taxes from homicidal illiterates and keep chickenstealing cases from turning into minor guerilla wars no insult intended but your district is the most intractable on barrayar miles there are people back behind dendarii gorge who live in caves ivan shuddered and they like it there are some great caves back there miles agreed gorgeous colors when you get the right light on the rock formations homesick remembrance twinged through him well if i ever inherit a countship im praying it will be of a city ivan concluded youre not in line for any i can think of grinned miles he tried to recapture the thread of their conversation but ivans remarks made lines of inheritance map themselves in his head he traced his own descent through his grandmother vorkosigan to prince xav to emperor dorca vorbarra himself had the great emperor ever foreseen what a turn his law that finally broke the private armies and the private wars of the counts forever would give his greatgreatgrandson whos your heir ivan miles asked idly staring out at the dendarii ships but dreaming of the dendarii mountains lord vortaine isnt it yeah but i expect to outlive the old boy any minute his health wasnt too good last i heard too bad this inheritance thing doesnt work backwards id be in for a bundle who does get his bundle his daughter i guess his titles go tolet me thinkcount vordrozda who doesnt even need em from what ive heard of vordrozda hed rather have the money dont know if hed go as far as marrying the daughter to get it though shes about fifty years old they both gazed into space god said ivan after a while i hope those orders dimir got when i ducked out werent to go home or something theyll think ive been awol for three weeksthere wont be enough room on my record for all the demerits thank god theyve eliminated the oldstyle discipline parades you were there when dimir got his orders and you didnt stick around to see what they were asked miles astonished it was like pulling teeth to get that pass out of him i didnt want to risk it there was this girl you seei wish now id taken my beeper you left your comm link there was this girli really did almost really forget it but he was opening the stuff by then and i didnt want to go back in and get nabbed miles shook his head hopelessly can you remember anything unusual about the orders anything out of the ordinary oh sure it was the damndest packet in the first place it was delivered by an imperial household courier in full livery lessee four data discs one green for intelligence two red for security one blue for operations and the parchment of course ivan had the family memory at least what would it be like to have a mind that retained nearly everything but never bothered to put it any kind of order exactly like living in ivans room miles decided parchment he said parchment yeah i thought that was kind of unusual do you have any idea how bloody he surged up sat back down squeezed his temples with the heels of his hands in an effort to get his brain into motion not only was ivan an idiot but he generated a telepathic damping field that turned people nearby into idiots too he would point this out to barrayaran intelligence who would make of his cousin the newest weapon in their arsenalif anyone could be found who could remember what they were doing once they closed on him ivan there are only three kinds of thing written on parchment any more imperial edicts the originals of the official edicts from the council of counts and from the council of ministers and certain orders from the council of counts to their own members i know that as my fathers heir i am a cadet member of that council you have my sympathy said ivan his gaze wandering back to the window which of those ships out there is the fastest dyou think the illyrican cruiser or the ivan im psychic miles announced suddenly im so psychic i can tell what color the ribbon was on that parchment without even seeing it i know what color it was said ivan irritably it was black miles cut across him black you idiot and you never thought to mention it look i have to take that stuff from my mother and your father i dont have to take it from you too ivan paused how did you know i know the color because i know the contents miles rose to pace uncontrollably back and forth you know them too or you would if you ever stopped to think ive got a joke for you whats white taken from the back of a sheep tied up with black bows shipped thousands of light years and lost if thats your idea of a joke youre weirder than death miless voice fell to a whisper making ivan jump treason civil war betrayal sabotage almost certainly murder evil you havent had any more of that sedative youre allergic to have you asked ivan anxiously miless pacing was becoming frenetic the urge to pick ivan up and shake him in the hope that all that information floating randomly around inside his head would start to polymerize into some chain of reason was almost overwhelming if dimirs courier ships necklin rods were sabotaged during the stopover at beta colony it would be weeks before the ship was missed for all the barrayaran embassy would know it left on its mission made the jumpno way for beta colony to know if it came out the other side or not what a thorough way to get rid of the evidence miles imagined the dismay and terror of the men aboard as the jump began to go wrong as their bodies began to run and smear like watercolors in the rainhe forced his mind back to abstract reason i dont understand where dyou think dimir is asked ivan dead quite thoroughly dead you were meant to be quite thoroughly dead too but you missed the boat a high wheezing laugh escaped miles he took hold of himself literally wrapping his arms around his torso i guess they figured if they were going to all that trouble to get rid of that parchment theyd throw you in at the same time theres a certain economy in the plotyou might expect it from a mind that ended up in procurement back up demanded ivan what do you figure the parchment was anywayand who the devil are they youre beginning to sound as paranoid as old bothari the black ribbon it had to have been a capital charge an imperial order for my arrest on a capital charge laid in the council of counts the charge you said it yourself violation of vorloupulouss law treason ivan now ask yourselfwho would benefit by my conviction for treason nobody said ivan promptly all right miles rolled his eyes upward try it this way who would suffer by my conviction for treason oh it would destroy your father of course i mean his office overlooks the great square he could stand at his window and watch you starve to death every working day an embarrassed laugh escaped ivan it would have to about drive him crazy miles paced take his heir by execution or exile break his morale bring him down and his centrist coalition with himorforce him to make the false charges real attempting my rescue then bring him down for treason as well what a demonic fork his intellect admired the plots abstract perfection even while rage at its cruelty nearly took his breath away ivan shook his head how could anything like that get this far and not be quashed by your father i mean he may be famous for impartiality but there are limits even for him you saw the parchment if gregor himself had been worked over into a state of suspicion miles spoke slowly a trial clears as well as convicts if i showed up voluntarily it would go a long way toward proving i had no treasonable intent that cuts both ways of courseif i dont show its a strong presumption of guilt but i could hardly show up if i werent informed it was taking place could i the council of counts is such a cantankerous body of old relics argued ivan your plotters would be taking an awful chance they could swing the vote their way nobody would want to get caught voting for the losing side in something like that either way thered be blood drawn at the end maybe they were forced maybe my father and illyan finally moved in on hessman and he figured the best defense would be a counterattack so whats in it for vordrozda why doesnt he just throw hessman to the wolves ah said miles there im i really wonder if i havent gone a little paro butfollow this chain count vordrozda lord vortaine you me my fatherwho is my father heir to your grandfather hes dead remember miles you cant convince me that count vordrozda would knock off five people to inherit the dendarii province hes the count of lorimel for gods sakes hes a rich man dendarii would drain his purse not fill it not my grandfather were talking about another title altogether ivan there is a large faction of historicallyminded people on barrayar who claim defensibly that the salic bar to imperial inheritance has no foundation in barrayaran law or custom dorca himself inherited through his mother after all yes and your father would like to ship every one of that faction off to er summer camp who is gregors heir right now nobody which is why everybody is on his back to marry and start swiving if salic descent were allowed who would be his heir ivan refused to be stampeded your father everybody knows that everybody also knows he wouldnt touch the imperium with a stick so what this is pretty wild miles can you think of another theory that will account or the facts sure said ivan happily continuing the role of devils advocate easy maybe that parchment was addressed to someone else damir took it to him which is why he hasnt shown up here have you ever heard of occams razor miles it sounds simpler until you start to think about it ivan listen think back on the exact circumstances of your midnight departure from the imperial academy and that dawn liftoff who signed you out who saw you go who do you know for certain who knows where you are right now why didnt my father give you any personal messages for meor my mother or captain illyan either for that matter his voice became insistent if admiral hessman took you off to some quiet isolated place right now and offered you a glass of wine with his own hands would you drink it ivan was silent for a long thoughtful time staring out at the dendarii free mercenary fleet when he turned back to miles his face was painfully somber no chapter nineteen he tracked them down finally in the crews mess of the triumph now parked in docking bay it was an offhour for meals and the mess was nearly empty but for a few diehard caffeine addicts swilling an assortment of brews they sat dark heads close opposite each other bazs hand lay open palmup on the small table as he leaned forward elenas shoulders were hunched her hands shredding a napkin in her lap neither looked happy miles took a deep breath carefully adjusted his own expression to one of benevolent good cheer and sauntered up to them he no longer bled inside the surgeon had assured him couldnt prove it now hi they both started elena still hunched shot him a look of resentment baz answered with a hesitant dismayed my lord that made miles feel very small indeed he suppressed an urge to turn tail and slither out under the door ive been thinking over what you said miles began leaning against an adjoining table in a pose of nonchalance your arguments made a lot of sense when i came to really examine them ive changed my opinion for what its worth youre welcome to my blessing bazs face lit with honest delight elenas posture opened like a daylily in sudden noon and as suddenly closed again the winged brows drew down in puzzlement she looked at him directly he felt for the first time in weeks really he supplied her with a chipper grin really and we shall satisfy all the forms of etiquette as well all it takes is a little ingenuity he pulled a colored scarf from his pocket secreted there for the occasion and walked around to bazs side of the table well start over on the right foot this time picture if you will this banal plastic table bolted to the floor before you as a starlit balcony with a pierced lattice window crawling with those little flowers with the long sharp thorns that make you itch like fire behind which is rightly and properly concealed your hearts desire got that nowarmsman jesek speaking as your leige lord i understand you have a request miless pantomime gestures cued the engineer baz leaned back with a grin and picked up his lead my lord i ask your permission and aid to wed the first daughter of armsman konstantine bothari that my sons may serve you miles cocked his head and smirked ah good weve all been watching the same vid dramas i see yes certainly armsman may they all serve me as well as you do i shall send the baba he flipped the scarf into a triangle and tied it around his head leaning on an imaginary cane he hobbled arthritically over to elenas side of the table muttering in a cracked falsetto once there he removed the scarf and reverted to the role of elenas liege lord and guardian and grilled the baba as to the suitability of the suitor she represented the baba was sent bobbing back twice to bazs leige commander to personally check and guarantee his a continued employment prospects and b personal hygiene and absence of headlice muttering obscene little old lady imprecations the baba returned at last to elenas side of the table to conclude her transaction baz by this time was cackling with laughter at assorted barrayaran injokes and elenas smile had at last reached her eyes when his clowning was over and the last somewhat scrambled formula was completed miles hooked a third chair into its floor bolts and fell into it whew no wonder the custom is dying out thats exhausting elena grinned ive always had the impression you were trying to be three people perhaps youve found your calling what oneman shows ive had enough of them lately to last a lifetime miles sighed and grew serious you may consider yourselves well and officially betrothed at any rate when do you plan to register your marriage soon said baz and im not sure said elena may i suggest tonight whywhy stammered baz his eyes sought his ladys elena could we i she searched miless face why my lord because i want to dance at your wedding and fill your bed with buckwheat groats if i can find any on this benighted space station you may have to settle for gravel theyve got plenty of that im leaving tomorrow three words should not be so hard to grasp as all that what cried baz why repeated elena in a shocked whisper i have some obligations to pursue miles shrugged theres tav calhoun to pay off andand the sergeants burial and very possibly my own you dont have to go in person do you protested elena cant you send calhoun a draft and ship the body why go back what is there for you the dendarii mercenaries said baz how can they function without you i expect them to function quite well because i am appointing you baz as their commander and you elena as his executive officerand apprentice commodore tung will be your chief of staff you understand that baz im going to charge you and tung jointly with her training and i expect it to be the best ii gasped the engineer my lord the honori couldnt youll find that you can because you must and besides a lady should have a dowry worthy of her thats what a dowry is for after all to provide for the brides support bad form for the bridegroom to squander it note and youll still be working for me after all baz looked relieved ohyoull be coming back then i thoughtnever mind when will you return my lord ill catch up with you sometime miles said vaguely sometime never thats the other thing i want you to clear out of tau verde local space pick any direction away from barrayar and go find employment when you get there but go soon the dendarii mercenaries have had enough of this tweedledumandtweedledee war its bad for morale when it gets too hard to remember which side youre working for this week your next contract should have clearly defined objectives that will weld this motley bunch into a single force under your command no more committee warfare its weaknesses have been amply demonstrated i trust miles went on with instructions and advice until he began to sound like a pintsized polonius in his own ears there was no way he could anticipate every contingency when the time came to leap in faith whether you had your eyes open or closed or screamed all the way down or not made no practical difference his heart cringed from his next interview even more than from the last but he forced his feet to carry him to it anyway he found the comm link technician at work at the electron microscope bench of the triumphs engineering repairs section elena visconti frowned at his gesture of invitation but turned the work over to her assistant and came slowly to miless side sir trainee visconti maam can we take a walk what for just to talk if its what i think you may as well save your breath i cant go to her im not any more comfortable talking about it than you are but its an obligation i cannot honorably evade ive spent eighteen years trying to put what happened at escobar behind me must i be dragged through it again this is the last time i promise im leaving tomorrow the dendarii fleet will follow soon after all you shortcontract people will be dropped off at dalton station where you can take ship for tau ceti or wherever you want i suppose youll be going home she fell in reluctantly beside him and they paced down the corridor yes my employers will doubtless be astonished at how much back pay they owe me i owe you something myself baz says you were outstanding on the mission she shrugged straightforward stuff he didnt mean just your technical efforts anyway i didnt want to leave elenamy elenaup in the air like this you see he began she ought to at least have something to replace what was taken from her some little crumb of comfort the only thing she lost was some illusion and believe me admiral naismith or whatever you are the only thing i could give her would be another illusion maybe if she didnt look so much like him anyway i dont want her following me around or showing up at my door whatever sergeant bothari was guilty of she is surely innocent elena visconti rubbed her forehead wearily with the back of her hand im not saying youre not right im just saying i cant for me she radiates nightmares miles chewed his lip gently they turned out of the triumph into a flex tube and walked across the quiet docking bay only a few techs were busy at some small tasks an illusion he mused you could live a long time on an illusion he offered maybe even a lifetime if youre lucky would it be so difficult to do a few dayseven a few minutesof acting im going to have to dip some dendarii funds anyway to pay for a dead ship and buy a lady a new face i could make it worth your time he regretted his words immediately at the loathing that flashed across her face but the look she finally gave him was ironically thoughtful you really care about that girl dont you yes i thought she was making time with your chief engineer suits me pardon my slowness but that does not compute association with me could be lethal where im going next id rather she were travelling in the opposite direction the next docking bay was busy and noisy with a felician freighter being loaded with ingots of refined rare metals vital to the felician war industries they avoided it and searched out another quiet corridor miles found himself fingering the bright scarf in his pocket he dreamed of you for eighteen years too you know he said suddenly it wasnt what he meant to say he had this fantasy you were his wife in all honor he held it so hard i think it was real to him at least part of the time thats how he made it so real for elena you can touch hallucinations hallucinations can even touch you the escobaran woman pale paused to lean against the wall and swallow miles pulled the scarf from his pocket and crumpled it anxiously in his hands he had an absurd impulse to offer it to her heaven knew what fora basin im sorry elena said at last but the very thought that he was pawing over me in his twisted imagination all these years makes me ill he was never an easy person miles began inanely then cut himself off he paced frustrated two steps turn two steps he then took a gulp of air and flung himself to one knee before the escobaran woman maam konstantine bothari sends me to beg your forgiveness for the wrongs he did you keep your revenge if you willit is your just rightbut be satisfied he implored her at least give me a deathoffering to burn for him some token i give him aid in this as his gobetween by my right as his leige lord his friend and as he was a fathers hand held over me in protection all my life as his son elena visconti was backed up against the wall as though cornered miles still on one knee shuffled back a step and shrank into himself as if to crush all hint of pride and coercion to the deck damned if im not starting to think youre as weirdyoure no betan she muttered oh do get up what if somebody comes down this corridor not until you give me a deathoffering he said firmly what do you want from me whats a deathoffering something of yourself that you burn for the peace of the soul of the dead sometimes you burn it for friends or relatives sometimes for the souls of slain enemies so they dont come back to haunt you a lock of hair would do he ran his hand over a short gap in his own crown that wedge represents twentytwo dead pelians last month some local superstition is it he shrugged helplessly superstition customive always thought of myself as an agnostic its only lately that ive come toto need for men to have souls please i wont bother you any more she blew out her breath in troubled exasperation wellwell give me that knife in your belt then but get up he rose and handed her his grandfathers dagger she sawed off a short curl is that enough yes thats fine he took it in his palm cool and silken like water and closed his fingers over it thank you she shook her head crazy wistfulness stole over her face it allays ghosts does it it is said replied miles gently ill make it a proper offering my word on it he inhaled shakily and as i have given you my word ill bother you no more excuse me maam we both have other duties sir they passed through the flex tube to the triumph turned each away but the escobaran woman looked back over her shoulder you are mistaken little man she called softly i believe youre going to bother me for a long time yet next he searched out arde mayhew im afraid i never was able to do you the good i intended miles apologized i have managed to find a felician shipmaster who will buy the rg for an innersystem freighter hes offering about a dime on the dollar but its cash up front i thought we could split it at least its an honorable retirement sighed mayhew better than having calhoun tear it to pieces im leaving for home tomorrow via beta colony i could drop you off if you want mayhew shrugged theres nothing on beta for me he looked up more sharply what happened to all this leigeman stuff i thought i was working for you idont really think youd fit in on barrayar said miles carefully the pilot officer must not follow him home betan or no the deadly bog of barrayaran politics could suck him down without a bubble in the vortex of his leige lords fall but you could certainly have a place with the dendarii mercenaries what rank would you like im no soldier you could retrain something on the tech side and theyll certainly need backup pilots for sublight and the shuttles mayhews forehead wrinkled i dont know driving a shuttle and so on was always the scut work something you did so you could jump i dont know that i want to be so close to ships it would be like standing outside the bakery hungry with no credit card to go in and buy he looked greyly depressed theres one more possibility mayhews brows lifted in polite inquiry the dendarii mercenaries are going to be outward bound looking for work on the fringes of the wormhole nexus the rg ships were never all accounted forits possible one or two might still be junked out there somewhere the felician shipmaster would be willing to lease the rg although for a lot less money if you could find and salvage a pair of rg necklin rods mayhews back straightened from a slump that had looked to be permanent i dont have time to go hunting all over the galaxy for spare parts miles went on but if youd agree to be my agent ill authorize baz to release dendarii funds to buy them if you find any and a ship to bring them back here a quest as it were just like vorthalia the bold and the search for emperor xian vorbarras lost scepter of course in the legend vorthalia never actually found the scepter yeah mayhews face was brightening with hope its a long shotbut i guess it is just barely possible thats the spirit forward momentum mayhew snorted your forward momentum is going to lead all your followers over a cliff someday he paused beginning to grin on the way down youll convince em all they can fly he stuck his fists in his armpits and waggled his elbows lead on my lord im flapping as hard as i can the docking bay its every second light bar extinguished provided an illusion of night in the unmarked changeless time of space those lights that remained on threw a dull illumination like shimmering puddles of mercury that gave vision without color the sounds of the loading small thumps and clanks carried in the silence and voices muted themselves the felician fast courier pilot grimaced as botharis coffin was carried past him and vanished into the flex tube when weve stripped baggage down to practically a change of underwear each it seems deuced gaudy to bring that every parade needs a float remarked miles absently indifferent to the pilots opinion the pilot like his ship was merely a courtesy loan from general halify the general had been reluctant to authorize the expenditure but miles had hinted that if his emergency run to beta colony failed to bring him to a certain mysterious appointment on time the dendarii mercenaries just might be forced to look for their next contract from the highest bidder here in tau verde local space halify had reflected only briefly before making all haste to speed him on his way miles shifted from foot to foot anxious to be gone before the bright activities marking daycycle began ivan vorpatril appeared carefully clutching a valise whose mass was most certainly not wasted on clothes stripes on the docking bay deck placed to aid organization in loading and unloading complex cargoes made pale parallels ivan blinked and walked down one line toward them with dignified precision only slightly spoiled by a list that precessed like an equinox he hove to by miles what a wedding party he sighed happily for an impromptu out in the middle of nowhere your dendarii came up with quite a spread captain auson is a splendid fellow miles smiled bleakly i thought you two would get along well you kind of disappeared about halfway through we had to start the drinking without you i wanted to join you said miles truthfully but i had a lot of lastminute things to work out with commodore tung too bad ivan smothered a belch gazed across the docking bay and muttered now i can see your wanting to bring a woman along two weeks in a box and all that but did you have to pick one that gives me nightmares miles followed his gaze elli quinn escorted by tungs surgeon was making her slow blind way toward them her crisp greyandwhites outlined the body of an athletic young woman but above the collar she was a bad dream of an alien race the hairless uniformity of the bland pink bulb of a head was broken by the black hole of a mouth two dark slits above it for a nose and a dot on either side marking the entrances to the ear canals only the right one still vented sound into her darkness ivan stirred uneasily and looked away tungs surgeon took miles aside for last minute instructions for her care during the journey and some acerbic advice on miless treatment of his own stillhealing stomach miles patted his hip flask now filled with medication and faithfully swore to drink ccs every two hours he placed the injured mercenarys hand on his arm and stood on tiptoe to her ear were all set then next stop beta colony her other hand patted the air then found his face for a brief touch her damaged tongue tried to form words in her stiff mouth on the second try miles correctly interpreted them as thank you admiral naismith had he been any tireder he might have wept all right miles began lets get out of here before the bon voyage committee wakes up and delays us another two hours but he was too late out of the corner of his eye he saw a willowy form sprinting across the docking bay baz followed at a saner pace elena arrived out of breath miles she accused you were going to leave without saying goodbye he sighed and twitched a smile at her foiled again her cheeks were flushed and her eyes sparkled from the exertion altogether desirable he had hardened his heart for this parting why did it hurt worse baz arrived miles bowed to each commander jesek commodore jesek you know baz perhaps i should have appointed you an admiral those names could get confusing over a bad comm link baz shook his head smiling you have piled enough honors on me my lord honors and honor and much more his eyes sought elena i once thought it would take a miracle to make a nobody into a somebody once again his smile broadened i was right and i thank you and i thank you said elena quietly for a gift i never expected to possess miles obediently cocked his head in an angle of inquiry did she mean baz her rank escape from barrayar myself she explained it seemed to him there was a fallacy in her reasoning somewhere but there was no time to unravel it dendarii were invading the docking bay through several entrances in twos and threes and then in a steady stream the lights came up to full daycycle power his plans for slipping away quietly were disintegrating rapidly well he said desperately goodbye then he shook bazs hand hastily elena her eyes swimming grabbed him in a hug just short of bonecrushing his toes sought the floor indignantly altogether too late by the time she put him down the crowd was gathering hands reaching to shake his hand to touch him or just reaching as if to warm themselves bothari would have had a spasm miles rendered the sergeants spirit an apologetic salute in his mind the docking bay was now a seething sea of people it rang to babble and cheers and cheerful hoots and foot stamping these soon picked up rhythm a chant naismith naismith naismith miles raised his hands in helpless acquiescence cursing under his breath there was always some idiot in a crowd to start these things elena and baz between them hoisted him to their shoulders and he was cornered now he would have to come up with a bloody farewell speech he lowered his hands rather to his surprise they quieted he flung his hands back up they roared he lowered them slowly like an orchestra director the silence became absolute it was terrifying as you can see i am high because you all have raised me up he began pitching his voice to carry to the last and least a gratified chuckle ran through them you have raised me up on your courage tenacity obedience and other soldierly virtues that was it stroke them they were eating it upalthough surely he owed as much to their confusion badtempered rivalry greed ambition indolence and gullibilitypass on pass oni can do no less than to raise you up in return i hereby revoke your provisional status and declare you a permanent arm of the dendarii mercenaries the cheering whistling and foot stomping shook the docking bay many were osers latecomers curious along for the ride but practically all of ausons original crew were there he picked out auson himself beaming and thorne tears streaming down cheeks he raised his arms for silence again and got it i am recalled on urgent affairs for an indefinite period i request and require that you obey commodore jesek as you would me he glanced down to meet bazs upturned gaze he will not desert you he could feel the engineers shoulder tremble beneath him absurd of baz to look so exaltedjesek of them all knew miles was a fake i thank you all and bid you farewell his feet hit the deck with a thump as he slid down and may god have mercy upon me amen he muttered under his breath he backed toward the flex tube and escape smiling and waving jesek blocking the press spoke to his ear my lord for my curiositybefore you go may i be permitted to know what house i serve what you havent figured that out yet miles looked to elena in astonishment botharis daughter shrugged security wellim not going to shout it out in this crowd but if you ever go shopping for livery which doesnt seem too bloody likelychoose brown and silver but baz ground to a halt there in the crowd a little knot of personal silence but thats he paled miles smiled wickedly gratified break him in gently elena the silence in the flex tube sucked at him refuge the noise in front of him beat on his senses for the dendarii had taken up their chant again naismith naismith naismith the felician pilot escorted elli quinn aboard ivan following the last person miles saw as he waved and backed into the tube was elena making her way toward her through the crowd her face drawn and grave and thoughtful was elena visconti the felician pilot bolted the hatch and blew the tube seals and went ahead of them to nav and com whew remarked ivan respectfully you sure got them going you have to be higher than i am now just on psychic waves or something not really miles grimaced why not i sure would be there was an undercurrent of envy in ivans voice my name isnt naismith ivan opened his mouth closed it studied him sideways the screens were up in nav and com showing the refinery and space around them the ship pulled away from the docking bay miles tried to keep that particular slot in the row of docking bays in sight but soon became confused fourth or fifth from the left damn ivan thrust his thumbs through his belt and rocked on his heels it still knocks me flat i mean here you come into this place with nothing and in four months you turn their war completely around and end up with all the marbles on top of it i dont want all the marbles said miles impatiently i dont want any of the marbles its death for me to be caught with marbles in my possession remember i dont understand you ivan complained i thought you always wanted to be a soldier here youve fought real battles commanded a whole fleet of ships wiped the tactical map with fantastically few losses is that what you think that ive been playing soldier peh miles began to pace restlessly he paused and lowered his head in shame maybe i did maybe that was the trouble wasting day after day feeding my ego while all the time back home vordrozdas pack of dogs were running my father to groundstaring out the damn window for five days while theyre killing him ah said ivan so thats whats got the hair up you never fear he comforted well get back all right he blinked and added in a much less definite tone milesassuming youre right about all thiswhat is it were going to do once we get back miless lips drew back in a mirthless grin ill figure something out he turned to watch the screens thinking silently but you are mistaken about the losses ivan they were enormous the refinery and the ships around it dwindled to a scattered constellation of specks sparks water in the eyes and gone chapter twenty the betan night was hot even under the force dome that shielded the suburb of silica miles touched the silver circles on his midforehead and temples praying that his sweat was not loosening their glue he had passed through betan customs on the felician pilots doctored ids it would not do for his supposed implant contact to go sliding down his nose artistically bonsaid mesquite and acacia trees picked out with colored spotlights surrounded the low dome that was the pedestrian entrance to his grandmothers apartment complex the old building predated the community force shield and was therefore entirely underground miles hooked elli quinns hand over his arm and patted it were almost there two steps down here youll like my grandmother she supervises life support equipment maintenance at the silica university hospitalshell know just who to see for the best work now heres a door ivan still clutching the valise stepped through first the cooler interior air caressed miless face and relieved him at least of his worries about his fake implant contacts it had been nervewracking crossing customs with a false id but using his real ones would have guaranteed instant entanglement in betan legal proceedings entailing godknewwhat delays time drummed in his head theres a lift tube there miles began to elli then choked on an oath recoiling popping out of the up tube in the foyer was the very man he least wanted to see on his touchandgo planetary stopover tav calhouns eyes started from his head at the sight of miles his face turned the color of brick you he cried youyouyou he swelled stuttering and advanced on miles miles tried a friendly smile why good evening mr calhoun youre just the man i wanted to see calhouns hands clenched on miless jacket where is my ship miles borne backwards to the wall felt suddenly lonely for sergeant bothari well there was a little problem with the ship he began placatingly calhoun shook him where is it what have you goons done with it its stuck at tau verde im afraid damage to the necklin rods but ive got your money he essayed a cheerful nod calhouns hold did not slacken i wouldnt touch your money with a handtractor he growled ive been given the royal runaround lied to followed had my comconsole tapped had barrayaran agents questioning my employees my girlfriend her wifei found out about that damned worthless hot land by the way you little mutanti want blood youre going to therapy because im calling security right now a plaintive mumble came from elli quinn which miless practiced ear translated as whats happening calhoun noticed her in the shadows for the first time jumped shrugged then turned on his heel and shot over his shoulder to miles dont you move this is a citizens arrest he headed for the public comconsole grab him ivan miles cried calhoun twisted away from ivans clutch his reflexes were quicker than miles had expected for so beefy a body elli quinn head cocked to one side slid into his path in two smooth sideways steps her ankles and knees flexing her hands found his shirt they whirled for a dizzy instant like a pair of dancers and suddenly calhoun was doing spectacular cartwheels he landed flat on his back on the pavement of the foyer the air went out of him in a dooming whoosh elli sitting spun around clamped one leg across his neck and put his arm in a lock ivan now that his target was no longer moving took over and achieved a creditable comealong hold how did you do that he asked elli astonishment and admiration in his voice she shrugged used to practice with eyes covered she mumbled to sharpen balance it works what do we do with him miles asked ivan can he really have you arrested even if you offer to pay him assault croaked calhoun battery miles straightened his jacket im afraid so there was some fine print in that contractlook theres a janitors closet on the second level we better take him down there before somebody comes through here kidnapping gurgled calhoun as ivan dragged him to the lift tube they found a coil of wire in the roomy janitors closet murder shrieked calhoun as they approached him with it miles gagged him his eyes rolled whitely by the time they finished all the extra loops and knots just in case the salvage operator began to resemble a bright orange mummy the valise ivan miles ordered his cousin opened it and they began stuffing calhouns shirt and sarong rope with bundles of betan dollars thirtyeight thirtynine forty thousand miles counted ivan scratched his head yknow theres something backwards about this calhoun was rolling his eyes and moaning urgently miles ungagged him for a moment plus ten percent calhoun panted miles gagged him again and counted out another four thousand dollars the valise was much lighter now they locked the closet behind them miles his grandmother fell on him ecstatically thank god captain dimir found you then the embassy people have been terribly worried cordelia says your father didnt think he could get the date for the challenge in the council of counts put off a third time she broke off as she saw elli quinn oh my miles introduced ivan and named elli hastily as a friend from offplanet with no connections and no place to stay he quickly outlined his hopes for leaving the injured mercenary in his grandmothers hands mrs naismith assimilated this at once merely remarking oh yes another of your strays miles silently called down blessings upon her his grandmother herded them to her living room miles sat on the couch with a twinge remembering bothari he wondered if the sergeants death would become like a veterans scar echoing the old pain with every change of weather as if reflecting his thought mrs naismith said wheres the sergeant and elena making reports at the embassy im surprised they let you out even to visit me lieutenant croye gave me the impression they were going to hustle you aboard a fast courier for barrayar the instant they laid hands on you we havent been to the embassy yet confessed miles uneasily we came straight here told you we should have reported in first said ivan miles made a negative gesture his grandmother glanced at him with a new penetrating concentration whats wrong miles where is elena shes safe replied miles but not here the sergeant was killed two almost three months ago now an accident oh said mrs naismith she sat silent a moment sobered i confess i never did understand what your mother saw in the man but i know he will be sadly missed do you want to call lieutenant croye from here she tilted her head at miles and added is that where youve been for the last five months training to be a jump pilot i shouldnt have thought youd have to do it in secret surely cordelia would have supported you miles touched a silver circle in embarrassment this is a fake i borrowed a jump pilots id to get through customs miles impatience thinned her lips and worry creased twin verticals between her eyebrows whats going on is this more to do with those ghastly barrayaran politics im afraid so quicklywhat have you heard from home since dimir left here according to your mother youre scheduled to be challenged in the council of counts on some sort of trumpedup treason charge and very soon miles gave ivan a short itoldyouso nod ivan began nibbling on a thumbnail theres evidently been a lot of behindthescenes maneuveringi didnt understand half of her message discs im convinced only a barrayaran could figure out how their government works by all right reason it should have collapsed years ago anyway most of it seemed to revolve around changing the substance of the charge from treason by violation of something called vorloupulouss law to treason by intent to usurp the imperial throne what miles shot to his feet the heat of terror flushed through him this is pure insanity i dont want gregors job do they think im out of my mind in the first place id need to command the loyalty of the whole imperial service not just some grubby free mercenary fleet you mean there really was a mercenary fleet his grandmothers eyes widened i thought it was just a wild rumor what cordelia said about the charges makes more sense then what did mother say that your father went to a great deal of trouble to goad this count vorwhatshisnamei can never keep all those vorpeople straight vordrozda yes that was it miles and ivan exchanged wild looks to goad vordrozda to up the charge from the minor to the major while appearing publicly to want just the opposite i didnt understand what difference it made since the penaltys the same did father succeed apparently at least as of two weeks ago when the fast courier that arrived yesterday left barrayar ah miles began to pace ah clever clevermaybe i dont understand it either complained ivan usurpation is a much worse charge but it happens to be one im innocent of and furthermore its a charge of intent about all id have to do is show up to disprove it violating vorloupulouss law is a charge of factand in fact although not in intent im guilty of it given that i showed up for my trial and spoke the truth as im sworn to itd be a lot harder to wriggle out of ivan finished his second thumbnail what makes you think your innocence or guilt is going to have anything to do with the outcome i beg your pardon said mrs naismith thats why i said maybe explained miles this thing is so damned politicalhow many votes dyou suppose vordrozda will have sewn up in advance before any evidence or testimony is even presented hes got to have some or hed never have dared to float this in the first place youre asking me said ivan plaintively you miles eye fell on his cousin you i am absolutely convinced you are the key to this thing if only i can figure out how to fit you into the lock ivan looked as if he were trying and failing to picture himself as a key to anything why for one thing until we report in somewhere hessman and vordrozda will think youre dead what said mrs naismith miles explained about the disappearance of captain dimirs mission he touched his forehead and added to ivan and thats the real reason for this besides calhoun of course speaking of calhoun said his grandmother hes been coming around here regularly looking for you youd best be on the lookout for him if you really mean to stay covert uh said miles thanks anyway ivan if dimirs ship was sabotaged it would have to have taken somebody on the inside to do it whats to keep whoever doesnt want me to show up for my trial from trying again if we soconveniently place ourselves in his hands by popping up at the embassy miles your mind is crookeder than your baci meananyway are you sure youre not catching botharis disease said ivan youre making me feel like ive got a bullseye painted on my back miles grinned feeling bizarrely exhilarated wakes you up doesnt it it seemed to him he could hear the gates of reason clicking over in his own brain cascading faster and faster his voice took on a faraway tone you know if youre trying to take a roomful of people by surprise its a lot easier to hit your targets if you dont yell going through the door they kept the rest of the visit almost as brief as miles had hoped they emptied out the valise onto the living room floor and miles counted out piles of betan dollars to clear his various betan debts including his grandmothers original investment rather bemusedly she agreed to be his agent for the task of distribution the largest pile was for elli quinns new face miles gulped when his grandmother quoted him the approximate price for the best work when he was finished he had one meager wad of bills left in his hand ivan snickered by god miles youve made a profit i think youre the first vorkosigan to do so in five generations must be that bad betan blood miles weighed the dollars wryly its getting to be a kind of family tradition isnt it my father gave away marks the day before he left the regency just so he would have the exact financial balance as the day he took it up sixteen years earlier ivan raised his eyebrows i never knew that why do you think vorkosigan house didnt get a new roof last year i think that was the only thing mother regretted the roof otherwise it was kind of fun figuring out where to bury the stuff the imperial service orphanage picked up a packet for curiosity miles stole a moment and punched up the financial exchange on the comconsole felician millifenigs were listed once again the exchange rate was millifenigs to the betan dollar but at least they were listed last weeks rate had been to the dollar miless growing sense of urgency propelled them toward the door if we can have a oneday head start in the felician fast courier he told his grandmother that should be enough then you can call the embassy and put them out of their misery yes she smiled poor lieutenant croye was convinced he was going to spend the rest of his career as a private doing guard duty someplace nasty miles paused at the door ahabout tav calhoun yes you know that janitors closet on the second level vaguely she looked at him in unease please be sure somebody checks it tomorrow morning but dont go up there before then i wouldnt dream of it she assured him faintly come on miles ivan urged over his shoulder just a second miles darted back inside to elli quinn still seated obediently in the living room he pressed the wad of leftover bills into her palm and closed her fingers over it combat bonus he whispered to her for upstairs just now you earned it he kissed her hand and ran after ivan chapter twentyone miles banked the lightflyer in a gentle demure turn around vorhartung castle resisting a nervous urge to slam it directly down into the courtyard the ice had broken on the river winding through the capital city of vorbarr sultana running a chill green now from the snows melting in the dendarii mountains far to the south the ancient building straddled high bluffs the lightflyer rocked in the updraft puffing from the river the modern city spread out for kilometers around was bright and noisy with morning traffic the parking areas near the castle were jammed with vehicles of all descriptions and knots of men in halfahundred different liveries ivan beside miles counted the banners snapping in the cold spring breeze on the battlements its a full council session said ivan i dont think theres a banner missingtheres even count vortalas and i dont think hes been to one in years must have been carried in ye gods miles theres the emperors bannergregor must be inside you could figure that from all the fellows on the roof in imperial livery with the antiaircraft plasma guns observed miles he flinched inwardly one such weapon was swivelling to follow their track even now like a suspicious eye slowly and carefully he set the lightflyer down in a painted circle outside the castle walls yknow said ivan thoughtfully were going to look a pair of damn fools busting in there if it turns out theyre all having a debate on water rights or something that thought has crossed my mind miles admitted it was a calculated risk landing in secret well weve both been fools before there wont be anything new or startling in it he checked the time and paused a moment in the pilots seat bent his head down and breathed carefully you feeling sick asked ivan alarmed you dont look so good miles shook his head a lie and begged forgiveness in his heart for all the harsh things hed once thought about baz jesek so this was the real thing paralyzing funk he wasnt braver than baz after allhed just never been as scared he wished himself back with the dendarii doing something simple like defusing dandelion bombs pray to god this works he muttered ivan looked even more alarmed youve been pushing this surprisescheme on me for the last two weeksall right so youve convinced me its too late to change your mind i havent changed my mind miles rubbed the silver circles loose from his forehead and stared up at the great grey wall of the castle the guards are going to notice us if we just keep sitting here ivan added after a time not to mention the hell thats probably breaking loose back at the shuttleport right now right said miles he dangled now at the end of a long long chain of reason swinging in the winds of doubt time to drop to solid ground after you said ivan politely right any time now added ivan the vertigo of free fall he popped the doors and clambered to the pavement they strode up to quartet of armed guards in imperial livery at the castle gate ones fingers twitched into a devils horns down by his side he had a countrymans face miles sighed inwardly welcome home he settled on an incisive nod by way of greeting good morning armsmen i am lord vorkosigan i understand the emperor has commanded me to appear here damn joker began a guard loosening his truncheon a second guard grasped his arm staring shocked at miles no dubit really is they underwent a second search in the vestibule of the great chamber itself ivan kept trying to peek around the door to the annoyance of the guard charged with being the final check against weapons carried into the presence of the emperor voices wafted from the council chamber to miless straining ear he identified count vordrozdas pitched to a carrying nasality rhythmic in the cadences of formal debate how long has this been going on miles whispered to a guard a week this was to be the last day theyre doing the summing up now youre just in time my lord he gave miles an encouraging nod the two guard captains finished a sotto voce argument but hes supposed to be here you sure you wouldnt rather be in betan therapy muttered ivan miles grinned blackly too late now wont it be funny if weve arrived just in time for the sentencing hysterical youll die laughing no doubt growled ivan ivan approved by the guard started for the door miles grabbed him sh wait listen another identifiable voice admiral hessman whats he doing here whispered ivan i thought this thing was closed and sealed to the counts alone witness ill bet just like you sh if our illustrious prime minister knew nothing of this plot then let him produce this missing nephew vordrozdas voice was heavy with sarcasm he says he cannot and why not i submit it is because lord vorpatril was dispatched with a secret message what message obviously some variation of fly for your lifeall is revealed i ask youis it reasonable that a plot of this magnitude could have been advanced so far by a son with no knowledge by his father where did those missing marks whose fate he so adamantly refuses to disclose go but to secretly finance the operation these repeated requests for delays are simply smokescreen if lord vorkosigan is so innocent why is he not here vordrozda paused dramatically ivan tugged miless sleeve come on youll never get a better straight line than that if you wait all day youre right lets go stained glass windows high in the east wall splashed the heavy oak flooring of the chamber with colored light vordrozda stood in the speakers circle upon the witness bench behind it sat admiral hessman the gallery above with its ornately carved railings was indeed empty but the rows of plain wooden benches and desks that ringed the room below were jammed with men formal liveries in a wild assortment of hues peeked out beneath their scarlet and silver robes of office but for a sprinkling of robeless men who wore the red and blue parade uniform of active imperial service emperor gregor on his raised dais to the left of the room also wore imperial service uniform miles gulped down a sharp spasm of stage fright he wished hed stopped at vorkosigan house to change he still wore the plain dark shirt trousers and boots hed stood in when leaving tau verde he estimated the distance to the center of the chamber as about a lightyear his father sat looking entirely at home in his redandblues behind his desk in the first row not far from vordrozda count vorkosigan leaned back his legs stretched out and crossed at the ankles arms draped along the backrest yet looking no more casual than a tiger stalking his prey his face was sour murderous concentrated on vordrozda miles wondered briefly if the old slanderous sobriquet the butcher of komarr that had once attached to his father might have some basis in fact after all vordrozda in the speakers circle was the only one directly facing the darkened entrance arch he was the first to see miles and ivan he had just opened his mouth to continue it hung there slack thats just the question i propose to make you answer count vordrozdaand you admiral hessman miles called two lightyears he thought and limped forward the chamber stirred to murmurs and cries of astonishment of all the mens reactions miles searched for only one count vorkosigan snapped his head around saw miles he inhaled and his arms and legs drew in he sat for a moment with his elbows on his desk face buried in his hands he rubbed his face hard when he raised it again it was flushed and furrowed blinking when did he grow to look so old miles grieved was his hair always that grey has he changed so much or is it i or both count vorkosigans eye fell on ivan and his face cleared to stunned exasperation ivan you idiot where have you been ivan glanced at miles and rose to the occasion bowing toward the witness bench admiral hessman sent me to find miles sir i did somehow i dont think that was what he really had in mind vordrozda turned in the circle to glare furiously at hessman who was goggling at ivan you vordrozda hissed at the admiral voice venomous with rage he caught himself up almost instantly straightening his crouch relaxing his hands from clawed rakes to elegant curves once again miles swept a bow to the encircling assemblage ending it on one knee in the direction of the dais my leige and my lords i would have been here sooner but my invitation was lost in the mail to attest this i wish to call lord ivan vorpatril as my witness gregors young face stared down at him stiff dark eyes troubled and distant the emperors gaze turned in bewilderment to his new advisor standing in the speakers circle his old advisor count vorkosigan looked wonderfully enlightened his lips drew back in a tigerish smile miles too glanced at vordrozda from the corner of his eye now he thought instantly is the time to push by the time the lord guardian of the circle admits ivan with all due ceremony they will have recovered give them sixty seconds to confer on the bench and they will concoct new lies of utmost reasonableness leaving it their word against ours in the hideous gamble of a stacked council vote hessman yes it was hessman he must put the wind up vordrozda was too supple to stampede strike now and cleave the conspiracy in half he swallowed cleared his locked throat and swung to his feet i challenge admiral hessman here before you lords on charges of sabotage murder and attempted murder i can prove he ordered the sabotage of captain dimirs imperial fast courier resulting in the horrible deaths of all aboard her i can prove his intent that my cousin ivan have been among them you are out of order cried vordrozda these insane charges do not belong in the council of counts you must make them in a military court if you make them at all traitor where admiral hessman most conveniently must stand them alone since you count vordrozda cannot be tried there said miles immediately count vorkosigan was tapping his fist softly on his desk leaning forward urgently toward miles his lips formed a silent litany yes go go miles encouraged raised his voice he will stand alone and he will die alone since he has only his own unwitnessed word that his crimes were by your order they were unwitnessed were they not admiral do you really think that count vordrozda will be so overcome by emotions of loyalty to a comrade as to endorse that word hessman was dead white breathing heavily stare flicking back and forth between vordrozda and ivan miles could see the panic blossoming in his eyes vordrozda straddling the circle gestured jerkily at miles my lords this is not a defense he merely hopes to camouflage his guilt by these wild counteraccusations and totally out of order at that my lord guardian i appeal to you to restore order the lord guardian of the circle began to rise stopped speared by a penetrating stare from count vorkosigan he sank back weakly to his bench this is certainly very irregular he managed then ran down count vorkosigan smiled approvingly you havent answered my question vordrozda called miles will you speak for admiral hessman subordinates have committed unauthorized excesses throughout history began vordrozda he twists he turns hes going to torque awayno i can twist too oh you admit he is your subordinate do you now he is nothing of a sort snapped vordrozda we have no connection but common interest in the good of the imperium no connection admiral hessman do you hear that how does it feel to be stabbed in the back with such surpassing smoothness i wager you can scarcely feel the knife going in it will be like that right up to the end you know hessmans eyes bulged he sprang to his feet no it wont he snarled you started this vordrozda if im going down ill take you with me he pointed at vordrozda he came to me at winterfair wanting me to pass him the latest imperial security intelligence about vorkosigans son shut up ground out vordrozda desperately fury firing his eyes at being so needlessly taken from behind shut up his hand snaked under his scarlet robe emerged with a glitter locked the needlers aim on the babbling admiral stopped vordrozda stared down at the weapon in his hand as though it were a scorpion who now is out of order mocked miles softly barrayars aristocracy still maintained its military tone drawing a deadly weapon in the presence of the emperor struck a deep reflex twenty or thirty men started up from their benches only on barrayar miles reflected would pulling a loaded needler start a stampede toward one others ran between vordrozda and the dais vordrozda abandoned hessman and whirled to face his real tormentor raising the weapon miles stood stock still transfixed by the needlers tiny dark eye fascinating that the pit of hell should have so narrow an entrance vordrozda was buried in an avalanche of tackling bodies their scarlet robes flapping ivan had the honor of the first hit taking him in the knees miles stood before his emperor the chamber had quieted his late accusers hustled out under arrest now he faced his true tribunal gregor sighed uneasily and motioned the lord guardian of the circle to his side they conferred briefly the emperor requests and requires a recess of one hour to examine the new testimony for witness count vorvolk count vorhalas they all filed into the private chamber behind the dais gregor count vorkosigan miles and ivan and gregors curious choice of witnesses henri vorvolk was one of gregors few agemates among the counts and a personal friend nucleus of a new generation of cronies miles supposed no surprise that gregor should desire his support count vorhalas vorhalas was miless fathers oldest and most implacable enemy since the deaths of his two sons on the wrong side of vordarians pretendership eighteen years before miles eyed him queasily the counts son and heir had been the man whod fired the soltoxin gas grenade through the window of vorkosigan house one night in a tangled attempt at vengeance for the death of his younger brother he had been executed in turn for his treason had count vorhalas seen in vordrozdas conspiracy an opportunity to complete the job revenge in perfect symmetry a son for a son yet vorhalas was known as a just and honest manmiles could as easily picture him uniting with his father in disdain of vordrozdas mushroom upstart plot the two had been enemies so long and outlived so many friends and foes their enmity had almost achieved a kind of harmony still no one would dare accuse vorhalas of favoritism in witness to the former regent now the two men exchanged nods like a pair of fencers en garde and took seats opposite each other so said count vorkosigan grown serious and intense what really happened out there miles ive had illyans reportsuntil latelybut somehow they all seemed to raise more questions than they answered miles was diverted moment isnt his agent still sending i promise you i didnt interfere with his duties captain illyan is in prison what awaiting trial he was included in your conspiracy charges thats absurd not at all most logical who moving against me would not take the precaution first of taking away my eyes and ears if they could count vorhalas nodded a tacticians approval and agreement as if to say just how id have done it myself miless fathers eyes narrowed with dry humor its a learning experience for him to be on the other end of the process of justice for a time no harm done i admit he is a trifle annoyed with you at the moment the question said gregor distantly was whether the captain served me or my prime minister bitter uncertainty still lingered in his eyes all who serve me serve you through me count vorkosigan stated it is the vor system at work streams of experience all flowing together combining at last in a river of great power yours is the final confluence it was the closest to flattery miles had ever heard his father come a measure of his unease you do simon illyan an injustice to suspect him he has served you all your life and your grandfather before you miles wondered what sort of tributary he now constitutedthe dendarii mercenaries included some very odd headwaters indeed what happened well sir he paused groping along the chain of events to some starting point truly it began at a wall not kilometers outside vorbarr sultana but he launched his account at his meeting with arde mayhew on beta colony he stumbled in fearful hesitation took a breath then went on in an exact and honest description of his meeting with baz jesek his father winced at the name the blockade the boarding the battlesselfforgetfulness overcame him during his enthusiastic description of these at one point he looked up to realize he had the emperor playing the part of the oseran fleet henri vorvolk captain tung and his father the pelian high command botharis death his fathers face grew drawn and inward at this news well he said after a time he is released from a great burden may he find his ease at last miles glanced at the emperor and edited out the escobaran womans accusations about prince serg from the sharp and grateful look count vorkosigan gave him miles gathered that was the correct thing to do some truths come in too fierce a flood for some structures to withstand miles had no wish to witness another devastation like elena botharis by the time he reached the account of how he broke the blockade at last gregors lips were parted in fascination and count vorkosigans eyes glinted with appreciation ivans arrival and miless deductions from ithe was reminded of the hour and reached for his hip flask what is that asked his father startled antacid uhwant some he offered politely thank you said count vorkosigan dont mind if i do he took a grave swig so straightfaced even miles was not sure if he was laughing miles gave a brief bald account of the thinking that led him to return in secret to attempt to surprise vordrozda and hessman ivan endorsed all he had been eyewitness to giving hessman the lie gregor looked disturbed at having his assumptions about his new friends turned so bluntly insideout wake up gregor thought miles you of all men cannot afford the luxury of comfortable illusions no indeed i have no desire to trade places with you gregor was downcast by the time miles finished count vorkosigan sat at gregors right hand backwards on a plain chair as usual and gazed at his son with a pensive hunger why then asked gregor what did you think to make of yourself when you raised up such force if not emperorif not of barrayar perhaps of someplace else my leige miles lowered his voice when we played together in the imperial residence in the winters when did i ever demand any part except that of vorthalia the loyal you know menow could you doubt the dendarii mercenaries were an accident i didnt plan themthey just happened in the course of scrambling from crisis to crisis i only wanted to serve barrayar as my father before me when i couldnt serve barrayar i wantedi wanted to serve something to he raised his eyes to his fathers driven to a painful honesty to make my life an offering fit to lay at his feet he shrugged screwed up again clay boy count vorkosigans voice was hoarse but clear only clay not fit to receive so golden a sacrifice his voice cracked for a moment miles forgot to care about his coming trial he lidded his eyes and stored tranquillity away in his hearts most secret recesses to pleasure him in some lean and desperate future hour fatherless gregor swallowed and looked away as if ashamed count vorhalas stared at the floor discomfited like a man accidentally intruding onto some private and delicate scene gregors right hand moved hesitantly to touch the shoulder of his first and most loyal protector i serve barrayar he offered its justice is my duty i never meant to dispense injustice you were ringled boy count vorkosigan muttered to gregors ear alone never mind but learn from it gregor sighed when we played together miles you always beat me at strato it was because i knew you that i doubted miles knelt head bowed and spread his arms your will my leige gregor shook his head may i always endure such treason as that he raised his voice to his witnesses well my lords are you satisfied that the substance of vordozdas charge intent to usurp the imperium is false and malicious and will you so testify to your peers absolutely said henri vorvolk with enthusiasm miles gauged that the secondyear cadet had fallen in love with him about halfway through his account of his adventures with the dendarii mercenaries count vorhalas remained cool and thoughtful the usurpation charge does indeed appear false the old man agreed and by my honor i will so testify but there is another treason here by his own admission lord vorkosigan was and indeed remains in violation of vorloupulouss law treason in its own right no such charge said count vorkosigan distantly has been laid in the council of counts henri vorvolk grinned whod dare after this a man of proven loyalty to the imperium with an academic interest in perfect justice might so dare said count vorkosigan still dispassionate a man with nothing to lose might daremuch might he not beg for it vorkosigan whispered vorhalas his coolness slipping beg for mercy as i did his eyes shut tight and he trembled count vorkosigan gazed at him in silence for a long moment then as you wish he said and rose and slid to one knee before his enemy let it lay then and i will see the boy does not trouble those waters any more still too stiffnecked if it please you then say i beg of you i beg of you repeated count vorkosigan obediently miles searched for tensions of rage in his fathers backbone found none this was something old older than himself between the two men labyrinthine he could scarcely penetrate its inward places gregor looked sick henri vorvolk bewildered ivan terrified vorhalass hard stillness seemed edged with a kind of ecstasy he leaned close to miless fathers ear shove it vorkosigan he whispered count vorkosigans head bowed and his hands clenched he sees me if at all only as a handle on my father time to get his attention count vorhalas miless voice flexed across the silence like a blade be satisfied for if you carry this through at some point you are going to have to look my mother in the eye and repeat that dare you vorhalas wilted slightly he frowned at miles can your mother look at you and not understand desire for vengeance he gestured at miless stunted and twisted frame mother said miles calls it my great gift tests are a gift she says and great tests are a great gift of course he added thoughtfully its widely agreed my mother is a bit strange he trapped vorhalass gaze direct what do you propose to do with your gift count vorhalas hell vorhalas muttered after a short interminable silence not to miles but to count vorkosigan hes got his mothers eyes ive noticed that count vorkosigan murmured back vorhalas glared at him in exasperation i am not a bloody saint vorhalas declared to the air generally no one is asking you to be said gregor anxiously soothing but you are my sworn servant and it does not serve me for my servants to be ripping up each other instead of my enemies vorhalas sniffed and shrugged grudgingly true my leige his hands unclenched finger by finger as if releasing some invisible possession oh get up he added impatiently to count vorkosigan the former regent rose quite bland again vorhalas glared at miles and just how aral do you propose to keep this gifted young maniac and his accidental army under control count vorkosigan measured out his words slowly drop by drop as though pursuing some delicate titration the dendarii mercenaries are a genuine puzzle he glanced at gregor what is your will my liege gregor jerked startled out of spectatorhood he looked rather pleadingly at miles organizations do grow and die any chance of them just fading away miles chewed his lip that hope has crossed my mind butthey looked awfully healthy when i left growing gregor grimaced i can hardly march my army on them and break them up like old dorca didits definitely too long a walk they themselves are innocent of any wrongdoing miles hastened to point out they never knew who i wasmost of them arent even barrayaran gregor glanced uncertainly at count vorkosigan who studied his boots as if to say youre the one who itched to make your own decisions boy but he did add aloud you are just as much emperor as dorca ever was gregor do what you will gregors gaze returned to miles for a long moment you couldnt break your blockade within its military context so you changed the context yes sir i cannot change dorcas law said gregor slowly count vorkosigan who had begun to look uneasy relaxed again it saved barrayar the emperor paused a long time awash in bafflement miles knew just how he felt miles let him stew a few moments more until the silence was stretched taut with expectation and gregor was starting to get that desperate glazed look miles recognized from his candidacy orals of a man caught without the answer now the emperors own dendarii mercenaries miles said suggestively what why not miles straightened and turned his hands palmout id be delighted to give them to you declare them a crown troop its been done with horse cavalry said count vorkosigan but his face was suddenly much lighter whatever he does with them will be a legal fiction anyway since they are beyond his reach miles bowed apologetically to gregor he may as well arrange it to his own maximum convenience whose maximum convenience inquired count vorhalas dryly you were thinking of this as a private declaration i trust said count vorkosigan well yesim afraid most of the mercenaries would be uh rather disturbed to hear theyd been drafted into the barrayaran imperial service but why not put them in captain illyans department their status would have to remain covert then let him figure out something useful to do with em a free mercenary fleet secretly owned by barrayaran imperial security gregor looked suddenly more reconciled indeed intrigued that might be practical count vorkosigans teeth glinted in a white flash of a grin instantly suppressed simon he murmured will be overjoyed really said gregor dubiously you have my personal guarantee count vorkosigan sketched a bow sitting vorhalas snorted and eyed miles youre too bloody clever for your own good you know boy exactly sir said miles agreeably in a mild hysteria of relief feeling lighter by soldiers and god knew how many tons of equipment he had done itthe last piece glued back in its place dare play the fool with me muttered vorhalas he raised his voice to count vorkosigan that only answers half my question aral count vorkosigan studied his fingernails eyes alight true we cant leave him running around loose i too shudder to think what accidents he might commit next he should doubtless be confined to an institution where he would be forced to labor all day long under many watchful eyes he paused thoughtfully may i suggest the imperial service academy miles looked up mouth open in an idiocy of sudden hope all his calculations had been concentrated on wriggling out from under vorloupulouss law hed scarcely dared even to dream of life afterwards let alone such reward as this his father lowered his voice to him assuming its not beneath youadmiral naismith i never did get to congratulate you on your promotion miles reddened it was all just fakery sir you know that all wellmostly ah you grow subtle even with me but you have tasted command can you go back to subordination demotions are a bitter meat to swallow an old irony played around his mouth you were demoted after komarr sir broken back to captain yes one corner of miless mouth twisted up i have a bionic stomach now that can digest anything i can handle it count vorhalas raised skeptical brows what sort of ensign do you think he will make admiral vorkosigan i think he will make a terrible ensign said count vorkosigan frankly but if he can avoid being strangled by his harried superiors forerexcessive initiative i think he might be a fine general staff officer someday vorhalas nodded reluctant agreement miless eyes blazed up like bonfires in reflection to his fathers after two days of testimony and behind thescenes maneuvering the council vote was unanimous for acquittal for one thing gregor took his place by right as count vorbarra and cast a resounding innocent as the fourth vote called instead of the usual abstention customary for the emperor the rest swung meekly into line some of count vorkosigans older political opponents looked as if theyd rather spit but only count vorhalas voted an abstention then vorhalas had never been of vordrozdas party and had no taint of association to wash off ballsy bastard count vorkosigan exchanged a familiar salute across the chamber with his closest enemy i wish they all had his backbone if not his opinions miles sat quietly absorbing this most mitigated triumph elena would have been safe after all but not happy hunting hawks do not belong in cages no matter how much a man covets their grace no matter how golden the bars they are far more beautiful soaring free heartbreakingly beautiful he sighed and rose to go wrestle with his destiny the vinyards garlanding the terraced slopes of the long lake above vorkosigan surleau were misted with new green the surface of the water glittered in a warm breath of air a spatter of silver coins it had once been a custom somewhere to put coins on the eyes of the dead miles had read for their journey it seemed appropriate he imagined the suncoins sinking to the bottom of the lake there to pile up and up until they broke the surface a new island the clods of earth were cold and wet yet winter lingering beneath the surface of the soil heavy he tossed a shovelful shoulderhigh from the hole he dug your hands are bleeding observed his mother you could do that in five seconds with a plasma arc blood said miles washes away sin the sergeant said so i see she made no further demur but sat in companionable silence her back against a tree watching the lake it was her betan upbringing miles supposed she never seemed to tire of the delight of water open to the sky he finished at last countess vorkosigan gave him a hand up out of the pit he took up the control lead of the float pallet and lowered the oblong box waiting patiently all this time into its rest bothari had always waited patiently for him covering it back up was quicker work the marker his father had ordered was not yet finished handcarved like the others in this family plot miless grandfather lay not far away next to the grandmother miles had never known dead decades before in barrayaran civil strife his eye lingered a moment uncomfortably on a double space reserved next to his grandfather above the slope and perpendicular to the sergeants new grave but that burden was yet to come he placed a shallow beaten copper bowl upon a tripod at the foot of the grave in it he piled juniper twigs from the mountains and a lock of his own hair he then pulled a colored scarf from his jacket carefully unfolded it and placed a curl of finer dark hair among the twigs his mother added a clipping of short grey hair and a thick generous tress of her own red roan and withdrew to a distance miles after a pause laid the scarf beside the hair im afraid i made a most improper baba he whispered in apology i never meant to mock you but baz loves her hell take good care of her my word was too easy to give too hard to keep but there there he added flakes of aromatic bark you shall lie warm here watching the long lake change its faces winter to spring summer to fall no armies march here and even the deepest midnights arent wholly dark surely god wont overlook you in such a spot as this there will be grace and forgiveness enough old dog even for you he lit the offering i pray you will spare me a drink from that cup when it overflows for you epilogue the emergency docking drill was called in the middle of the night cycle naturally hed probably have timed it that way himself miles thought as he scrambled through the corridors of the orbital weapons platform with his fellow cadets this fourweek stint of orbital and freefall training was due to end tomorrow for his group and the instructors hadnt pulled anything nasty for at least four days not for him the galloping anticipation of upcoming leave planetside that had formed the bulk of the conversation in the officers mess last night he had sat quietly meditating on all the marvelous possibilities for a grand finale he arrived at his assigned shuttle hatch corridor at the same moment as his cotrainee and the instructor the instructors face was a mask of neutrality cadet kostolitz looked miles over sourly still carrying that obsolete pigsticker eh said kostolitz with an irritated nod at the dagger at miless waist i have permission said miles tranquilly dyou sleep with it a small bland smile yes miles considered the ongoing problem of kostolitz the accidents of barrayaran history guaranteed he would be dealing with classconsciousness in his officers throughout his imperial service career aggressive like kostolitzs or in more subtle forms he must learn to handle it not merely well but creatively if his officers were ever to give him their best he had the uncanny sensation of being able to look through kostolitz the way a doctor saw through a body with his diagnostic viewers every twist and tear and emotional abrasion every young cancer of resentment growing from them seemed redlined in his minds eye patience the problem displayed itself with everincreasing clarity the solution would follow in time with opportunity kostolitz could teach him much this docking drill might prove interesting after all kostolitz had acquired a thin green armband since they had last been paired miles saw he wondered what wit among the instructors had come up with that idea the armbands were rather like getting a gold star on your paper in reverse green represented injury in drills yellow represented death in the judgment of whatever instructor was umpiring the simulated catastrophe very few cadets managed to escape these training cycles without a collection of them miles had encountered ivan vorpatril yesterday sporting two greens and a yellow not as bad as the unfortunate fellow hed seen at mess last night with five yellows miless own undecorated sleeve was attracting a bit more attention from the instructors than he really wanted lately the notoriety had a pleasant flipside some of the more alert among his fellow cadets vied quietly to have miles in their groups as armband repellent of course the very most alert were now avoiding him like a plague realizing he was beginning to draw fire miles grinned to himself in happy anticipation of something really sneaky and underhanded coming up every cell of his body seemed awake and singing kostolitz with a stifled yawn and a last growl at miless upperclass decorative blade took the starboard side of the shuttle and began working forward with his checklist miles took the port side ditto the instructor floated between them watching sharply over their shoulders hed got one good thing out of his adventures with the dendarii mercenaries miles reflected his freefall nausea had vanished an unexpected sidebenefit of the work tungs surgeon had done on his stomach small favors kostolitz was working swiftly miles saw from the corner of his eye they were being timed kostolitz counted emergency breath masks through the plexiglass of their case and hurried on miles almost called a suggestion to him then clamped his jaw it wouldnt be appreciated patience item item itemfirst aid kit correctly in its wall socket automatically suspicious miles unlocked it and checked to see that all its contents were indeed intact tape tourniquets plastic bandage iv tubing meds emergency oxygenno surprises concealed there he ran a hand along the bottom of the case and caught his breathplastic explosive no only a wad of chewing gum shucks kostolitz was finished and waiting impatiently as miles arrived up front youre slow vorkosigian kostolitz jammed his report panel into the readslot and slid into the pilots seat miles eyed an interesting bulge in the instructors breast pocket he patted his own pockets and essayed a helpless smile oh sir he chirped politely to the instructor i seem to have misplaced my lightpen may i borrow yours the instructor disgorged it unwillingly miles lidded his eyes in addition to the lightpen the instructors pocket contained three emergency breathmasks folded an interesting number three anyone on a space station might carry a breath mask in his pocket as a matter of course but three yet they had a dozen breathmasks ready to hand kostolitz had just checked themno kostolitz had just counted them your light pens are standard issue said the instructor coldly youre supposed to hang onto them you careless characters are going to bring the accounting office down on us all one of these days yes sir thank you sir miles signed his name with a flourish made to pocket the pen came up with two oh heres mine sorry sir he entered his report and strapped himself into the copilots chair with his seat at the limit of its forward adjustment he could just reach the foot controls imperial equipment was not so flexible as the mercenaries had been no matter he schooled himself to strict attention he was still awkward in his handling of shuttle controls but a bit more practice and he would never be at the mercy of a shuttle pilot for transportation again it was kostolitzs turn now though miles was pressed into his padded seat by the acceleration as the shuttle popped free of its clamps and began to boost toward its assigned station breath masks check lists assumptions the chip on kostolitzs shoulder assumptions miless nerves extended themselves spiderpatient questing minutes crept by a sharp report and a hissing came from the rear of the cabin miless heart lurched and began to pound violently in spite of his anticipation he swung around and took it in at a glance as when a strobeflash of lightning betrays the secrets of the dark kostolitz swore violently miles breathed ha a jagged hole in the paneling on the starboard side of the shuttle was pouring out a thick green gas a coolant line had snapped as from a meteor hit the meteor was undoubtedly plastic explosive since the stuff was streaming into and not out of the cabin besides the instructor was still seated watching them kostolitz leaped for the case of emergency breath masks miles dove instead for the controls he snapped the atmosphere circuit from recycle to exterior venting and in one pauseless motion fired the shuttles attitude verniers at maximum boost after a groaning moment the shuttle began to turn then spin around an axis through the center of the cabin miles the instructor and kostolitz were thrown forward the coolant gas heavier than their atmosphere mix began to pile up against the back wall of the cabin in noxious billows under the influence of this simplest of artificial gravities you crazy bastard screamed kostolitz scrabbling at a breath mask what are you doing the instructors expression was first an echo of kostolitzs then suddenly enlightened he eased back into the seat he had begun to shoot out of hanging on tightly and observing his eyes crinkling with interest miles was too busy to reply kostolitz would figure it out shortly he was sure kostolitz donned a breath mask attempted to inhale he snatched it off his face and threw it aside and grabbed up the second of the three hed brought forward miles climbed up the wall toward the first aid kit the second breath mask curved past him empty reservoirs no doubt kostolitz had counted the breath masks without checking their working condition miles levered the first aid kit open and pulled out iv tubing and two yconnectors kostolitz threw aside the third breath mask and began climbing back up the starboard wall toward the case of breath masks the coolant gas made an acrid burning stench in miless nostrils but its harmful concentrations remained in the other end of the cabin for now a cry of rage and fear interrupted by coughing came from kostolitz as he began pawing through breath masks checking their condition readouts at last miless lips drew back in a wicked grin he pulled his grandfathers dagger from its sheath cut the iv tubing into four pieces inserted the yconnectors sealed them with blobs of plastic bandage jammed the hookahlike apparatus into the single outlet of the emergency medical oxygen canister and skidded back to the instructor air sir he offered a hissing end of iv tubing to the officer i suggest you breathe in through your mouth and out through your nose thank you cadet vorkosigan said the instructor in a fascinated tone taking it kostolitz coughing eyes rolling desperately fell back toward them barely managing not to put his feet through the control panel miles blandly handed him a tube he sucked on it eyes wide and watering not miles thought only from the effects of the coolant gas clenching his airtube between his teeth miles began to climb the starboard wall kostolitz started after him then discovered that both he and the instructor had been issued short tethers miles uncoiled tubing behind him yes it would reach although just barely kostolitz and the instructor could only watch breathing in yogalike cadence miles reversed his hold as he passed the midpoint of the cabin and centrifugal force began to pull him toward the pooling green gas slowly filling the shuttle from the back wall he counted down wall panels a b cthat should be it he popped it open and found the manual shutoff valves that one no that one he turned it it slipped in his sweating hand the panel door on which he rested his weight gave way with a sudden crack and he swung out over the evilly heaving green gas the oxygen tube ripped from his mouth and flapped around wildly he was saved from yelping only by the fact that he was holding his breath the instructor forward lurched futilely tied to his air supply but by the time hed fumbled his pocket open miles had swallowed achieved a more secure grip on the wall and recovered his tube in a heartstopping grab try again he turned the valve hard and the hissing from the hole in the wall a meter astern of him faded to an elfin moan then stopped the tide of green gas began to recede and thin at last as the cabin ventilators labored miles shaking only slightly climbed back to the front end of the shuttle and strapped himself into his copilots seat without comment comment would have been awkward around his oxygen tube anyway cadet kostolitz in his role as pilot returned to his controls the atmosphere cleared at last he stopped the spin and aimed the damaged shuttle slowly back toward dock paying strict and subdued attention to engine temperature readouts the instructor looked extremely thoughtful and only little pale the chief instructor himself was waiting in the shuttle hatch corridor of the orbital station when they docked along with a repairs tech he smiled cheerily turning two yellow armbands absently in his hands their own instructor sighed and shook his head dolefully at the armbands no no queried the chief instructor miles was not sure if it was with amazement or disappointment no this ive got to see the two instructors ducked into the shuttle leaving miles and kostolitz alone a moment kostolitz cleared his throat that ahblade of yours came in pretty handy after all yes there are times when a plasma arc beam isnt nearly as suitable for cutting miles agreed like when youre in a chamber full of inflammable gas oh hell kostolitz seemed suddenly struck that stuff will go off mixed with oxygen i almost he cut himself off cleared his throat again you dont miss much do you a sudden suspicion filled his face did you know about this set up in advance not exactly but i figured something must be up when i counted the three breath masks in the instructors pocket you kostolitz paused turned did you really lose track of your lightpen no hell kostolitz muttered again he scuffed around the corridor a moment hunched red dismally recalcitrant now thought miles i know a place you can buy good blades in vorbarr sultana he said with nicely calculated diffidence better than standard issue stuff you can get a real bargain there sometimes if you know what to look for kostolitz stopped oh yeah he began to straighten as though being relieved of a weight you ahi dont suppose its kind of a holeinthewall i could take you there sometime during leave if youre interested really youdyoudyes id be interested kostolitz feigned a casual air sure he looked suddenly much more cheerful miles smiled
