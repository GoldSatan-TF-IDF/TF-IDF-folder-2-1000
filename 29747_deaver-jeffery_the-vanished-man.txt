jeffery deaver the vanished man the fifth book in the lincoln rhyme series a conjuring trick is generally regarded by magicians as consisting of an effect and a method the effect is what the spectator sees the method is the secret behind the effect and allows the effect to take place peter lament and richard wiseman magic in theory i effect saturday april the expert magician seeks to deceive the mind rather than the eye marvin kaye the creative magicians handbook chapter one greetings revered audience welcome welcome to our show we have a number of thrills in store for you over the next two days as our illusionists our magicians our sleightofhand artists weave their spells to delight and captivate you our first routine is from the repertoire of a performer everyones heard of harry houdini the greatest escape artist in america if not the world a man who performed before crowned heads of state and us presidents some of his escapes are so difficult no one has dared attempt them all these years after his untimely death today well recreate an escape in which he risked suffocation in a routine known as the lazy hangman in this trick our performer lies prone on the belly hands bound behind the back with classic darby handcuffs the ankles are tied together and another length of rope is wound around the neck like a noose and tied to the ankles the tendency of the legs to straighten pulls the noose taut and begins the terrible process of suffocation why is it called the lazy hangman because the condemned executes himself in many of mr houdinis more dangerous routines assistants were present with knives and keys to release him in the event that he was unable to escape often a doctor was on hand today therell be none of these precautions if theres no escape within four minutes the performer will die we begin in a moment but first a word of advice never forget that by entertaining our show youre abandoning reality what youre absolutely convinced you might see might not exist at all what you know has to be an illusion may turn out to be gods harsh truth your companion at our show might turn out to be a total stranger a man or woman in the audience you dont recognize may know you far too well what seems to be safe may be deadly and the dangers you guard against may be nothing more than distractions to lure you to greater danger in our show what can you believe whom can you trust well revered audience the answer is that you should believe nothing and you should trust no one no one at all now the curtain rises the lights dim the music fades leaving only the sublime sound of hearts beating in anticipation and our show begins the building looked as if itd seen its share of ghosts gothic sooty dar sandwiched between two highrises on the upper west side capped with a widows walk and many shuttered windows the building dated from the victorian era and had been a boarding school at one point and later a sanatorium where the criminally insane lived out their frazzled lives the manhattan school of music and performing arts could have been home to dozens of spirits but none so immediate as the one who might be hovering here now above the warm body of the young woman lying stomach down in the dim lobby outside a small recital hall her eyes were still and wide but not yet glassy the blood on her cheeks was not yet brown her face was dark as plum from the constriction of the taut rope connecting her neck to her ankles scattered around her were a flute case sheet music and a spilled grande cup from starbucks the coffee staining her jeans and green izod shirt and leaving a comma of dark liquid on the marble floor also present was the man whod killed her bending down and examining her carefully he was taking his time and felt no urge to rush today was saturday the hour early there were no classes in the school on the weekends hed learned students did use the practice rooms but they were in a different wing of the building he leaned closer to the woman squinting wondering if he could see some essence some spirit rising from her body he didnt he straightened up considering what else he might do to the still form in front of him youre sure it was screaming yeahno the security guard said maybe not screaming you know shouting upset for just a second or two then it stopped officer diane franciscovich a portable working out of the twentieth precinct continued anybody else hear anything the heavy guard breathing hard glanced at the tall brunette policewoman shook his head and flexed and opened his huge hands he wiped his dark palms on his blue slacks call for backup asked nancy ausonio another young patrol officer shorter than her partner blonde franciscovich didnt think so though she wasnt sure portables walking the beat in this part of the upper west side dealt mostly with traffic accidents shoplifting and car theft as well as holding the hands of distraught muggees this was a first for them the two women officers on their saturday morning watch had been spotted on the sidewalk and motioned urgently inside by the guard to help check out the screaming well upset shouting lets hold off the calm franciscovich said see whats going on the guard said sounded like it was comin from round her somewhere dunno spooky place ausonio offered oddly uneasy she was the partner most likely to leap into the middle of a dispute even if it involved combatants twice her size the sounds you know hard to tell you know what im sayin where theyre coming from franciscovich was focusing on what her partner had said damn spooky place she added silently seeming miles of dim corridors later finding nothing out of the ordinary the security guard paused franciscovich nodded to a doorway in front of them whats through here be no reason for students tbe there its only franciscovich pushed the door open inside was a small lobby that led to a door labeled recital hall a and near that door was the body of a young woman trussed up rope around her neck hands in cuffs eyes open in death a brownhaired bearded man in his early fifties crouched over her he looked up surprised at their entry no ausonio cried oh christ the guard gasped the officers drew their weapons and franciscovich sighted down on the man with what she thought was a surprisingly steady hand you dont move stand up slow move away from her and put your hands in the air her voice was much less firm than the fingers gripping the glock pistol the man did as he was told lie facedown on floor keep your hands in sight ausonio started forward to the girl it was then franciscovich noticed that the mans right hand over his head was closed in a fist open your pop she went blind as a flash of searing light filled the room it seemed to come directly from the suspects hand and hovered for a moment before going out ausonio froze and franciscovich went into a crouch scrabbling backward and squinting swinging the gun back and forth panicked she knew the killer had kept his eyes shut when the flash went off and would be aiming his own weapon at them or charging forward with a knife where where where she shouted then she saw vaguely thanks to her frizzled vision and the dissipating smoke the killer running into the recital hall he slammed the door shut there was a thud inside as he moved a chair or table against the door ausonio dropped to her knees in front of the girl with a swiss army knife she cut the rope off her neck rolled her over and using a disposable mouthpiece started cpr any other exits franciscovich shouted to the guard only one in the back around the corner to the right windows no hey she called to ausonio as she started sprinting watch this door got it the blonde officer called and blew another breath into the victims pale lips more thuds from inside as the killer beefed up his barricade franciscovich sprinted around the corner toward the door the guard had told them about calling for backup on her motorola as she looked ahead she saw someone standing at the end of the corridor franciscovich stopped fast drew a target on the mans chest and shone the brilliant beam from her halogen flashlight on him lord croaked the elderly janitor dropping the broom he held franciscovich thanked god shed kept her finger outside the trigger guard of the glock you see somebody come out of that door whats going on you see anybody franciscovich shouted no maam how long you been here i dont know ten minutes id guess there was another thud of furniture from inside as the killer continued to blockade the door franciscovich sent the janitor into the main corridor with the security guard then eased up to the side door gun held high eye level she tested the knob gently it was unlocked she stepped to the side so she wouldnt be in the line of fire if the perp shot through the wood a trick she remembered from nypd blue though an instructor mightve mentioned it at the academy too another thump from inside nancy you there franciscovich whispered into her handytalkie ausonios voice shaky said shes dead diane i tried but shes dead he didnt get out this way hes still inside i can hear him silence i tried diane i tried forget it come on you on this you on it yeah im cool really the officers voice hardened lets go get him no franciscovich said well keep him contained till esu gets here thats all weve got to do sit tight stay clear of the door and sit tight which is when she heard the man shout from inside ive got a hostage ive got a girl in here try to get in and ill kill her oh jesus you inside franciscovich shouted nobodys going to do anything dont worry just dont hurt anybody else was this procedure she wondered neither primetime television nor her academy training was any help here she heard ausonio call central and report that the situation was now a barricade and hostagetaking franciscovich called to the killer just take it easy you can a huge gunshot from inside franciscovich jumped like a fish what happened was that you she shouted into her radio no her partner replied i thought it was you no it was him you okay yeah he said hes got a hostage you think he shot her i dont know how do i know franciscovich thinking where the hell is the backup diane ausonio whispered after a moment weve gotta go in maybe shes hurt maybe shes wounded then shouting you inside no answer you nothing maybe he killed himself franciscovich offered or maybe he fired the shot to make us think hed killed himself and hes waiting inside drawing a target guthigh on the doorway then that terrible image returned to her the seedy door to the recital lobby opening casting the pale light on the victim her face blue and cold as winter dusk stopping people from doing things like this was why shed become a cop in the first place we have to go in diane ausonio whispered thats what im thinking okay well go in speaking a bit manically as she thought of both her family and how to curl her left hand over her right when firing an automatic pistol in a combat shooting situation tell the guard well need lights inside the hall a moment later ausonio said the switch is out here hell turn em on when i say so a deep breath that franciscovich heard through the microphone then ausonio said ready on three you count it okay one wait ill be coming in from your two oclock dont shoot me okay two oclock ill be youll be on my left go ahead one franciscovich gripped the knob with her left hand two this time her finger slipped inside the guard of her weapon gently caressing the second trigger the safety on glock pistols three franciscovich shouted so loud that she was sure her partner heard the call without the radio she shoved through the doorway into the large rectangular room just as the glaring lights came on freeze she screamed to an empty room crouching skin humming with the tension she swung her weapon from side to side as she scanned every inch of the space no sign of the killer no sign of a hostage a glance to her left the other doorway where nancy ausonio stood doing the same frantic scan of the room where the woman whispered franciscovich shook her head she noticed about fifty wooden folding chairs arranged in neat rows four or five of them were lying on their backs or sides but they didnt seem to be a barricade they were randomly kicked over to her right was a low stage on it sat an amplifier and two speakers a battered grand piano the young officers could see virtually everything in the room except the perp what happened nancy tell me what happened ausonio didnt answer like her partner she was looking around frantically threesixty checking out every shadow every piece of furniture even though it was clear the man wasnt here spooky the room was essentially a sealed cube no windows the airconditioning and heating vents were only six inches across a wooden ceiling not acoustic tile no trapdoors that she could see no doors other than the main one ausonio had used and the fire door that franciscovich had entered through where franciscovich mouthed her partner mouthed something back the policewoman couldnt decipher it but the message could be read in her face i dont have a clue yo a loud voice called from the doorway they spun toward it drawing targets on the empty lobby ambulance and some other officers just got here it was the security guard hiding out of sight heart slamming from the fright franciscovich called him inside he asked is it uhm i mean you get him hes not here ausonio said in a shaky voice what the man peeked cautiously into the hall franciscovich heard the voices of the officers and ems techs arriving the jangle of equipment still the women couldnt bring themselves to join their fellow cops just yet they stood transfixed in the middle of the recital space both uneasy and bewildered trying vainly to figure out how the killer had escaped from a room from which there was no escape chapter two hes listening to music im not listening to music the music happens to be on thats all music huh lon sellitto muttered as he walked into lincoln rhymes bedroom thats a coincidence hes developed a taste for jazz thom explained to the paunchy detective surprised me i have to tell you as i said lincoln rhyme continued petulantly im working and the music happens to be playing in the background what do you mean coincidence nodding at the flatscreen monitor in front of rhymes flexicair bed the slim young aide dressed in a white shirt tan slacks and solid purple tie said no hes not working unless staring at the same page for an hour is work he wouldnt let me get away with work like that command turn page the computer recognized rhymes voice and obeyed his order slapping a new page of forensic science review onto the monitor he asked thom acerbically say you want to quiz me on what ive been staring at the composition of the top five exotic toxins found in recent terrorist laboratories in europe and how bout we put some money on the answers no we have other things to do the aide replied referring to the various bodily functions that caregivers must attend to several times a day when their patients are quadriplegics like lincoln rhyme well get to that in a few minutes the criminalist said enjoying a particularly energetic trumpet riff well get to that now if youll excuse us for a moment lon yeah sure large rumpled sellitto stepped into the corridor outside the secondfloor bedroom of rhymes central park west townhouse he closed the door as thom expertly performed his duties lincoln rhyme listened to the music and wondered coincidence five minutes later thom let sellitto back into the bedroom coffee yeah could use some too fucking early to work on a saturday the aide left so how do i look linc asked the pirouetting middleaged detective whose gray suit was typical of his wardrobe made apparently from permanently wrinkled cloth a fashion show rhyme asked coincidence then his mind slipped back to the cd how the hell does somebody play the trumpet so smoothly how can you get that kind of sound from a metal instrument the detective continued i lost sixteen pounds rachel has me on a diet fats the problem you cut out fat youd be amazed how much weight you can lose fat yes i think we knew that lon so meaning get to the point gotta bizarre case found a body a half hour ago at a music school up the street from here im case officer and we could use some help music school and im listening to music thats a pisspoor coincidence sellitto ran through some of the facts student killed the perp was nearly collared but he got away through some kind of trapdoor that nobody could find music was mathematical that much rhyme a scientist could understand it was logical it was perfectly structured it was also he reflected infinite an unlimited number of tunes could be written you could never be bored writing music he wondered how one went about it rhyme believed he had no creativity hed taken piano lessons when he was eleven or twelve but even though hed developed an enduring crush on miss osborne the lessons themselves were a writeoff his fondest memories of the instrument were taking stroboscopic pictures of the resonating strings for a sciencefair project you with me linc a case you were saying bizarre sellitto gave more of the details slowly corralling rhymes attention theres got to be some way outta the hall but nobody from the school or our team can find it hows the scene still pretty virgin can we get amelia to run it rhyme glanced at the clock shes tied up for another twenty minutes or so thats not a problem sellitto said patting his stomach as if he were searching for the lost weight ill page her lets not distract her just yet why whats she doing oh something dangerous rhyme said concentrating once more on the silken voice of the trumpet what else she smelled the wet brick of the tenement wall against her face her palms sweated and beneath the fiery red hair shoved up under her dusty issue hat her scalp itched fiercely still she remained completely motionless as a uniformed officer slipped up close beside her and planted his face against the brick too okay heres the situation the man said nodding toward their right he explained that just around the corner of the tenement was a vacant lot in the middle of which was a getaway car thatd crashed a few minutes ago after a highspeed pursuit drivable amelia sachs asked no hit a dumpster ands out of commission three perps they bailed but we got one in custody ones in the car with some kind of jesuslong hunting rifle he wounded a patrolman condition superficial pinned down no out of the perimeter one building west of here she asked the third perp the officer sighed hell he made it to the first floor of this building here nodding toward the tenement they were hugging its a barricade hes got a hostage pregnant woman sachs digested the flood of information as she shifted her weight from one foot to the other to ease the pain of the arthritis in her joints damn that hurt she noticed her companions name on his chest the hostagetakers weapon wilkins handgun unknown type wheres our side the young man pointed out two officers behind a wall at the back of the lot then two more in front of the building containing the ht anybody call esu i dont know i lost my handytalkie when we started taking fire you in armor negative i was doing traffic stops what the hellre we going to do she clicked her motorola to a particular frequency and said crime scene five eight eight five to supervisor a moment later this is captain seven four go ahead tenthirteen at a lot east of sixohfive delancey officer down need backup ems bus and esu immediately two subjects both armed one with hostage well need a negotiator roger five eight eight five helicopter for observation negative seven four one suspect has a highpowered rifle and theyre willing to target blues well get backup there as soon as we can but the secret services closed up half of downtown cause the vice presidents coming in from jfk therell be a delay handle the situation at your discretion out roger out vice president she thought just lost my vote wilkins shook his head but we cant get a negotiator near the apartment not with the shooter still in the car im working on that sachs replied she edged to the corner of the tenement again and glanced at the car a cheap lowrider with its nose against a dumpster doors open revealing a thin man holding a rifle im working on that she shouted you in the car youre surrounded were going to open fire if you dont drop your weapon do it now he crouched and aimed in her direction she ducked for cover on her motorola she called the two officers in the back of the lot are there hostages in the car none youre sure positive was the officers reply we got a good look before he started shooting okay you got a shot probably through the door no dont shoot blind go for position but only if youve got cover all the way roger she saw the men move to a flanking position a moment later one of the officers said ive got a shot to kill should i take it stand by then she shouted you in the car with the rifle you have ten seconds or well open fire drop your weapon you understand she repeated this in spanish fuck you which she took to be affirmative ten seconds she shouted were counting to the two officers she radioed give him twenty then youre greenlighted at close to the tensecond mark the man dropped the rifle and stood up hands in the air no shoot no shoot keep those hands straight up in the air walk toward the corner of the building here if you lower your hands you will be shot when he got to the corner wilkins cuffed and searched him sachs remained crouched down she said to the suspect the guy inside your buddy who is he i dont gotta tell you yeah you do gotta because if we take him out which we are going to do youll go down for felony murder now is that man in there worth fortyfive years in ossining the man sighed come on she snapped name address family what he likes for dinner whats his mothers first name he have relatives in the system you can think of all kinds of real helpful stuff about him ill bet he sighed and started to talk sachs scribbled down the details her motorola crackled the hostage negotiator and the esu team had just showed up in front of the building she handed her notes to wilkins get those to the negotiator she read the rifleman his rights thinking had she handled the situation the best way she could had she endangered lives unnecessarily should she have checked on the wounded officer herself five minutes later the supervising captain walked around the corner of the building he smiled the ht released the woman no injuries weve got three collared the wounded officerll be okay just a scratch a policewoman with short blond hair poking out from under her regulation hat joined them hey check it out we got a bonus she held up a large baggie full of white powder and another containing pipes and other drug paraphernalia as the captain looked it over nodding with approval sachs asked that was in their car naw i found it in a ford across the street i was interviewing the owner as a witness and he started sweating and looking all nervous so i searched his car where was it parked sachs asked in his garage did you call in a warrant no like i say he was acting nervous and i could see a corner of the bag from the sidewalk thats probable cause nope sachs was shaking her head its an illegal search illegal we pulled this guy over last week for speeding and saw a kilo of pot in the back we busted him okay its different on the street theres a lesser expectation of privacy in a mobile vehicle on public roads all you need for an arrest then is probable cause when a cars on private property even if you see drugs you need a warrant thats crazy the policewoman said defensively hes got ten ounces of pure coke here hes a ballsforward dealer narcotics spends months trying to collar somebody like this the captain said to sachs you sure about this officer positive recommendation sachs said confiscate the stuff put the fear of god into the perp and give his tag number and stats to narcotics then she glanced at the policewoman and you better take a refresher course in search and seizure the woman officer started to argue but sachs wasnt paying attention she was surveying the vacant lot where the perps car rested against the dumpster she squinted at the vehicle officer the captain began she ignored him and said to wilkins you said three perps thats right how do you know that was the report from the jewelry store they hit she stepped into the rubblefilled lot pulling out her glock look at the getaway car she snapped jesus wilkins said all the doors were open four men had bailed dropping into a crouch she scanned the lot and aimed her gun toward the only possible hiding place nearby a short culdesac behind the dumpster weapon she cried almost before she saw the motion everyone around her turned as the large tshirted man with a shotgun jogged out of the lot making a run for the street sachss glock was centered on his chest as he broke cover drop the weapon she ordered he hesitated a moment then grinned and began to swing it toward the officers she pushed her glock forward and in a cheerful voice she said bang bang youre dead the shotgunner stopped and laughed he shook his head in admiration damn good i thought i was home free the stubby gun over his shoulder he strolled to the cluster of fellow cops beside the tenement the other suspect the man whod been in the car turned his back so that the cuffs could be removed wilkins released him the hostage played by a very unpregnant latina officer sachs had known for years joined them too she clapped sachs on the back nice work amelia saving my ass sachs kept a solemn face though she was pleased she felt like a student whod just aced an important exam which was in effect exactly what had happened amelia sachs was pursuing a new goal her father herman had been a portable a beat cop in the patrol services division all his life sachs now had the same rank and mightve been content to remain there for another few years before moving up in the department but after the september attacks shed decided she wanted to do more for her city so shed submitted the paperwork to be promoted to detective sergeant no group of law enforcers has fought crime like nypd detectives their tradition went back to tough brilliant inspector thomas byrnes named to head up the fledgling detective bureau in the s byrness arsenal included threats headknocking and subtle deductions he once broke a major theft ring by tracing a tiny fiber found at a crime scene under byrness flamboyant guidance the detectives in the bureau became known as the immortals and they dramatically reduced the level of crime in a city as freewheeling back then as the wild west officer herman sachs was a collector of police department memorabilia and not long before he died he gave his daughter one of his favorite artifacts a battered notebook actually used by byrnes to jot notes about investigations when sachs was young and her mother wasnt around her father would read aloud the more legible passages and the two of them would make up stories around them october the other leg has been found slaggardys coal bin five pts expect cotton williamss confession forthwith given its prestigious status and lucrative pay for law enforcement it was ironic that women found more opportunities in the detective bureau than in any other division of the nypd if thomas byrnes was the male detective icon mary shanley was the female and one of sachss personal heroines busting crime throughout the s shanley was a boisterous uncompromising cop who once said you have the gun to use and you may as well use it which she did with some frequency after years of combating crime in midtown she retired as a detective firstgrade sachs however wanted to be more than a detective which is just a job specialty she wanted rank too in the nypd as in most police forces one becomes a detective on the basis of merit and experience to become a sergeant though the applicant goes through an arduous triathlon of exams written oral and what sachs had just endured an assessment exercise a simulation to test practical skills at personnel management community sensitivities and judgment under fire the captain a softspoken veteran who resembled laurence fishburne was the primary assessor for the exercise and had been taking notes on her performance okay officer he said well write up our results and theyll be attached to your review but let me just say a word unofficially consulting his notebook your threat assessment regarding civilians and officers was perfect calls for backup were timely and appropriate your deployment of personnel negated any chance the perpetrators would escape from the containment situation and yet minimized exposure you called the illegal drug search right and getting the personal information from the one suspect for the hostage negotiator was a nice touch we didnt think about making that part of the exercise but we will now then at the end well frankly we never thought youd determine there was another perp in hiding we had it planned that hed shoot officer wilkins here and then wed see how youd handle an officerdown situation and organize a fleeing felon apprehension the officialese vanished and he smiled but you nailed the bastard bang bang then he asked youve done the written and orals right yessir should have the results any day now my groupll complete our assessment evaluation and send that to the board with our recommendations you can stand down now yessir the cop whod played the last bad guy the one with the shotgun wandered up to her he was a goodlooking italian half a generation out of the brooklyn docks she judged and had a boxers muscles a dirty stubble of beard covered his cheeks and chin he wore a bigbore chrome automatic high on his trim hip and his cocky smile brought her close to suggesting he might want to use the guns reflection as a mirror to shave i gotta tell ya ive done a dozen assessments and that was the best i ever seen babe she laughed in surprise at the word there were certainly cavemen left in the department from patrol services to corner offices at police plaza but they tended to be more condescending than openly sexist sachs hadnt heard a babe or honey from a male cop in at least a year lets stick with officer you dont mind no no no he said laughing you can chill now the aes over hows that when i said babe its not like its a part of the assessment you dont have to you know deal with it official or anything im just saying it cause i was impressed and cause youre you know he smiled into her eyes his charm as shiny as his pistol i dont do compliments much coming from me thats something cause youre you know hey youre not pissed or anything are you he asked not pissed at all but its still officer thats what you call me and what ill call you at least to your face hey i didnt mean any offense or anything youre a pretty girl and im a guy you know what thats like so so she replied and started away he stepped in front of her frowning hey hold on this isnt going too good look let me buy you a coffee youll like me when you get to know me dont bet on it one of his buddies called laughing the babe man goodnaturedly gave him the finger then turned back to sachs which is when her pager beeped and she looked down to see lincoln rhymes number on the screen the word urgent appeared after it gotta go she said so no time for that coffee he asked a fake pout on his handsome face no time well how bout a phone number she made a pistol with her index finger and thumb and aimed it at him bang bang she said and trotted toward her yellow camaro chapter three this is a school wheeling a large black crimescene suitcase behind her amelia sachs walked through the dim corridor she smelled mold and old wood dusty webs had coagulated near the high ceiling and scales of green paint curled from the walls how could anybody study music here it was a setting for one of the anne rice novels that sachss mother read spooky one of the responding officers had muttered only half jokingly that said it all a halfdozen cops four patrol officers and two in soft clothes stood near a double doorway at the end of the hall disheveled lon sellitto head down and hand clutching one of his notepads was talking to a guard like the walls and floors the guards outfit was dusty and stained through the open doorway she glimpsed another dim space in the middle of which was a lightcolored form the victim to the cs tech walking beside her she said well need lights a couple of sets the young man nodded and headed back to the rrv the crime scene rapid response vehicle a station wagon filled with forensic collection equipment it sat outside half on the sidewalk where hed parked it after the drive here probably at a more leisurely pace than sachs in her camaro ss which had averaged mph en route to the school from the assessment exercise sachs studied the young blonde woman lying on her back ten feet away belly arched up because her bound hands were underneath her even in the dimness of the school lobby sachss quick eyes noted the deep ligature marks on her neck and the blood on her lips and chin probably from biting her tongue a common occurrence in strangulations automatically she also observed emeraldcolored studs for earrings shabby running shoes no apparent robbery sexual molestation or mutilation no wedding ring who was first officer a tall woman with short brunette hair her name tag reading d franciscovich said we were a nod toward her blonde partner n ausonio their eyes were troubled and franciscovich played a brief rhythm on her holster with thumb and fingers ausonio kept glancing at the body sachs guessed this was their first homicide the two patrol officers gave their account of what had happened finding the perp a flash of light his disappearing a barricade then he was gone you said he claimed to have a hostage thats what he said ausonio offered but everybody in the schools accounted for were sure he was bluffing victim svetlana rasnikov ausonio said twentyfour student sellitto turned away from the security guard he said to sachs bedding and saulre interviewing everybody in the building here this morning she nodded toward the scene whos been inside sellitto said the first officers nodding toward the women then two medics and two esu they backed out as soon as they cleared it scenes still pretty clean the guard was inside too ausonio said but only for a minute we got him out as soon as we could good sachs said witnesses ausonio said there was a janitor outside the room when we got here he didnt see anything franciscovich added sachs said i still need to see the soles of his shoes for comparison could one of you find him for me sure ausonio wandered off from one of the black suitcases sachs extracted a zippered clear plastic case she opened it and pulled out a white tyvek jumpsuit donning it she pulled the hood over her head then gloves the outfit was standard issue now for all forensics techs at the nypd it prevented substances trace hair epithelial skin cells and foreign matter from sloughing off her body and contaminating the scene the suit had booties but she still did what rhyme always insisted on put rubber bands on her feet to distinguish her prints from the victims and the perps mounting the earphones on her head and adjusting the stalk mike she hooked up her motorola she called in a landline patch and a moment later a complex arrangement of communications systems brought the low voice of lincoln rhyme into her ear sachs you there yep it was just like you said they had him cornered and he disappeared he chuckled and now they want us to find him do we have to clean up for everybodys mistakes hold on a minute command volume lower lower music in the background diminished the tech whod accompanied sachs down the gloomy corridor returned with tall lamps on tripods she set them up in the lobby and clicked the switch theres a lot of debate about the proper way to process a scene generally investigators agree that less is more though most departments still use teams of cs searchers before his accident lincoln rhyme however had run most scenes alone and he insisted that amelia sachs do the same with other searchers around you tend to be distracted and are often less vigilant because you feel even if only subconsciously that your partner will find what you miss but there was another reason for solitary searching rhyme recognized that theres a macabre intimacy about criminal violation a crime scene searcher working alone is better able to forge a mental relationship with the victim and the perpetrator gather better insights into what is the relevant evidence and where it might be found it was into this difficult state of mind that amelia sachs now slipped as she gazed at the body of the young woman lying on the floor next to a fiberboard table near the body were a spilled cup of coffee sheet music a music case and a piece of the womans silver flute which shed apparently been in the act of assembling when the killer flipped the rope around her neck in her death grip she clutched another cylinder of the instrument had she intended to use it as a weapon or did the desperate young woman just want to feel something familiar and comforting in her fingers as she died im at the body rhyme she said as she snapped digital pictures of the corpse go ahead shes on her back but the respondings found her on her abdomen they turned her over to give her cpr injuries consistent with strangulation sachs now delicately rolled the woman back onto her belly handsre in some kind of oldfashioned cuffs i dont recognize them her watch is broken stopped at exactly eight a m doesnt look accidental she closed her gloved hand around the womans narrow wrist it was shattered yep rhyme he stomped on it and its nice a seiko why break it why not steal it good question sachs might be a clue might be nothing which was as good a slogan for forensic science as any she reflected one of the respondings cut the rope around her neck she missed the knot officers should never cut through the knot to remove a cord from a strangulation victim it can reveal a great deal of information about the person who tied it sachs then used a tape roller to collect trace evidence recent forensic thinking was that a portable vacuum cleaner which resembled a dustbuster picked up too much trace most cs teams were switching to rollers similar to doghair removers she bagged the trace and used a vic kit to take hair combings and nail scraping samples from the womans body sachs said im going to walk the grid the phrase of lincoln rhymes own creation came from his preference for searching a crime scene the grid pattern is the most comprehensive method back and forth in one direction then turning perpendicular and covering the same ground again always remembering to examine the ceiling and walls as well as the ground or floor she began the search now looking for discarded or dropped objects rolling for trace taking electrostatic prints of shoeprints and digital photos the photo team would make a comprehensive still and video record of the scene but getting those images took time and rhyme always insisted on having some photographic record available instantly officer sellitto called she glanced back just wondering since we dont know where this asshole got to you want some backup in there nope she said silently thanking him for reminding her that there was a missing murderer last seen nearby another of lincoln rhymes crimescene aphorisms search well but watch your back she tapped the butt of her glock to remind herself exactly where it was in case she needed to draw fast the holster rode slightly higher when she wore the tyvek jumpsuit and continued the search okay got something she told rhyme a moment later in the lobby about ten feet away from the victim piece of black cloth silk i mean it appears to be silk its on top of a part of the vics flute so it has to be his or hers interesting rhyme mused wonder what thats about the lobby yielded nothing else and she entered the performance space itself her hand continuing to stray to the butt of her glock she relaxed momentarily seeing that there was in fact absolutely no hiding place where a perp could be no secret doorways or exits but as she started on the grid here she felt a growing sense of discomfort spooky rhyme this is strange i cant hear you sachs she realized that in her uneasiness shed been whispering theres burned string tied around the chairs thatre lying on the ground fuses too it looks like i smell nitrate and sulfur residue the reportings said he fired a round but its not the smell of smokeless powder its something else ah okay its a little gray firecracker maybe that was the gunshot they heard hold on theres something else under a chair its a small green circuit board with a speaker attached to it small rhyme asked caustically a foot is small compared with an acre an acres small compared with a hundred acres sachs sorry measures about two inches by five thatd be big compared with a dime now wouldnt it got the message thank you very much she replied silently she bagged everything then left by the second door the fire door and electrostaticked and photographed the footprints she found there finally she took control samples to compare against the trace found on the victim and where the unsub had walked got everything rhyme ill be back in a half hour and the trapdoors the secret passages everybodys talking about i cant find any all right come on home sachs she returned to the lobby and let photo and latents take over the scene she found franciscovich and ausonio by the doorway you find the janitor she asked i need to look at his shoes ausonio shook her head he told the guard he had to take his wife to work i left a message with maintenance for him to call her partner said solemnly hey officer we were talking nancy and me and we dont want this scumbag to get away if theres anything more we can do you know to follow up let us know sachs understood exactly how they felt ill see what i can do she told them sellittos radio crackled and he took the call listened for a moment its the hardy boys theyve finished interviewing the wits andre in the main lobby sachs sellitto and the two patrolwomen returned to the front of the school there they joined bedding and saul one of them tall one short one with freckles one with a clear complexion these were detectives from the big building who specialized in canvassing postcrime interviewing of witnesses we talked to the seven people here this morning plus the guard no teachers only students also called the twins despite very different appearances the duo were skilled at doubleteaming perps and witnesses alike it got too confusing if you tried to tell them apart lump them together and consider them one person they were a lot easier to understand the information was not the most illuminating for one thing everybody was freaked out the locations not helping a nod toward a wad of cobwebs hanging from the dark waterstained ceiling nobody knew the victim very well when she got here this morning she walked to the recital room with a friend she the friend didnt see anybody inside they stood in the lobby for five ten minutes talking the friend left around eight so said rhyme whod overheard on the radio he was inside the lobby waiting for her the victim the shorter of the two sandyhaired detectives said had come over here from georgia thats the russia georgia not the peachtree georgia about two months ago she was kind of a loner the consulates contacting her family all the other students were in different practice rooms today and none of them heard anything or saw anybody they didnt know why wasnt svetlana in a practice room sachs asked her friend said svetlana liked the acoustics better in the hall husband boyfriend girlfriend sachs asked thinking of rule number one in homicide investigations the doer usually knows the doee none that the other students knew howd he get into the building rhyme asked and sachs relayed the question the guard said only doors open is the front one we got fire doors course but you cant open them from the outside and hed have to walk past you right and sign in and get his picture took by the camera sachs glanced up theres a security camera rhyme but it looks like the lens hasnt been cleaned in months they gathered behind the desk the guard punched buttons and played the tape bedding and saul had vetted seven of the people but they agreed that one person a brownhaired bearded older man in jeans and bulky jacket hadnt been among those theyd talked to thats him franciscovich said thats the killer nancy ausonio nodded on the fuzzy tape he was signing the register book then walking inside the guard glanced at the book but not at the mans face as he signed it did you get a look at him sachs asked didnt pay no attention he said defensively if they sign i let them in thats all i gotta do thats my job im here mostly to keep folk from walking out with our stuff weve got his signature at least rhyme and a name theyll be fake but at least its a handwriting sample which line did he sign on sachs asked picking up the signin book with latexclad fingers they ran the tape fastforward from the beginning the killer was the fourth person to sign the book but in the fourth slot was a womans name rhyme called count all the people who signed sachs told the guard to do so and they watched nine people fill in their names eight students including the victim and her killer nine people sign rhyme but there are only eight names on the list howd that happen sellitto asked rhyme ask the guard if hes sure the perp signed maybe he faked it she put the question to the placid man yeah he did i saw it i dont always look at their faces but i make sure they sign thats all i gotta do thats my job sachs shook her head and dug into the cuticle of her thumb with another nail well bring me the signin book with everything else and well have a look at it here rhyme said in the corner of the room a young asian woman stood hugging herself and looking out the uneven leaded glass she turned and looked at sachs i heard you talking you said i mean it sounded like you didnt know if he got out of the building after he afterward you think hes still here no i dont sachs said i just meant were not sure how he escaped but if you dont know that then it means he could still be hiding here somewhere waiting for somebody else and you dont have any idea where he is sachs gave her a reassuring smile well have plenty of officers around until we get to the bottom of what happened you dont have to worry though she was thinking the girl was absolutely right yes he could be here waiting for somebody else and no we dont have a clue who or where he is chapter four and now revered audience well take a short intermission enjoy the memory of the lazy hangman and relish the anticipation of whats coming up soon relax our next act will begin shortly the man walked along broadway on the upper west side of manhattan when he reached one street corner he stopped as if hed forgotten something and stepped into the shadow of a building he pulled his cell phone off his belt and lifted it to his ear as he spoke smiling from time to time the way people do on mobiles he gazed around him casually also a common practice for cellphone users he was not however actually making a call he was looking for any sign that hed been followed from the music school malericks present appearance was very different from his incarnation when hed escaped from the school earlier that morning he was now blond and beardless and wearing a jogging outfit with a highnecked athletic shirt had passersby been looking they might have noticed a few oddities in his physique leathery scar tissue peeked over the top of his collar and along his neck and two fingers little and ring of his left hand were fused together but no one was looking because his gestures and expressions were natural and as all illusionists know acting naturally makes you invisible finally content that he hadnt been followed he resumed his casual gait turning the corner down a cross street and continued along the treelined sidewalk to his apartment around him were only a few joggers and two or three locals returning home with the times and zabars bags looking forward to coffee a leisurely hour with the newspaper and perhaps some unhurried weekendmorning sex malerick walked up the stairs to the apartment hed rented here a few months ago a dark quiet building very different from his house and workshop in the desert outside las vegas he made his way to the apartment in the back as i was saying our next act will begin shortly for now revered audience gossip about the illusion youve just seen enjoy some conversation with those around you try to guess whats next on the bill our second routine will involve very different skills to test our performer but will be i assure you every bit as compelling as the lazy hangman these words and dozens more looped automatically through malericks mind revered audience he spoke to this imaginary assembly constantly he sometimes heard their applause and shouts of laughter and occasionally gasps of horror a white noise of words in that broad theatrical intonation a greasepainted ringmaster or a victorian illusionist would use patter it was called a monologue directed to the audience to give them information they need to know to make a trick work to build rapport with the audience and to disarm and distract them too after the fire malerick cut off most contact with fellow human beings and his imagined revered audience slowly replaced them becoming his constant companions the patter soon began to fill his waking thoughts and dreams and threatened he sometimes felt to drive him completely insane at the same time though it gave him intense comfort knowing that he hadnt been left completely alone in life after the tragedy three years ago his revered audience was always with him the apartment smelled of cheap varnish and a curious meaty aroma rising from the wallpaper and floors the place had come lightly furnished inexpensive couches and armchairs a functional diningroom table currently set for one the bedrooms on the other hand were packed filled with the tools of the illusionists trade props rigs ropes costumes latex molding equipment wigs bolts of cloth a sewing machine paints squibs makeup circuit boards wires batteries flash paper and cotton spools of fuse woodworking tools a hundred other items he made herbal tea and sat at the diningroom table sipping the weak beverage and eating fruit and a lowfat granola bar illusion is a physical art and ones act is only as good as ones body eating healthy food and working out were vital to success he was pleased with this mornings act hed killed the first performer easily recalling with shivery pleasure how shed stiffened with shock when hed appeared behind her and slipped the rope around her neck never a clue hed been waiting in the corner under the black silk for a half hour the surprise entrance by the police well thatd shaken him but like all good illusionists malerick had prepared an out which hed executed perfectly he finished his breakfast and took the cup into the kitchen washed it carefully and set it in a rack to dry he was meticulous in all his ways his mentor a fierce obsessive humorless illusionist had beaten discipline into him the man now went into the larger of the bedrooms and put on the videotape hed made of the site of the next performance hed seen this tape a dozen times and though he virtually had it memorized he was now going to study it again his mentor had also beaten into him literally sometimes the importance of the rule you rehearse one hundred minutes for every one minute onstage as he watched the tape he pulled a velvetcovered performing table toward him not watching his hands malerick practiced some simple card maneuvers the false dovetail shuffle the threepile false cut then some trickier ones the reverse sliparound the glide and the dealoff force he ran through some actual tricks complicated ones like stanley palms ghost cards maldos famous sixcard mystery and several others by the famous card master and actor ricky jay others by cardini malerick also did some of the card tricks that had been in harry houdinis early repertoire most people think of houdini as an escapist but the performer had actually been a wellrounded magician who performed illusion largescale stage tricks like vanishing assistants and elephants as well as parlor magic houdini had been an important influence in his life when he first started performing in his teens malerick used as a performing name young houdini the erick portion of his present name was both a remnant of his former life his life before the fire and an homage to houdini himself whod been born ehrich weisz as for the prefix mal a magician might suspect that it was taken from another worldfamous performer max breit who performed under the name malini but in fact malerick had picked the three letters because they came from the latin root for evil which reflected the dark nature of his brand of illusion he now studied the tape measuring angles noting windows and the location of possible witnesses blocking out his positions as all good performers do and as he watched the cards in his fingers riffled together in lightningfast shuffles that hissed like snakes the kings and jacks and queens and jokers and all the rest of the cards slithered onto the black velvet and then seemed to defy gravity as they leaped back into his strong hands where they vanished from sight watching this impromptu performance an audience would shake their heads halfconvinced that reality had given way to delusion that a human being couldnt possibly do what they were observing but the truth was the opposite the card tricks malerick was now performing absently on the plush black cloth were not miraculous at all they were merely carefully rehearsed exercises in dexterity and perception governed by mundane rules of physics oh yes revered audience what youve seen and what youre about to see are very real as real as fire burning flesh as real as a rope knotted around a young girls white neck as real as the circuit of the clock hands moving slowly toward the horror that our next performer is about to experience hey there the young woman sat down beside the bed where her mother lay out the window in the manicured courtyard she saw a tall oak tree on the trunk of which grew a tentacle of ivy in a shape that shed had interpreted a number of ways over the past months today the anemic vine wasnt a dragon or a flock of birds or a soldier it was simply a city plant struggling to survive so how you feeling mum kara asked the appellation grew out of one of the familys many vacations this one to england kara had given them all nicknames his kingness and the queenly mum for her parents she herself had been the royal kid just fine darling and hows life treating you better than some not as good as others hey you like kara held up her hand to show off her short evenly filed fingernails which were black as a grand pianos finish lovely darling i was getting a bit tired of the pink you see it everywhere nowadays awfully conventional kara stood and adjusted the down pillow under her mothers head then sat again and sipped from the large starbucks container coffee was her sole drug but the addiction was intense not to mention expensive and this was her third cup of the morning her hair was cut in a boyish style currently colored auburnpurple having been pretty much every color of the spectrum at some point in her years in new york city pixieish some people said of the cut a description she hated kara herself described the do simply as convenient she could be out her door minutes after stepping from the shower a true benefit for someone who tended not to get to bed before a m and who was definitely not a morning person today she wore black stretch pants and though she was not much over five feet flat shoes her dark purple top was sleeveless and revealed taut cut muscles kara had attended a college where art and politics took precedence over the cult of the physique but after graduating from sarah lawrence shed joined golds gym and was now a regular weightpumper and treadmill runner one would expect an eightyear resident of bohemian greenwich village hovering somewhere in her late twenties to dabble in body art or to sport at least a latent ring or stud but karas very white skin was tattoofree and unpierced now check this out mum ive got a show tomorrow one of mr balzacs little things you know i remember but this time its different this time hes letting me go on solo im warmup and main bill rolled into one really honey true as toast outside the doorway mr geldter shuffled past hello there kara nodded at him she recalled that when her mother had first come to stuyvesant manor one of the citys best aging facilities the woman and the widower had caused quite a stir they think were shacking up shed told her daughter in a whisper are you kara had asked thinking it was about time her mother struck up a relationship with a man after five years of widowhood of course not her mother had hissed truly angry what a thing to suggest the incident defined the woman perfectly a hint of the bawdy was fine but there was a very clear line established arbitrarily past which you would become the enemy even if you were her flesh and blood kara continued rocking forward excitedly and telling her mother in an animated way about what she planned for tomorrow as she spoke she studied her mother closely the skin oddly smooth for a woman in her midseventies and as healthy pink as a crying babys hair mostly gray but with plenty of defiant wiry black strands scattered throughout the staff beautician had done it up in a stylish bun anyway mum some friendsll be there and itd be great if you could come too ill try kara now sitting on the very edge of the armchair realized suddenly that her fists were clenched her body a knot of tension her breath was coming in shallow sibilant gasps ill try kara closed her eyes filling with slivers of tears goddamnit ill try no no no thats all wrong she thought angrily her mother wouldnt say ill try that wasnt her sort of dialogue it might be ill be there hons in the first row or shed say frostily well i cant tomorrow you shouldve let me know earlier whatever else about her mother there was nothing illtry about her ballsout for you or helltopay against except now when the woman was hardly a human being at all at most a child sleeping with her eyes open the conversation kara had just had with the woman had occurred only in the girls hopeful imagination well karas portion had been real but her mothers from the just fine darling and hows life treating you to the glitch of ill try had been ginned up by kara herself no her mother hadnt said a single word today or during yesterdays visit or the one before shed lain beside the ivy window in some kind of waking coma some days she was like that on others the woman might be fully awake but babbling scary nonsense that only attested to the success of the invisible army moving relentlessly through her brain torching memory and reason but there was a more pernicious part of the tragedy once in a rare while thered be a fragile moment of clarity which brief though it was perfectly negated her despair just when kara had come to accept the worst that the mother she knew was gone forever the woman would return just like in the days before the cerebral hemorrhage and karas defenses vanished the same way an abused woman forgives her slugging husband at the slightest hint of contrition at moments like that shed convince herself that her mother was improving the doctors said that there was virtually no hope for this of course still the doctors hadnt been at her mothers bedside when several months ago the woman woke up and turned suddenly to kara hi there hons i ate those cookies you brought me yesterday you put in extra pecans the way i like them and heck with the calories a girlish smile oh im glad youre here i wanted to tell you what mrs brandon did last night with the remote control kara had blinked stunned because damn she had brought her mother pecan sandies the day before and had stocked them with extra nuts and yes crazy mrs brandon from the fifth floor had copped a remote and bounced the signal off the windows next door into the nursing homes lounge confounding the residents for a half hour by changing channels and volume like a poltergeist there who needed better evidence than this that her vibrant mother her real mother remained within the injured shell of a body and could someday escape but the next day kara had found the woman staring at her daughter suspiciously asking why she was there and what she wanted if this was about the electric bill for twentytwo dollars and fifteen cents shed paid it and had the canceled check for proof since the pecansandy remotecontrol performance thered been no encores kara now touched her mothers arm warm wrinklefree baby pink sensing what she always did here on her daily visits the numbing trilogy of wishing that the woman would mercifully die wishing that shed come back to her vibrant life and wishing that kara herself could escape from the terrible burden of wanting both of those irreconcilable choices a glance at her watch late for work as always mr balzac would not be happy saturday was their busiest day she drained the coffee cup pitched it out and walked into the hallway a large black woman in a white uniform lifted a hand in greeting kara how long you been here a broad smile in a broad face twenty minutes i wouldve come by and visited jaynene said she still awake no she was out when i got here oh im sorry was she talking before kara asked yep just little things couldnt tell if she was with us or not seemed like it this is some gorgeous day hm sephie and me were gonna take her walking in the courtyard later if shes awake she likes it she always does better after that ive gotta get to work kara told the nurse hey im doing a show tomorrow at the store remember where it is sure do what time four come on by im off early tomorrow ill be there well drink some more of those peach margaritas after like last time thatll work kara replied hey bring pete the woman scowled girl nothing personal but thonly way that manll see you on sunday is if youre playing the halftime show for the knicks or the lakers an its on network tv kara said from your mouth to gods ear chapter five one hundred years ago a moderately successful financier mightve called this place home or the owner of a small haberdashery in the luxurious shopping neighborhood of fourteenth street or possibly a politician connected with tammany hall savvy in the timeless art of growing rich through public office the present owner of the central park west townhouse however didnt know or care about its provenance nor would the victorian furnishings or subdued fin de siècle objets dart that had once graced these rooms appeal to lincoln rhyme at all he enjoyed what surrounded him now a disarray of sturdy tables swivel stools computers scientific devices a density gradient rack a gas chromatographmass spectrometer microscopes plastic boxes in myriad colors beakers jars thermometers propane tanks goggles latched black or gray cases of odd shapes which suggested they contained esoteric musical instruments and wires wires and cables everywhere covering much of the limited square footage of the room some tidily coiled and connecting adjacent pieces of machinery some disappearing through ragged holes shamefully cut into the hardearned smoothness of centuryold plasterandlath walls lincoln rhyme himself was largely wireless now advances in infrared and radio technology had linked a microphone on his wheelchair and on his bed upstairs to environmental control units and computers he drove his storm arrow with his left ring finger on an mkiv touchpad but all the other commands from phone calls to email to slapping the image from his compound microscope onto computer monitors could be accomplished by using his voice it could also control his new harmon kardon receiver which was currently piping a pleasant jazz solo through the lab control stereo off rhyme reluctantly ordered hearing the front door slam the music went silent replaced by the erratic beat of footsteps in the front hall and the parlor one of the visitors was amelia sachs he knew for a tall woman she had a decidedly light footfall then he heard the distinctive clump of lon sellittos big perpetually outturned feet sachs he muttered as she entered the room was it a big scene was it huge not so big she frowned at the question why his eyes were on the gray milk crates containing evidence she and several other officers carried i was just wondering because it seemed to take a long time to search the scene and get back here it is okay for you to use that flashing light on your car thats why they make them you know sirens are allowed too when rhyme was bored he grew testy boredom was the biggest evil in his life sachs however was impervious to his sourness she seemed in a particularly good mood and said merely weve got ourselves some mysteries here rhyme he recalled that sellitto had used the word bizarre about the killing give me the scenario what happened sachs offered a likely account of the events culminating in the perps escape from the recital hall the respondings heard a shot inside the hall then they did a kickin timed it together went in through the only two doors in the room he was gone sellitto consulted his notes the patrol officers put him in his fifties medium height medium build no distinguishings other than a beard brown hair there was a janitor who says he didnt see anybody go in or out of the room but maybe he got witnessitis you know the schools gonna call with his name and number ill see if i can refresh his memory what about the vic what was the motive sachs said no sexual assault no robbery sellitto added just talked to the twins she hasnt got any present or recent boyfriends nobody in the past thatd be a problem she was a fulltime student rhyme asked or did she work fulltime student yeah but apparently she did some performing on the side theyre finding out where rhyme recruited his aide thom to act as a scribe as he often did jotting down the evidence in his elegant handwriting on one of the large whiteboards in the lab the aide took the marker and began to write there was a knock on the door and thom disappeared momentarily from the lab incoming visitor he called from the hallway visitor rhyme asked hardly in the mood for company the aide though was being playful into the room walked mel cooper the slim balding lab technician whom rhyme thenhead of nypd forensics had met some years ago on a joint burglarykidnapping case with an upstate new york police department cooper had disputed rhymes analysis of a particular type of soil and had been right it turned out impressed rhyme had dug into the techs credentials and found that like rhyme he was an active and highly respected member of the international association for identification experts at identifying individuals from friction ridges dna forensic reconstruction and dental remains with degrees in math physics and organic chemistry cooper was also topnotch at physicalevidence analysis rhyme mounted a campaign to get the man to return to the city where hed been born and he finally agreed the softspoken forensic techchampion ballroom dancer was based in the nypd crime lab in queens but he often worked with rhyme when the criminalist was consulting on an active case greetings all around and then cooper shoved his thick harry potterstyle glasses high on his nose and squinted a critical eye at the crates of evidence like a chess player sizing up his opponent what do we have here mysteries rhyme said to use our sachss assessment mysteries well lets see if we cant make them a little less mysterious sellitto ran through the scenario of the killing for cooper as he donned latex gloves and began looking over the bags and jars rhyme wheeled up close to him there he nodded whats that he was gazing at the green circuit board with a speaker attached the board i found in the recital hall sachs said no idea what it is only that the unsub put it there i could tell by his footprints it looked like itd come from a computer which didnt surprise rhyme criminals have always been in the forefront of technological development bank robbers armed themselves with the famous colt semiautomatic pistols within days of their release even though it was illegal for anyone but the military to possess one radios scrambled phones machine guns laser sights gps cellular technology surveillance equipment and computer encryption ended up in the arsenal of criminals often before they were added to law enforcers rhyme was the first to admit that some subjects were beyond his realm of expertise clues like computers cell phones and this curious device all of which he called nasdaq evidence he farmed out to the experts get it downtown to tobe geller he instructed the fbi had a talented young man in its new york computer crimes office geller had helped them in the past and rhyme knew that if anyone could tell them what the device was and where it mightve come from geller could do it sachs handed off the bag to sellitto who in turn gave it to a uniformed policeman for transport downtown but aspiring sergeant amelia sachs stopped him she made sure he filled out a chainofcustody card which documents everyone whos handled each piece of evidence from crime scene to trial she checked the card carefully and sent him on his way and how was the assessment exercise sachs rhyme asked well she said a hesitation i think i nailed it rhyme was surprised at this response amelia sachs often had a difficult time accepting praise from others and hardly ever bestowed it on herself i didnt doubt you would he said sergeant sachs lon sellitto pondered gotta good ring to it they turned next to the pyrotechnic items found at the music school the fuses and the firecracker sachs had figured out one mystery at least the killer she explained had leaned chairs backward on two legs balancing them in that position with thin pieces of cotton string hed tied fuses to the middle of the strings and lit them after a minute or so the flame in the fuses hit the strings and burned through them the chairs tumbled to the floor making it sound like the killer was still inside hed also lit a fuse that ultimately set off the squib they mistook for a gunshot can you source any of it sellitto asked generic fuse untraceable and the squibs destroyed no manufacturer nothing cooper shook his head all that was left rhyme could see were tiny shreds of paper with a burned metal core of fuse attached the strings turned out to be narrowgauge percent cotton generic and thus also impossible to source there was that flash too sachs said looking over her notes when the officers saw him with the victim he held up his hand and there was a brilliant light like a flare it blinded both of them any trace none that i could find they said it just dissolved in the air okay lon you said it bizarre lets move on footprints cooper pulled up the nypd database on shoetread prints a digitized version of the hardcopy file rhyme had compiled when hed been head of nypd forensics after a few minutes of perusal he said shoes are slipon black ecco brand appear to be a size ten trace evidence rhyme asked sachs picked several plastic bags out of a milk crate inside were strips of adhesive tape torn off the trace pickup roller thesere from where he walked and next to the body cooper took the plastic bags and extracted the adhesive tape rectangles one by one over separate examining trays to avoid crosscontamination most of the trace adhering to the squares was dust that matched sachss control samples meaning that its source was neither the perp nor the victim but was found naturally at the crime scene but on several of the pieces of tape were some fibers that sachs had found only in places where the perp had walked or on objects that hed touched scope em the tech lifted them off with a pair of tweezers and mounted them on slides he put them under the stereobinocular microscope the preferred instrument for analyzing fibers and then hit a button the image he was looking at through the eyepiece popped onto the large flatscreen computer monitor for everyone to see the fibers appeared as thick strands grayish in color fibers are important forensic clues because theyre common they virtually leap from one source to another and they can be easily classified they fall into two categories natural and manmade rhyme noted immediately that these werent viscous rayon or polymerbased and therefore had to be natural but what kind specifically mel cooper wondered aloud look at the cell structure im betting its excremental whatsat sellitto asked excrement like shit excrement like silk it comes from the digestive tract of worms dyed gray processed to a matte finish whats on the other slides mel he ran these through the scope too and found they were identical fibers was the perp wearing gray no sellitto reported the vic wasnt either sachs said more mysteries ah cooper said peering into the eyepiece might have a hair here on the screen a long strand of brown hair came into focus human hair rhyme called out noting hundreds of scales an animal hair would have at most dozens but its fake fake sellitto asked well he said impatiently its real hair but its from a wig obviously look at the end thats not a bulb its glue might not be his of course but its worth putting on the chart that hes not brownhaired thom asked the facts rhyme said tersely are all we care about write that the unsub is possibly wearing a brown wig okay bwana cooper continued his examination and found that two of the adhesive squares revealed a minuscule bit of dirt and some plant material scope the plant first mel in analyzing crime scenes in new york lincoln rhyme had always placed great importance on geologic plant and animal evidence because only oneeighth of the city is actually on the north american mainland the rest is situated on islands this means that minerals flora and fauna tend to be more or less common to particular boroughs and even neighborhoods within them making it easier to trace substances to specific locations a moment later a rather artistic image of a reddish twig and a bit of leaf appeared on the screen good rhyme announced whats good about it thom asked its good because its rare its a red pignut hickory you hardly ever find them in the city the only place i know of are central and riverside parks and oh look at that that little bluegreen mass where sachs asked cant you see it its right there feeling painfully frustrated that he couldnt leap from his chair and tap the screen lower righthand corner if the twigs italy then the mass is sicily got it what do you think mel lichen right and id vote for parmelia conspersa could be the tech said cautiously but therere a lot of lichens but there arent a lot of bluegreenand gray lichens rhyme replied dryly in fact hardly any and this one is most abundant in central park weve got two links to the park good now lets look at the dirt cooper mounted another slide the image in the microscope grains of dirt like asteroids wasnt forensically revealing and rhyme said run a sample through the gcms the gas chromatographmass spectrometer is a marriage of two chemicalanalysis instruments the first of which breaks down an unknown substance into its component parts with the second determining what each of those parts is white powder that appears uniform for instance might be a dozen different chemicals baking soda arsenic baby powder phenol and cocaine the chromatograph has been compared to a horse race the substances start out moving through the instrument together but they progress at different rates becoming separated at the finish line the mass spectrometer compares each one with a huge database of known substances to identify it the results of coopers analysis showed that the dirt sachs had recovered was impregnated with an oil the database though reported only that it was mineralbased not plant or animal and couldnt identify it specifically rhyme commanded send it to the fbi see if their lab peopleve run across it then he squinted into a plastic bag thats the black cloth you found might be a clue might be nothing she nodded it was in the corner of the lobby where the victim was strangled was it hers cooper wondered maybe rhyme said but for the time being lets go on the assumption its the killers cooper carefully lifted out the material he examined it silk hemmed by hand rhyme observed that even though it could be folded into a tiny wad it opened up to be quite large about sixbyfour feet we know from the timing he was waiting for her in the lobby rhyme said ill bet thats how he did it hid in the corner with that cloth draped over him hed be invisible he probably wouldve taken it with him except the officers showed up and he had to get away what the poor girl mustve felt when the killer materialized as if by magic cuffed her and strung the rope around her neck cooper found several flecks adhering to the black cloth he mounted them on a slide an image soon popped up on the screen under magnification the flecks resembled ragged pieces of fleshcolored lettuce he touched one with a fine probe the material was springy what the hell is that sellitto asked rhyme suggested rubber of some kind shred of balloon no too thick for that and look at the slide mel something smeared off fleshcolored too run it through the gc while they waited for the results the doorbell rang thom stepped out of the room to open the door and returned with an envelope latents he announced ah good rhyme said fingerprints are back run them through afis mel the powerful servers of the fbis automated fingerprint identification system located in west virginia would search digitized images of friction ridges fingerprints throughout the country and return the results in hours possibly even minutes if the latents team had found good clear prints how do they look rhyme asked pretty clean sachs held up the photos for him to see many were just partials but they had a good print of his whole left hand the first thing rhyme noticed was that the killer had two deformed fingers on that hand the ring and little fingers they were joined it seemed and ended in smooth skin without prints rhyme had a working knowledge of forensic pathology but couldnt tell whether this was a congenital condition or the result of an injury ironic rhyme thought gazing at the picture the unsubs left ring finger is damaged mine is the only extremity below my neck that can move at all then he frowned hold off on the scan for a minute mel closer sachs i want to see them closer she stepped next to rhyme and he examined the prints again notice anything unusual about them she said not really wait she laughed theyre the same flipping through the pictures all his fingers theyre the same that little scar its in the same position on every one of them he must be wearing some kind of glove cooper said with fake friction ridges on them never seen that before who the hell was this perp the results from the chromatographspectrometer popped onto a computer screen okay ive got pure latex and whats this he pondered something the computer identifies as an alginate never heard of teeth what cooper asked rhyme its a powder you mix with water to make molds dentists use it for crowns and dental work maybe our doerd just been to the dentist cooper continued to examine the computer screen then we have very minute traces of castor oil propylene glycol cetyl alcohol mica iron oxide titanium dioxide coal tar and some neutral pigments some of thosere found in makeup rhyme said recalling a case in which hed placed a killer at the scene after the man wrote obscene messages on the victims mirror with a touchup stick smears of which were found on his sleeve running the case hed made a study of cosmetics hers cooper asked sachs no the policewoman answered i took swabs of her skin she wasnt wearing any well put it on the board well see if it means anything turning to the rope the murder weapon mel cooper looked up from his slump over a porcelain examining board its a white sheath of rope around a black core theyre both braided silk real light and thin which is why it doesnt look any thicker than a normal rope even though its really two put together whats the point of that does the core make it stronger rhyme asked easier to untie harder to untie what no idea its getting mysteriouser sachs said with a dramatic flair that rhyme would have found irritating if he hadnt agreed with her yup he confirmed disconcerted thats a new one to me lets keep going i want something familiar something we can use and the knot tied by an expert but i dont recognize it cooper said get a picture of it to the bureau and dont we know somebody at the maritime museum theyve helped us with knots a few times sachs said ill upload a picture to them too a call came in from tobe geller at the computer crimes unit at new york s fbi headquarters this is fun lincoln glad were keeping you amused rhyme murmured anything helpful you might be able to tell us about our toy geller a curlyhaired young man was impervious to rhymes edge especially since there was a computer product involved its a digital audio recorder fascinating little thing your unsub recorded something on it stored the sounds on a hard drive then programmed it to play back after some delay we dont know what the sound was he built in a wiping program so that it destroyed the data it was his voice rhyme muttered when he said he had a hostage it was just a recording like the chairs it was to make us think he was still in the room that makes sense it had a special speaker small but excellent bass and midtone range itd mimic a human voice pretty well theres nothing left on the disk nope gone for good damn i wanted a voiceprint sorry its gone rhyme sighed in frustration and rolled back to the examination trays it was left to sachs to tell geller how much they appreciated the help the team then examined the victims wristwatch which had been shattered for reasons none of them could figure out it yielded no evidence except the time it was broken perps occasionally broke watches or clocks at crime scenes after theyd set them to the wrong time to mislead investigators but this was stopped at close to the actual time of death what should they make of that mysteriouser as the aide wrote their observations on the whiteboard rhyme looked over the bag containing the signin book the missing name in the book he mused nine people signed but therere only eight names in the log i think we need an expert here rhyme ordered into the microphone command telephone call kincaid comma parker chapter six on the screen the display showed a area code virginia then the number being dialed a ring a young girls voice said kincaid residence uhm yes is parker there your father i mean whos calling lincoln rhyme in new york hold on please a moment later the laidback voice of one of the countrys preeminent document examiners came on the line hey lincoln been a month or two hasnt it busy time rhyme offered and whatre you up to parker oh getting into trouble nearly caused an international incident the british cultural society in the district wanted me to authenticate a notebook of king edwards theyd purchased from a private collector note the tense of the verb lincoln theyd already paid for it six hundred thousand little pricey they wanted it that badly oh it had some real nice juicy gossip about churchill and chamberlain well not in that sense of course of course not as usual rhyme tried to be patient with those from whom he was seeking gratuitous help i looked it over and what could i do i had to question it the innocuous verb from a respected document examiner like kincaid was synonymous with branding the diary a badass forgery ah theyll get over it he continued though come to think of it they havent paid my bill yet no honey we dont make the frosting till the cake cools because i said so a single father kincaid was the former head of the fbis documents department at headquarters hed left the bureau to run his own documentexamination service so he could spend more time with his children robby and stephanie hows margaret sachs called into the speaker that you amelia yup shes fine havent seen her for a few days we took the kids to planet play on wednesday and i was just starting to beat her at laser tag when her pager goes off she had to go kick in somebodys door and arrest them panama or ecuador or someplace like that she doesnt give me the details so whats up were running a case and i need some help heres the scenario perp was seen writing his name in a security desk signin book okay got it and you need the handwriting analyzed the problem is we dont have any handwriting it disappeared yep and youre sure the writer wasnt faking positive there was a guard who saw ink going on paper no question anything visible now nothing kincaid gave a grim laugh thats smart so there was no record of the perp entering the building and then somebody else wrote their name over the blank space and ruined whatever impression there mightve been of his signature right anything on the sheet below the top one rhyme glanced at cooper who shone a bright light at an acute angle on the second sheet in the log this rather than covering the page with pencil lead was the preferred method to raise impression evidence he shook his head nothing rhyme told the document examiner then asked so howd he pull that off he exlaxed it kincaid announced hows that sellitto called used disappearing ink we call it exlaxing in the business the old exlax contained phenolphthalein before it was banned by the fda youd dissolve a pill in alcohol and make a blue ink it had an alkaline ph then youd write something after a while exposure to the air would make the blue disappear sure said rhyme recalling his basic chemistry the carbon dioxide in the air turns the ink acidic and that neutralizes the color exactly you dont see phenolphthalein much anymore but you can do the same thing with thymolphthalein indicator and sodium hydroxide can you buy this stuff anyplace in particular hm kincaid considered well just a minute honey daddys on the phone no its okay all cakes look lopsided when theyre in the oven ill be there soon lincoln what i was going to say was that its a great idea in theory but when i was in the bureau there were never any perps or spies who actually used disappearing ink its more of a novelty you know entertainersd use it entertainment rhyme thought grimly looking at the board on which were taped the pictures of poor svetlana rasnikov where would our doer find ink like that most likely toy stores or magic shops interesting okay well thats helpful parker come and visit sometime sachs called and bring the kids rhyme grimaced at the invitation he whispered to sachs and why dont you invite all their friends too the whole school laughing she shushed him after he disconnected the call rhyme said grumpily the more we learn the less we know bedding and saul called in and reported that svetlana seemed to be well liked at the music school and had no enemies there her parttime job wasnt likely to have produced any stalkers either she led singalongs at kids birthday parties a package arrived from the medical examiners office inside was a plastic evidence bag containing the old handcuffs the victim had been restrained with they were unopened as rhyme had ordered hed told the m e to compress the victims hands to remove them since drilling out the locks could destroy valuable trace never seen anything like this cooper said holding them up outside of a movie rhyme agreed they were antique heavy and made of unevenly forged iron cooper brushed and tapped all around the lock mechanisms but he found no significant trace the fact they were antique though was encouraging because it would limit the sources they mightve come from rhyme told cooper to photograph the cuffs and print out pictures to show to dealers sellitto received another phone call he listened for a moment then looking bewildered said impossible youre sure yeah okay thanks hanging up the detective glanced at rhyme i dont get it whats that rhyme asked in no mood for any more mysteries that was the administrator of the music school there is no janitor but the patrol officers saw him sachs pointed out the cleaning staff doesnt work on saturday only weekday evenings and none of em look like the guy the respondings saw no janitor sellitto looked through his notes he was right outside the second door sweeping up he oh goddamn rhyme snapped it was him a glance at the detective the janitor looked completely different from the perp right sellitto consulted his notebook he was in his sixties bald no beard wearing gray coveralls gray coveralls rhyme shouted yeah thats the silk fiber it was a costume whatre you talking about cooper asked our unsub killed the student when he was surprised by the respondings he blinded them with the flash and ran into the performance space set up the fuses and the digital recorder to make them think he was still inside changed into the janitor outfit and ran out the second door but he didnt just strip off throwaway sweats like some chainsnatcher on the a train linc the rotund policeman pointed out how the hell could heve done it he was out of sight for what sixty seconds fine if you have an explanation that doesnt involve divine intervention im willing to listen come on theres no fucking way no way rhyme mused cynically as he wheeled closer to the whiteboard on which thom had taped the printouts of the digital photos sachs had taken of the footprints then how bout some evidence he examined the perps footprints and then the ones that shed lifted in the corridor near where the janitor had been shoes he announced theyre the same the detective asked yep sachs said walking to the board ecco size ten christ sellitto muttered rhyme asked okay what do we have a perp in his early fifties medium build medium height and beardless two deformed fingers probably has a record cause hes hiding his prints and thats all we goddamn know but then rhyme frowned no he muttered darkly thats not all we know theres something else he had a change of clothes with him murder weapons hes an organized offender he glanced at sellitto and added hes going to do this again sachs nodded her grim agreement rhyme gazed at thoms flowing lettering on the evidence whiteboards and he wondered what ties this all together the black silk the makeup the costume change the disguises the flashes and the pyrotechnics the disappearing ink rhyme said slowly im thinking that our boys got some magic training sachs nodded makes sense sellitto nodded okay maybe but whatta we do now seems obvious to me rhyme said find our own our own what sellitto asked magician of course do it again shed done it eight times so far again the man nodded and so kara did it again the triple handkerchief release developed by the famous magician and teacher harlan tarbell is a surefire audiencepleaser it involves separating three differentcolored silks that seem hopelessly knotted together its a hard trick to perform smoothly but kara felt good about how itd gone david balzac didnt however your coins were talking he sighed harsh criticism meaning that an illusion or trick was clumsy and obvious the heavyset older man with a white mane of hair and tobaccostained goatee shook his head in exasperation he removed his thick glasses rubbed his eyes and replaced the specs i think it was smooth she protested it seemed smooth to me but you werent the audience i was now again they stood on a small stage in the back of smoke mirrors the store that balzac had bought after hed retired from the international magic and illusion circuit ten years ago the grungy place sold magic supplies rented costumes and props and presented free amateur magic shows for customers and locals a year and a half ago kara doing freelance editing for self magazine had finally worked up her courage to get up on stage balzacs reputation had intimidated her for months the aging magician had watched her act and called her into his office afterward the great balzac himself had told her in his gruff but silky voice that she had potential she could be a great illusionist with the proper training and proposed that she come work in the shop hed be her mentor and teacher kara had moved to new york from the midwest years before and was savvy about city life she knew immediately what mentor might entail especially when he was a quadruple divorcee and she was an attractive woman forty years younger than he but balzac was a renowned magician hed been a regular on johnny carson and had been a headliner in las vegas for years hed toured the world dozens of times and knew virtually every major illusionist alive illusion was her passion and this was a chance of a lifetime she accepted on the spot at the first session her guard was up and she was ready to repel boarders the lesson indeed turned out to be upsetting to her though for an entirely different reason he tore her to shreds after an hour of criticizing virtually every aspect of her technique balzac had looked at her pale tearful face and barked i said you have potential i didnt say you were good if you want somebody to polish your ego youre in the wrong place now are you going to run home crying to mommy or are you going to get back to work they got back to work and so began an eighteenmonth lovehate relationship between mentor and apprentice which kept her up until the early hours of the morning six or seven days a week practicing practicing practicing while balzac had had many assistants in his years as a performer hed been a mentor to only two apprentices and in both cases it seemed the young men had proved to be disappointments he wasnt going to let that happen with kara friends sometimes asked her where her love of and obsession with illusion came from they were probably expecting a movieoftheweek tormented childhood filled with abusive parents and teachers or at least a little slip of a mousy girl escaping from the cruel cliques at school into the world of fantasy but they got normal girl instead a cheerful astudent gymnast cookie baker and schoolchoir singer who started on the path of entertainment undramatically by attending a penn and teller performance in cleveland with her grandparents followed a month later by a coincidental family trip to vegas for one of her fathers turbinemanufacturing conventions the trip exposing her to the thrill of flying tigers and fiery illusions the exhilaration of magic thats all it took at thirteen she founded the magic club at jfk junior high and was soon sinking every penny of babysitting money into magic magazines howto videos and packaged tricks she later expanded her entrepreneurial efforts to yard work and snow shoveling in exchange for rides to the big apple circus and cirque du soleil whenever they were appearing within a fiftymile radius which is not to say that there wasnt an important motive that set and kept her on this course no what drove kara could be easily found in the blinks of delighted surprise on the faces of the audience whether they were twodozen of her relatives at thanksgiving dinner a show complete with quickchange routines and a levitating cat though without the trapdoor her father wouldnt let her cut in the living room floor or the students and parents at the high school senior talent show where she did two encores to a standing ovation life with david balzac though was quite different from that triumphant show over the past year and half she sometimes felt she shed lost whatever talent shed once had but just as shed be about to quit hed nod and offer the faintest of smiles several times he actually said that was a tight trick at moments like that her world was complete much of the rest of her life though blew away like dust as she spent more and more time at the store handling the books and inventory for him the payroll serving as webmaster for the stores website since balzac wasnt paying her much she needed other work and she took jobs that were at least marginally compatible with her english degree writing content for other magic and theater websites then about a year ago her mothers condition had begun to worsen and onlychild kara spent her little remaining free time with the woman an exhausting life but she could handle it for now in a few years balzac would pronounce her fit to perform and off shed go with his blessing and his contacts with producers around the world hold tight girl as jaynene might say and stay on top of the galloping horse kara now finished tarbells threesilk trick again tapping his cigarette ash onto the floor balzac frowned left index finger slightly higher you could see the tie if i couldnt see it he snapped angrily why would i ask you to lift your finger higher try again once more the goddamn index finger slightly goddamn higher wshhhhhh the entangled silks separated and flew into the air like triumphant flags ah balzac said a faint nod not traditional praise exactly but kara had learned to make do with ahs she put the trick away and stepped behind the counter in the cluttered business area of the store to log in the merchandise that had arrived in fridays afternoon shipment balzac returned to the computer on which he was writing an article for the stores website about jasper maskelyne the british magician who created a special military unit in world war two which used illusionist techniques against the germans in north africa he was writing it from memory without any notes or research that was one thing about david balzac his knowledge of magic was as deep as his temperament was unstable and fiery you hear that the cirque fantastiques in town she called opens tonight the old illusionist grunted he was exchanging his glasses for contact lenses balzac was extremely aware of the importance of a performers image and always looked his best for any audience even his customers you going to go she persisted i think we should go cirque fantastique a competitor to the older and bigger cirque du soleil was part of the next generation of circuses it combined traditional circus routines ancient commedia dellarte theater contemporary music and dance avantgarde performance art and street magic but david balzac was old school vegas atlantic city the late show why change something that works hed grumble kara loved cirque fantastique though and was determined to get him to a performance but before she could pitch her case to convince him to accompany her the stores front door opened and an attractive redheaded policewoman walked in asking for the owner thats me im david balzac what can i do for you the officer said were investigating a case involving someone who mightve had some training in magic were talking to magic supply stores in town hoping you might be able to help us you mean somebodys running a scam or something balzac asked he sounded defensive a feeling kara shared in the past magic has often been linked to crooks sleightofhand artists as pickpockets for instance and charlatan clairvoyants using illusionist techniques to convince bereaved family members that the spirits of their relatives are communicating with them but the policewomans visit it turned out was prompted by something else actually she said glancing at kara then back to balzac the case is a homicide chapter seven i have a list of some items we found at a crime scene amelia sachs told the owner and was wondering if you mightve sold them he took the sheet she handed him and read it as sachs looked over smoke mirrors the blackpainted cavern of a store in the photo district part of manhattans chelsea neighborhood smelled of mold and chemicals plastic too the petrochemical body odor from the hundreds of costumes that hung like a limp crowd from racks nearby the grimy glass counters half of them cracked and taped together were filled with card decks and wands and phony coins and dusty boxes of magic tricks a fullsize replica of the creature from the alien movies stood next to a diana mask and costume be the princess of the party a card read as if no one in the store even knew she was dead he tapped the list and then nodded at the counters i dont think i can help we sell some of this sure but so does every magic store in the country a lot of toy stores too she observed he hadnt spent more than a few seconds looking it over how about these sachs showed him the printout of the photo of the old handcuffs he glanced at it quickly i dont know anything about escapology was this an answer so that means you dont recognize them no its very important sachs persisted the young woman with striking blue eyes and black fingernails looked at the picture theyre darbys she said the man glanced at her coolly she fell silent for a moment then regulation scotland yard handcuffs from the eighteen hundreds a lot of escapists use them they were houdinis favorites where could theyve come from balzac rocked impatiently in his office chair we wouldnt know like i was saying thats not a field we have any experience with the woman nodded agreeing with him therere probably escapology museums somewhere you could get in touch with and after you restock balzac said to his assistant i need you to process those orders there were a dozen came in last night after you left he lit a cigarette sachs offered him the list again you did say you sold some of these products do you have records of customers i meant products like them and no we dont keep customer records after some questioning sachs finally got him to admit that there were recent records of mailorder and online sales the young woman checked these though and found that nobody had bought any of the items on the evidence list sorry balzac said wish we could be more help you know i wish you could be more help too sachs said leaning forward because see this guy killed a woman and escaped by using magic tricks and were afraid hes going to do it again giving a frown of concern balzac said terrible you know you might try east side magic and theatrical theyre bigger than us we have another officer over there now ah there you go she let a moment pass silent then well if you can think of anything else id appreciate a call a good civil servants smile an nypd sergeants smile remember community relations are as important as criminal investigations good luck officer balzac said thanks she said you apathetic sonofabitch she nodded farewell to the young woman and glanced at a cardboard cup she was sipping from hey there anyplace around here to get some decent coffee fifth and nineteenth she replied good bagels too balzac said helpful now that there was no risk or effort involved outside sachs turned toward fifth avenue and found the recommended coffee shop she walked inside bought a cappuccino she leaned against a narrow mahogany bar in front of the flecked window sipping the hot drink and watching the saturdaymorning populace here in chelsea salespeople from the clothing stores in the area commercial photographers and their assistants rich yuppies who lived in the massive lofts poor artists lovers young and lovers old a wacky notebook scribbler or two and one magic store clerk now entering the shop hi said the woman with short reddishpurple hair carrying a battered faux zebraskin purse over her shoulder she ordered a large coffee filled it with sugar and joined sachs at the bar back at smoke mirrors the policewoman had asked about a venue for coffee because of a conspiratorial glance the assistant had shot sachs it seemed that shed wanted to say something out of balzacs presence sipping her coffee thirstily the woman said the thing about david is hes uncooperative a frown of consideration yeah that says it pretty well anything outside his world he doesnt trust or want any part of he was afraid wed have to be witnesses or something im not supposed to be distracted from what from the profession magic right see hes sort of my mentor more than my boss whats your name kara its my stage name but i use it most of the time a pained smile better than the one my parents were kind enough to give me sachs lifted a curious eyebrow well keep that a secret so sachs said whyd you give me that look back at the store davids right about that list you can buy those things anywhere in any store or on the internet in hundreds of places but about the darbys the handcuffs thosere rare you should call the houdini and escapology museum in new orleans its the best in the world escapisms one of my things i dont tell him though reverent emphasis on the thirdperson pronoun davids kind of opinionated can you tell me what happened with that murder normally circumspect about what she gave away on an active case sachs knew they needed help and gave kara an outline of the killing and the escape oh thats horrible the young woman whispered yeah sachs replied softly it is the way he disappeared theres something you ought to know officer wait do i call you officer or are you like a detective or something amelias fine enjoying a brief memory of how shed aced the assessment exercise bang bang kara sipped more coffee decided that it wasnt sweet enough and unscrewed the top of the sugar bottle then poured more in sachs watched the young womans deft hands then glanced down at her own fingernails two of which were torn the cuticles bloody the girls were perfectly filed and the glossy black finish reflected the overhead lights in exact miniature a jealous twinge at the nails and the selfcontrol that kept them so perfect flared momentarily and then was put quickly to sleep by amelia sachs kara asked you know what illusion is david copperfield sachs replied shrugging houdini copperfield yes houdini no he was an escapist well illusions different from sleight of hand or closein magic we call it like kara held up a quarter in her fingers change from the coffee she closed her palm and when she opened it again the coin was gone sachs laughed where the hell had it gone that was sleight of hand illusion is tricks involving large objects or people or animals what you just described what that killer did is a classic illusionist trick its called the vanished man vanishing man no the vanished man in magic we use vanish to mean to make disappear like i just vanished the quarter go on the way its performed usually is a little different from what you described but basically it involves the illusionist getting out of a locked room the audience sees him step into this little room onstage they can see the back because of a big mirror behind it they hear him pound on the walls the assistants pull the walls down and hes gone then one of the assistants turns around and its the illusionist how does it work there was a door in the back of the room the illusionist covers himself with a large piece of black silk so the audience cant see him in the mirror and slips through the back door just after he walks inside theres a speaker built into one of the walls to make it sound like he was inside all the time and a gimmick that hits the walls and sounds like hes pounding once the illusionists outside he does a quick change behind the silk into an assistants costume sachs nodded thats it all right could we get a short list of people who know the routine no sorry its pretty common the vanished man sachs was recalling that the killer had changed disguises quickly to become an older man recalling too balzacs lack of cooperation and the cold look in his eyes almost sadistic when he was talking to kara she asked i need to ask where was he this morning who mr balzac here i mean in the building he lives there above the store wait youre not thinking he was involved thesere questions we need to ask sachs said noncommittally the young woman seemed more amused than upset by the inquiry though she gave a laugh look i know hes gruff and he has this i guess youd call it an edge you know a temper but hed never hurt anybody sachs nodded but then asked still you know where he was at eight this morning kara nodded yeah he was at the store he got in early because some friend of his is in town doing a show and needed to borrow some equipment i called to tell him id be a little late sachs nodded then a moment later asked can you take a little time off work me oh no way an embarrassed laugh i was lucky to sneak out now therere a thousand things to do around the store then ive got three or four hours of rehearsing with david for a show im doing tomorrow he doesnt let me rest the day before a performance i sachs held the womans crisp blue eyes were really afraid this persons going to kill someone else karas eyes swept the sticky mahogany bar please just for a few hours look over the evidence with us brainstorm he wont let me you dont know david what i know is that im not letting anybody else get hurt if theres any way i can stop it kara finished her coffee and absently played with the cup using our tricks to kill people she whispered in a dismayed voice sachs said nothing and let silence do the arguing for her finally the young woman grimaced my mothers in a home shes been in and out of the infirmary mr balzac knows that i guess i could tell him i have to go check on her we really could use your help ohoh the sickmother excuse gods gonna get me for this one sachs glanced down again at karas perfect black nails hey one thing what happened to that quarter look under your coffee cup the girl replied impossible no way sachs lifted up the cup there sat the coin the bewildered policewoman asked howd you do that karas answer was an enigmatic smile she nodded at the cups lets get a couple more to go she picked up the coin heads you buy tails its on me two out of three she flipped it into the air sachs nodded deal the young woman caught it and glanced into her cupped palm she looked up we said two out of three right sachs nodded kara opened her fingers inside were two dimes and a nickel the dimes were headsup no sign of the quarter guess this means youre buying chapter eight lincoln meet kara shed been warned rhyme could see but the young woman still blinked in surprise and glanced at him with the look the one he knew so well accompanied by the smile it was the famous dontlookathisbody gaze accompanied by the ohyourehandicappedinevernoticed grin and rhyme knew shed be counting down the moments until she could get the hell out of his presence the spritely young woman walked farther into the parlor lab in rhymes townhouse hi nice to meet you the eyes remained rooted in his at least she didnt start forward with that minuscule lean that told him she was stifling an offered handshake and then cringe in horror at the faux pas okay kara dont worry you can give the gimp your insights then get the hell out he offered her a superficial smile that matched hers crease for crease and said how pleased he was to meet her too which on a professional level at least wasnt sardonic kara was it turned out the only magician lead theyd snared none of the employees at the other shops in town had been any help and everyone had alibis for the time of the killing she was introduced to lon sellitto and mel cooper thom nodded and did one of the things he was known for whether rhyme wanted him to or not offered refreshments were not really in a church social mode here thom rhyme muttered kara said no that was all right but thom said no he was insisting maybe coffee she asked coming up black sugar maybe a couple sugars we really rhyme began for the whole room the aide announced ill make a pot get some bagels too bagels sellitto asked you could open a restaurant in your spare time rhyme snapped to the aide get it out of your system whats spare time came the trim blond mans fast quip he headed for the kitchen officer sachs he continued to kara told us that you had some information you thought might help i hope so another tight perusal of rhymes face the look again closer this time oh for christs sake just say something ask me how it happened ask me if it hurts ask me what its like to pee into a tube hey whatre we calling him sellitto tapped the top of the evidence whiteboard until the identity of the unsub for unknown subject was learned many law enforcers gave perps nicknames how bout the magician no that sounds too tame rhyme said looking at the pictures of the victim hows the conjurer surprising himself by offering this decidedly rightbrained suggestion works for me in handwriting far less elegant than thoms the detective wrote the words on top of the chart the conjurer now lets see if we can make him appear rhyme said sachs said tell them about the vanished man the young woman rubbed her hand over her boyish hair as she described an illusionists trick that sounded almost identical to what the conjurer had done at the music school she added the discouraging news though that most illusionists would know about it rhyme asked give us some idea about how he does the tricks techniques so well know what to expect from him if he tries to target somebody else you want me to tip the gaff huh tip the gaff kara said then explained see all magic tricksre made up of an effect and a method the effect is what the audience sees you know the girl levitating the coins falling through a solid tabletop the method is the mechanism of how the magician does it wires holding up the girl palming the coins then dropping identical ones from a rig under the table effect and method rhyme reflected kind of like what i do the effect is catching a perp when it seems impossible the method is the science and logic that let us do it kara continued tipping the gaff means giving away the method of a trick like i just did explaining how the vanished man worked its a sensitive thing mr balzac my mentor hes always hounding magicians who tip the gaff in public and give away other peoples methods thom carted a tray into the room he poured coffee for those who wanted some kara dumped sugar into hers and sipped it fast even though to rhyme it seemed scaldinghot he glanced at the macallan eighteenyearold single malt on a bookcase across the room thom noticed his eyes and said its midmorning dont even think about it sellitto gave a similarly lustful gaze toward the bagels he allowed himself only half without cream cheese he looked pained with every bite they went over each item of evidence with kara who studied it carefully and delivered the discouraging news that there were hundreds of sources for most of the items the rope was a colorchanging rope trick sold in fao schwarz as well as magic stores throughout the country the knot was one houdini used in his routines when he planned to cut the cord to escape it was virtually impossible for a bound performer to untie even without the cuffs kara said softly that girl never had a chance of getting away is that rare the knot she explained that no anyone with a basic knowledge of houdinis routines would know it the castor oil in the makeup kara continued meant that he was using very realistic and durable theatrical cosmetics and the latex was as rhyme had suspected probably from the fake finger cups which were also popular magicians tools the alginate kara suggested wouldnt be from dental work but was used to make molds for latex casting probably for the finger cups or the bald cap hed worn in his janitor disguise the disappearing ink was more of a novelty though some illusionists occasionally used it in their shows only a few things were unique she explained the circuit board which was a gimmick she said a prop the audience cant see for instance but hed made that himself the darby handcuffs were rare rhyme ordered someone to check out the escapology museum in new orleans that kara had mentioned sachs suggested they take the responding officers franciscovich and ausonio up on their offer to help this was the sort of assignment thatd be perfect for a couple of eager young officers rhyme agreed and sellitto arranged it through the head of the patrol services division how about his escape sellitto said whats the deal where he changed into janitor clothes so fast protean magic its called kara said quick change its one of the things ive been studying for years i just use it as part of my routines but therere some people its all they do it can be amazing i saw arturo brachetti a few years ago he could do three or four dozen changes in one show some of them in under three seconds three seconds yeah and see true quickchange artists dont just change clothes theyre actors too they walk differently hold themselves differently speak differently hell prepare everything ahead of time the clothes are breakaway theyre held together with snaps or velcro most of quick change is really quick strip and theyre made of silk or nylon real thin so we can wear layers of them i sometimes wear five costumes under my top outfit silk rhyme asked we found gray silk fibers he explained the officers on the scene reported that the janitor was wearing a gray uniform the fibers were abraded sort of buffed to a matte finish kara nodded so theyd look like cotton or linen not shiny we also use collapsible hats and suitcases shoe coverings telescoping umbrellas all kinds of props that we hide on our bodies wigs of course she continued to alter a face the most important thing is the eyebrows change those and the face is sixty seventy percent different then add some prostheses we call them appliances latex strips and pads you put on with spirit gum quickchange performers study the basic facial structures of different races and genders a good protean artist knows the proportions of a womans face versus a mans and can change genders in seconds we study psychological reactions to faces and posture so we can become beautiful or ugly or scary or sympathetic or needy whatever the magic esoterica was interesting but rhyme wanted specific suggestions is there anything concrete you can tell us thatll help find him she shook her head i cant think of anything that might lead you to a particular store or other place but i do have some general thoughts go ahead well the fact he used the changing rope and finger cups tells me hes familiar with sleight of hand that means hell be good at picking pockets hiding guns or knives or things like that getting peoples keys and ids he also knows quick change and its obvious what kind of problem thatll be for you but more important the vanished man routine the fuses and squibs the disappearing ink the black silk the flash cotton means hes a classically trained illusionist she explained the difference between a sleightofhand artist and a true illusionist whose acts involved people and large objects whys that important for us kara nodded because illusion is more than just physical technique illusionists study audience psychology and create whole routines to trick them not just their eyes but their minds too their point isnt making you laugh because a quarter disappears its to make you believe in your heart that everything you see and believe is one way when in fact its the opposite theres one thing youll have to keep in mind never forget it what rhyme asked misdirection mr balzac says its the heart and soul of illusion youve heard the expression that the hand is quicker than the eye well no its not the eye is always quicker so illusionists trick the eye into not noticing what the hand is doing like you mean diversion distraction sellitto asked thats part of it misdirection is pointing the audiences attention where you want it and away from where you dont want it therere lots of rules hes been drumming into me like the audience doesnt notice the familiar butre drawn to novelty they dont notice a series of similar things but focus on the one thats different they ignore objects or people that stand still but theyre drawn to movement you want to make something invisible repeat it four or five times and pretty soon the audience is bored and their attention wanders they can be staring right at your hands and not see what youre doing thats when you zing em okay now therere two kinds of misdirection hell be using first physical misdirection watch kara stepped near sachs and stared at her own right hand as she lifted it very slowly and pointed to the wall squinting then she dropped her hand see you looked at my arm and where i pointed perfectly natural reaction so you probably didnt notice that my left hands got amelias gun sachs gave a faint jump as she glanced down and saw that sure enough karas fingers had lifted the glock partway out of the holster careful there sachs said reholstering the pistol now look in that corner pointing with her right hand again this time though rhyme and the others in the room naturally looked at karas left hand caught my left hand didnt you she laughed but you didnt notice my foot pushing that white thing behind the table a bedpan rhyme said acerbically irritated that hed been tricked again but feeling hed scored a point or two by mentioning the indelicate nature of the object shed moved really she asked unfazed well its not just a bedpan its also a misdirection because when you were looking at it just now i got this with my other hand oh here she said is this important she handed a canister of mace back to sachs the policewoman frowned looked down at her utility belt to see if anything else was missing and replaced the cylinder so thats physical misdirection thats pretty easy the second kind of misdirection is psychological this is harder audiences arent stupid they know youre going to try to trick them i mean thats why theyve come to the show in the first place right so we try to reduce or eliminate the audiences suspicion the most important thing in psychological misdirection is to act naturally you behave and say things thatre consistent with what the audience expects but underneath the surface youre getting away with her voice faded as she realized how close shed come to using the word that described the death of the young student that morning kara continued as soon as you do something in an unnatural way the audience is on to you okay i say im going to read your mind and i do this kara put her hands on sachss temples and closed her eyes for a moment she stepped away and handed sachs back the earring shed just plucked from the policewomans left ear i never felt a thing but the audienced know instantly how i did it because touching someone while youre pretending to read minds which most people dont believe in anyway isnt natural but if i say part of a trick is for me to whisper a word so that nobody else can hear she leaned closer to sachss ear with her right hand over her own mouth see thats a natural gesture you missed the other earring sachs said laughing shed lifted a protective hand to her ear when kara had stepped close but i vanished your necklace its gone even rhyme couldnt help but be impressed and amused watching sachs touch her neck and chest smiling but troubled to keep losing accessories sellitto laughed like a little kid and mel cooper gave up on the evidence to watch the show the policewoman looked around her for the jewelry and then at kara who offered her empty right hand vanished she repeated but rhyme said suspiciously i do notice that your left hands in a fist behind your back which is by the way a rather unnatural gesture so i assume the necklace is there ah youre good kara said then laughed but not at catching moves im afraid she opened her left hand and it too was empty rhyme scowled keeping my left fist closed and out of sight well that was the most important misdirection of all i did that because i knew youd spot it and it would focus your attention on my left hand we call it forcing i forced you to think youd figured out my method and as soon as you did that your mind snapped shut and you stopped considering any other explanations for what had happened and when you and everybody else were staring at my left hand that gave me the chance to slip the necklace into amelias pocket sachs reached inside and pulled the chain out cooper applauded rhyme gave a grudging but impressed grunt kara nodded toward the evidence board so thats what hes going to do this killer misdirection youll think youve figured out what hes up to but thats part of his plan just like i did hell use your suspicions and your intelligence against you in fact he needs your suspicions and intelligence for his tricks to work mr balzac says that the best illusionistsll rig the trick so well that theyll point directly at their method directly at what theyre really going to do but you wont believe them youll look in the opposite direction when that happens youve had it youve lost and theyve won the reference to her mentor seemed to upset her and she glanced at the clock and offered a faint grimace i really have to get back now ive been away too long sachs thanked her and sellitto said ill get a car to take you back to the store well near the store i dont want him to know where ive been oh one thing you might want to do theres a circus in town the cirque fantastique i know they have a quickchange act you might want to check it out sachs nodded theyre setting up right across the street in central park the park was often the site for largescale outdoor concerts and other shows during the spring and summer rhyme and sachs had once attended a paul simon concert by sitting in front of the criminalists open bedroom windows rhyme scoffed oh thats who was rehearsing that godawful music all night you dont like the circus sellitto asked of course i dont like the circus he snapped who does bad food clowns acrobats threatening to die in front of your children but he turned to kara its a good suggestion thanks even though one of us shouldve thought of it before he said caustically looking over the others on the team rhyme watched her sling an ugly blackandwhite purse over her shoulder escaping from him fleeing into the cripfree world taking the look and the smile with her dont worry you can give the gimp your insights then get the hell out she paused and looked at the evidence board once more with a cloud in her striking blue eyes then started for the door wait rhyme said she turned id like you to stay what work with us on the case at least for today you could go with lon or amelia to talk to the people at the circus and there might be more magic evidence we uncover oh no i cant really it was hard for me to get away now i cant spend any more time rhyme said we could use your help weve just scratched the surface with this guy you saw mr balzac she said to sachs in nomine patri you know linc sellitto said uneasily better not to have too many civilians on a case there are regs on that didnt you use a psychic one time rhyme asked dryly i didnt fucking hire her somebody at hq did and then you had the dog tracker and you keep saying you no i dont hire civilians except you which gets me into enough shit ah you can never get into enough shit in police work lon he glanced at kara please its very important the young woman hesitated you really think hes going to kill someone else yes he replied we do the girl finally nodded if im going to get fired at least itll be for a good cause then she laughed you know roberthoudin did the same thing whos that a famous french illusionist and magician he helped out the police too well the french army sometime i dont know in the s there were these algerian extremists the marabouts they were trying to get local tribes to rise up against the french and they kept saying they had magic powers the french government sent him to algeria to have a sort of magical duel to show the tribes that the french had better magic you know more power it worked roberthoudin had tighter tricks than the marabouts then she frowned though i think they almost killed him dont worry sachs reassured her ill make sure that doesnt happen to you then kara looked over the evidence chart you do this in all your cases write down all the clues and things youve learned thats right sachs confirmed heres an idea most magicians specialize like the conjurer doing both quickchange and largescale illusion thats unusual lets write down his techniques that might help narrow down the number of suspects yeah sellitto said a profile good the young woman grimaced and ill have to find somebody to replace me at the shop mr balzac was going to be out of the store with that friend of his oh man hes not going to like this she looked around the room there a phone i can use you know one of those special ones special one thom asked yeah in private so theres nobody around to hear you lie to your boss oh those phones the aide said putting his arm around her shoulders and directing her toward the doorway the one i use for thats in the hall the conjurer musicschool crime scene perps description brown hair fake beard no distinguishing medium build medium height age fifties ring and little fingers of left hand

chapter nine they sensed many smells as they walked blooming lilacs smoke from the pretzel vendors carts and families barbecuing chicken and ribs suntan lotion sachs and kara were making their way to the huge white tent of the cirque fantastique through the damp grass of central park noticing two lovers kissing on a bench kara asked so hes more than your boss lincoln thats right i could tell howd you meet a case serial kidnapper a few years ago is it hard him being that way no its not sachs replied simply which was the complete truth can they do anything for him the doctors theres some surgery hes been thinking about its risky though and it probably wouldnt do any good he decided not to last year and hasnt mentioned it since so the whole things been on hold for a while he may change his mind at some point but well see you dont sound like youre in favor of it im not a lot of risk and not much gain to me its a question of balancing risks lets say you want to bust a perp real bad lots of paper on him okay warrants i mean you know hes in a particular apartment well do you go ahead and kick the door in even when you dont know if hes asleep or if he and his buddies have two mps pointed at the door or do you wait for backup and take the chance that hell get away sometimes the risk is worth it sometimes its not but if he wants to go ahead with the surgery im with him thats the way we work then sachs explained that hed been undergoing treatments that involved electronic stimulation of his muscles and a series of exercises that thom and some physical therapists had been administering the same exercises that the actor christopher reeve had been doing with remarkable results reeves an amazing man sachs said incredible determination lincoln s the same he doesnt talk about it much but sometimes he just disappears and has thom and the pts work on his exercises i dont hear from him for a few days another sort of vanished man hm the young woman asked exactly sachs replied smiling they were silent for a moment and she wondered if kara expected more about their relationship stories of perseverance over the obvious obstacles some hint about the knobby details of life as a quad peoples reactions when they were out in public or even some hint about the nature of the intimacies but if she was curious she didnt pursue it in fact sachs detected mostly envy kara continued i havent had much luck lately in the man department not seeing anybody im not sure kara replied pensively our last contact was french toast and mimosas my place brunch in bed way romantic he said hed call me the next day and no call no call oh and maybe i should add that the aforementioned brunch was three weeks ago have you called him i wouldnt do that she said firmly its in his court good for you pride and power were born joined at the hip sachs knew kara laughed theres an old routine a magician named william ellsworth robinson did it was way popular it was called how to get rid of a wife or the divorce machine a laugh thats my story i can vanish boyfriends faster than anybody well theyre also pretty good at vanishing themselves you know sachs offered most of the guys id meet working at my old job the magazine or the storere interested in two things a onenight romp in the hay or else the opposite wooing then settling down in the burbs you ever get wooed sure sachs said it can be creepy depending on the wooer of course you got it sister so hayromping or wooing and burbsettling theyre both a problem for me i dont want either well a romp now and then lets be realistic what about men in the business ah so you noticed i excluded them from the rompwoo equation other performers naw i dont go there too many conflicts of interest they also claim they like strong women but the truth is most of them dont want us in the business at all the ratio of men to women is about a hundred to one its better now oh you see some famous women illusionists princess tenko an asian illusionist shes brilliant and therere a few others but thats recent twenty thirty years ago you never saw a woman as the star only the assistant a glance at sachs kind of like the police huh its not as bad as it used to be not my generation the sixties and seventies thats when women were breaking the ice that was the hard time but ive had my share i was a portable before i moved to crimescene and a what a portables a beat cop if we ever worked hells kitchen in midtown theyd partner a woman with some experienced male cop sometimes id have a knuckledragger who hated being with a woman just hated it he didnt say a word to me for the entire watch eight hours walking up and down the streets this guy not saying a word wed go tensixtythree for lunch and id be sitting there trying to be pleasant and hed be two feet away reading the sports section and sighing cause he had to waste his time with a woman memories came back to her i was working the sevenfive house the what sachs explained precinct we call them houses and most cops dont say seventyfifth in numbers its always sevenfive or seventyfive like macys is on threefour street okay anyway the usual supervisor was off and we had a temporary sergeant who was oldschool so its one of my first days at the sevenfive and im the only woman on this particular watch i go to roll call in the assembly room and therere a dozen kotex taped to the lectern no kid you not the regular supervisor never wouldve let anybody get away with that but copsre like kids in a lot of ways they push until an adult stops em not what you see in the movies moviesre made in hollywood not in the sevenfive whatd you do about the pads i walked up to the front row and asked the cop sitting right in front of the lectern if i could have his seat which is where i was going to sit anyway they were all laughing so hard im surprised some of them didnt pee their pants well i sat down and just started to take notes about what the sergeant was telling us you know outstanding warrants and community relations things and street corners with known drug activity and about two minutes later no more laughter the whole thing became embarrassing not for me for them you know who did it sure did you report him no see thats the hardest part of being a woman cop you have to work with these people you need them behind you watching your back you can fight every step of the way but if you have to do that youve already lost the hardest part isnt having the balls to fight its knowing when to fight and when to just let it go pride and power like us i guess my business but if youre good if you can bring in audiences managementll hire you its a catch though you cant prove youll draw crowds if they dont hire you and they wont hire you if you cant bring in door receipts they walked closer to the massive glowing tent and sachs watched the young womans eyes light up as she gazed at it this the sort of place youd like to work oh man ill say thiss my idea of heaven cirque fantastique and doing tv specials after a moment of silence as she gazed around her she said mr balzac has me learning all the old routines and thats important youve got to know em cold but a nod toward the tent this is the direction magics going david copperfield david blaine performance art street magic sexy magic you should audition here me youre kidding kara replied im nowhere near ready yet your act has to be perfect you have to be the best better than a man you mean no better than everybody men and women why for the audience kara explained mr balzacs like a broken record you owe it to the audience every breath you take onstage is for your audience illusion cant be just okay you cant just satisfy you have to thrill if one person in the audience catches your moves youve failed if you hesitate just a moment too long and the effect is dull youve failed if one person out there yawns or looks at his watch youve failed you cant be at a hundred percent all the time id think sachs offered but you have to be kara said simply sounding surprised anyone would feel different they arrived at the cirque fantastique where rehearsals for the opening show tonight were underway dozens of performers were walking around some in costumes some in shorts and tshirts or jeans oh man came a breathy voice it was karas her face was like a little girls eyes taking in the brilliant white canvas of the sweeping tent sachs jumped at the sound of a loud crack above and behind her she looked up and saw two huge banners thirty or forty feet high snapping in the wind glowing in the sunlight on one was painted the name cirque fantastique on the other was a huge drawing of a thin man in a blackandwhitecheckered bodysuit he was holding his arms forward palmsup inviting his audience inside he wore a black snubnosed halfmask the features grotesque it was a troubling image she thought immediately of the conjurer hidden by masks of disguise his motives and plans hidden too kara noticed sachss gaze its arlecchino she said in english thats harlequin you know commedia dellarte she asked no sachs said italian theater it lasted from i dont know the fifteen hundreds for a couple of hundred years the cirque fantastique uses it as a theme she pointed to smaller banners on the sides of the tent that displayed other masks with their hook noses or beaks arching brows high serpentine cheekbones they appeared otherworldly and unsettling kara continued there were a dozen or so continuing characters that all the commedia dellarte troupes used in their plays they wore masks to show who they were playing comedy sachs asked lifting an eyebrow as she looked at a particularly demonic mask wed call them black comedies i guess harlequin wasnt exactly a heroic figure he had no morals at all all he cared about was food and women and hed just appear and disappear sneak up on you another one pulcinella was way sadistic he played really mean pranks on people even his lovers then there was a doctor whod poison people the only voice of reason was this woman columbine kara added one of the things i like about commedia dellarte was that her part was really played by a woman not like in england where women werent allowed to perform the banner snapped again harlequins eyes seemed to stare off slightly behind them as if the conjurer were easing up close an echo of the search at the music school earlier no we dont have a clue who or where he is she turned away to see a guard approaching looking over her uniform help you officer sachs asked to see the manager the man explained that he was away but did they want to talk to an assistant sachs said yes and a moment later a short thin harried woman dark gypsylike arrived yes i can help you she asked in an indeterminate accent after introductions sachs said were investigating a series of crimes in the area wed like to know if you have any illusionists or quickchange artists appearing in the show concern blossomed in the womans face we have that yes of course she said irina and vlad klodoya spell those please kara was nodding as sachs wrote down the names i know about them sure they were with the circus of moscow a few years ago right confirmed the assistant have they been here all morning yes they rehearsed until about twenty minutes ago now it is they are shopping youre sure thiss the only time theyve been away yes i supervise myself where everyone is anyone else sachs asked maybe somebody whos had training at illusion or magic i mean even if theyre not performing no nobody those are only the two okay sachs said what were going to do is have a couple of police officers parked outside they should be here in about fifteen minutes if you hear about anyone bothering your employees or the audience acting suspicious tell the officers right away this had been rhymes suggestion i will tell everyone yes but can you please to tell me what is this about a man with some illusionist experience was involved in a homicide earlier today theres no connection to your show that we know of but we just want to be on the safe side they thanked the assistant who offered a troubled farewell probably sorry that shed asked the reason for the visit outside sachs asked whats the story on those performers the ukrainians yeah do we trust em husbandandwife team have a couple of children who travel with them theyre two of the best quickchange artists in the world i cant imagine theyd have anything to do with the killings she laughed see thats who gets jobs at cirque fantastique performers whove been pros since they were five or six sachs called rhymes phone and got thom she gave him the ukrainian performers names and what shed learned have mel or somebody run them through ncic and the state department will do she disconnected the call and they started out of the park walking west toward a slash of livid clouds like striations of bruise in the otherwise brilliant sky another loud snap behind her the banners again flapping in the breeze as the playful harlequin continued to beckon passersby into his otherworldly kingdom refreshed revered audience relaxed good because its time now for our second routine you may not know the name p t selbit but if youve been to any magic shows at all or seen illusionists on television youre probably familiar with some of the tricks this englishman made popular in the early s selbit began his career performing under his real name percy thomas tibbies but he soon learned that such a mild name didnt suit a performer whose forte wasnt card tricks vanishing doves or levitating children but sadomasochistic routines that shocked and therefore of course drew crowds throughout the world selbit yes his stage name was the reverse of his surname created the famous living pincushion in which a girl was apparently skewered with eightyfour needlesharp spikes another of his creations was the fourth dimension a routine where audiences watched in horror as a young woman was seemingly crushed to death under a huge box one of my favorites of selbits was a routine he introduced in the title says it all revered audience the idol of blood or destroying a girl today im delighted to present to you an updated variation of selbits most renowned illusion one that he presented in dozens of countries and that he was invited to perform at the royal command variety performance in the london hippodrome its known as ah but no no revered audience i think ill keep you in suspense and refrain for the moment from mentioning the name of the illusion but ill give you one clue when selbit was performing this routine he instructed his assistants to pour fake blood into the gutters in front of the theater to tantalize passersby and get them to buy tickets which naturally they did enjoy our next routine i hope you will i know of one person who most certainly wont chapter ten how much sleep the young man wondered the play had ended at midnight then thered been drinks at the white horse until who knew when home at three on the phone for forty minutes with bragg no maybe an hour then the ridiculous plumbing had started up its ridiculous banging at how many hours sleep was that then the math eluded tony calvert and he decided that it was probably better not to know too much about the extent of his exhaustion at least he was working on broadway and not doing advertising shoots where you started work sometimes at heaven help us a m his afternoon call at the gielgud theater tidily made up for the fact that he had to work saturdays and sundays he surveyed the tools of his trade and decided he needed some more tattoo concealer since chiselchin boy was standing in today and the ladies from teaneck and garden city might wonder about the credibility of a leading man who lusted after the ingénue starlet when his ample biceps said love forever robert calvert closed the big yellow makeup case and glanced in the mirror by the door he looked better than he felt he had to admit his complexion still retained a bit of the tan from the glorious march trip down to st thomas and his trim build belied the dumpy sluggishness churning in his belly gods sake keep it to four beers okay hello can we live with that his eyes though yep pretty red but thats easily taken care of a stylist knows hundreds of ways to make the old look young the plain look beautiful and the weary look alert he attacked with eyedrops and then followed through with the coup de grace a swipe or two with an undereye touchup stick calvert pulled on his leather jacket locked the door and started down the hallway of his east village apartment building quiet now a few minutes before noon most of the people in the building he guessed were outside enjoying the first truly nice spring weekend this year or were still sleeping off their own debaucheries he used the back exit as he always did which deposited him in the alleyway behind the building starting for the sidewalk forty feet away he noticed something motion down one of the culdesacs leading off the alley he stopped and squinted into the dimness an animal jesus was that a rat but no it was a cat apparently injured he looked around but the alleyway was completely deserted no sign of its owner oh the poor thing calvert wasnt a pet person but hed sat for a neighbors norwich terrier last year and remembered the man telling him that just in case bilbos vet was around the corner on st marks hed take the cat in on the way to the subway maybe his sisterd want it she adopted children why not cats lingering in alleys wasnt the best idea in this neighborhood but calvert saw that he was still completely alone he moved slowly over the cobblestones so he wouldnt spook the animal it was lying on its side meowing faintly could he pick it up would it try to scratch him he remembered something in prevention about catscratch fever but the animal looked too weak to hurt him hey whats the matter fella he asked in a soothing voice you hurt crouching down he set his makeup case on the cobblestones and reached out carefully in case the cat took a swipe at him he touched it but then drew his hand back in shock the animal was icecold and emaciated he could feel stiff bones beneath the skin had it just died but no the leg was still moving and it uttered another faint meow he touched it again and wait those werent bones under the skin they were rods and inside its body was a metal box what the fuck was this was he on candid camera or was some asshole just ragging him then he glanced up and saw someone ten feet away calvert gasped and reared back a man was crouching but no he realized it was his own image reflected in a fulllength mirror sitting in the corner at the end of the dark alley calvert saw his face shocked eyes wide frozen for a moment he started to relax and laughed but then he frowned watching himself slowly falling forward as the mirror pivoted to the cobblestones and shattered the bearded middleaged man hiding behind it charged forward raising a large piece of pipe no help me the young man cried scrabbling away my god my god the pipe swung down in a fierce arc directly toward his head but calvert grabbed the makeup case fast and thrust it toward the attacker deflecting the blow he struggled to his feet and began to run the assailant started after him but slipped on the slick cobblestones and went down hard on one knee take the wallet take it he pulled his billfold from his pocket and flung it behind him but the man ignored it and rose continuing after him he was between calvert and the street the only escape was back into the building oh jesus jesus lord help me help me help me keys he thought get them now fishing them out of his jeans as he gave a brief glance behind him the man was only thirty feet or so away if i dont get the door unlocked on the first try thats it im dead calvert didnt even slow down he slammed hard into the metal door and a miracle slid the key home instantly turning it fast the latch opened he pulled the key out and leaped through the doorway slamming the steel door shut behind him it locked automatically heart pounding fiercely gasping in fear he rested only for a moment thinking mugger gaybasher druggie didnt matter he thought im not letting the prick get away he ran up the hall to his apartment this door too he opened fast he leaped inside swinging it shut after him and locking it hurrying into the kitchen he seized the phone and dialed a moment later a womans voice said police and fire emergency a man a man just attacked me hes outside are you injured no but you have to send the police he shouted hurry is he there with you no he didnt get in i locked the doors but he could still be in the alley you have to hurry what was that calvert wondered he felt a sudden breeze against his face the sensation was familiar and he realized that it was the feeling of crossventilation when someone opened the front door to his apartment the operator asked hello sir are you there can you calvert spun toward the door and cried out seeing the bearded man with the pipe standing only a few feet from him calmly unplugging the phone line from the wall the doors how did he get through the locks calvert backed away as far as he could against the refrigerator there was nowhere else to go what he whispered noting the scars on the mans neck his deformed left hand what do you want the assailant ignored him for a moment and looked around first at the kitchen table then at the large wooden coffee table in the living room something about the sight of it seemed to please him he turned back and when he brought the pipe down on calverts raised arms the swing seemed almost like an afterthought they rolled up silent two rmps two officers in each the sergeant climbed out of the first squad car before itd braked to a stop only six minutes had elapsed since the call came in even though the call had been cut off central knew which building and apartment it had been placed from thanks to callerid technology six minutes if they were lucky theyd find the vic alive and well if they were less lucky at least the doerd still be in the apartment shopping through the vics valuables he called in on his motorola sergeant four five three one to central im teneightyfour on the scene of that assault on nine street k roger four five three one ems bus en route injuries k dont know yet out roger four five out he sent one of his men around to the back to cover the service door and the rear windows and told another to stay in the front the third officer trotted with the sergeant toward the lobby if they were lucky the perpd jump out a window and break an ankle the sergeant wasnt in any mood to run assholes to ground on this fine day this was alphabet city its name courtesy of the northsouth avenues here a b c how fast i can cook some smack and shoot up it was improving slowly but was still one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in manhattan both cops had their weapons drawn by the time they approached the door if they were lucky hed be armed only with a knife or something like what that cluckhead gone on crack had threatened him with last week a chopstick and garbage can lid for a shield well they got one break at least they didnt have to find somebody to let them through the security door an elderly woman listing against the weight of a shopping bag that sprouted a huge pineapple was on her way out blinking in surprise she held the door open for the two cops and they hurried inside answering her question about their presence with a noncommittal nothing to be concerned about maam if were lucky apartment j was on the ground floor toward the back the sergeant positioned himself to the left of the door the other officer opposite glanced at him and nodded the sergeant rapped hard with his big knuckles police open the door open it now no response from inside police he tried the knob more luck it was unlocked the sergeant shoved the door open and both men stood back waiting finally the sergeant peeked round the corner oh christ on earth he whispered when he saw what was in the center of the living room the word luck vanished from his thoughts entirely the secret to successful protean magic quick change is making distinct but simple changes to your appearance and demeanor while simultaneously distracting your audience with misdirection and no change was more distinctive than turning yourself into a seventyfiveyearold bag woman malerick had known the police would arrive quickly so after the brief performance in tony calverts apartment he did a fast change into one of his escape outfits a highnecked blue dress and a white wig he pulled his elasticized jeans above the hemline of the dress revealing opaque support hose the beard came off and he applied a heavy base of eccentriclady rouge he painted on excessive eyebrow liner several dozen strokes with a thin sienna pencil gave him septuagenarian wrinkles a change of shoes as for the misdirection hed found a shopping bag and filled the bottom with newspaper along with the pipe and the other weapon hed used for his routine and added a large fresh pineapple from calverts kitchen if he met anyone as he left the building they might glance at him but theyd focus on the sizable pineapple which is just what happened as he politely held the door open for the arriving officers now a quarter mile from the building still dressed as the woman he stopped and leaned against the wall of a building as if he were catching his breath then he eased into a dim alley with one tug the dress held together by tiny velcro dots came off this garment and the wig went under a footwide elastic band he wore around his stomach which compressed the items and made them invisible under his shirt he tugged his pants cuffs down took makeupremoval pads from a baggie in his pocket and wiped his face until the rouge wrinkles and eyebrow pencil were gone checking to make sure with a small pocket mirror the pads he dropped into the shopping bag with the pineapple which he in turn placed in a green garbage bag he found a car illegally parked picked the lock to the trunk and tossed the bag inside the police would never think to search the trunks of parked cars and anyway the odds were that the car would be towed before the owner returned back on the street heading for one of the west side subways and what did you think of our second act revered audience he himself thought it had gone well considering that because hed slipped on the damn cobblestones the performer had gotten away and managed to close and lock two doors but by the time malerick had gotten to the back door of calverts building he had his picking tools in hand malerick had studied the fine art of lockpicking for years it was one of the first skills his mentor had taught him a picker uses two tools a tension wrench which is inserted into the lock and twisted to keep pressure on the locking pins inside and the pick itself which pushes each pin out of the way so the lock can be turned to the open position it can be timeconsuming to push aside the pins one at a time though so malerick had mastered a very difficult technique called scrubbing in which you move the pick back and forth quickly brushing the pins out of the way scrubbing only works when the lockpicker senses exactly the right combination of torque on the cylinder and pressure on the pins using tools that were only a few inches long it had taken malerick less than thirty seconds to scrub open the locks in both the back door and the apartment door of calverts place does that seem impossible revered audience but thats the job of illusionists you know rendering the impossible real pausing outside the subway he bought a new york times and flipped through it as he studied passersby again it seemed that no one had followed him he trotted down the stairs to catch the train a truly cautious performer might have waited a bit longer to be absolutely sure he wasnt being tailed but malerick didnt have much time the next routine would be a difficult one hed set quite major challenges for himself and he had to make some preparations he didnt dare risk disappointing his audience chapter eleven its bad rhyme amelia sachs was speaking into the stalk mike as she stood in the doorway of apartment j in the heart of alphabet city earlier that morning lon sellitto had ordered all dispatchers at central to call him immediately with news of any homicide in new york city when a report came in about this particular killing they concluded that it was the work of the conjurer the mysterious way the killer had gained access to the mans apartment was one clue the clincher though was that hed smashed the victims wristwatch just as hed done with the students at the first killing that morning one thing that was different was the cause of death which had prompted sachss comment to rhyme while sellitto gave commands to the detectives and patrol officers in the hall sachs studied the unfortunate vic a young man named anthony calvert he lay on his back in the middle of the coffee table in the living room spreadeagled hands and feet tied to the legs of the table his abdomen had been sawn completely through down to his spine sachs now described the injury to rhyme well said the criminalist unemotionally consistent consistent id say hes keeping with the magic theme ropes in the first killing cutting someone in half now his voice rose as he called across the room presumably to kara thats a magic trick right cutting somebody in half a pause and then he was addressing sachs again she said its a classic illusionist trick he was right she realized shed been shocked at the sight and hadnt made the connection between the two killings an illusionist trick though grotesque mutilation described it better keep detached she told herself a sergeant would be detached but then a thought occurred to her rhyme you think what you think he was alive when the perp started cutting his handsre tied to the table legs spreadeagle oh you mean maybe he left something for us some clue about the killers identity good no she said softly thinking about the pain oh that oh that blood workll tell then she noticed a major bluntobject trauma to calverts temple that wound hadnt bled much which suggested that his heart had stopped beating soon after the skull had been crushed no rhyme looks like the cutting was postmortem she vaguely heard the criminalists voice talking to his aide telling thom to write this on the evidence chart he was saying something else but she wasnt paying any attention the sight of the victim gripped her hard and wouldnt let go but this was as she wanted it yes she could give up the dead the way all crimescene cops had to do and in a moment she would but death she felt deserved a moment of stillness sachs did this not out of any sense of spirituality though or abstract respect for the dead no it was for herself so that her heart would resist hardening to stone a process that happened all too frequently in this calling she realized that rhyme was talking to her what she asked i was wondering any weapons no sign of them but i havent searched yet a sergeant and a uniformed officer joined sellitto in the doorway been talking to the neighbors one of them said nodding toward the body then doing a double take she guessed he hadnt seen the carnage upclose yet vic was a nice quiet guy everybody liked him gay but not into rough trade or anything hadnt been seeing anybody for a while sachs nodded then said into her mike doesnt sound like he knew the killer rhyme we didnt think that was likely now did we the criminalist said the conjurers got a different agenda whatever the hell it is what line of work she asked the officers makeup artist and stylist for one of the theaters on broadway we found his case in the alley you know hair spray makeup brushes sachs wondered if calvert had ever been hired by commercial photographers and if so if hed worked on her when shed been with the chantelle modeling agency on madison avenue unlike many photographers and the ad agency account people makeup artists treated models as if they were human beings an account exec might offer all right lets get her painted and see what she looks like and the makeup artist would mutter excuse me i didnt know she was a picket fence an asianamerican detective from the ninth precinct which covered this part of town walked up to the doorway hanging up his cell phone how bout this one huh he asked breezily how bout it sellitto muttered any idea how he got away the vic called nineoneone himself your respondings mustve got to the scene in ten minutes six the detective said a sergeant said we rolled up silent and covered all the doors and windows when we got inside the body was still warm im talking ninetyeight point six we did a doortodoor but no sign of the doer wits the sergeant nodded the only person in the hall when we got here was this old lady she was the one let us in when she gets back well talk to her maybe she got a look at him she left sellitto asked yeah rhyme had heard you know who it was dont you goddamn the policewoman snapped the detective said no its okay we left cards under everybodys door shell call us back no she wont sachs said sighing that was the doer her the sergeant asked his voice high he laughed she wasnt a her sachs explained she only looked like an old lady hey officer sellitto said lets not get too paranoid the guy cant do a sexchange operation or anything yes he can remember what kara told us it was her lieutenant want to bet in her ear rhymes voice said im not taking odds on that one sachs the sergeant said defensively she was like seventy years old or something and carrying a big bag of groceries a pineapple look she said and pointed to the kitchen counter on which were two spiky leaves next to them was a little card on a rubber band courtesy of dole offering tasty recipes for fresh pineapple hell theyd had him he was inches away from them and rhyme continued he probably had the murder weapon in the grocery bag she repeated this to the increasingly sullen detective from the nine you didnt see her face right she asked the sergeant not really just glanced at her it was like you know all made up covered with whats that stuff my grandmother used to wear it rouge sachs asked yeah and paintedon eyebrows well well find her now she he cantve got that far rhyme said hes changed clothes again sachs probably dumped them nearby she said to the asian detective hes wearing something else now but the sergeant here can give you a description of the clothes you should send a detail to check out the dumpsters and the alleyways around here the detective frowned coolly and looked sachs up and down a cautionary glance from sellitto reminded her that an important part of becoming sergeant was not acting like one until you actually were he then authorized the search and the detective picked up his radio and called it in sachs suited up in the tyvek overalls and walked the grid in the hall and the alleyway where she found the strangest bit of evidence shed ever come across a toy black cat she then ran the gruesome scene in the young mans apartment processed the body and assembled the evidence she was heading for her car when sellitto stopped her hey hold on officer he hung up his phone on which hed apparently just had a difficult conversation to judge from his scowl ive gotta meet with the captain and dep com about the conjurer case but i need you to do something for me were going to add somebody to the team i want you to pick him up sure but why somebody else cause weve had two bodies in four hours and therere no fucking suspects he snapped and that means the brass arent happy and heres your first lesson about being a sergeant when the brass aint happy you aint happy the bridge of sighs this was the aerial walkway connecting the two soaring towers of the manhattan detention center on center street in downtown manhattan the bridge of sighs the route walked by the grandest mafiosos with a hundred hired kills to their names walked by terrified young men whod done nothing more than take a sammy sosa baseball bat to the asshole whod knocked up their sister or cousin by edgy cluckheads whod killed a tourist for fortytwo dollars cause i needed the crack needed the rock needed it man i needed it amelia sachs crossed the bridge now on her way to detention technically the bernard b kerik complex but still known informally as the tombs a nickname inherited from the original city jail located across the street here high above the governmental hood of the city sachs gave her name to a guard surrendered her glock shed left her unofficial weapon a switchblade in the camaro and entered the secure lobby on the other side of a noisy electric door it groaned shut a few minutes later the man she was here to pick up came out of a nearby prisoner interview room trim in his late thirties with thinning brown hair and a faint grin molded into his easygoing face he wore a black sports coat over a blue dress shirt and jeans amelia hey there came the drawl so i can hitch a ride with you up to lincoln s place hi rol you bet detective roland bell unbuttoned his jacket and she caught a glimpse of his belt he too in accordance with regs was weaponless but she noticed two empty holsters on bell s midriff she remembered when they worked together they often compared stories of driving nails a southernism for shooting one of his hobbies and for sachs a competitive sport two men whod also been in the prisoner interview room joined them one was in a suit a detective shed met before crewcut luis martinez a quiet man with fast careful eyes the second man wore saturday business clothes khaki slacks and a black izod shirt under a faded windbreaker he was introduced to sachs as charles grady though sachs knew him by sight the assistant district attorney was a celebrity among new york law enforcers the lean middleaged harvard law grad had remained in the das office long after most prosecutors had fled to more lucrative pastures pit bull and tenacious were just two of the many clichés the press regularly applied to him he was likened favorably to rudolph giuliani unlike the former mayor however grady had no political aspirations he was content to stay in the prosecutors office and pursue his passion which he described simply as putting bad guys in jail and which he happened to be damn good at his conviction record was one of the best in the history of the city bell was here thanks to gradys current case the state was prosecuting a fortyfiveyearold insurance agent who lived in a small rural town in upstate new york andrew constable was known less for writing homeowners policies though than for his local militia group the patriot assembly he was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and hate crimes and the case had been moved down here on a changeofvenue motion as the trial date approached grady had begun to get death threats then a few days ago the prosecutor had received a call from the office of fred dellray an fbi agent who often worked with rhyme and sellitto dellray was currently in parts unknown on a classified antiterrorist assignment but fellow agents had learned that a serious attempt on gradys life might be imminent thursday night or early friday morning gradys office had been burglarized at that point the decision was made to call roland bell the softspoken north carolina natives official assignment was working homicide and other major crimes with lon sellitto but he also headed up an unofficial division of nypd detectives known as swat which wasnt the same famous acronym that every viewer of cops knows this version stood for the saving the witnesss ass team bell had as he expressed it this sorta knack for keeping people alive other people want dead the result was that in addition to his regular investigation caseload with sellitto and rhyme bell ended up doing double duty running the protection detail but now gradys bodyguards were in place and the brass downtown the unhappy brass had decided to gear up the effort to nail the conjurer more muscle was needed on the sellittorhyme team and bell was a logical choice so that was andrew constable grady said to bell with a nod through the greasy window into the interview room sachs stepped to the window and saw a slim rather distinguishedlooking prisoner in an orange jumpsuit sitting at a table his head down nodding slowly he what you expected grady continued dont reckon bell drawled was thinkin hed be more hill country more of a blueprint bigot you know what i mean but that fella hes fair mannerable fact is charles i have to say he didnt feel guilty sure doesnt grady grimaced gonna be hard to get a conviction then a wry laugh but thats what they pay me the big bucks for gradys salary was less than that of a firstyear associate at a wall street law firm bell asked anything more about the breakin at your office the preliminary crime scene report ready yet i need to see it its being expedited well make sure you get a copy bell said we got another situation needs looking into ill leave my fellows and girls with you and your family but ill be a phone call away thanks detective grady said he then added my daughter says hi weve got to get her together with your boys and meet that lady friend of yours wheres she live again lucys down in north carolina shes police too right yep acting head of the sheriffs department metropolis of tanners corner luis martinez noticed grady start for the door and he was instantly at the prosecutors side you just want to wait here for a minute charles the bodyguard left the secure area and retrieved his pistol from the guard who oversaw the lockbox behind the desk and looked over the hallway and bridge carefully it was then that a soft voice sounded behind them hello miss sachs detected in the words a particular lilt formed by a history of service labor and contact with the public she turned and saw andrew constable standing next to a huge guard the prisoner was quite tall his posture completely erect his saltandpepper hair was wavy and thick his short round lawyer stood next to him he continued are you part of the team looking out for mr grady andrew his lawyer cautioned the prisoner nodded but kept his eyebrow raised as he looked at sachs its not my case she said to him dismissively ah no was just going to tell you what i told detective bell i honestly dont know anything about those threats against mr grady he turned to bell who gazed back at the suspect the tarheel cop could sometimes look bashful and reserved but that was never the case when confronting a suspect a cool glare was his response now you have to do your job i understand that but believe me i wouldnt hurt mr grady one of the things that made this country great is playing fair a laugh ill beat him at trial which i will do thanks to my brilliant young friend here a nod toward his lawyer then a look of curiosity at bell one thing i wanted to mention detective i was wondering if you might have some interest in what my patriotsve been doing up in canton falls me oh i dont mean that crazy conspiracy nonsense i mean what were really about the prisoners lawyer said come on andrew better to keep quiet just conversing here joe a glance at bell how bout it how dyou mean sir bell asked stiffly the expected allusion to racism and the detectives southern roots didnt rear its head he said states rights working folk local government versus federal you should go to our website detective he laughed people expect swastikas they get thomas jefferson and george mason when bell said nothing a thick silence filled the close air around them the prisoner shook his head then he laughed and looked abashed lord sorry me sometimes i just cant stop myself all this ridiculous preaching get a few people around me and look what happens i outstay my welcome the guard said lessgo all right then the prisoner responded a nod to sachs one to bell he shuffled down the hall to the faint clink of the shackles on his legs his lawyer nodded to the prosecutor two adversaries who respected and yet were wary of each other and left the secure area a moment later grady bell and sachs followed and joined martinez the policewoman said doesnt seem like a monster whatre the charges exactly grady said some atf folk working undercover on a weapons sting upstate found out about this plot we think constable was behind some of his people were going to lure state troopers to remote areas of the county on fake nineoneone calls if any of them were black they were going to kidnap them strip them naked and lynch em oh there was some suggestion of castration too sachs whod dealt with plenty of terrible crimes in her years on the force blinked in shock at this horrific news are you serious grady nodded and that was just the start of it it seems the lynchings were all part of a grand plan they were hoping that if they murdered enough troopers and the media televised the hangings the blacksd rise up in some kind of revolt thatd give the whites around the country the chance to retaliate and wipe them out they were hoping the latinos and asians would join the blacks and the white revolution could take them out too in this day and age youd be surprised bell nodded to luis hes in your care now stay close you bet the detective responded grady and the slim bodyguard left the detention lobby while sachs and bell retrieved their weapons from the checkin desk as they returned to the courthouse portion of the criminal courts building walking over the bridge of sighs sachs told bell about the conjurer and his victims bell winced hearing about anthony calverts gruesome death motive dont know pattern ditto whats the perp look like bell asked little dicey on that part too nothin at all we think hes a white male medium build so nobodys got a look at him huh actually a lot of people have except the first time they did he was a darkhaired bearded male in his fifties next time he was a bald janitor in his sixties then he was a woman in her seventies bell waited for her to laugh signifying that this was a joke when she remained grimfaced he asked this for no foolin fraid it is roland im good bell said shaking his head and tapping the automatic pistol on his right hip but i need a target now theres a prayer for you thought amelia sachs chapter twelve the evidence from the second scene had arrived and mel cooper was arranging the bags and vials on examining tables in rhymes parlor sellitto had just returned from a tense meeting at the big building about the conjurer case the deputy commissioner and the mayor wanted details on the progress of a case about which there were few details and had been no progress rhyme had heard back about the ukrainian illusionists with the cirque fantastique and learned that they had no record the two police officers stationed at the tent had also been checking around the circus and reported no leads or suspicious activity a moment later sachs strode into the room accompanied by the evenkeeled roland bell when sellitto had been ordered to add another detective to the team rhyme had immediately suggested bell he liked the idea of a streetwise cop who was a crack shot backing up sachs in the field greetings and introductions all around bell hadnt been told about kara and she answered his querying glance with im like him a nod toward rhyme sort of a consultant bell said nice to meetcha and blinked to see her absently rolling three coins back and forth over her knuckles simultaneously as sachs went to work on the evidence with cooper rhyme asked who was he the vic name was anthony calvert thirtytwo unmarried well no partner in his case any connection with the student at the music school doesnt seem to be sellitto answered bedding and saulve checked it out what was his job cooper asked makeup stylist on broadway and the first one was a musician and music student rhyme reflected one straight female one gay male victim lived and worked in different neighborhoods what could link the killings he asked any feelgood stuff but since the first crime hadnt been sexual in nature rhyme wasnt surprised when sachs said nope not unless he takes his memories home to bed with him and he gets off on this she stepped to the whiteboard and taped up the digital photos of the body rhyme wheeled closer and studied the gruesome images sick fuck sellitto offered this lethargic observation and the weapon was roland bell asked looks like a crosscut saw cooper said examining some closeups of the wounds bell whod seen his share of carnage as a cop both in north carolina and new york shook his head well now thats a tough shell as rhyme continued to study the pictures he was suddenly aware of an odd noise an erratic hissing from nearby he turned to see kara behind him the sound was her frantic breath she was looking at the pictures of calverts body she ran her hand compulsively over her short hair as she stared transfixed at the photos tearfilled eyes wide in shock her jaw trembled she turned away from the board are you sachs began kara held up a hand closed her eyes breathing hard rhyme knew then seeing the pain in her face that this was it for her shed reached the end his life crimescene work entailed this type of horror her world didnt the risks and dangers in her profession were of course illusory and it was too much to expect civilians to confront this revulsion voluntarily this was a true shame because they needed her help desperately but seeing the horror in her face he knew they couldnt subject her to any more of this violence he wondered if she was going to be sick sachs started toward her but stopped when rhyme shook his head his message he knew they were losing the girl and they had to let her go except that he was wrong kara took another deep breath like a high diver about to plunge off the board and turned back to the pictures a determined look in her eyes shed just been steeling herself to confront the photos again she studied them closely and finally nodded p t selbit she said wiping her blue eyes thats a person from sachs kara nodded mr balzac used to do some of his routines he was an illusionist who lived a hundred years ago he did that routine its called sawing a woman in half thiss the same tied down spreadeagle the saw the only difference is he picked a man for the performance she blinked at the benign word i mean the murder again rhyme asked would only a limited number of people know it nope it was a famous trick even more famous than the vanished man anybody with the slightest knowledge of magic historyd be aware of it he had expected this discouraging answer but said put it on the profile anyway thom then to sachs okay tell us what happened at calverts looks like the vic left through his buildings back entrance on his way to work like he always did the neighbors said he walked past an alley and saw that she pointed to the black toy cat in a plastic bag a toy cat kara looked it over its an automaton like a robot wed call it a feke a feke a prop that the audience is supposed to think is real like a fake knife with a disappearing blade or a coffee cup with a hidden reservoir in it she pushed a switch and suddenly it started to move giving off a realisticsounding meow the vic mustve seen the cat and walked over to it maybe thought it was hurt sachs continued thats how the conjurer got him into the culdesac source rhyme asked cooper singlu manufacturing in hong kong i checked the website the toys available in hundreds of stores around the country rhyme sighed too common to trace was the theme of the case it seemed sachs continued so calvert walked to the cat crouched down to check it out the perp was hiding somewhere and the mirror rhyme interrupted a glance at kara who was nodding illusionists do a lot with mirrors you aim them just right and you can vanish whatever or whoevers behind them completely rhyme recalled the name of her store was smoke mirrors but something went wrong and the vic got away sellitto continued now this is the crazy part we checked the nineoneone tape calvert got back inside and into his apartment then called emergency he told them the attacker was outside the building and the doors were locked but then the line went dead somehow the conjurer got inside maybe the window sachs did you search the fire escape no the window on the escape was locked from the inside still shouldve searched it rhyme said shortly he didnt get in that way there wasnt time well then he mustve had the vics keys the criminalist said there were no latents on them sachs countered only the vics he must have rhyme insisted no kara said he picked the lock impossible rhyme said or maybe hed gotten in before and had a mold made of the key sachs you should go back and check out if he had he picked the lock the young woman said adamantly i guarantee it rhyme shook his head in sixty seconds he got through two doors he couldnt possibly kara sighed im sorry but yeah in sixty seconds he got through two doors and it mightve taken him less than that well lets assume he didnt rhyme said dismissively now the young woman snapped lets assume he did look we cant skip over this it tells us something else about him something important that locked doors dont even slow him up rhyme glanced at sellitto who said i gotta say working larceny i busted a dozen burglars and none of em could get through locks that fast mr balzac has me practicing lock picking ten hours a week kara said i dont have my kit with me but if i did i could open your front door in thirty seconds the deadbolt in sixty and i dont know how to scrub a lock if the conjurer does he could cut that time in half now i know you like all this like evidence stuff but youre wasting your time to have amelia go search for something that isnt there you sure sellitto asked if you dont trust my opinion then whyd you want my help sachs glanced at rhyme he grudgingly accepted karas assessment with a stony nod though privately he was pleased that the woman had shown some grit it made up a lot for the look and the smile he said to thom okay put down on the chart that our boys a master lockpicker too sachs continued no sign of whatever the conjurer used to knock him out bluntobject trauma looks like a pipe probably but he took that with him too the report from latents came in eightynine separate prints from areas of the crime scene near the victim and the places the conjurer most likely touched but rhyme noticed immediately that some of the prints looked odd and on closer examination he could see that they were from the finger cups he didnt bother to scan the others turning to the trace sachs had collected at the scene they found minuscule amounts of the same mineral oil theyd recovered at the music school that morning and more of the latex makeup and alginate detective kuan from the ninth precinct called and reported that a search of the dumpsters around calverts building had turned up no sign of the mans quickchange outfit or the murder weapons rhyme thanked him and told him to keep at it the man said he would but with such fake enthusiasm that rhyme knew the search had already ended the criminalist asked sachs you said he smashed calverts watch yep at noon exactly a few seconds after and the other victim was at eight hes on a timetable looks like and probably has somebody else lined up for four this afternoon less than three hours from now cooper continued no luck with the mirror no manufacturer that mustve been on the frame and he scraped it off a few real prints but theyre covered up by his fingercup smudges so id guess that theyre from the clerk where he bought it or the manufacturer ill send em through apis anyway got some shoes sachs said lifting a bag out of a cardboard box his probably theyre the same ecco brand we found at the music school same size too he left em behind why sellitto wondered rhyme suggested probably thought that we knew he was wearing eccos at the first scene and was worried the respondingsd noticed them on an elderly woman examining the shoes mel cooper said weve got some good trace in the indentation in front of the heel and between the upper and sole he opened a bag and scraped the material out horn o plenty the tech said absently and bent over the dirt it was hardly a cornucopia but for forensic purposes the residue was as big as a mountain and might reveal a wealth of information scope it mel rhyme ordered lets see what weve got the workhorse of tools in a forensic lab is the microscope and although thereve been many refinements over the years the instrument isnt any different in theory from the tiny brassplate microscope that antonie van leeuwenhoek invented in the netherlands in the s in addition to an ancient scanning electron microscope which he rarely needed rhyme had two other microscopes in his homegrown laboratory one was a compound leitz orthoplan an older model but one he swore by it was trinocular two eyepieces for the operator and a camera tube in the middle the second which cooper was preparing to use now was a stereo microscope which the tech had used to examine the fibers from the first scene these instruments have relatively low magnification and are used for examining threedimensional objects like insects and plant materials the image popped onto the computer screen for rhyme and the others to see firstyear criminalistics students invariably click immediately on a microscopes highest power to examine evidence but in reality the best magnification for forensic purposes is usually quite low cooper began at x and then went up to x ah focus focus rhyme called cooper adjusted the highratio screw of the objective so that the image of the material came into perfect clarity okay lets walk through it rhyme said the tech moved the stage with imperceptible twists of the controls connected to the stage as he did hundreds of shapes scrolled past on the screen some black some red or green some translucent rhyme felt as he always did when looking through the eyepiece of a microscope that he was a voyeur examining a world that had no idea it was being spied upon and a world that could be very revealing hairs rhyme said studying a long strand animal he could tell this by the number of scales what kind sachs asked dog id say cooper offered rhyme concurred the tech went online and a moment later was running the images through an nypd database of animal hair got two breeds no three looks like a mediumlengthcoat breed of some land german shepherd or malinois and hairs from two longerhaired breeds english sheepdog briard cooper brought the screen to a stop they were looking at a mass of brownish grains and sticks and tubes whats that long stuff sellitto asked fibers sachs suggested rhyme glanced at it dried grass id say or some kind of vegetation but i dont recognize that other material gc it mel soon the chromatographspectrometer had spit out its data on the monitor a chart appeared giving the results from the analysis bile pigments stercobilin urobilin indole nitrates skatole mercaptans hydrogen sulfide ah ah sellitto asked whats ah command microscope one rhyme commanded the image reappeared on the computer screen and he replied to the detective its obvious dead bacterial matter partially digested fiber and grass its shit oh excuse me for being indelicate he said sarcastically its doggy do our perp stepped where he should not have this was encouraging the hairs and fecal matter were good class evidence and if they found similar trace on a suspect at a particular location or in a car thered be a strong presumption that he was or had contact with the conjurer the fingerprint report on the shards of mirror in the alley came in from the afis system it was negative to no ones surprise what else from the scene rhyme asked zip sachs said thats it rhyme was scanning the evidence charts when the doorbell rang and thom went to answer it a moment later he returned accompanied by a uniformed officer he stood timidly in the doorway as many young law enforcers did when they entered the den of the legendary lincoln rhyme im looking for detective bell i was told he was here thats me bell said crimescene report from the breakin at charles gradys office thanks son the detective took the envelope and nodded to the young man who with a brief intimidated glance at lincoln rhyme turned and left reading the contents bell shrugged not my expertise hey lincoln any chance you could take a look at it sure roland rhyme said pull the staples out and mount it in the turning frame there thomll do it whats the story this about the andrew constable case is he told rhyme about the breakin at charles gradys office when the aide was finished mounting the report rhyme drove into position he read the first page carefully then said command turn page he continued reading the breakin had been accomplished by simply shattering the corner of the glass window in the door to the hall and unlatching it from the inside the door between the secretarys outer office and prosecutors interior office was doublelocked and made of thick wood it had defeated the burglar the cs searchers rhyme noted had found something interesting on and around the secretarys desk were a number of fibers the report indicated only their color mostly white some black and a single red one but nothing else about them they also found two tiny flecks of gold foil the cs team had learned that the breakin had occurred after the cleaning service had finished with the office so the fibers probably had not been left by gradys secretary or anyone legitimately in her office during the day most likely theyd come from the intruder rhyme came to the last page thats it he asked reckon so bell responded a grunt from the criminalist command telephone call peretti comma vincent rhyme had hired peretti as a crimescene cop some years ago and hed proved talented at forensics what hed truly excelled at though was the far more esoteric art of police department politics which unlike rhyme he preferred to the work of actually running crime scenes he was now head of the nypds investigation and resource division which oversaw the crimescene unit when rhyme was finally put through the man asked lincoln how are you fine vince i youre on this conjurer case right hows it going its going listen im calling about something else im here with roland bell ive got the report on the grady office breakin oh the andrew constable thing those threats against grady right what can i do im looking at the report now but its just the preliminary i need some more information crime scene found some fibers i need to know the exact composition of each one length diameter color temperature dyes used and amount of wear hold on ill get a pen a moment later go ahead i also need electrostatics of all the footprints and photos of their patterns on the floor and i want to know everything that was on the secretarys desk credenza and bookshelves everything on any surface in any drawer on the wall and its exact location everything the perp touched okay i guess well no vince everything that was in the office everything paper clips pictures of the secretarys children mold in the top drawer i dont care whether he touched it or not huffy now peretti said ill make sure somebody does it he didnt see why peretti didnt do it himself which is what rhyme would have done even as head of ird to make sure the job got done immediately but in his present role as consultant he had only limited clout sooner is better thanks vince dont mention it the man said coolly they hung up rhyme said to bell not much else i can do roland until we get that information a glance at the breakin report fibers and backwoods militiamen mysteries but at the moment theyd have to remain somebody elses rhyme had his own enigmas to unravel and not much time in which to do so the notations on the evidence chart about the broken watches reminded him that they had less than three hours to stop the

premium on the island even in those days many animals were housed in highrises at least thats what their second and thirdstory quarters would have been considered at the time one such elevated stable can still be found in the borough the wellknown hammerstead riding academy on the upper west side still in its original structure built in the academy features hundreds of stalls above the groundlevel arena which is the site for both private riding lessons and shows a large busy stable like this seems an anomaly in a city like manhattan in the twentyfirst century until you consider that central park s six miles of welltended bridle paths are only a few blocks away ninety horses reside in the academy some privately owned and some for rent and one of these latter variety was now being led down a steep ramp from his stall by a groom a redheaded teenage girl to a waiting rider cheryl marston felt the same thrill she did every saturday at this time of day when she saw the tall feisty horse with the mottled rump of an appaloosa hey donny boy she called her pet name for the animal whose real name was don juan di middleburg a ladies man she often said a joke but true enough under a male rider the animal would shy and whinny and resist from the gitgo but with marston he was putty see you in an hour she told the groom swinging up onto donny boy gripping the supple reins feeling his astonishing muscles beneath her a touch to the ribs and they were on their way out onto eightysixth street moving east slowly toward central park the shod feet clopping loudly on the asphalt drawing everyones attention as they examined both the gorgeous animal and high atop him the thinfaced serious woman dressed in jodhpurs a red jacket and black velvet helmet out of which dangled a long blonde french braid crossing into central park itself marston glanced south and saw in the distance the office building in midtown where she spent fifty hours a week practicing corporate law there were a thousand thoughts that might have overwhelmed her now about the job projects that were frontburnered as one of her partners said with irritating frequency but none of these thoughts intruded at the moment nothing could she was invulnerable to everything when she sat here on one of gods most magnificent creations feeling the sunwarmed loamscented air on her face as donny boy trotted along the dark path surrounded by early jonquils and forsythia and lilacs the first beautiful day this spring for a half hour she circled the reservoir slowly lost in the rapture of that unique connection between two different complementary animals each powerful and smart in its own way she enjoyed a brief canter and then slowed to post in a trot as they came to the sharper turns in the deserted northern part of the park near harlem completely at peace until the worst happened she wasnt sure exactly how it occurred shed slowed to make the turn through a narrow gap between two stands of bushes when a pigeon flew directly into donny boys face whinnying he skidded to a stop so fast that marston was nearly thrown off then he reared and she almost went backward over his rump she grabbed his mane and the front edge of the saddle to keep from falling eight feet to the rocky ground whoa donny she cried trying to pat his neck donny boy its all right whoa still he kept rearing crazed had the collision with the bird hurt his eyes her concern for the horse though was mixed with her own fear sharp rocks jutted from the ground on either side of them if donny boy kept rearing he could lose his balance on the uneven ground and go down hard possibly with her under him nearly all of the serious injuries among her fellow riders werent from tumbling off a horse but were from being caught between the animal and the ground when it fell donny she called breathlessly but he reared again and held the position dancing in panic on his hind legs and edging toward the rocks jesus marston gasped no no she knew then she was going to lose him his feet were clattering on the stones and she felt the huge muscles quivering in his own panic as he sensed his balance go he whinnied loudly knowing shed crush her leg in a dozen places maybe her chest too almost tasting the pain feeling his pain too oh donny then from nowhere a man in a jogging suit stepped from the bushes wideeyed he looked at the horse he jumped forward grabbing bit and bridle no get back marston shouted hes out of control hed get kicked in the head get out of the but what was happening the man was looking not at her but directly into the brown eyes of the horse speaking words she couldnt hear miraculously the appaloosa was calming the rearing stopped donny boy dropped forward onto all four hooves he was fidgety and he still trembled just like her own heart but the worst seemed to be over the man pulled the horses head down close to his and he said a few more words finally he stepped back gave the horse an approving onceover and then glanced up at her are you all right he asked i think so marston inhaled deeply touching her chest i just it was all so fast what happened a bird spooked him flew into his face it mightve hit him in the eyes a close examination looks okay to me you might want to have a vet look at him but i dont see any cuts whatd you do she asked are you a horse whisperer he replied laughing glancing away from her shyly he seemed more comfortable looking into the horses eyes not hardly but i ride a lot i have this calming effect i guess i thought he was going down he gave her a tentative smile wish i could think of something to say thatd calm you down whats good for my horse is good for me i dont know how to thank you another rider approached and the bearded man led donny boy off the path to let the chestnut by he was examining the horse closely whats his name don juan you rent from hammerstead or is he yours hammerstead but i feel like hes mine i ride him every week i rent there too sometimes what a beautiful animal calm now marston examined him more closely he was a handsome man in his early fifties he had a trim beard and thick eyebrows that met above the bridge of his nose on his neck and chest too she could see what looked like bad scarring and his left hand was deformed though none of that mattered to her considering his most important trait he liked horses cheryl marston divorced for the last four of her thirtyeight years realized that they were both sizing each other up he gave a faint laugh and looked away i was his voice faded and he filled the silence by patting donny boys rippled shoulder marston lifted an eyebrow whats that she encouraged well since youre about to ride off into the sunset and i may never see you again he tromped on the shyness and continued boldly i was just wondering if itd be out of line to ask if you want to get some coffee not out of line at all she responded pleased by his straightforward attitude but she added to let him know something about her im going to finish my hour ive got about twenty minutes left got to get back up on the horse so to speak hows that fit with your schedule twenty minutes is perfect ill meet you at the stable good cheryl said oh i never asked you ride english or western bareback mostly i used to be a pro really where believe it or not he answered shyly i rode in the circus chapter fourteen a faint ding resounded from coopers computer indicating hed received an email a note from our friends on ninth and pennsylvania he proceeded to decrypt the message from the fbi lab and a moment later he said the results from the oil its commercially available brand name tackpure used to condition saddles reins leather feeding bags equestrianrelated products horses rhyme spun his storm arrow around and looked at the evidence board no no no whats the matter sachs asked the manure on the conjurers shoes what about it its not from dogs its from horses look at the vegetation what the hell was i thinking of dogsre carnivores they dont eat grass and hay all right lets think the dirt and the mold and the other evidence placed him in central park and the hairs you know that area the dog knoll thats in the park too its right across the street sellitto pointed out where everybody walks their dogs kara he snapped does the cirque fantastique have horses no she said no animal acts at all okay that lets the circus out what else could he be up to the dog knolls right next to the bridle path in the park right its a long shot but maybe he rides or has been checking out riders one of them could be a target maybe not his next one but lets just go on the assumption that it is since its our only goddamn solid lead sellitto said theres a stable someplace around here isnt there ive seen it nearby sachs said its in the eighties i think find out rhyme called and get some people over there sachs glanced at the clock it was p m well weve got some time two and a half hours till the next victim good sellitto said ill get surveillance teams set up in the park and around the stable if theyre in place by twothirty thatll be plenty of time to spot him then rhyme noticed kara frowning what is it he asked her you know im not sure you do have that much time why i was telling you about misdirection i remember well theres also time misdirection thats tricking the audience by making them think somethings going to happen at one time when it really happens at another like an illusionistll repeat an act at regular intervals the audience subconsciously comes to believe that whatever hes doing has to happen only at those times but what the performer does then is shorten the time between the intervals the audience isnt paying attention and they completely miss whatever hes doing you can spot a timemisdirection trick because the illusionist always lets the audience know what the interval is like breaking the watches sachs asked exactly rhyme asked so you dont think we have until four kara shrugged we might maybe hes planned to kill three people every four hours and then hell murder the fourth victim only one hour later i dont know we dont know anything here rhyme said firmly what do you think kara what would you do she gave a troubled laugh being asked to step into the mind of a killer after a moment of hard debate she said he knows youve found the watches by now he knows youre smart he doesnt need to hammer it home anymore if i were him id be going after the next victim before four id be going after him right now thats good enough for me rhyme said forget surveillance and forget soft clothes lon call haumann and get esu into the park in a big way it might scare him off linc if hes in disguise and doing his own surveillance i think we have to take that chance tell esu were looking for who knows what the hell were looking for give him a general description as best you can fiftyyearold killer sixtyyearold janitor seventyyearold bag lady cooper looked up from his computer got the stable hammerstead riding academy bell sellitto and sachs started for the door kara said i want to go too no rhyme said there may be something ill notice some sleight or a quickchange move by somebody in a crowd i could spot it a nod toward the other cops they might not no its too dangerous no civilians on a tactical operation thats the rule i dont care about the rules the young woman said leaning toward him defiantly i can help kara but the young woman silenced him by glancing at the crimescene photos of tony calvert and svetlana rasnikov then turning back to lincoln rhyme with a cold expression in her eyes in this simple gesture she reminded him that it was he whod asked her here he whod brought her into his world and transformed her from an innocent into someone who could now look at these horrors without flinching all right rhyme said then nodding toward sachs he added but stay close to her she was cautious malerick observed as befitted any woman whod just been picked up by a man in manhattan even if that stranger was shy friendly and able to calm rearing horses still cheryl marston was relaxing little by little enjoying the tales of his times riding bareback with a circus all of which were embellished considerably to keep her amused and to whittle down her defenses after the groom and the vet on call at hammerstead had examined donny boy and declared him in good health malerick and his next unwitting performer strolled from the stable to this restaurant which was just off riverside drive the woman now chatted amiably with john his persona for their date about her life in the city her early love of horses the ones shed owned or ridden her hopes of buying a summer place in middleburg virginia he responded with occasional bits of equine lore what he could deduce from her comments and what he knew from circuses and the world of illusion animals have always been an important part of the profession mesmerizing them vanishing them turning them into different species an illusionist created a hugely popular routine in the s instantly transforming a chicken into a duck the method was simplicity itself the duck made his entrance wearing a quickchange chicken costume killing and resurrecting animals was popular in less politically correct times though they were rarely actually harmed after all its a rather inept illusionist who has to really kill an animal to create the illusion that its dead it tends to be expensive too for his routine in central park today to snare cheryl marston malerick had drawn on the routines of howard thurston a popular illusionist in the early s who specialized in animal acts the trick malerick performed wouldntve met with thurstons approval though the famous illusionist had treated the animals in his act as if they were human assistants if not family members malerick had been less humane hed captured a pigeon by hand hed then turned it on its back and stroked the neck and sides slowly until it was hypnotized a technique magicians have used for years to create the appearance of a dead bird as cheryl marston approached on her horse hed flung the pigeon hard into the horses face donny boys rearing in pain and fright had nothing to do with the bird though but was caused by an ultrasonic pitch generator set to a frequency that stung the horses ears as malerick stepped out of the bushes to rescue cheryl he shut the generator off and by the time he grabbed the bridle the horse was calming now little by little the equestrian was growing even less cautious as she learned how much they had in common or appeared to this illusion was due to malericks use of mentalism not one of his strongest skills but one that he was competent at mentalism has nothing to do with telepathically discerning someones thoughts of course its a combination of mechanical and psychological techniques to deduce facts malerick was now doing what the best mentalists did body reading it was called as opposed to mind reading he was noting very subtle changes in cheryls poses and facial expressions and gestures in response to comments he made some told him he was straying from her thoughts others that he was on the mark he mentioned for instance a friend whod just been through a divorce and he could see easily that she had too and shed been on the receiving end so grimacing he told her that he was divorced and that his wifed had an affair and left him it had devastated him but he was now recovering i gave up a boat she said sourly just to get away from that sonofabitch a twentyfourfoot sailboat malerick also used barnum statements to make her think they had more in common than they did the classic example was a mentalist sizing up his subject and offering gravely i sense youre often extroverted but at times you find yourself quite shy which is interpreted as insightful but of course applies to nearly everybody on earth neither the fictional john nor cheryl had children both had cats divorced parents and a love of tennis look at all these coincidences a match made in heaven almost time he thought though he was in no hurry even if the police had some leads to what he was up to theyd be thinking he wouldnt kill anyone again until it was now just after two you may think revered audience that the world of illusion never intersects the world of reality but thats not wholly true i think of john mulholland the renowned magician and editor of the magic magazine the sphinx he abruptly announced his early retirement from magic and journalism in the nineteen fifties no one could figure out why but then the rumors began rumors that hed started working for the american intelligence community to teach spies how to use magic techniques to deliver drugs in such subtle ways that even the most paranoid communist didnt know he was being given a mickey what do you see in my hands revered audience look closely at my fingers nothing right they seem empty and yet as youve probably guessed they arent now using one of mulhollands smoother clandestine drugging techniques malerick picked up his spoon with his left hand as he tapped it absently on the tabletop cheryl glanced at it a mere fraction of a second but it gave malerick enough time to empty a tiny capsule of tasteless powder into her coffee as he reached for the sugar with his other hand john mulholland wouldve been proud after a few moments malerick could see that the drug was having its effect her eyes were slightly unfocused and she was weaving as she sat she didnt sense anything was wrong though that was the good thing about flunitrazepam the famous daterape drug rohypnol you didnt know youd been drugged not until the next morning which in cheryl marstons case wasnt going to be an issue he looked at her and smiled hey you want to see something fun fun she asked drowsily she blinked smiling broadly he paid the check and then said to her i just bought a boat she laughed in delight a boat i love boats what kind sailboat thirtyeight feet my wife and i had one malerick added sadly she got it in the divorce john no youre kidding me she said laughing groggily my husband and i had one he got ours in the divorce really he laughed and stood hey lets walk down to the river you can see it from there id love to she rose unsteadily and took his arm he steered her through the doorway the dosage seemed right she was submissive but she wasnt going to pass out before he got her into the bushes next to the hudson they headed toward riverside park you were talking about boats she said drunkenly thats right my ex and i had one she said i know malerick said you told me oh did i cheryl laughed hold on he said i have to get something he stopped at his car a stolen mazda and took a heavy gym bag from the backseat locked the car again from inside the bag came a loud clank of metal cheryl glanced at it began to speak but then seemed to forget what she was going to say lets go this way malerick led her to the end of the cross street across a pedestrian bridge over the parkway and down into an overgrown deserted strip of land on the riverbank he disengaged her arm from his and gripped her firmly around the back and under the arm he felt her breast with his fingers as her head lolled against him look she said pointing unsteadily into the hudson where dozens of sailboats and cabin cruisers moved over the sparkling darkblue water malerick said my boats down there i like boats so do i he said softly really she asked laughing and adding in a whisper that guess what she and her exhusband had had one but shed lost it in the divorce chapter fifteen the riding academy was a slice of old new york smelling powerful barn scent amelia sachs looked through an archway into the interior of the woody old place at the horses and atop them riders all of whom looked stately in their tan pants black or red riding jackets velvet helmets a halfdozen uniformeds from the nearby twentieth precinct stood in and outside the lobby more officers were in the park under the command of lon sellitto deployed around the bridle path looking for their elusive prey sachs and bell walked into the office and the detective flashed his gold shield to the woman behind the counter she looked over his shoulder at the officers outside and asked uneasily yes is there a problem maam do you use tackpure to treat the saddles and leather she glanced at an assistant who nodded yessir we do we use a lot of it bell continued we found traces of some and of some horse manure at the scene of a homicide today we think the suspect in that killing might work here or be stalking one of your employees or a rider no who thats what were not sure about sorry to say and were not sure of the suspects appearance either all we know is hes average build around fifty years old white might have a beard and brown hair but we arent sure fingers on his left hand might be deformed what we need is for you to talk to your employees regular customers too if therere any hereabouts and see if theyve noticed anybody fitting that description or anybody who seems like theyd be a threat of course she said uncertainly ill do whatever i can sure bell took several of the uniformed patrol officers and disappeared through an old doorway into the pungent sawdustfilled riding arena well do a search he called back to sachs the policewoman nodded and looked out the window checking on kara who sat alone in sellittos unmarked car parked at the curb next to sachss deepyellow camaro the young woman wasnt happy being confined in the car but sachs had been adamant about her staying out of danger roberthoudin had tighter tricks than the marabouts though i think they almost killed him dont worry ill make sure that doesnt happen to you sachs glanced at the clock p m she radioed in to central and had the transmission patched into rhymes phone a moment later the criminalist came on the line sachs lons teams havent seen anything in central park any luck with you the managers interviewing staff and riders here at the academy roland and his team are searching the stables she then noticed the manager with a cluster of employees there were assorted frowns and looks of concern on their faces one girl a roundfaced redhead suddenly raised her hand to her mouth in shock she began to nod hold on rhyme may have something the manager beckoned sachs over and the teenager said i dont know if its like anything important but theres one thing whats your name tracey she answered as if she were asking im a groom here go ahead okay what it is is theres this rider who comes in every saturday cheryl marston rhyme shouted into sachss ear at the same time ask her if she comes in at the same time every week sachs relayed the question oh yeah she does the girl said shes like you know clockwork been coming here for years the criminalist noted people with regular habitsre easiest to target tell her to go on and what about her tracey today she comes back from a ride about a half hour ago and what it is is she hands off don juan to me thats like her favorite horse and she wants me and the vet to check him out careful because a bird flew into his face and spooked him so were looking him over and shes telling me about this guy who came along and calmed donny down we tell her that donny looks fine and shes going on about this guy yadda yadda yadda and how interesting he is and shes all excited cause shes going to have coffee with him and he might be a real horse whisperer i saw him downstairs waiting for her and the thing is im like whats wrong with his hand cause he kinda hid it you know it looked like he only had three fingers thats him sachs said do you know where they were going she pointed west away from the park i think that way she didnt say where exactly get a description rhyme called the girl explained that he had a beard and his eyebrows were odd all kind of grown together to alter a face the most important thing is the eyebrows change those and the face is sixty seventy percent different wearing she asked a windbreaker running shoes jogging pants color the jacket and pants were dark blue or black i didnt see his shirt bell returned with his officers and muttered not a burr on the dog got a lead here she explained about the rider and the bearded man then asked the girl and youre pretty sure she didnt know this guy no way ms marston and me weve known each other for a while and she told me shes like totally off dating doesnt trust men her ex he cheated on her and then in the divorce he got the sailboat shes still pissed about that the best illusionists my friends engage in a practice known as routining that means planning the order and the pacing of their acts carefully to make the performances as intense as possible for our third act today we first saw our animal illusion featuring wonderhorse donny boy in central park then we slowed the pace with some classic sleight of hand combined with a touch of mentalism and now we turn to escapism well see what is perhaps harry houdinis most famous escape in this routine which he developed himself he was bound hung by his heels and submerged in a narrow tank of water he had only a few minutes to try to bend upward from the waist release his ankles and open the locked top of the chamber before he drowned the tank was of course prepared the bars apparently intended to keep the glass from shattering were actually handholds that let him pull himself up to reach his ankles the locks on his feet and the top of the tank itself had hidden latches that would instantly release his ankles and the lid our recreation of the famous escapists popular feat needless to say doesnt offer such features our performer will be on her own and ive added a few variations of my own all for your entertainment of course and now courtesy of mr houdini the water torture cell now beardless and dressed in chinos and a white dress shirt over a white tshirt malerick wrapped chains tightly around cheryl marston her ankles first then her chest and arms he paused and looked around again but they remained hidden from view of the road and the river by thick bushes they were beside the hudson river next to a small stagnant pool of water which at one time had apparently been a tiny inlet for dinghies landfill and debris had sealed it long ago and created this foulsmelling pond about ten feet in diameter on one side was a rotting pier in the middle of which was a rusty crane that had been used for lifting boats out of the water malerick now swung a rope over the crane caught the end and began tying it to the chains holding cheryls feet escapists love chains they look impressive they have a wonderfully sadistic flavor to them and seem more formidable than silks and ropes and theyre heavy just the thing to keep a bound performer underwater no no noooo whispered the groggy woman he stroked her hair as he surveyed the chains simple and tight houdini wrote strange as it may appear i have found that the more spectacular the fastening to the eyes of the audience the less difficult the escape really proves to be this was true malerick knew from experience dramaticlooking masses of thick ropes and chains wound around and around the illusionist were in fact easy to get out of fewer restraints and simpler fasteners were much harder like these for instance noooooo she whispered groggily it hurts please what are you malerick pressed duct tape over her mouth then he braced himself took a good grip and slowly pulled down on the rope which in turn lifted the whimpering lawyers feet and began dragging her slowly toward the brackish water on this glorious spring afternoon a busy crafts fair filled the large central square of west side college between seventyninth and eightieth streets so dense with visitors it would be virtually impossible to spot the killer and his victim in the crowd on this glorious spring afternoon customers filled the scores of neighborhood restaurants and coffee shops in any one of which the conjurer might at this moment be suggesting to cheryl marston that she go for a drive with him or they stop at her apartment on this glorious spring afternoon fifty alleyways bisected the blocks here and offered in their dim seclusion a perfect killing ground sachs bell and kara jogged up and down the streets looking through the crafts fair the restaurants and the alleys and every other place they could think to search they found nothing until desperate minutes later a break the two cops and kara walked into elys coffee shop near riverside drive and scanned the crowd sachs gripped bell s arm nodding toward the cash register next to it were a black velvet riding hat and a stained leather crop sachs ran to the manager a swarthy middle easterner did a woman leave those here yeah ten minutes ago she was she with a man yeah beard and a running suit thats them she forgot the hat and that whip thing on the floor under the table do you know where they went bell asked what is happening is there where sachs insisted okay i hear him say he going to show her his boat but i hope he took her home how do you mean sachs asked the woman she was sick i figure that why she forgot her stuff sick couldnt walk steady you know what im saying seem drunk but all they drank was coffee and she was fine when they got here he drugged her sachs muttered to bell drugged her the manager asked hey what is story she asked which table were they at he pointed to one where four women sat talking and eating and doing both quite loudly scuse me sachs said to them and gave the area a fast examination she saw no obvious evidence on or beneath the table weve gotta look for her she said to bell if he said boat lets go west the hudson sachs nodded to where the conjurer and cheryl had sat thats a crime scene dont wash it or sweep under it and move them to a different table she shouted pointing to the four wideeyed and momentarily silent women and ran outside into the dazzling sunlight chapter sixteen she saw her husband crying tears of regret that he had to end the marriage end the marriage like taking out the trash walking the dog it was our fucking marriage it wasnt a thing but roy didnt feel that way roy wanted a stubby assistant securities analyst instead of her and that was that another gagging flood of hot slimy water shot up her nose air air air give me air now cheryl marston saw her father and mother at christmas decades ago coyly wheeling out the bicycle santa had brought her from the north pole look honey santa even has a pink helmet for you to protect your pretty little noggin ahhhhhh coughing and choking gripped by constricting chains cheryl was hauled out of the opaque water of the greasy pond upside down spinning lazily held by a rope looped over a metal crane jutting over the water her skull throbbed as the blood settled in her head stop stop stop she screamed silently what was going on she remembered donny boy rearing somebody calming him a nice man coffee in a greek restaurant conversation something about boats then the world uncoiling in dizziness silly laughter then chains the terrible water and now this man studying her with pleasant curiosity on his face as she died who is he why is he doing this why inertia spun her slowly in a circle and he could no longer see her pleading eyes as the inverted hazy line of new jersey miles away across the hudson came into view she revolved slowly back until she was looking at the brambles and lilacs and him he in turn looked down at her nodded then played out the rope lowering her into the disgusting pond again cheryl bent hard at the waist trying desperately to keep away from the surface of the water as if it were scaldinghot but her own weight the weight of the chains pulled her down below the surface holding her breath she shivered fiercely and shook her head struggling vainly to pull free from the unbreakable metal then cheryls husband was here again in front of her explaining explaining explaining why the divorce was the best thing that couldve happened to her roy looked up wiped away crocodile tears and said it was for the best shed be happier this way look here was something for her roy opened a door and there was a shiny new schwinn bike streamers on the handle grips training wheels in the back and a helmet a pink one to protect her noggin cheryl gave up you win you win take the goddamn boat take your goddamn girlfriend just let me go let me go in peace she inhaled through her nose to let comforting death into her lungs there amelia sachs cried she and bell ran forward over the pedestrian walkway toward the thick cluster of bushes and trees on the edge of the hudson river a man stood on a rotting pier which had apparently been a dock years ago before access to the river had been filled in this area was overgrown filled with trash and stank of stagnant water a man in chinos and a white shirt was holding a rope that arced over a small rusting crane the other end disappeared below the surface hey bell called you he had brown hair yes but the outfit was different no beard either and his eyebrows didnt seem that thick sachs couldnt see if the fingers of his left hand were fused together still what did that mean the conjurer could be a man could be a woman the conjurer could be invisible as they jogged closer he looked up in apparent relief here he cried help me over here theres a woman in the water bell and sachs left kara beside the overpass and sprinted through the brush surrounding the brackish pond dont trust him she called breathlessly to bell as they ran im with you there amelia the man pulled harder and feet and then legs in tan slacks emerged followed by a womans body she was wrapped in chains oh the poor thing sachs thought please let her be alive they closed the distance fast bell calling on his handytalkie for backup and medics several other people who were on the east side of the pedestrian bridge were gathering alarmed at what was going on help me i cant pull her up alone the rescuer called to bell and sachs his voice was a gasp out of breath from the effort this man he tied her up and pushed her into the water he tried to kill her sachs drew her weapon and trained it on the man hey whatre you doing he asked in shock im trying to save her he glanced down at a cell phone on his belt im the one called nineoneone she still couldnt see his left hand it was enclosed by his right keep your hands on that rope sir she said keep em where i can see them i didnt do anything he was wheezing an odd sound maybe it wasnt exertion but asthma staying clear of her line of fire bell grabbed the crane and swung it toward the muddy shore when the woman was in arms reach he tugged her toward him as the man holding the rope let out slack until she was lying on the ground she lay on the grass limp and cyanotic the detective pulled the tape off her mouth unhooked the chains and began to give her cpr sachs called to the dozen people gathered nearby drawn by the commotion is anybody a doctor no one answered she glanced back at the victim and saw her stirring then she began choking and spitting out water yes theyd gotten to her in time in a minute shed be able to confirm the mans identity then she looked past the scene and noticed a wad of shiny navyblue cloth she caught sight of a zipper and sleeve it could be the jogging jacket hed quickchanged out of the mans eyes followed hers and he saw it too was there a reaction a faint wince she thought so but couldnt tell for sure sir she called firmly until we get things sorted out here im going to put some cuffs on you i want your hands suddenly a mans panicked voice shouted yo lady look out that guy in the jogging suit to yo right he got a gun people screamed and dropped to the ground and sachs crouched spinning to her right squinting for a target roland look out bell too dropped to the ground beside the woman and looked in the same direction as sachs his sig in his hand but sachs saw nobody in a jogging suit oh no she thought no furious with herself she understood what had happened hed mimicked the voice himself ventriloquism she turned back fast to see a brilliant fireball explode from the rescuers hand it hovered in the air blinding her amelia bell called i cant see anything where is he i dont a fast series of gunshots sounded from where the conjurer had been standing the onlookers fled in panic as sachs aimed at the sound of the shooting bell did too they both squinted for targets but the killer was gone by the time her vision returned she found herself aiming at a cloud of faint smoke from more of the explosive squibs then to the east she saw the conjurer on the other side of the parkway he started up the middle of the street but saw an rmp speeding his way its lights and sirens frantic and he leaped up the wide stairway that led to the college and vanished into the crafts fair like a copperhead disappearing into tall grass chapter seventeen they were everywhere dozens of police all searching for him gasping from the sprint his lungs stinging the muscles in his side on fire malerick leaned against the cool limestone of one of the colleges classroom buildings in front of him a fair spread out over the large plaza which was jammed with people he looked behind him west the direction hed come from already the police had cut off that entrance on the north and south sides of the square were tall concrete buildings the windows were sealed and there were no doors his only exit was east on the other side of a footballfieldsize expanse of booths and dense crowds he made his way in that direction but he didnt dare run because illusionists know that fast attracts attention slow makes you invisible he glanced at the goods for sale nodded in pleasure at a guitarists performance laughed at a balloontying clown he did what everyone else did because unique attracts attention similar makes you invisible easing east wondering how the police had located him of course hed expected theyd find the drowned body of the woman lawyer sometime today but theyd moved too fast it was as if theyd anticipated that hed kidnap someone in that part of the city maybe even at the riding academy itself how farther east past the booths past the concession stand past a dixieland band on a red white and blue draped stage ahead of him was the exit the east stairway leading from the square down to broadway only another fifty feet to freedom forty thirty but then he saw flashing lights they seemed nearly as bright as the burst from the flash cotton hed used to escape from the redheaded officer the lights were atop four squad cars that squealed to a stop beside the stairway a halfdozen uniformed officers jumped out they scanned the stairs and remained with their cars meanwhile other officers in plain clothes were arriving they now climbed the stairs and merged into the crowd looking over the men at the fair now surrounded malerick turned and headed back toward the center of the festival the plainclothed officers were slowly moving westward they were stopping men in their fifties who were clean shaven wearing light shirts and tan slacks exactly like him but they were also stopping fiftyyearolds who were bearded and were wearing other clothes which meant they knew about his quickchange techniques then he saw what hed been dreading the policewoman with the steely eyes and fiery red hair whod tried to arrest him at the pond appeared at the top of the stairs at the west end of the fair she plunged into the crowd malerick turned aside lowering his head and studying some very bad ceramic sculpture what to do he thought desperately he had one remaining quickchange outfit left under what he now wore but after that there was no backup the redheaded officer spotted someone who was built and dressed similarly to him she examined the man closely then she turned away and continued to scan the crowd the trim brownhaired cop whod been giving cheryl marston cpr now crested the stairs and joined the policewoman in the crowd they conferred for a few moments another woman was with him she didnt seem like a cop she had brilliant blue eyes and short reddishpurple hair and was quite thin she looked over the crowd and whispered something to the woman officer who headed off in a different direction the shorthaired girl stayed with the male cop and they began to work their way through the crowd malerick knew hed be spotted sooner or later he had to get out of the fair now before even more cops arrived walking to the row of porta potties he stepped inside the fiberglass box and executed a change in thirty seconds he stepped out again politely holding the door open for a middleaged woman who hesitated and turned away deciding to wait for a john whose prior user wasnt a ponytailed biker with a beer gut wearing a pennzoil cap a greasy longsleeved denim harleydavidson shirt and dirty black jeans he picked up a newspaper and rolled it up gripping it in his left hand to obscure his fingers then moved toward the east side of the fair again checking out stained glass mugs and bowls handmade toys crystals cds one cop looked right at him but the glance was brief and he turned away malerick now returned to the eastern edge of the fair the stairway that led down to broadway was about thirty yards wide and the uniformed police had managed to close off much of it they were now stopping all adult men and women who left the fair and asking for ids he saw the detective and the purplehaired girl nearby next to the concession stand she was whispering to him had she noticed him malerick was swept by a burst of uncontrollable fury hed planned the performance so carefully every routine every trick choreographed to lead up to tomorrows finale this weekend was supposed to be the most perfect illusion ever performed and it was all crumbling around him he thought of how disappointed his mentor would be he thought of letting down his revered audience he found his hand holding a small oil painting of the statue of liberty beginning to shake this is not acceptable he raged he put the picture down and turned but he stopped fast giving a sharp gasp the redhaired policewoman stood only a few feet from him looking away he quickly turned his attention to a case of jewelry and asked the vendor in a thick brooklyn accent how much a pair of earrings cost from the corner of his eye he could see the policewoman glance at him but she paid him no mind and a moment later made a call on her radio five eight eight five requesting a landline patch to lincoln rhyme a moment later were at the fair rhyme he has to be here he couldntve gotten out before they sealed the exits well find him if we have to frisk everybody well find him malerick eased into the crowd what were his options misdirection that seemed to be the only answer something to distract the police and give him just five seconds to slip through the line and disappear among the pedestrians on broadway but what would misdirect them long enough to let him escape he didnt have any more squibs to simulate gunshots set a booth on fire but that wouldnt cause the sort of panic he now needed anger and fear seized him again but then he heard his mentors voice from years ago after the boy had made a mistake onstage and nearly ruined one of the mans routines the demonic bearded illusionist had pulled the youngster aside after the performance close to tears the boy had gazed down at the floor as the man asked what is illusion science and logic had been malericks instant response the mentor had drummed a hundred answers like this one into his assistants souls science and logic yes if theres a mishap because of you or your assistant or god himself you use science and logic to take charge instantly not one second should pass between the mistake and your reaction be bold read your audience turn disaster into applause hearing those words in his mind now malerick grew calm he tossed his biker braid and looked around considering what to do be bold read your audience turn disaster into applause sachs scanned the people near her again a mother and father with two bored children an elderly couple a biker in a harley shirt two young european women bargaining with a vendor over some jewelry she noticed bell across the square near the food concession area but where was kara the young woman was supposed to stay close to one of them she started to wave to the detective but a cluster of people ambled between them and she lost sight of him she walked in his direction and her head swiveled back and forth scanning the crowd feeling she realized as unsettled as at the music school that morning despite the fact that the sky was clear and the sun bright hardly the gothic setting of the first scene spooky she knew what the problem was wire when you walked a beat either you had wire or you didnt a cop expression having wire meant you were connected to your neighborhood it was more than a question of knowing the people and the geography of your beat it was knowing what kind of energy drove them what kind of perps you could expect how dangerous they were how theyd come at their vics and at you if you didnt have wire in a hood you had no business walking a beat there with the conjurer sachs now understood she didnt have wire at all he could be on the number train right now headed downtown or he could be three feet away from her she just didnt know in fact just then someone passed close behind her she felt a breath or wafting of cloth on her neck she spun around fast shivering in fear hand on the butt of her gun remembering how easily kara had distracted her as shed lifted sachss weapon from its holster a halfdozen people were nearby but no one seemed to have stirred the air behind her or had they a man was walking away limping he couldnt be the conjurer or could he the conjurer can become somebody else in seconds remember around her an elderly couple the ponytailed biker three teenagers a huge man wearing a coned uniform she was at sea frustrated and scared for herself and for everyone around her no wire it was then that a womans scream filled the air a voice called there look god somebodys hurt sachs drew her weapon and headed toward the cluster gathering nearby get a doctor whats wrong oh god dont look honey a large crowd had formed near the eastern edge of the plaza not far from the concession stand they gazed down in horror at someone lying on the bricks at their feet sachs lifted her motorola to call for a medical team and pushed through the crowd let me through let me she stopped inside the ring of onlookers and gasped no she whispered shuddering in dismay at the sight amelia sachs was staring at the conjurers latest victim kara lay on the ground blood covering her purple blouse and the bricks around her her head was back and her still dead eyes stared toward the azure sky chapter eighteen numb sachs lifted her hand to her mouth oh lord no roberthoudin had tighter tricks than the marabouts though i think they almost killed him dont worry ill make sure that doesnt happen to you but she hadnt shed been so focused on the conjurer that shed neglected the girl no no rhyme some dead you cant give up this tragedy would be with her forever but then she thought therell be time to mourn therell be time for recrimination and consequences right now start thinking like a goddamn cop the conjurers nearby and he is not getting away this is a crime scene and you know what to do step one seal the escape routes step two seal the scene step three identify protect and interview witnesses she turned to two fellow patrol officers to delegate some of these tasks but as sachs started to speak she heard a voice in her clattering radio rmp four seven to all available officers on that tentwentyfour by the river suspect just broke through perimeter at the east side of the street fair is now on west end approaching seveneight street heading north on foot wearing jeans blue shirt with harleydavidson logo dark hair braid black baseball cap cant see any weapons im losing him in the crowd all available portables and rmps respond the biker hed ditched his businessmans clothes and quickchanged hed stabbed kara to misdirect them and then slipped through the perimeter when the officers started toward the girl and i was three feet from him other officers called in their acknowledgments and joined the chase though it seemed that the killer had a good head start sachs caught sight of roland bell who was looking down at kara frowning as he pressed the headset of his motorola closer to his ear listening to the same transmission that sachs was they caught each others eyes and he nodded in the direction of the pursuit sachs barked orders to a nearby patrolman to seal the scene of karas murder call the medical examiner and find witnesses but the balding young officer began to protest none too happy she guessed to be taking orders from a peer his own age no buts she said not in the mood for a pissing contest about weeks or days of seniority between them you can bitch to your supervisor about it later if he said anything else she didnt hear ignoring the painful arthritis she leaped down the stairs two at a time after roland bell and began pursuit of the man whod killed their friend hes fast but im faster sixyearvet patrolman lawrence burke sprinted out of riverside park onto west end avenue only twenty feet behind the speeding perp some biker asshole in a harley shirt running around pedestrians broken field exactly the way he used to do in high school going after the receiver and just like back then legs larry was closing in hed been on his way to the hudson river to help secure a assault crime scene when hed heard a furtherto pursuit call and turned aboutface to find himself staring at the perp a scuzzy biker yo you hold it but the man hadnt stopped hed dodged past burke and kept right on going north in a panic run and so just like at the woodrow wilson high homecoming game when hed sprinted seventytwo yards after chris broderick managing to bring him down with a breathless wallop two feet shy of the end zone legs went into overdrive and started after the perp burke didnt draw his weapon unless the perp youre after is armed and theres an immediate danger hes going to shoot you or a passerby you cant use deadly force to stop him and shooting anybody in the back looks very bad at the shooting incident inquiry not to mention at promotion reviews and in the press hey you fuck loser burke gasped the biker turned east down a cross street glancing back with wide eyes seeing legs steadily closing the distance the guy skidded to the left down an alley the cop took the turn even smoother than mr harley and stayed right on the mans ass some police departments issued nets or stun guns to stop fleeing felons but the nypd wasnt so hightech besides it didnt matter not in this case larry burke had more skills than running tackling for instance from three feet away he launched himself into the air remembering to aim high and use the guys own body for padding when they went down jesus the biker gasped as they crashed to the cobblestones and skidded into a pile of garbage goddamn burke muttered feeling skin flay off his elbow you motherfuck i didnt do anything the biker gasped why were you chasing me shut up burke cuffed him and because the guy was such a fuckall runner he used a plastic restraint on his ankles too nice and tight he examined his bloody elbow damn i lost skin ow that hurts you fuck i didnt do anything i was at that fair is all i was doing i just spitting on the ground burke inhaled deeply a number of times he gasped what part about shut upre you having trouble with im not gonna tell you again fuck that stings he frisked the man carefully and found a wallet there was no id inside only money curious and he had no weapons or drugs either which was pretty odd for a biker you can threaten me all you want but i want a lawyer im going to sue you if you think i did something youre way wrong mister but then burke tugged up the guys shirt and tshirt and blinked his chest and abdomen were badly scarred it was creepy to look at but even stranger was a bag around his waist like those belly packs he and the wifed worn on their european vacation burke expected a stash but no all that the guy was hiding was a pair of jogging pants a turtleneck chinos white shirt and a cell phone and this was really weird makeup a ton of waddedup toilet paper too stuffed in the pack as if he was trying to make himself look fat pretty weird burke inhaled deeply again and got an unfortunate whiff of garbage and urine from the alley he pushed the button on his motorola portable five two one two to central ive got the perp in that tentwofour in custody k injuries negative except for one fucking sore elbow location block and a half east of west end k hold on a minute ill get the cross street burke walked to the mouth of the alley to look for the street sign and wait for his fellow cops to show up it was only then that the adrenaline began to subside leaving in its wake a tasty euphoria not a shot fired one badass loser bellydown godlovingdamn it felt nice almost as good as that game twelve years ago bringing down chris broderick who gave a girlie yelp as he slammed into the turf on the oneyard line having covered the whole length of the field without a clue that legs larry had been right behind him all the way hey there you okay bell touched amelia sachs on the arm she was so shaken by karas death that she couldnt answer she nodded breathless with grief ignoring the pain in her knees from the earlier jogging sachs and the detective continued quickly up west end toward where patrolman burke had radioed that hed collared the killer wondering if kara had siblings oh god well have to tell her family no not we ill have to do it thiss my fault i make that call sick with the sorrow she hurried toward the alleyway bell glanced at her again inhaling deeply to catch his breath but at least theyd caught the conjurer though she was in her private heart sorry she hadnt been the arresting officer she wished shed found herself alone in the alley facing the conjurer a gun in his hand she mightve used the glock before the motorola and tapped his shoulder with a single round in movies shoulder shots were just flesh wounds inconveniences and the heroes survived with nothing more than a sling the truth though was that even a small bullet wound changed your life for a long long time sometimes forever but the killer had been caught and shed have to be satisfied with multiple murder convictions dont worry dont worry dont worry kara sachs realized she didnt even know her real name its my stage name but i use it most of the time better than the one my parents were kind enough to give me this small bit of missing information brought her close to tears she realized that bell was saying something to her you uhn with us here amelia a curt nod they turned the corner onto eightyeighth street where the patrolman had downed the perp both ends of the street were being sealed off by rmps bell squinted up the block and noted an alleyway there he said pointing he motioned several cops both plainclothes detectives and uniformed patrol officers to follow them okay lets go wrap him up sachs muttered man i hope grady goes for the needle they stopped and looked into the dim canyon the alley was empty isnt this it bell asked he said eighteight right sachs asked a block and a half east of west end im sure that was the call me too a detective said thiss gotta be the place she looked up and down the street no other alleys three more officers joined them we get it wrong one asked looking around this the place or not bell called on his motorola portable five two one two respond k no answer portable five two what street are you on k sachs squinted down the alley oh no her heart sank running forward she found resting on the cobblestones near a pile of garbage a pair of handcuffs open next to them was a plastic hog tie which had been severed bell ran up beside her he got out of the goddamn cuffs and cut the restraint sachs looked around well where are they one of the uniformed officers asked wheres larry another one called in pursuit somebody else offered maybe hes out of reception area maybe drawled bell the concern in his tone reflecting the fact that the workhorse motorolas rarely malfunctioned and their reception in the city was better than most cell phones bell called in a escaped suspect with an officer missing or in pursuit he asked the dispatcher if thered been any transmissions from burke but was told thered been none no thirdparty reports of shots fired in the vicinity either sachs walked the length of the alley looking for any clues that might suggest where the killer had gone or where the conjurer mightve dumped the patrol officers body if hed gotten control of burkes gun and killed him but neither she nor bell found any sign of the officer or the perp she returned to the cluster of cops at the mouth of the alley what a terrible day two dead this morning kara too and now a police officer was missing her hand rose to the speakermike of her sp handytalkie and pulled it off her shoulder time to tell rhyme oh brother dont want to make this call she called in to central on the radio and asked for a patch as she was waiting for the call to go through she felt a tug on her sleeve sachs turned as she inhaled a shocked breath the mike slipped from her hand and swung at her side a pendulum two people stood in front of her one was the balding officer sachs had been giving orders to at the fair ten minutes ago the other was kara wearing an nypd windbreaker frowning the young woman looked up and down the alley she asked so where is he chapter nineteen are you all right sachs stammered what wait what happened all right yeah im fine kara took in the womans astonished gaze and said you mean you didnt know the balding officer said to sachs i tried to tell you but you ran off before i had a chance tell me sachss voice stopped working she was so stunned and riddled with relief that she couldnt speak you thought i was really hurt kara said oh god bell walked up nodding a greeting to kara who said amelia didnt know about our plan the fake stabbing the expression on bell s face was pure shock lord you thought she was really dead the patrol officer repeated to bell i tried to let her know first i couldnt find her and then when i did she just tells me to seal the scene and call the m e and takes off kara explained roland and i were talking and we figured that the conjurer was going to hurt somebody for real maybe set a fire or shoot or stab somebody you know to misdirect us so he could get away so we thought wed make up our own misdirection to flush that boy outta the brush bell added she got some catsup at the concession stand squirted it on herself screamed then fell down kara opened the blue windbreaker to reveal the red stain on her purple tank top the detective continued was worried a few folks at the faird be all tore up over it well id guess but we were thinking thatd be better than somebody really getting clocked or stabbed by the conjurer bell added proudly was her idea no foolin im getting a feel for how he thinks the young woman said jesus sachs found herself trembling it was so real bell nodded she does dead good sachs gave her a hug then said sternly but from now on stay close or keep me in the loop im too young for heart attacks they waited a short while but no reports came in of suspects spotted in the area finally bell said you search the scene here amelia im going to go interview the victim see if she can tell us anything meet you back at the fair a crime scene bus was parked on eightyeighth street she walked to it and began to collect her equipment to run the scene a voice clattered through her dangling speaker startling her she pulled her handsfree headset off her belt and plugged it in five eight eight five repeat k sachs what the hells going on i heard you had him and now hes gone she told rhyme what had happened about flushing the conjurer from the fair karas idea playing dead hmm the final sound a grunt really was a high compliment coming from lincoln rhyme but hes disappeared sachs added and we cant find that officer either maybe hes in pursuit but we dont know rolands interviewing the woman we saved see if she has any leads okay well run the scene sachs scenes plural she corrected sourly the coffee shop the pond and the alley here too damn many not too many at all he replied three times the chance to find some good evidence rhyme had been right the three scenes had yielded a good amount of evidence theyd been difficult to work though for an unusual reason the conjurer had been present at each one his phantom at least hovering nearby making her pause often to tap the grip of her glock turning around and making sure the killer hadnt materialized behind her search well but watch your back she never actually saw anyone but then svetlana rasnikov hadnt seen her killer shed the black camouflage and creep up behind her from the shadows tony calvert hadnt seen him hiding behind the mirror in the alley when hed walked toward the fake cat and even cheryl marston hadnt truly seen the conjurer though shed sat and talked with him shed seen someone else entirely never suspecting the terrible death he had planned for her sachs walked the grids at the various locations took digital photos and released the scenes to latents and photo she then returned to the fair where she met roland bell hed interviewed cheryl marston at the hospital they of course couldnt rely on anything the killer had told her pack of goddamn lies marston had summarized bitterly but she remembered some details from before the drug reached its full effect she gave a good description of him including particulars about the scars she also recalled that hed stopped at a car she remembered the make and the first few letters of the tag this was good news there are a hundred ways to trace a car to a perpetrator or witness lincoln rhyme called cars evidence generators dmv had reported that a car matching the description a tan mazda had been stolen from the white plains airport a week ago sellitto put out an emergency vehicle locator request to all law enforcement agencies in the metro area and sent officers to check the blocks around the site of the attack to see if they could find the car though neither officer had much faith that it would still be there bell was concluding his narrative about cheryl marstons harrowing ordeal when a patrol officer taking a radio call interrupted him detective bell what was that car again the one the perp was driving tan mazda six two six tags fet two three seven thats it the officer said into his mike then to bell and sachs he added just got a report rmp spotted him on central park west they went after him but get this he drove over the curb into the park itself the rmp tried to follow but got stuck on the embankment cpw and what sachs asked around ninetwo he probably bailed bell said he will bail sachs said but hes going to get some distance first she nodded to the evidence crates get all this to rhyme she called and ten seconds later she was in the seat of her camaro and had the big engine rattling she snapped the racecar harness on and pulled the canvas straps snug amelia wait bell called esu is on the way but the squeal of rubber and the cloud of blue smoke the goodyears left behind were her only response to bell s words skidding onto central park west heading north sachs concentrated on avoiding pedestrians poky cars bicyclists and rollerbladers baby strollers too they were everywhere man why werent these kids home taking naps she pitched the blue flasher onto the dash and plugged it into the cigarette lighter outlet the brilliant light began rotating and as she hurtled forward she found herself slapping the horn in time to the flash a streak of gray in front of her shit as she braked hard to avoid the uturner the camaro ended up a scant foot from the side of a car that was worth twice her annual income then she crunched the accelerator again and the general motors horses responded instantly she managed to keep the needle under fifty until the traffic thinned out around ninetieth street and then she went to the floor in a few seconds she hit seventy a clatter through the headset of her motorola which lay on the front passenger seat she grabbed it with one hand and pulled it on lo she called dispensing with any pretense of requisite police radio codes amelia roland here bell called hed also given up on standard communication protocols go ahead weve got cars on the way where is he she asked shouting over the roar of the engine hold on okay he drove out of the park on central park north sideswiped a truck and kept going headed where that was it was lessn a minute ago hes going north got it heading north in harlem sachs considered there were several routes out of the city from that area of town but she doubted that hed take them they all involved bridges and most were via controlledaccess highways where hed easily be trapped more likely hed abandon the sedan in a relatively quiet neighborhood and carjack a new one a new voice resounded in her headset sachs weve got him where rhyme hed turned westbound on street the criminalist explained near fifth avenue im just about at onetwofive and adam clayton powell ill try to block him but get me some backup she called were on it sachs just how fast are you going im not really looking at the speedometer probably just as well keep your eyes on the road sachs honked her way into the busy intersection at street she parked crosswise blocking the westbound lanes she jumped out of her car her glock in her hand several cars were stopped in the eastbound lanes sachs shouted to the drivers out police action get out of those cars and get under cover the drivers a delivery man and a woman in a mcdonalds uniform instantly did as they were told now all the lanes of street were blocked everybody she shouted get under cover now motherfuck yo she glanced to her right to see four gangbangers leaning against a chainlink fence staring with jaded interest at the austrian gun the detroit car and the redhead they belonged to most other people on the street had taken cover but these four teenagers stayed right where they were looking casual as sunday why move it wasnt often that a wesley snipes movie came to their hood in the distance sachs saw the mazda weaving frantically through traffic as it sped west toward her impromptu roadblock the conjurer didnt notice the blockade until he was past the street that he couldve taken to avoid her he skidded to a halt behind him a garbage truck making a turn braked hard the driver and the trash collectors saw what was happening and they bailed leaving the truck to block him from the rear she glanced at the teens again get down she called sneering they ignored her sachs shrugged leaned over the hood of the camaro and centered the blade sight on the windshield so here he was at last the conjurer she could see his face his blue harley shirt beneath a black cap his fake braid whipped back and forth as he looked desperately for some way to escape but there wasnt any you in the mazda get out of the car and lie down on the ground no response sachs rhymes voice came through the headset can you she ripped the unit off and centered the sight once more on the silhouette of the killers head you have the gun to use and you may as well use it hearing detective mary shanleys words looping through her head sachs breathed deeply and kept the gun steady a bit high a bit to the left compensating for gravity and the pleasant april breeze when you shoot nothing exists but you and the target connected by an invisible cable like the quiet energy of light your ability to hit your target depends exclusively on where this energy originates if its source is your brain you may hit what youre aiming at but if its your heart you almost always will the conjurers victims tony calvert svetlana rasnikov cheryl marston officer larry burke now seated this power solidly in the latter and she knew that she couldnt miss come on she thought you son of a bitch put the goddamn car in drive try for me come on give me an excuse the car edged forward her finger slipped inside the trigger guard as if he sensed this the conjurer braked come on she found herself whispering thinking about how to handle it if he just tried to get away shed take out the fan blades or a tire and try to capture him alive but if he drove toward her or aimed for the sidewalk endangering someone else then shed drop him yo one of the teens on the sidewalk called shoot the motherfuck cap his ass bitch you dont have to convince me homes ready willing and able she decided that if he drove ten feet toward her at any kind of speed shed nail him the engine of the bandaidcolored car revved and she saw or imagined that the vehicle shuddered ten feet thats all im asking another growl of the engine do it she pleaded silently and then sachs saw a slowmoving mass of yellow ease behind the mazda a school bus from zion prophetic tabernacle church filled with children pulled away from the curb into traffic the driver unaware of what was happening it stopped at an angle between the mazda and the garbage truck no even a direct hit might not stop the slug which could careen into the bus after it passed through its target finger off the trigger muzzle safely in the air sachs looked through the windshield of the mazda she could see the faint motion of the conjurers head as he glanced up and to his right locating the bus in the rearview mirror he then looked back toward her and she had the impression that he smiled deducing that she couldnt fire now the raw squeal of the mazdas front tires filled the street as he floored the pedal and headed toward sachs at twenty forty fifty miles an hour he bore straight down on the policewoman and her camaro which was a far brighter yellow than the bible school bus whose presence had cast its blessing of holy protection over the conjurer chapter twenty as the mazda headed straight at her sachs ran to the sidewalk to try for a crossfire shot lifting the glock she aimed at the dark form that was the conjurers head leading him by three or four feet but beyond him were dozens of store windows and apartments and people crouching on the sidewalk there was simply no way to fire even a single round safely her chorus didnt care yo bitch lessee you waste that motherfuck whatcho waitin fo she lowered the gun shoulders slumped as she watched the mazda streak straight for the camaro oh not the car no thinking of when her father had bought her the muscle car a junker and how together theyd rebuilt much of the engine and suspension added a new transmission and stripped it to goose the horsepower skyward this vehicle and a love of policing were his essential legacies to his daughter thirty feet from the camaro the conjurer turned the wheel hard to the left toward where sachs crouched she leaped aside and he turned the other way back toward the chevy the mazda skidded cutting diagonally toward the sidewalk at a glancing angle it slammed into the passenger door and right front fender of the camaro spinning it in a circle over two lanes onto the far sidewalk where the four kids finally showed some energy and scattered sachs dove out of the way and landed on her knees on the concrete gasping at the pain in her arthritic joints the camaro came to rest a few feet from her its rear end off the ground jacked up by the battered orange metal trash basket it had rolled over the mazda went over the far sidewalk then back into the street and turned right heading north sachs climbed to her feet but didnt even bother to lift her gun in the direction of the beige car there was no safe shot a glance at the camaro the side was a mess the front end too but the torn fender wasnt binding on the tires yeah she could probably catch him she jumped in and fired up the engine first gear a roar the tach shot up to and she popped the clutch but she didnt move an inch what was the problem was the drive train cracked she glanced out the window and saw that the rear wheels the drive wheels were jacked up off the ground thanks to the trash basket she sighed in frustration slammed the steering wheel with her palm damn she saw the mazda three blocks away the conjurer wasnt escaping that fast the collision had taken a toll on his car too there was still a chance to catch him but not in a car up on goddamn blocks shed have to the camaro began to rock back and forth she looked in the rearview mirror and saw that three of the gangbangers had shed their combat jackets and were straining as they tried to shove the car off its perch the fourth bigger than the others the leader of this crew walked slowly up to the window he leaned down a gold tooth shining bright in the middle of his dark face yo sachs nodded and held his eye he looked back at his friends yo niggers push the fuckin car you makin like you jerkin off with it fuck you came the winded reply he leaned down again yo lady we gonna get you down whatcha gonna shoot that motherfuck with a glock forty caliber he glanced at her holster sweet be the twentythree the c no the full size that a good gun i got myself a smittie he lifted his throwaway sweatshirt and with a mix of defiance and pride showed her the brushedsilver handle of a smith and wesson automatic but ima get me a glock like yos so she reflected an armed teenager how would a sergeant handle this situation the car bounced down off the trash can rear wheels ready to roll whatever a proper sergeant would say or do she decided didnt matter under the present circumstances the way she handled it was to give him a solemn nod thanks homes then the woman with wire added ominously dont shoot anybody and make me come lookin for you you got that a wide gold grin then snap into first gear and the gutsy tires burned wormholes into the asphalt in a few seconds amelia sachs was doing sixty go go go she muttered to herself focused on the faint blur of tan in the distance the chevy wobbled like crazy but it drove more or less straight sachs struggled to get the motorola headset on she called central to report the pursuit and redirect the backup along this route accelerating fast braking hard the streets of crowded harlem arent made for highspeed pursuits still the conjurer was in the same traffic as she was and he wasnt half the driver slowly she closed the gap then he turned toward a schoolyard in which kids were playing halfcourt basketball and whacking softballs into fake outfields the playground wasnt crowded the gate was padlocked shut and anybody wishing to play here either had to squeeze through the gap like a contortionist or be willing to scale a twentyfoot chainlink fence the conjurer however simply gunned the engine and went though the gate the kids scattered and he narrowly missed some of them as he sped up again to take out a second gate on the far side sachs hesitated but decided not to follow not in an unstable car with youngsters around she sped around the block praying shed pick him up on the other side then skidded around the corner and stopped no sign of him she didnt see how hed gotten away hed been out of sight for only ten seconds or so as she made the sweep around the playground and the school and the only other escape route was a short deadend street terminating in a wall of bushes and small saplings beyond that she could see the elevated harlem river drive beyond which was just a scuzzy mud bank leading down to the river so he got away and all ive got to show for the pursuit is five thousand bucks of bodywork man then a voice crackled all units in the vicinity of frederick douglass and onefivethree street be advised of a tenfivefour car accident with probable injuries vehicle has gone into the harlem river repeat we have a vehicle in the water could it be him she wondered crime scene five eight eight five further to that tenfivefour you have the make of the vehicle k mazda or toyota late model beige okay central believe thats the subject vehicle of the central park pursuit im teneightfour at the scene out roger five eight eight five out sachs sped her camaro to the end of the culdesac and parked on the sidewalk she climbed out as an ambulance and emergency services unit truck arrived and rocked slowly through the brush which had been crushed by the speeding mazda she followed walking carefully over the rubble as they broke from the vegetation she saw a cluster of decrepit shanties and leantos dozens of homeless mostly men the place was muddy and filled with brush and garbage dumped appliances stripped rusting cars apparently the conjurer expecting to find a road on the other side of the bushes had gone through the brush fast she saw the panicked skid marks as he slid uncontrollably through the slick muck careened off a shack knocking it apart then went off a rotting pier into the river two esu officers helped the residents of the shack out of the wreckage they were unhurt while others scanned the river for any sign of the driver she radioed rhyme and sellitto and told them what had happened and asked the detective to call in a priority request for a crime scene rapid response bus they get him amelia sellitto asked tell me they got him looking at the slick of oil and gasoline on top of the choppy water she said no sign walking past a shattered toilet and a ripesmelling trash bag sachs approached several men who were talking excitedly in spanish among themselves they held fishing rods this was a popular place to use bloodworms or cut bait to catch stripers bluefish and tommycod theyd been drinking but were sober enough to give her a coherent account the car had sped through the bushes fast and gone straight into the river theyd all seen a man in the drivers seat and they were positive he hadnt jumped out sachs talked briefly with carlos and his friend the two homeless men who lived in the nowdemolished shack they were both stoned and since theyd been inside when the mazda struck it they hadnt seen anything that could help carlos was belligerent and seemed to feel the city owed him some compensation for his loss two other witnesses ripping open trash bags for refundable bottles and cans at the time of the accident reiterated the story of the fishermen more police cars were arriving tv crews too turning their cameras on what was left of the shack and on the police boat off the stern of which two wetsuited divers were rolling backward into the water now that the emergency activity had shifted to the river itself the landside operation became amelia sachss she had little crime scene equipment in the camaro but she did have plenty of yellow tape with which she now sealed off a large area of the riverbank by the time she finished the rrv had arrived hooking up her headset she called central and was patched through to rhyme once more weve been following it sachs the divers havent found anything yet dont think so did he bail out not according to the witnesses im going to run the scene here on the riverbank rhyme she told him itll be good luck luck sure i go to the trouble to run the scene that means the diversll be sure to find his body and a searchll be a waste of time therell still be an inquiry and it was a joke rhyme yeah well this particular perp doesnt make me feel like laughing get going on the grid she carried one of the cs suitcases to the perimeter of the scene and was opening it when she heard an accented voice call out urgently my god what happened is everyone all right near the tv crews a wellcoiffed latino in jeans and a sports jacket pushed forward through the crowd he squinted in alarm at the damaged shack and then began to run toward it hey sachs called he didnt hear her the man ducked under the yellow tape and made straight for the shack tramping over the mazdas tire treads and possibly obliterating anything that the conjurer might have thrown from the car or had fallen out maybe even destroying the killers own footprints if he had bailed despite what the fishermen believed theyd seen suspicious of everyone now she checked out his left hand and could see that the index and little finger werent fused together so he wasnt the conjurer but who the hell is he sachs wondered and what was he doing in her crime scene the man was now wading through the wreckage of the shack grabbing planks and sheets of wood and corrugated metal flinging them over his shoulder hey you she called get the hell out of there he shouted over his shoulder there could be somebody inside angry now she snapped thiss a crime scene you cant be in there there could be somebody inside he repeated no no no everybodys out theyre okay hey you hearing me excuse me buddy are you hearing me whether he was or not apparently didnt matter not to him he continued to dig feverishly what was his point the man was dressed well and wearing a gold rolex crackhead carlos was clearly not a relative reciting to herself the famous cops prayer lord deliver us from concerned citizens she gestured to two nearby patrol officers get him out he was shouting we need more medics there could be children inside sachs disgustedly watched the officers footprints adding to the slow erosion of her crime scene they grabbed the intruder by the arms and pulled him to his feet he yanked his arms away from the officers haughtily called his name to sachs as if he was some kind of mafioso that everybody should know and began to lecture her on the polices shameful treatment of the neglected latino population here lady do you have any idea cuff him she said then get him the hell out of there deciding that the community relations part of the sergeants handbook slogan took second place to criminal investigation in this case the officers ratcheted the cuffs on the redfaced man and he was led fuming and cursing out of the scene want we should book him one officer called naw just put him in timeout for a while she shouted drawing laughter from some of the onlookers she watched him being deposited in the back of a squad car yet another obstacle in the seemingly impossible search for an elusive killer sachs then dressed in the tyvek outfit and armed with camera and collection bags and with rubber bands at last on her feet she waded into the scene starting with the remains of carloss destroyed mansion she took her time and searched carefully after this harrowing daylong pursuit amelia sachs was accepting nothing at face value true the conjurer might be floating forty feet below the surface of the graybrown water but he could just as easily be crawling safely up the riverbank nearby she wouldnt even have been surprised to find out that he was already miles away dressed in a new disguise stalking his next victim the reverend ralph swensen had been in town for several days his first visit to new york city and hed decided he could never get used to the place the thin man somewhat balding somewhat shy ministered to souls in a town thousands of times smaller than and dozens of years removed from manhattan whereas at home he looked out the window of his church to see rolling acres of land where placid animals grazed here he looked out the barred window of his cheap hotel room near chinatown and saw a brick wall with a swirl of grainy spray paint that was part of an obscenity whereas at home when he walked down the street of his town people would say hello reverend or great sermon ralph here they would say gimme a dollar or i got aids or simply suck me still reverend swensen was here only for a brief time so he supposed he could survive a little culture shock for a bit longer for the past several hours hed been trying to read the ancient crumbling gideon bible the hotel had provided but finally he gave up the gospel according to st matthew as compelling as that story was couldnt compete with the sound of a gay hooker and his client banging away at each other and howling loudly in pain or pleasure or most likely both the reverend knew he should be honored to have been picked for this mission to new york but he felt like the apostle paul on one of his missionary quests among the nonbelievers in greece and asia minor greeted with only derision and scorn ah ah ah ah right there right there oh yeah yeah yeah thats it thats it thats okay that was it even paul hadnt had to put up with this level of depravity the concert recital wasnt scheduled to start for several hours but reverend swensen decided to leave early he brushed his hair found his glasses and tossed the bible a map of the city and a sermon he was working on in his attaché case he took the stairs to the lobby where another prostitute was sitting this one was or appeared to be a woman our father in heaven full of grace a knot of tension in his gut he hurried past staring at the floor anticipating a proposition but she or he or whatever it was merely smiled and said beautiful weather aint it father reverend swensen blinked and then smiled back yes it is resisting the urge to add my child which is something hed never said in all his days as a minister he settled for have a nice day outside into the hard streets of the lower east side of new york city he paused on the sidewalk in front of the hotel as taxis shushed past young asians and latinos hurried by purposefully buses exhaled hot metallic fumes and chinese delivery boys on battered bicycles zipped over the sidewalk it was all so very exhausting edgy and upset the reverend decided that a walk to the school where the recital would be held would relax him hed consulted the map and knew it was a long way but he needed to do something to bleed off this mad anxiety hed do some windowshopping stop for dinner work on his sermon as he oriented himself for the walk he sensed that he was being watched he glanced to his left into the alley next to the hotel a man stood half hidden by a dumpster a lean brownhaired man in overalls holding a small toolkit he was looking the priest up and down in a way that seemed purposeful then as if hed been caught he turned and receded into the alley reverend swensen tightened his grip on the attaché case wondering if hed made a mistake not staying in the safety of his room foul and noisy though it was until it was time for the recital then he gave a faint laugh relax he told himself the man had been nothing more than a janitor or handyman maybe an employee of the hotel itself surprised to see a minister step out of the sleazy place besides he reflected as he started walking north he was a man of the cloth a calling that surely had to give him some degree of immunity even here in this modernday sodom chapter twentyone here one second gone the next the red ball couldnt possibly get from karas outstretched right hand to the spot behind her ear but it did and after shed plucked it away and tossed the crimson sphere into the air it couldnt possibly have vanished and ended up inside in the fold of her left elbow but it did that too how rhyme wondered she and the criminalist were in the downstairs lab of his townhouse waiting for amelia sachs and roland bell as mel cooper was setting the evidence out on examination tables and a cd pumped jazz piano into the room rhyme was being treated to his own sleightofhand show kara stood in front of a window wearing one of sachss black tshirts from the closet upstairs thom was currently washing her tank top removing the heinz bloodstain from her improvised illusion at the crafts fair whered you get those rhyme asked nodding at the balls he hadnt seen her take them out of her purse or pocket she said with a smile that shed materialized them another trick magicians enjoyed rhyme had wryly observed was transforming intransitive verbs into transitive ones where do you live he asked the village rhyme nodded at some memories when my wife and i were together most of our friends lived down there and soho tribeca i dont get north of twentythird much she said a laugh from the criminalist in my day fourteenth was the start of the demilitarized zone our sides winning looks like she joked as the red balls appeared and disappeared moved from one hand to the other then circulated in the air in an impromptu juggling act your accent he asked i have an accent she asked intonation then inflection tone ohio probably midwest me too rhyme told her illinois but ive been here since i was eighteen went to school in bronxville sarah lawrence drama rhyme deduced english and you liked it here and stayed well i liked it once i got out of the burbs and into the city then after my father died my mother moved out here to be closer to me daughter of a widowed mother like sachs rhyme reflected he wondered if kara had the same problems with her mother as sachsd had with hers a peace treaty had been negotiated in recent years but in sachss youth her mother had been tempestuous moody unpredictable rose didnt understand why her husband wanted to be nothing more than a cop and why her daughter wanted to be anything other than what her mother wanted her to be this naturally drove father and daughter into an alliance which made matters worse sachs had told him that their refuge on bad days was the garage where they found a comfortably predictable universe when a carburetor didnt seat it was because a simple and just rule of the physical world had been broken machine tolerances were off or a gasket had been cut wrong engines and suspensions and transmissions didnt subject you to melodramatic moods or cryptic diatribes and even at the worst they never blamed you for their own failings rhyme had met rose sachs on several occasions and found her charming chatty eccentric and proud of her daughter but the past he knew is nowhere as present as it is between parents and children and how does it work out her being nearby rhyme asked skeptically sounds like the sitcom from hell huh but nope mums great my mom shes hey you know a mother theyre just a certain way they never outgrow that where does she live shes in a care facility upper east side is she very sick nothing serious shell be fine kara absently rolled the balls over her knuckles and into her palm as soon as shes better were going to england just the two of us london stratford the cotswolds my parents and i went there once it was our best vacation ever this time im going to drive on the lefthand side of the road and drink warm beer they wouldnt let me the last time of course i was thirteen you ever been there sure i used to work with scotland yard from time to time and id lecture there i havent been back since well not for a few years magic and illusion were always more popular in england than here theres so much history i want to show mum where egyptian hall was in london that was the center of the universe for magicians a hundred years ago sort of like a pilgrimage for me you know he glanced toward the door no sign of thom do me a favor sure i need some medicine kara noticed some pill bottles against the wall no over on the bookcase ah gotcha which one she asked the one on the end macallan eighteen years he whispered and probably the quieter you poured it the better hey youre talking to the right person roberthoudin said there were three skills you needed to master to be a successful illusionist dexterity dexterity and dexterity in a moment a healthy dose of the smokey whisky had been poured into his tumbler indeed silently and almost invisibly thom couldve been standing nearby and would never have noticed she slipped the straw into the cup and fitted it into the holder on his chair help yourself he said kara shook her head and gestured toward the coffeepot which she alone had nearly drained thats my poison rhyme sipped the scotch he tilted his head back and let the burn ease into the back of his mouth then disappear watching her hands the improbable behavior of the red balls another long sip i like it what this idea of illusion dont get fucking maudlin he told himself you get maudlin when youre drunk but this selfinsight didnt stop him from taking another sip of whisky and continuing sometimes reality can be a bit hard to take you know nor could he avoid an unfortunate look down at his motionless body instantly he regretted the comment and the glance and he started to change the subject but kara didnt offer any canned sympathy she said you know im not sure there is much reality he frowned not getting her meaning isnt most of our lives an illusion she continued hows that well everything in the past is memory right true and everything in the future is imagination thosere both illusions memories are unreliable and we just speculate about the future the only thing thats completely real is this one instant of the present and thats constantly changing from imagination to a memory so see most of our lifes illusory rhyme laughed softly at this a logician a scientist he wanted to poke a hole in her theory but he couldnt she was right he concluded he spent much of his time with memories of the before prior to the accident and of how his life had changed after and the future oh yes he often dwelt there unknown to almost everyone except sachs and thom he spent at least an hour most days exercising working through manual rangeofmotion exercises doing aqua therapy at a nearby hospital or riding the electrologic stimulation bicycle tucked away in a bedroom upstairs this exercise regimen was partly to regain some nerve and motor functions improve his stamina and prevent the adjunct health problems that can plague quads but the main reason for his efforts was to keep his muscles in shape for the day when a cure was possible he applied karas theory to his profession too working a case he continually scanned his vast memory banks for knowledge about forensics and past crimes while he anticipated where a suspect might be and what he might do next everything in the past is memory everything in the future is imagination since weve broken the ice she said adding sugar to her coffee ive got a confession another sip yes when i saw you for the first time i had this thought oh yes he remembered the look the famous escapefromthecrip look served up with the smile the only thing worse than that was what now loomed the eversoawkward apology for the look and the smile she hesitated embarrassed then said i thought what an amazing illusionist youd be me a surprised rhyme asked kara nodded youre all about perception and reality peopled look at you and see that youre handicapped is that what you say the politically correct call it disabled i myself just say that im fucked kara laughed and continued they see you cant move they probably think youve got mental problems or youre slow right this was true people who didnt know him often spoke slower and louder explained the obvious in simple terms to thoms disgust rhyme would sometimes respond by muttering incoherently or feigning tourettes syndrome and driving the horrified visitors out of the room an audienced have instant opinions about you and be convinced that you couldnt possibly be behind the illusions they were seeing half of themd be obsessing with your condition the other half wouldnt even look at you thats when youd hook em anyway there i was meeting you and you were in this wheelchair andd obviously gone through a tough time and i wasnt sympathetic didnt ask how you were doing i didnt even say im sorry i was just thinking damn what a performer youd be that was pretty crass and i had a feeling you picked up on it this delighted him completely he reassured her believe me i dont do well with sympathy or kid gloves crass scores a lot more points yeah yep she lifted her coffee cup to the famous illusionist the immobilized man sleight of handd be a bit of a problem rhyme pointed out kara replied like mr balzacs always saying sleight of minds the better skill then they heard the front door open and the voices of sachs and sellitto speaking as they walked into the hallway rhyme lifted an eyebrow and leaned for the straw in the tumbler he whispered watch this its a routine i call vanishing the incriminating evidence lon sellitto asked first of all do we think hes dead sleepin wit da fishes sachs and rhyme looked at each other and simultaneously said no the big detective said you know how rough that water is in the harlem kids try and swim it and you never see em again bring me his corpse rhyme said and ill believe it he was encouraged about one thing though that theyd had no reports of a homicide or disappearance the nearcapture and the swim in the river had probably spooked the killer maybe now that he knew the police were close on his trail hed either give up the attacks or at least go to ground for a while giving rhyme and the team a chance to find where he was hiding out what about larry burke rhyme asked sellitto shook his head weve got dozens of people out searching lot of volunteers too officers and firemen offduty you know the mayors offering a reward but i gotta say its not looking good im thinking he might be in the trunk of the mazda they havent brought it up yet they havent found it yet waters black as night and with that current a diver was telling me a car could drift a half mile before it hit the bottom we have to figure rhyme pointed out that hes got burkes weapon and radio lon we should change the frequency so he cant hear what were up to sure the detective called downtown and had all transmissions about the conjurer case changed to the citywide specialops frequency lets get back to the evidence what do we have sachs nothing in the greek restaurant she said grimacing i told the owner to preserve the scene but somehow it didnt translate or he didnt want it to translate by the time we got back the staff had cleaned the table and mopped the floor how bout the pond where you found him we found some things there sachs said he blinded us with more of that flash cotton and then set off some squibs we thought he was shooting at first cooper looked over the burned residue just like the others cant source it all right rhyme sighed what else is there chains two lengths hed wrapped these around cheryl marstons chest arms and ankles and secured them with snap clasps like on the end of dog leashes cooper and rhyme examined all of these items carefully there were no manufacturers markings on any of them the story was the same with the rope and the duct tape hed gagged her with the gym bag that the killer had collected from the car presumably containing the chains and rope was unbranded and had been made in china given enough manpower it was sometimes possible to find a source for common items like this by canvassing discount stores and street vendors but for a cheap massproduced bag a search of that magnitude was impossible cooper inverted the bag above a porcelain examining tray and repeatedly tapped the bottom to dislodge whatever might be inside a bit of white powder drifted out the tech did a drug analysis and the substance turned out to be flunitrazepam daterape drug of choice sachs told kara there were also tiny pellets of a sticky translucent material inside it looked like a similar substance was lodged in the zipper and smeared on the handle i dont recognize it cooper said but kara looked it over smelled the substance and said magicians adhesive wax we use it to stick things together temporarily onstage maybe he had an open capsule of the drug stuck to the palm of his hand when he reached over her drink or coffee he tipped it in sources for the wax are rhyme asked cynically let me guess any magic supply store in the free world kara nodded sorry within the bag cooper also found some tiny metallic shavings and a circular black mark as if from some residue on the bottom of a small bottle of paint an examination through the microscope revealed the metal was probably brass and there were unique machining patterns on the metal but any deductions were beyond lincoln rhyme send some pictures down to our friends in the bureau cooper took the images compressed them and sent them off via encrypted email to washington the black stains turned out not to be paint but permanent ink but the database couldnt identify what kind specifically there were no markers to individuate it whats that rhyme asked looking toward a plastic bag containing some navyblue cloth we were lucky there sachs said thats the windbreaker he was wearing when he picked up the marston woman he didnt get a chance to take it with him when he bolted individuate rhyme asked hoping that there might be some initials or laundry marks inside after a lengthy examination of the garment cooper said nope and all the tagsve been removed but sachs said we found some things in the pockets the first item they examined was a press pass issued by one of the big cabletv networks the ctn reporters name was stanley saferstein and the photo on the pass revealed a thin brownhaired man with a beard sellitto called the network and spoke to the head of security it turned out that saferstein was one of their senior reporters and had worked the metro desk for years his pass had been stolen last week lifted during or after a press conference downtown the reporter had never felt a thing as the thief had apparently cut the lanyard and pocketed the id the conjurer had snatched safersteins card rhyme assumed because the reporter bore a slight resemblance in his fifties narrowfaced and darkhaired the stolen pass had been canceled the security chief had explained but the guy could still flash it and get past a checkpoint guards and police dont check too close if they see our logo after they hung up rhyme said to cooper run saferstein through vicap and ncic sure but why just because rhyme answered he wasnt surprised when the results came back negative he hadnt actually thought that the reporter had any connection with the conjurer but with this particular perp rhyme was taking no chances the jacket also contained a gray plastic hotel key card rhyme was delighted at this find even though there was no hotel name on it just a picture of a key and an arrow to show the guest which end to insert in the lock he assumed it would have codes in the magnetic strip to tell them which hotel and room it belonged to cooper found the manufacturers name in small type on the back of the card apc inc akron ohio this he found out from a search of a trademark database stood for american plastic cards a company that made hundreds of different identification and key cards in a few minutes the team was on the speakerphone with the president of apc himself a shirtsleeve ceo rhyme imagined who had no problem working on saturday or picking up his own phone rhyme explained the situation to him described the key and asked how many hotels in the new york city metro area it was sold to ah thats the apc its our most popular model we make them for all the big locking systems ilco saflok tesa ving sargent all the others any suggestions on narrowing down which hotel it belongs to im afraid youll just have to start calling hotels and see who uses gray apcs we have that information here someplace but i wouldnt know how to dig it up myself ill try and track down my sales manager or his assistant but it could be a day or two ouch sellitto said yeah ouch after they hung up rhyme decided he wasnt content to wait for apc so he had sellitto send the key to bedding and saul with instructions to start canvassing hotels in manhattan to find out who used the very fucking popular apc he also ordered both the press pass and the key card fingerprinted but the results were negative on this too they revealed just smudges and two more of the fingercup prints roland bell returned from the scenes on the west side and cooper briefed him on what the team had learned so far they then returned to the evidence and found that the conjurers running jacket contained something else a restaurant check from a place called the riverside inn in bedford junction new york the bill revealed that four people had eaten lunch at table on saturday april two weeks ago the meal consisted of turkey meatloaf a steak and one daily special no one drank alcohol it was soft drinks all around sachs shook her head where the hells bedford junction way upstate i do believe mel cooper said theres a phone number on the receipt bell drawled call em up ask debby or tanya or whoevers the charmin waitress if any regular foursome sits at he squinted at the receipt table twelve or at least if she remembers who ordered those things long shot but who knows whats the number sellitto asked bell called it out it was a long shot too long as rhyme had expected the manager and the waitresses there had no idea who mightve been in on that saturday its a bustlin spot sellitto reported rolling his eyes thats a quote i dont like it sachs said what whats he doing having lunch with three other people good point bell said you think hes working with somebody sellitto replied naw i doubt it pattern doersre almost always loners kara disagreed im not sure closein artists parlor magicians they work alone but hes an illusionist remember they always work with other people youve got volunteers from the audience then assistants onstage that the audience knowsre working with the performer and then therere confederates too thosere people whore working for the illusionist but the audience doesnt know it they might be disguised as stagehands members of the audience volunteers in a good show youre never quite sure whos who christ rhyme thought this one perp was bad enough with his skills at quick change escape and illusionism working with assistants would make him a hundred times more dangerous mark it down thom he barked then lets look at what you found in the alley where burke collared him the first item was the officers handcuffs he got out of them in seconds had tove had a key sachs said to the dismay of cops around the country most handcuffs can be opened with generic keys available from lawenforcement supply houses for a few dollars rhyme wheeled over to the examination table and studied them carefully turn them over hold them up he mightve used a key true but i see fresh scratches in the hole id say it was picked but burke wouldve frisked him sachs pointed out whered he get a pick kara offered couldve been hidden anywhere his hair his mouth mouth rhyme mused hit the cuffs with the als mel cooper donned goggles and shone an alternative light source on the cuffs yep weve got some tiny smears and dots around the keyhole this meant rhyme explained to kara the presence of bodily fluid saliva most likely houdini did that all the time sometimes hed let somebody from the audience check his mouth out then just before he did the escape his wifed kiss him he said it was for luck but she was really passing a key from her mouth to his but hed be cuffed behind his back sellitto said how could he even reach his mouth oh kara said with a laugh any escapist can get cuffed hands in front of his body in three or four seconds cooper tested the saliva traces some individuals secrete antibodies into all bodily fluids which lets investigators determine blood type the conjurer though turned out not to be a secretor sachs had also found a very tiny piece of serratededge metal yeah its his too kara said another escapist tool a razor saw its probably what he used to cut through those plastic bands on his ankles would thatve been in his mouth too wouldnt it be too dangerous oh a lot of us hide needles and razor blades in our mouths as part of the acts with practice its pretty safe examining the last of the trace from the alley scene they found more bits of latex and traces of the makeup identical to what theyd seen earlier more tackpure oil as well at the riverside sachs when he went into the river you find anything just skid marks in the mud she pinned up the digital photos that cooper had printed out from his computer some helpful citizen managed to screw up the scene she explained but i spent a half hour going through the muck im pretty sure he didnt drop any evidence or bail out sellitto asked bell what about the vic the marston woman she have anything to say the tarheel detective gave a summary of his interview with her an attorney rhyme considered why pick her what the hell was the conjurers pattern with the victims musician makeup artist and attorney bell added shes divorced husbands out in california wasnt the friendliest divorce in the world but i dont reckon hes involved i had lapd make some calls and he was accounted for today and theres no ncic or vicap sheet on him cheryl marston had described the conjurer as slim strong bearded scars on neck and chest oh and she confirmed his fingers were deformed like wed thought fused together she said he was hush about the neighborhood he lives in and he picked the alias john now theres a clever boy for you useless rhyme assessed bell then explained how hed picked her up and what had happened afterward rhyme asked kara anything sound familiar he couldve hypnotized a pigeon or gull pitched it at the horse then used some kind of gimmick to keep the horse agitated what kind of gimmick rhyme asked you know any manufacturers no thats probably homemade too magicians used to use electrodes or prods to get lions to roar on cue things like that but animalrights activistsd never let you get away with that now bell continued describing what had happened when marston and the conjurer had gone to have coffee one thing she said that was odd it was like he could read her mind bell described what marston had told him about the conjurers knowing so much about her body reading kara said hed say something and then watch her close check out her reactions thatd tell him a lot about her coming on to somebody like thats called selling them the medicine a really good mentalist can find out all kinds of things just by having an innocent conversation with you then when she was gettin comfortable with him he drugged her and took her to the pond dunked her upside down it was a variation of the water torture cell routine kara explained houdini one of his most famous and his escape from the pond rhyme asked sachs at first i wasnt sure it was him hed done a quick change she said his clothes were different and a glance at kara his eyebrows too i couldnt get a look at his hand to see the fingers but he distracted me used ventriloquism i was looking right at his face i never saw his lips move kara said ill bet he picked words that didnt have any bs or ms or ps probably no fs or vs either youre right i think it was something like yo look out on your right that guy in the jogging suits got a gun perfect black dialect she grimaced i looked away the same direction he looked like everybody else then he set off that flash cotton and i got blinded he fired the squibs and i thought he was shooting he got me cold rhyme saw the disgust in her face amelia sachs reserved her worst anger for herself kara though said dont take it too hard hearings the easiest sensation to fool we dont use sound illusions much in shows theyre cheap shots sachs shrugged this reassurance off and continued while roland and i were still blinded from the flash he took off and disappeared slipped into the crafts fair another grimace and then i saw him fifteen minutes later this biker wearing a harley shirt i mean for gods sake he was right there in front of me man kara said shaking her head his coins definitely dont talk whats that rhyme asked coins oh an expression magicians use literally it means you cant hear any clinking when you do coin tricks but we use it in general when somebodys really good wed also say hes got tight tricks walking to the whiteboard reserved for the magician profile she picked up the marker and added to it commenting so he does closein and mentalism and even ventriloquism and animal tricks we knew he does lockpicking from the second murder but now we know hes an escapist too what kind of magic doesnt he do as rhyme leaned his head back watching her write thom brought a large envelope into the room he handed it to bell for you whatsis the tarheel detective asked pulling the contents out and reading them he nodded slowly as he read thiss the report on the followup search at gradys office the one you asked peretti to run you mind taking a gander lincoln the curt note on top read lr as requested vp rhyme read through the details of the report thom flipping the page for him with every stern nod the cs techs had completed a thorough inventory of the secretarys office and had identified and mapped out all the footprints in the room exactly as rhyme had asked he read this carefully several times closing his eyes and picturing the scene then he turned to the complete analysis of the fibers thatd been found most of the white ones were a polyesterrayon blend some were attached to a thick cotton fiber also white most were dull and dirty the black fibers were wool mel what do we think about the black ones there the tech scooted off his stool and examined the images photo work isnt the best he said after a moment he concluded from some tight weave twilled fabric gabardine rhyme asked cant tell without a bigger sample to see the diagonal but ill go with gabardine rhyme read down the page and learned that the single red fiber found in the office was satin okay okay he mused closing his eyes and digesting everything hed read the criminalist asked cooper what do you know about fabric and clothing mel not a lot but if i can quote you lincoln the important question isnt what do you know about something its do you know where to find out about it and the answer to that is yes i do the conjurer musicschool crime scene perps description brown hair fake beard no distinguishings medium build medium height

techniques experience with animal illusions used mentalism to get information on victim used sleight of hand to drug her tried to kill third victim with houdini escape water torture cell ventriloquism chapter twentytwo harry houdini was renowned for his escapism but in fact there were many great escapists who preceded him and many who were his contemporaries what set houdini apart from all the others was a simple addition to his act the challenge a major part of his show involved an invitation to anyone in the town where he was appearing to challenge houdini to escape from a device or location that the challenger himself provided maybe a local policemans own handcuffs or a cell in the town lockup it was this competitive manversusman element of performing that made houdini great he thrived on these challenges and so do i malerick now thought walking into his apartment after his escape from the harlem river and a bit of reconnaissance work but he was still badly shaken up by the events that afternoon when hed been performing regularly before the fire there was often an element of danger in the routines real danger his mentor had beaten into him that if there was no risk how could you possibly hope to engage your audience there was no sin worse to malerick than boring those whod come to be entertained by you but what a series of challenges this particular act had turned out to be the police were far better than hed expected how had they anticipated that hed target the woman at the riding academy and where he was going to drown her trapping him in the crafts fair then finding him in the mazda chasing him again getting so close that hed had to send the car into the river and get away in a very narrow escape challenges were one thing but he was now feeling paranoid he wanted to do more preparation for his next routine but he decided to stay in his apartment until the last minute besides there was something else that he needed to do now something for himself not for his revered audience he drew the shades of his apartment and placed a candle on the mantelpiece next to a small inlaid wooden box he struck a match and lit the candle then sat on the rough cloth of the cheap sofa he controlled his breathing inhaled slowly exhaled slowly slowly slowly concentrating on the flame drifting into a meditation throughout its history the art of magic has been divided into two schools first there are the sleightofhand artists the prestidigitators the jugglers the illusionists people who entertain their audiences with dexterity and physical skill the second school of magic is far more controversial the practice of the occult even in this scientific era some practitioners contend that they actually possess supernatural powers to read minds and move objects mentally predict the future and communicate with spirits for thousands of years charlatan seers and mediums have grown rich claiming to be able to summon the spirits of the deceased for their distraught loved ones before the government began cracking down on such scams it was legitimate magicians whod protect the gullible by publicly revealing the methods behind the supposedly occult effects even today the brilliant magician james randi spends much of his time debunking fakes harry houdini himself devoted much of his life and fortune to challenging fake mediums yet ironically one of the reasons he took up this cause was out of his desperate search for a legitimate medium who could contact the spirit of his mother whose death he never completely recovered from malerick now stared at the candle the flame watching praying for the spirit of his soul mate to appear and caress the yellow cone of illumination to send him a sign he used the candle for this medium of communication because it was fire that had taken his love away from him fire that had changed malericks life forever wait did it flicker yes maybe no he couldnt tell both schools of magic vied within him as a talented illusionist malerick knew of course that his routines were nothing more than applied physics chemistry and psychology but still there was that one splinter of doubt in his mind that perhaps magic actually did hold the key to the supernatural god as illusionist vanishing our failing bodies then palming the souls of those we loved transforming them and returning them to us his sad and hopeful audience this was not unthinkable malerick told himself he and then the candle flickered yes he saw it the flame moved a millimeter closer to the inlaid box very possibly it was a sign that the soul of his dead beloved was hovering near summoned not by mechanics but by the fiber of connection that magic might reveal if only he could stay receptive are you there he whispered are you breathing so very slowly afraid that his exhalation would reach the candle and make it shiver malerick wanted proof positive that he was not alone finally the candle burned itself out and malerick sat for a long time in his meditative state watching gray smoke curl toward the ceiling then vanish a glance at his watch he could wait no longer he gathered his costumes and props assembled them and dressed carefully applied his makeup the mirror told him that he was in role he walked to the front lobby a glance out the window the street was empty then outside into the spring evening for a routine that would be yes even more challenging than the prior ones fire and illusion are soul mates bursts of flash powder candles propane flames over which escape artists dangle fire revered audience is the devils toy and the devil has always been linked to magic fire illuminates and fire obscures it destroys and it creates fire transforms and its at the heart of our next act one i call the charred man the neighborhood school just off fifth avenue in greenwich village is a quaint limestone building as modest in appearance as in name one would never suspect that the children of some of the richest and most politically connected families in new york city learn reading riting and rithmatic here it was known not only as a quality educational institution if you can refer to an elementary school that way but was also an important cultural venue in this part of the city the p m saturday music recitals for instance to which the reverend ralph swensen was now making his way hed survived his lengthy stroll through chinatown and little italy to greenwich village without any harm other than your average accosting by your average panhandler to which he was by now almost oblivious hed stopped at a small italian restaurant for a plate of spaghetti that and ravioli were the only dishes on the menu he recognized and since the wife wasnt with him he ordered a glass of red wine the food was wonderful and he remained in the restaurant for quite some time sipping the forbidden drink and enjoying the sight of children playing in the streets of this boisterous ethnic neighborhood hed paid the check feeling somewhat guilty about using church funds for alcohol then continued north farther into the village along a route that took him through a place called washington square this appeared at first to be a miniature sodom in its own right but when he plunged into the heart of the chaotic park the reverend found that the only sins were youngsters playing loud music and people drinking beer and wine out of containers in paper bags although he believed in a moral system that sent certain transgressors straight to hell like noisy homosexual prostitutes who wouldnt let you get to sleep the spiritual offenses he found here werent the sort thatd guarantee a oneway ticket to the big furnace but partway through the park he began to grow uneasy he thought again of the man whod been spying on him the one in overalls with the toolkit by the hotel the reverend was sure hed seen him a second time in a storewindow reflection not long after hed left the hotel the same sense of being watched came over him now he turned fast and looked back well no workmen but he did catch sight of a trim man in a dark sports coat watching him the man looked away casually and veered off toward a public rest room paranoia had to be the man didnt look anything like the worker but as the reverend left the square walking north along fifth avenue dodging the hundreds of strollers on the sidewalk he sensed again that he was being followed another glance behind him this time he saw a blond man wearing thick glasses and dressed in a brown sports coat and tshirt looking his way reverend swensen also noticed that he was crossing to the same side of the street that hed just crossed to but now he was sure he was paranoid three different men couldntve been following him relax he thought and continued north on fifth avenue toward the neighborhood school the street dense with people enjoying the beautiful spring evening reverend swensen arrived at the neighborhood school at exactly p m a half hour before the doors would open he set down his briefcase and crossed his arms then he decided that no he should keep a hold on the attaché case and picked it up again he lounged against a wroughtiron fence surrounding a garden next to the school glancing uneasily in the direction hed come no no one no workmen with toolkits no men in sports coats he was excuse me father startled he turned quickly and found himself looking at a big swarthy man with a twoday growth of beard uhm yes you here for the recital the man nodded toward the neighborhood school thats right he answered trying to keep his voice from quavering with uneasiness what times it start eight the doors open at seventhirty thank you father not a problem the man smiled and walked away in the direction of the school reverend swensen resumed his vigil nervously squeezing the handle of his attaché case a look at his watch it read then finally after an interminable five minutes he saw what hed been waiting for what hed traveled all these many miles for the black lincoln town car with the official government license plates it eased to a stop a block from the neighborhood school the minister squinted in the dusk as he read the plate number it was the right vehicle thank you lord two young men in dark suits got out the front they looked up and down the sidewalk including a glance at him and were apparently satisfied that the street was safe one of them bent down and spoke through the open rear window the reverend knew whom he was speaking to assistant district attorney charles grady the man prosecuting the case against andrew constable grady was here with his wife for the recital that their daughter was participating in it was the prosecutor in fact who was at the heart of his mission to sodom this weekend like paul the reverend swensen had entered the world of the nonbelievers to show them the error of their ways and to bring them truth he intended to do so in a somewhat more decisive way than the apostle though by murdering charles grady with the heavy pistol now resting in his briefcase which he clutched to his chest as if it were the ark of the covenant itself chapter twentythree sizing up the scene in front of him carefully noting angles escape routes how many passersby were on the sidewalk the amount of traffic on fifth avenue he couldnt afford to fail there was a lot riding on his success he had a personal stake in making sure charles grady died around midnight last tuesday jeddy barnes a local militiaman had suddenly appeared at the door of the doublewide that served as reverend swensens home and church barnes had reportedly been hiding out in a camper deep in the woods around canton falls after the state police raids against andrew constables patriot assembly a few months ago make me some coffee barnes had commanded looking over the terrified reverend with his fierce fanatics eyes amid the staccato tap of rain on the metal roof barnes a tough scary loner with a gray crew cut and gaunt face had leaned forward and said i need you to do something for me ralph whats that barnes had stretched his feet out and looked at the plywood altar reverend swensen had made himself thick with sloppy varnish theres a man out to get us persecuting us hes one of them swensen knew that by them barries was referring to an illdefined alliance of federal and state government the media nonchristians members of any organized political party and intellectuals for starters us meant everybody who wasnt in any of above categories provided they were white the reverend wasnt quite as fanatical as barnes and his tough militia buddies who scared the soul out of him but he certainly believed there was some truth to what they preached we need to stop him who is it a prosecutor in new york city oh the one going after andrew thats him charles grady whatm i supposed to do reverend swensen had asked envisioning a letterwriting campaign or a fiery sermon kill him barnes had said simply what i want you to go to new york and kill him oh lord well i cant do that trying to put on a firm front although his hands were shaking so bad he spilled his coffee on a hymnal for one thing what goodll it do it wont help andrew any hell theyll know he was behind it and theyll make it even harder constables not part of this hes out of the equation therere bigger issues here we need to make a statement you know do what all those assholes in washington re always saying in their press conferences send a message well just forget it jeddy i cant do it its crazy oh i think you can but im a minister you hunt every sunday thats murder if you want to look at it one way and you were in nam you got scalps if your storiesre true that was thirty years ago whispering desperately avoiding both the mans eyes and the admission that no the war stories werent true im not killing anybody ill bet clara sampsond like you to stony silence for a moment chickensre coming back to roost ralph lord lord lord last year jeddy barnes had stopped wayne sampson from going to the police after the dairy farmer had found the minister with sampsons thirteenyearold daughter in the playground hed built behind the church it occurred to him now that barnes had played mediator solely to get some leverage on him please look clara wrote a nice letter which i happen to have di mention i asked her to do that last year anyway she went and described your private parts in more detail than i personally wanna read about but im sure a juryd appreciate it you cant do this no no no dont wanta argue the matter with you ralph heres the situation if you dont agree then come next month youll be doin the same thing to niggers in prison that you had clara sampson doin to you now whats it gonna be shit ill take that as a yes now lemme walk you through what we have planned and barnes had given him a gun the address of a hotel and the location of gradys office then shipped him off to new york city when hed first arrived a few days ago reverend swensen had spent several days doing recon work hed gone into the state government building late thursday afternoon and with his slightly baffled demeanor and wearing his ministers garb had wandered the halls unchallenged until he found a broom closet in a deserted corridor where he hid until midnight then hed broken into gradys secretarys office and found out that the prosecutor and his family would be attending the recital at the neighborhood school tonight his daughter was one of the young performers now armed and edgy with cat nerves the reverend stood fidgeting in front of the school and watching gradys bodyguards talking with the prosecutor in the backseat the plan was to kill grady and his guards with the silenced pistol then drop to the ground himself screaming in panic that a man had just driven by and was shooting from a car the minister should be able to escape in the confusion should be he now tried to say a prayer but even though charles grady was a tool of the devil asking help from the lord our god to kill an unarmed white christian bothered reverend swensen considerably so he settled for a silent bible recitation i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lit up by his glory reverend swensen rocked on his feet thinking that he couldnt bear to wait any longer catnerves catnerves he wanted to get back to his sheep his farmland his church his everpopular sermons clara sampson too who was nearly fifteen now and for all intents and purposes fair game and the angel cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit he considered the matter of gradys family the prosecutors wife hadnt done anything wrong being married to a sinner wasnt the same as being a sinner yourself or choosing to work for one no hed spare mrs grady unless she noticed that he was the one shooting as for the daughter barnes had told him about chrissy he wondered how old she was and what she looked like and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all now he thought do it go go go and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea saying thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all thinking the stone of retribution ive got grady is a wellbuilt swiss gun and the messenger isnt an angel from heaven but a representative of all rightthinking people in america he started forward the bodyguards were still looking away opening the attaché case he took out the rand mcnally and the heavy gun hiding the weapon inside the colorful map he strolled casually toward the car gradys bodyguards were now standing together on the sidewalk with their backs to him one reached down to open the door for the prosecutor twenty feet away reverend swensen thought to grady god have mercy on your and then the angels millstone landed squarely on his shoulders on the ground on the ground now now now now a halfdozen men and women a hundred demons grabbed reverend swensens arms and flung him hard to the sidewalk dont move dont move dont move dont move one grabbed the gun one snatched away the briefcase one pressed the reverends neck down into the sidewalk like the weight of the citys sin his face scraped against the concrete and pain shot through his wrists and shoulder sockets as handcuffs were ratcheted on him and his pockets turned insideout crushed to the concrete reverend swensen saw gradys car door open and three policemen leap out wearing helmets and bulletproof vests stay down head down down down jesus our lord in heaven he watched a mans feet walk closer to him in contrast to the fierceness of the other officers this man was quite polite in a southernaccented voice he said now sir were going to roll you over and then im going to read you your rights and you let me know if you understand em several cops turned him over and pulled him to his feet the reverend started in shock the man speaking was the one in the dark sports coat hed thought was following him in washington square next to him was the blond man in glasses whod apparently taken over the surveillance the third the swarthy man whod asked about the time the concert began stood nearby sir my names detective bell and im going to read those rights now you ready good here we go bell looked over the contents of swensens attaché case extra ammunition for the h k pistol a yellow pad inscribed with what looked to be a very bad sermon scrawled on it a guidebook new york on fifty dollars a day there was also a beatup gideon bible stamped with the name and address the adelphi hotel bowery new york new york hmmm bell thought wryly looks like we can add a count of bible larceny to the charges he found nothing though that suggested a direct connection between this attempt on gradys life and andrew constable discouraged he handed off the evidence to be logged in and called rhyme to tell him that the impromptu operation by the saving asses team had been successful back at rhymes an hour earlier the criminalist had continued to pore over the revised crime scene report while mel cooper had researched the fibers the cs team had found in gradys office finally rhyme had made some troubling deductions the analysis of the footprints in the office revealed that the intruder had stood for some minutes in one spot the right front corner of the secretarys desk the inventory of the office showed only one item in this portion of the desk the womans daily calendar and the only entry for this weekend was chrissy gradys recital at the neighborhood school which meant that the person who broke in undoubtedly noted this as for the attacker himself rhyme had ventured that he might be disguised as a minister or priest with the help of an fbi database cooper managed to trace the black fibers and dye to a cloth manufacturer in minnesota which cooper and rhyme learned from its website specialized in black gabardine for clericalclothing makers rhyme also noted that several of the white fibers cs had found were polyester bonded with starched cotton which suggested a white lightweight shirt with a stiff clerical collar attached the single red satin fiber was the sort that couldve come from a ribbon bookmark in an old book as could the gold leaf a bible for instance rhyme had run a case years ago in which a smuggler had hidden drugs in a hollowedout bible that cs search team had found similar trace in the mans office bell had ordered grady and his family not to attend their daughters recital in their place a team of esu troopers would drive to the school in gradys city car teams stationed themselves north of the school on fifth avenue on cross streets west at sixth avenue and east at university place and south in washington square park sure enough bell whod taken the park had spotted a minister walking nervously toward the school bell had started to tail him but was spotted so hed peeled off another swat officer picked up and tracked him to the school a third detective from bells swat group approached and asked about the concert checking visually for signs of weapons but not finding any obvious ones and hence having no probable cause to detain and search him but the suspect remained under close surveillance and as soon as he was seen pulling the gun from his attaché case and starting for the decoys he was taken down expecting a fake priest theyd been surprised to find that theyd caught a real one which the contents of swensens wallet confirmed despite the contrary testimony of the embarrassingly bad sermon bell nodded at the h k automatic pretty big gun for a priest he said im a minister meant to say ordained good for you now im wondering i read you those rights you want to waive your right to remain silent tell you sir you bow up to what you just did and thingsll go a lot easier for you tell us who wanted you to kill mr grady god hmm bell said okay how bout anybody else thats all im saying to you or to anybody thats my answer god well all right lets getcha downtown now and see if hes inclined to throw bail for you chapter twentyfour they call that music a thud of a drum and then the raw sound of a brass instrument rehearsing short passages penetrated rhymes parlor it was coming from the cirque fantastique across the street in the park the notes were jarring and the tone gaudy and brash he tried to ignore it and returned to his phone conversation with charles grady who was thanking him for his efforts in collaring the minister whod come to town to kill him bell had just interrogated constable down at the detention center the prisoner said he knew swensen but had drummed him out of the patriot assembly over a year ago because of an unhealthy interest in the daughters of some parishioners constable had had nothing to do with the man after that and hed fallen in with some backwoods militiamen according to local gossip the prisoner adamantly denied that he knew anything about the attempted killing still grady had arranged to have delivered to rhyme a box of evidence from the crime scene at the neighborhood school and one from the reverend swensens hotel room rhyme had looked through it quickly but found no obvious connection to constable he explained this to grady and added we need to get it to some forensic people upstate in whats the town canton falls they can do some soil or trace comparisons there might be something linking swensen to constable but i dont have any samples from up there thanks for checking lincoln ill have somebody get it up there asap if you want me to write an experts opinion on the results id be happy to the criminalist said then had to repeat the offer the last half was drowned out by a particularly raucous horn solo hell yes i could write better music than that he thought thom called timeout and took rhymes blood pressure he found the results high i dont like it he said well for the record i dont like a lot of things rhyme responded petulantly frustrated with their slow progress with the case a tech at the fbi lab in dc had called and said that it would be morning before theyd have any report on the bits of metal found in the conjurers bag redding and saul had called more than fifty hotels in manhattan but had found none that used apc key cards that matched the one found in the conjurers running jacket sellitto had also called the relief watch outside the cirque fantastique fresh officers had replaced the two whod been there since that morning and theyd reported nothing suspicious and most troubling of all thered been no luck in finding larry burke the missing patrol officer whod collared the conjurer near the crafts fair dozens of officers were searching the west side but had turned up no witnesses or evidence as to where he might be one encouraging note though his body wasnt in the stolen mazda the car hadnt yet been raised but a diver whod braved the currents reported that there were no bodies inside the car itself or the trunk wheres the food sellitto asked looking out the window sachs and kara had gone up the street to pick up some takeout from a nearby cuban restaurant the young illusionist was less excited about dinner than the prospect of her first cuban coffee which thom described as onehalf espresso onehalf condensed milk and onehalf sugar the concept of which despite the impossible proportions had instantly intrigued her the bulky detective turned to rhyme and thom and asked you ever have those cubano sandwiches theyre the best but neither the food nor the case meant anything to the aide time for bed its nine thirtyeight rhyme pointed out practically afternoon so its not time for bed he managed to make his singsong voice sound both juvenile and threatening at the same time we have a fucking killer on the loose who keeps changing his mind about how often he wants to kill people every four hours every two hours a glance at the clock and he might just now be perpetrating his nine thirtyeight killing i appreciate that you dont like it but i have work to do no you dont if you dont want to call it a night all right but were going upstairs to take care of some things and then youre taking a nap for a couple of hours ha youre just hoping ill fall asleep till morning well i wont ill stay awake all night the aide rolled his eyes he announced in a firm voice lincoln ll be upstairs for a few hours howd you like to be out of work rhyme snapped howd you like to be in a coma thom shot back this is fucking crip abuse he muttered but he was giving in he understood the danger when a quad sits too long in one position or is constricted in the extremities or as rhyme loved to put it so indelicately in front of strangers needs to piss or shit and hasnt for a while there was a risk of autonomic dysreflexia a soaring of the blood pressure that could result in a stroke leading to more paralysis or death dysreflexias rare but itll send you to the hospital or a grave pretty damn fast and so rhyme acquiesced to a trip upstairs for the personal business and then a rest it was moments like this disruptions of normal life that infuriated him most about his disability infuriated and though he refused to let on deeply depressed him in the bedroom upstairs thom took care of the necessary bodily details okay two hours rest get some sleep one hour rhyme grumbled the aide was going to argue but then he glanced at rhymes face and while he probably saw anger and dontfuckwithme eyes which wouldnt have affected him one bit he observed too the criminalists heartfelt concern for the next victims on the conjurers list thom conceded one hour if you sleep an hour it is rhyme said then added wryly and ill have the sweetest of dreams a drink would help you know the aide tugged at the subtle purple tie a gesture of weakening that rhyme seized on like a shark lapping a molecule of blood just one the criminalist said all right he poured a little ancient macallan into one of rhymes tumblers and arranged the straw next to his mouth the criminalist sipped long ah heaven then he glanced at the empty glass someday ill teach you how to pour a real drink ill be back in an hour thom said command alarm clock rhyme said sternly on the flatscreen monitor a clock face appeared and he orally set the alarm to sound in one hour i wouldve gotten you up the aide said ah well just in case you were occupied and somehow forgot rhyme said coyly now ill be sure to be awake wont i the aide left closing the door behind him and rhymes eyes slipped to the window where the peregrine falcons perched lording over the city their heads turning in that odd way of theirs both jerky and elegant at the same time then one the female the better hunter glanced quickly at him blinking her narrow slits of eyes as if shed just sensed his gaze a cock of her head then she returned to her examination of the hubbub of the circus in central park rhyme closed his eyes though his mind was speeding through the evidence trying to figure out what the clues might mean the brass the hotel key the press pass the ink mysteriouser and mysteriouser finally his eyes sprang open this was absurd he wasnt the least bit tired he wanted to get the hell back downstairs and return to work sleeping was out of the question he felt a breeze tickle his cheek and was angrier yet at thom for leaving the airconditioning on when a quads nose runs there goddamn well better be somebody nearby to wipe it he summoned up the climate control panel on the monitor thinking about telling thom that he wouldve gotten to sleep except that the room was too cold but one look at the screen told him that the airconditioner was off what had the breeze been the door was still closed there he felt it again a definite waft of air on his other cheek his right one he turned his head quickly was it from the windows no they too were closed well it was probably but then he noticed the door oh no he thought chilled to his heart the door to his bedroom had a bolt on it a latch that could be closed only by someone in his room not from the outside it was locked another breath on his skin hot this time very close he heard a faint wheeze too where are you rhyme whispered he gasped as a hand appeared suddenly in front of his face two fingers deformed fused together the hand held a razor blade the sharp edge aimed toward rhymes eyes if you call for help said the conjurer in a breathy whisper if you make a noise ill blind you understood lincoln rhyme nodded chapter twentyfive the blade in the conjurers hand vanished he didnt put it away didnt hide it one moment the metal rectangle was in his fingers aimed at rhymes face the next it was gone the man brownhaired beardless wearing a policemans uniform walked around the room examining the books the cds the posters he seemed to nod approvingly at something he studied one curious decoration a small red shrine inside of which was a likeness of the chinese god of war and of police detectives guan di the conjurer seemed to think nothing of the incongruity of such an item in the bedroom of a forensic scientist he returned to rhyme well the man said in his throaty whisper looking over the flexicair bed youre not what i expected the car rhyme said in the river how oh that he said dismissively the submerged car trick i was never in the car i got out in the bushes at the end of that street a simple trick a closed window so the witnesses would see mostly glare and my hat on the headrest it was my audiences imagination that saw me houdini was never even in some of the trunks and barrels he pretended to escape from so they werent skid marks from braking rhyme said they were skid marks from accelerating tires he was angry that hed missed this you put a brick on the accelerator a brick wouldntve looked natural when the divers found the car i wedged it down with a shoe the conjurer looked rhyme over closely and asked in a wheezing voice but you never believed i was dead not a question how did you get into the room without me hearing you i was here first i slipped upstairs ten minutes ago i was downstairs too in your war room or whatever you call it nobody noticed me you brought that evidence in rhyme recalled being vaguely aware of two patrolmen carting in boxes of the evidence collected outside the neighborhood school and the reverend swensens hotel room thats right i was waiting on the sidewalk this cop came up with a couple of boxes i said hello and offered to help nobody ever stops you if youre in a uniform and you seem to have a purpose and youve been hiding up here covered up with a piece of silk that was the color of the walls you caught on to that trick did you rhyme frowned looking at the mans uniform it seemed genuine not a costume but contrary to regulations there was no nameplate on the breast his heart suddenly sank he knew where it had come from you killed him larry burke you killed him and stole his clothes the conjurer glanced down at the uniform and shrugged reverse stole the uniform first came the whispery disembodied voice convinced him that i wanted him naked to give me a chance to escape he saved me the effort of stripping him afterward then i shot him repulsed rhyme reflected that hed considered the danger that the conjurer had taken burkes radio and his weapon it hadnt occurred to him though that hed use the mans uniform as a quickchange costume to attack his pursuers he asked in a whisper wheres his body on the west side where keep that to myself i think somebodyll find him in a day or two sniff him out the weathers warm you sonofabitch the criminalist snapped he might be civilian now but in his heart lincoln rhyme would always be a cop and there is no bond closer than that between fellow police officers the weathers warm but he struggled to remain calm and asked casually how did you find me at the crafts fair i got close to your partner that redheaded policewoman very close as close as i was to you just now i breathed on her neck too im not sure which i enjoyed more anyway i heard her talking to you on her radio she mentioned your name then it just took a little research to find you youve been in the papers you know youre famous famous a freak like me apparently rhyme shook his head and said slowly im old news the chain of command passed me by a long time ago the word command zipped from rhymes lips through the microphone mounted to the headboard into the voice recognition software in his computer command was the latch word that told the computer to be prepared for instructions a window opened up on the monitor which he could see but the conjurer could not instruction it asked silently chain of command the conjurer asked what do you mean i used to be in charge of the department now sometimes the young officers they wont even return my telephone call the computer seized the last two words of the sentence its response whom would you like to call rhyme sighed ill tell you a story i needed to get in touch with an officer the other day a lieutenant lon sellitto the computer reported dialing lon sellitto and i told him a sudden frown from the conjurer he stepped forward quickly swinging the monitor away from rhymes face and looking it over the killer grimaced ripped the phone lines from the wall and unplugged the computer with a faint pop it went silent as the man hovered a few feet from him rhyme pressed his head into the pillows expecting the terrible razor blade to appear but the conjurer stepped back breathing hard with his asthmatic wheeze he seemed more impressed than angered by what the criminalist had tried you know what that was dont you he asked smiling coldly pure illusionism you distracted me with patter and then did some classic verbal misdirection ruse we call it that was good what you were saying was very natural until you mentioned the name it was the name ruined it see telling me that wasnt natural it made me suspicious but up until then you were good the immobilized man he continued im good too though the conjurer reached forward with an open empty palm rhyme cringed as the fingers passed close to his eyes he felt a brush against his ear when the conjurers hand appeared a second later there were four doublesided razor blades gripped between his fingers he closed his hand into a fist and the four blades became a single one now held once more between his thumb and index finger no please worse than the pain rhyme feared the horror of being deprived of yet another of his senses the killer eased the edge close to rhymes eye moved it back and forth then the killer smiled and stepped back he glanced across the room into the shadows on the far wall now revered audience lets begin our routine with some prestidigitation ill be assisted by a fellow performer here these words were spoken in an eerie theatrical tone the mans hand rose and he displayed the glistening razor blade in a smooth gesture the conjurer pulled out the waistband of rhymes sweatpants and underwear and tossed the blade like a frisbee toward his naked groin the criminalist winced what he must be thinking the conjurer said to his imaginary audience knowing that a razor blade is against his skin perhaps cutting into his skin his genitals a vein or an artery and he doesnt feel a thing rhyme stared at the front of his pants waiting for blood to appear then the conjurer smiled but maybe the blades not there maybe its someplace else maybe here he reached into his own mouth and pulled the small rectangle of steel out he held it up then frowned wait he removed another blade from his mouth then more he now had the four blades back in his hand he fanned them like cards then tossed them into the air above rhyme who gasped and cringed waiting for them to hit him but nothing theyd vanished in his neck and temple rhyme felt his heart pounding harder now sweat trickling down his forehead and temple rhyme glanced at the alarm clock it seemed like hours had passed but thom had left only fifteen minutes ago rhyme asked why are you doing this those people you killed what was the point they werent all killed he pointed out angrily you ruined my performance with the equestrian by the hudson river well attacked then why it was nothing personal he said and broke into a coughing spell not personal rhyme spat out incredulous lets say it was more what they represented than who they were what does that mean represented explain the conjurer whispered no i dont think i will he walked slowly around rhymes bed breathing hard do you know what goes through the mind of the audience during a performance part of them hopes that the illusionist isnt going to escape in time that hell drown hell fall on the spikes burn up get crushed to death theres a trick called the burning mirror my favorite it starts out with a vain illusionist looking in a mirror he sees a beautiful woman on the other side of the glass she beckons to him and finally he gives in to temptation and steps through we see theyve changed places the womans now on the front side of the mirror but theres a puff of smoke and she does a quick change and becomes satan now the illusionist is trapped in hell chained to the floor flames begin shooting up from the floor around him a wall of fire moves closer just as hes about to be engulfed by flames he gets out of the chains and leaps through the fire at the back of the mirror to safety the devil runs toward the illusionist flies into the air and vanishes the illusionist shatters the mirror with a hammer then he walks across the stage pauses and snaps his fingers theres a flash of light and youve probably guessed he becomes the devil the audience loves it but i know that part of everyones mind is rooting for the fire to win and the performer to die he paused and of course that does happen from time to time who are you rhyme whispered despairing now me the conjurer leaned forward and passionately rasped im the wizard of the north im the greatest illusionist who ever was im houdini im the man who can escape from the burning mirror from handcuffs chains locked rooms shackles ropes anything he eyed rhyme closely except except you i was afraid that you were the one thing i couldnt escape from youre too good i had to stop you before tomorrow afternoon why whats happening tomorrow afternoon the conjurer didnt answer he looked into the gloom now revered audience our main act the charred man look at our performer here no chains no handcuffs no ropes yet he cant possibly escape this is even harder than the worlds first escape routine st peter thrown in a cell shackled guarded and yet he escaped of course he had an important confederate god our performer tonight however is on his own a small gray object appeared in the conjurers hand and he leaned forward fast before rhyme could turn his head the killer slapped a piece of duct tape over his mouth he then shut out all the lights in the room except a small nightlight he returned to rhymes bed held an index finger up and flicked his thumb against it a threeinch point of flame rose from the digit the conjurer wagged the finger back and forth sweating i can see he held the flame close to rhymes face fire isnt it fascinating its probably the most compelling image in illusionism fires the perfect misdirection everyone watches flame they never take their eyes off it onstage i could do anything with my other hand and youd never notice for instance the bottle of rhymes scotch appeared in the mans grip he held the flame under the bottle for a long moment then the killer took a sip of liquor and held the flaming finger in front of his lips looking directly at rhyme who cringed but the conjurer smiled turned aside and blew the flaming spray toward the ceiling stepping back slightly as the stream of fire vanished into the darkness of the ceiling rhymes eyes flickered to the wall in the corner of the room the conjurer laughed smoke detector i got that earlier the batterys gone he blew another flaming stream toward the ceiling and set the bottle down suddenly a white handkerchief appeared he wafted it under rhymes nose it was soaked in gasoline the astringent smell burned rhymes eyes and nose the conjurer coiled the handkerchief into a short rope and ripping open rhymes pajama top draped it around his neck like a scarf the man walked toward the door silently opened the deadbolt and then the door looked out rhymes nose detected another scent mixed with the gasoline what was it a rich smoky scent oh the scotch the killer mustve left the bottle open except that the smell soon overtook the gasolines aroma it was overpowering there was scotch everywhere and rhyme understood with dismay what the man was doing hed poured a stream of liquor from the door to the bed like a fuse the conjurer flicked his finger and a white fireball flew from his hand into the pool of single malt the liquor ignited and blue flames raced along the floor soon theyd set fire to a stack of magazines and a cardboard box next to the bed one of the rattan chairs too soon the fire would climb up the bedclothes and begin devouring his body which he wouldnt feel and then his face and head which he horribly would he turned to the conjurer but the man was gone the door closed smoke began to sting rhymes eyes and fill his nose the fire crawled closer igniting boxes and books and posters melting cds soon the blue and yellow flames began lapping at the blankets at the foot of lincoln rhymes bed chapter twentysix a diligent nypd officer perhaps hearing an odd noise perhaps seeing an unlocked door stepped into a west side alleyway fifteen seconds later another man emerged dressed in a lightweight maroon turtleneck tight jeans baseball cap no longer in the role of officer larry burke malerick began walking purposefully up broadway glancing at his face noting the flirtatious way he glanced around him a cruisin look youd suspect that he was a man on the prowl heading for some west side bar to defibrillate his ego and his genitalia both in arrest lately as he approached middle age he paused at a basement cocktail lounge glanced inside he decided this would be a good place in which to hide out temporarily until it was time to return briefly to lincoln rhymes and see how much damage the fire had done he found a stool at the far end of the bar near the kitchen and ordered a sprite and a turkey sandwich looking around the arcade games with their electronic soundtracks a dusty jukebox the room smoky and dark smelling of sweat and perfume and disinfectant the liquorinduced brays of laughter and hum of pointless conversation all of which transported him back to his youth in the city built from sand las vegas is a mirror surrounded by glaring lights stare at it for hours but all youll ever truly see is yourself with your pocks squinty wrinkles vanity greed desperation its a dusty hard place where the cheery illumination of the strip fades fast just a block or two from the neon and doesnt penetrate to the rest of the city the trailers sagging bungalows sandy strip malls pawnshops selling engagement rings suit jackets prosthetic arms whatever can be transformed into quarters or silver dollars and everywhere the dusty endless beige desert this was the world that malerick was born into father a blackjack dealer and mother a restaurant hostess until her growing weight put her behind the scenes in a cash room they were two of the army of vegas service people treated like ants by casino management and guests alike two of the army who spent their lives so inundated with money that they could smell the ink perfume and sweat on the bills but who were forever aware that this astonishing flood was destined to pause in their fingers for only the briefest of moments like many vegas children left on their own by parents working long and irregular shifts and like children living in bitter homes everywhere their son had gravitated to a place where he found some comfort and that place for him was the strip i was explaining revered audience about misdirection how we illusionists distract you by drawing attention away from our method with motion color light surprise noise well misdirection is more than a technique of magic its an aspect of life too were all desperately drawn toward flash and glitz and away from boredom from routine from bickering families from hot motionless hours on the edge of the desert from sneering teens who chase you down because youre skinny and timid and then pound you with fists as hard as scorpions shells the strip was his refuge the magic shops specifically of which there were many las vegas is known among performers around the world as the capital of magic the boy found that these shops were more than just retail outlets they were places where aspiring performing and retired magicians hung out to share stories and tricks and to gossip it was in one of these that the boy learned something important about himself he might be skinny and timid and a slow runner but he was miraculously dexterous the magicians here would show him palms and pinches and drops and conceals and hed pick them up instantly one of these clerks lifted an eyebrow and said about the thirteenyearold a born prestidigitator the boy frowned never having heard the word a french magician made it up in the eighteen hundreds the man explained tresti as in presto fast digit as in finger prestidigitation fast fingers sleight of hand so maybe he slowly came to believe he was someone more than odd man out in the family something more than knuckle bait at the playground every day hed leave school at and head directly to his favorite store where hed hang out and sop up method at home he practiced constantly one of the shop managers would hire him occasionally to put on demonstrations and brief shows for customers in the magic cavern in the back of the store he could still picture clearly his initial performance from that day on young houdini his first stage name would talk or bully his way up onto stage at any opportunity what a joy it was to mesmerize his audience delight them sell them the medicine trick them to scare them too he liked to scare them finally he got busted by his mother the woman eventually realized that the boy hardly spent any time at home and raided his room to learn why i found this money she snapped rising from her dinner and waddling into the kitchen one evening to confront him as he walked in the back door explain its from abracadabra whos that the store by the tropicana i was telling you about it you stay off the strip mom its just a store that magic store where you been drinking let me smell your breath mom no backing away repulsed by the massive woman in the pastasaucestained top her own breath horrific they catch you in a casino i could lose my job your father could lose his i was just at the store i do a little show people give me tips sometimes thats too much for tip money i never got tips like that when i was a hostess im good the boy said so was i show what kind of show magic he was frustrated hed told her this months before watch he did a card trick for her that was good she said nodding but for lying to me im keeping this money i didnt lie you didnt tell me what youre doing thats the same as lying mom thats mine you lie you pay with some effort she stuffed the money into a jeans pocket sealed closed by her belly then she hesitated okay heres ten back if you tell me something tell you tell me something you ever seen your father with tiffany loam i dont know whos that you know dont pretend you dont that waitress from the sands was over here with her husband a couple months ago for dinner she was in that yellow blouse i did you see them driving out to the desert yesterday i didnt see them she examined him closely and decided he was telling the truth if you do see them you let me know and she left him for her spaghetti coagulating on a tv tray in the living room my money mom shut up its the daily double one day performing a small show in abracadabra the boy was surprised to notice a slim unsmiling man enter the store as he walked toward the magic cavern all the magicians and clerks in the store fell silent he was a famous illusionist and was appearing at the tropicana he was known for his temper and his dark scary illusions after the show the illusionist gestured the boy over and nodded at the handwritten sign on stage you call yourself young houdini yeah you think youre worthy of that name i dont know i just liked it do some more nodding at a velvet table the boy did nervous now as the legend watched his moves a nod which seemed to be an approving nod that a fourteenyearold boy would receive a compliment like this stunned the magicians in the room to silence you want a lesson the boy nodded thrilled let me have the coins he held his open palm to offer the coins the illusionist looked down frowning where are they his hand was empty the illusionist laughing harshly at the boys bewildered expression had already dipped them the quarters were in his own hands the boy was astonished he hadnt felt a thing now ill hold this one up in the air the boy looked up but suddenly some instinct said close your fingers now hes going to put the coins back embarrass him in front of a roomful of magicians grab his hand suddenly without looking down the illusionist froze and whispered are you sure you want to do it the boy blinked in surprise i think twice a glance down at the boys hand young houdini looked at his palm which was tensed to catch the great illusionists he saw to his shock that the man had placed something there but not the coins five doublesided razor blades if hed closed his fingers as hed planned young houdini wouldve needed a dozen stitches let me see your hands he said taking the blades out of them and vanishing them instantly young houdini held his palms up and the man touched them stroked them with his thumbs it felt to the boy that there was an electric current running between them youve got the hands to be great he whispered for the boy alone to hear youve got the drive and i know youve got the cruelty but you dont have the vision not yet a blade appeared again and the man used it to slice through a piece of paper which began to bleed he crumpled the paper and then opened it up there was no slash and no blood he handed it to the boy who noticed that on the inside was an address written in red ink as the small audience of onlookers cheered and clapped with genuine admiration or jealousy the illusionist whispered come see me leaning forward his lips brushing young houdinis ear you have a lot to learn and i have a lot to teach the boy kept the illusionists address but he couldnt work up the courage to go see him then at his fifteenth birthday party his mother changed the course of his life forever by flying into a tirade and flinging a platter of fettuccine at her husband over some recently received intelligence about the notorious mrs loam bottles flew collectibles shattered police arrived the boy decided hed had enough the next day he went to visit the illusionist who agreed to be his mentor the timing was perfect in two days the man was starting an extensive tour of the united states he needed an assistant young houdini cleaned out his secret bank account and did just what his namesake had done he ran away from home to work as a magician there was one major difference between them however unlike harry houdini whod left home only to make money to help his impoverished family and who was soon reunited with them young malerick would never see any member of his again hey how you doing the womans husky voice woke him out of these durable memories as he sat at the bar of the upper west side tavern a regular here he guessed fiftyish trying unsuccessfully for the illusion of ten years younger shed picked this hunting ground based largely on the dim lighting she scooted onto a stool next to his and was leaning forward flying a flag of cleavage sorry just asked how youre doing dont think ive seen you in here just in town for a day or two ah she said drunkenly say i need a light conveying the irritating impression that he should consider it a privilege to light her cigarette oh sure he said he clicked a lighter and held it up this flame flickered madly he observed as she wrapped her red bony fingers around his to guide the lighter to her lips thanks she shot a narrow stream of smoke toward the ceiling when she looked back malerick had paid the bill and was pushing away from the bar she frowned i have to go he smiled and said oh here you can keep that he handed her the small metal lighter she took it and blinked her frown deepened it was her own lighter which hed dipped from her purse when shed leaned toward him malerick whispered coldly guess you didnt need one after all leaving her at the bar two tears leading the mascara down her cheeks he thought that of all the sadistic illusions hed perpetrated and had planned for this weekend the blood the cut flesh the fire this one would perhaps be the most satisfying she heard the sirens when they were two blocks away from rhymes amelia sachss mind did one of those funny jogs hearing the urgent electronic catcall from some emergency vehicle thinking the sound seemed to be coming from the direction of his townhouse of course it wasnt she decided too much of a coincidence but then the flashing lights blue and red were on central park west where his place was located come on girl she reassured herself its your imagination stoked by the memory of the eerie harlequin on the banner in front of the cirque fantastique tent in the park the masked performers the horror of the conjurers murders they were making her paranoid spooky forget it shifting the large shopping bag containing garlicky cuban food from one hand to the other she and kara continued down the busy sidewalk talking about parents about careers about the cirque fantastique about men too bang bang the young woman sipped her double cuban coffee to which she said shed become addicted at first taste not only was it half the price of starbucks kara pointed out but it was twice as strong im not sure about the math but i think that makes it four times as good the young woman said ill tell you i love finds like this its the little things in life dont you think but sachs had lost the thread of the conversation another ambulance sped by she sent a silent prayer that it keep going past rhymes it didnt the vehicle braked to a fast stop at the corner next to his building no she whispered whats going on kara wondered an accident heart pounding sachs dropped the bags of food and began sprinting toward the building oh lincoln kara started after her spilled hot coffee on her hand and dropped the cup she kept up the pace beside the policewoman whats going on as she turned the corner sachs counted a halfdozen fire trucks and ambulances at first shed suspected hed had an attack of dysreflexia but this had clearly been a fire she looked up to the second story and gasped in shock smoke was drifting out of rhymes bedroom window jesus no sachs ducked under the police line and ran toward the cluster of firefighters in the doorway she leaped up the front stairs her arthritis momentarily forgotten then she was through the door nearly slipping on the marble floor the hallway and the lab seemed intact but a faint haze of smoke filled the downstairs hallway two firemen were walking slowly down the stairs it seemed their faces were filled with resignation lincoln she cried and started for the stairs no amelia lon sellittos gruff voice cut through the hallway she turned panicked thinking that he wanted to stop her from seeing his burned corpse if the conjurer had taken lincoln away from her he was going to die nothing in the world would stop her lon he motioned her off the stairs and embraced her hes not up there amelia is no no its okay hes all right thom brought him down to the guest room in the back this floor thank god kara said she looked around in dismay at more firefighters coming down the stairs large men and women swollen even larger by their uniforms and equipment thom grimfaced joined them from the back of the hall hes all right amelia no burns some smoke inhalation blood pressures high but hes on his meds itll be okay what happened she asked the detective the conjurer sellitto muttered he sighed he killed larry burke stole his uniform thats how he got in somehow he snuck up to rhymes room he set a fire around his bed we didnt even know it down here somebody saw the smoke from the street and called nineoneone and dispatch called me thom and mel and i got most of it out before the trucks got here she asked sellitto i dont suppose we got him the conjurer a bitter laugh whatta you think he vanished thin air following the accident that left him paralyzed after rhyme had graduated from the stage of grief that called for him to spend months willing his legs to work again he gave up on the impossible and turned his considerable focus and strength of will to a more reasonable goal breathing on his own a c quad like rhyme his neck broken at the fourth vertebra from the base of the skull is on the borderline of needing a ventilator the nerves that lead from the brain down to the diaphragm muscles may or may not be functioning in rhymes case his lungs appeared at first not to be pumping properly and he was put on a machine a hose implanted in his chest rhyme hated the device with its mechanical gasping and the odd sensation of not feeling the need to breathe even though he knew he himself wasnt the machine also had the nasty habit of occasionally stopping cold but then his lungs began working spontaneously and he was freed from the bionic device the doctors said the improvement was due to his bodys natural posttrauma stabilizing but rhyme knew the real answer hed done it himself with willpower sucking air into his lungs meager breaths at first yes but his own breaths all the same was one of the greatest accomplishments of his life he was now working hard at those exercises that might lead to increased sensation throughout his body and even movement of his limbs but however successful he was with these he didnt think his sense of pride would match what hed felt when he was taken off the ventilator for the first time tonight lying in his small guest room he recalled seeing the clouds of smoke flowing from the cloth and paper and plastic burning all around him in his room in his panic he thought less about burning to death and more about the terrible smoke working into his lungs like metal splinters and taking away the sole victory hed won in the war against his disability it was as if the conjurer had picked his single most vulnerable spot to attack when thom sellitto and cooper burst into the room his first thought was not about the fire extinguishers the two cops held but the green oxygen tank the aide wielded hed thought save my lungs before the flames were out thom had the oxygen mask over his face and he hungrily inhaled the sweet gas they got him downstairs and both ems and rhymes own sci doctor had examined him cleaning and dressing a few small burns and looking carefully for razor cuts there were none nor were any blades found in his pajamas the spinal cord specialist declared that his lungs were all right though thom should rotate him more frequently than normal to keep them clear it was only then that rhyme began to calm but he was still very anxious the killer had done something far more cruel than causing him physical injury the attack had reminded rhyme how precarious his life was and how uncertain his future he hated this feeling this terrible helplessness and vulnerability lincoln sachs walked fast into the room sat on the old clinitron bed and dropped to his chest hugged him hard he lowered his head against her hair she was crying hed seen tears in her eyes perhaps twice since hed known her no first names he whispered bad luck remember and weve had enough of that today youre okay yes im fine he said in a whisper stung by the illogical fear that if he spoke louder the particles of smoke would somehow puncture and deflate his lungs the birds he asked praying that nothing had happened to the peregrine falcons he wouldnt have minded if they moved to a different building but it would have devastated him if theyd been injured or killed thom said theyre fine theyre on the other sill she held him for a moment then thom appeared in the doorway i need to rotate you the policewoman hugged him once more then stood back as thom stepped close to the bed search the scene rhyme told her theres got to be something that hes left behind there was that handkerchief he put around my neck and he had some razor blades sachs said she would and left the room thom took over and began expertly to clear his lungs twenty minutes later sachs returned she stripped off the tyvek suit and carefully folded and replaced it in the crime scene suitcase didnt find much she reported got that handkerchief and a couple of footprints hes wearing a new pair of eccos but i didnt find any blades and anything else he mightve dropped got vaporized oh and there was a bottle of scotch too but i assume its yours yes it is rhyme whispered normally he wouldve made a joke something about the severity of the punishment for using eighteenyearold single malt as an arson accelerant but he couldnt bring himself to be humorous he knew there wouldnt be much evidence because of the extensive destruction in a fire the clues in most suspiciousorigin fire scenes usually reveal only where and how the fire started but they already knew that still he thought there must be more what about the duct tape thom pulled it off and dropped it no duct tape look behind the head of the bed the conjurer was standing there he mightve i did look well search again you missed things you must have no she said simply what forget the crime scene its toast so to speak we need to move this goddamn case forward were going to rhyme im going to interview the witness there was a witness he grumbled nobody told me there was a witness well there was she stepped to the doorway called down the hall for lon sellitto to join them he ambled inside sniffing his jacket and wrinkling his nose a twohundredfortyfuckingdollar suit history shit what officer im going to interview the witness lieutenant you have your tape recorder sure he took it out of his pocket and handed it to her theres a wit rhyme said forget witnesses sachs you know how unreliable they are stick with the evidence no well get something good ill make sure we do a glance at the doorway well who the hell is it you she said pulling a chair close to the bed chapter twentyseven me ridiculous no not ridiculous forget it walk the grid again you missed things you searched way too fast if you were a rookie im not a rookie i know how to search a scene fast and i know when its time to stop searching and go on to more productive things she examined sellittos small recorder checked the tape and clicked it on this is nypd patrol officer amelia sachs badge five eight eight five interviewing lincoln rhyme witness in a tentwentyfour assault and tentwentynine arson at threefourfive central park west the date is saturday april twentieth she set the recorder on the table near rhyme who glanced at the unit as if it were a snake now she said description i told lon tell me a sarcastic look at the ceiling he was mediumbuilt male approximately fifty to fiftyfive years of age wearing a police officers uniform no beard this time scar tissue and discoloration on his neck and on his chest his blouse was open you could see his chest excuse me he said with bright sarcasm scar tissue at the base of his neck presumably continuing down to his chest little and ring fingers of his left hand were fused together he had appeared to have brown eyes good rhyme she said we didnt have his eye color before and we may not now if hes wearing contacts he snapped feeling hed scored a point here i could probably remember better with something to help he looked toward thom something to help i assume you have an unincinerated bottle of macallan somewhere in the kitchen later sachs said lets keep a clear head but worrying her scalp with a nail she continued now i want to go through everything that happened what did he say i cant remember very much he said impatiently it was mostly crazy ramblings and i was hardly in the mood to pay attention maybe they sounded crazy to you but ill bet there was something we could use sachs he said sardonically do you think i mightve been a little spooked and confused i mean just a little distracted maybe she touched his shoulder a place where he could feel the contact i know you dont trust witnesses but sometimes they do see things thiss my specialty rhyme amelia sachs the people cop ill walk you through it just like you walk me through the grid well find something important she rose walked to the door and called kara yes he distrusted witnesses even those who had good vantage points and werent part of the action itself anyone involved in the actual crime especially a victim of violence was totally unreliable even now thinking about the killers visit all rhyme could see was a random series of incidents the conjurer behind him standing over him lighting the fire the razor blades the smell of the scotch the boiling smoke he didnt even have a sense of the chronology of the killers visit memory as kara had said is only an illusion a moment later the young woman appeared are you all right lincoln fine he muttered sachs was explaining that she wanted kara to listen she might recognize something the killer had said that could be helpful to them the policewoman sat down again and pulled her chair close lets go back there rhyme tell us what happened just in general terms he hesitated glanced at the tape recorder then he began to recount the events as he remembered them the conjurer appearing admitting hed stolen the uniform then killed the officer telling rhyme about the officers body the weathers warm he then said it was like he was pretending he was performing a show and i was a fellow performer hearing the mans odd rambling in his mind rhyme said i do remember one thing hes got asthma or at least he sounded winded he was gasping for breath a lot whispering good sachs said id forgotten he sounded that way at the pond after the marston assault what else did he say rhyme looked at the dark ceiling of the small guest room shaking his head thats about it he was either burning me or threatening to slice me up oh did you find any razor blades when you searched the room no well there thiss what im talking about evidence i know he threw a blade in my sweatpants the doctors didnt find it it mustve fallen out see thats the sort of thing you should be looking for it was probably never in your pants kara said i know the illusion he palmed the blade well my point is that you dont tend to listen to people real close when theyre torturing you come on rhyme go on back there its earlier this evening kara and ire getting dinner youve been looking over evidence thoms brought you upstairs you were tired right no the criminalist said i wasnt tired but he brought me up there anyway imagine you werent too happy about that no i wasnt so youre up in the room picturing the lights the silhouette of the birds thom closing the door its quiet sachs began no its not quiet at all theres that goddamn circus across the street anyway i set the alarm for what time i dont know an hour what difference does it make one detail can give birth to two others a scowl whered that come from a fortune cookie she smiled made it up but it sounds good dont you think use it in the new edition of your book i dont write books about witnesses rhyme said i write them about evidence feeling victorious again with this comeback now how do you tell hes here at first did you hear anything no i felt a draft i thought it was the airconditioning at first but it was him he was blowing on my neck and cheek just to why to scare me i guess it worked by the way rhyme closed his eyes then he nodded as a few memories came back i tried to call lon on the phone but he a glance at kara he caught my move he threatened to kill me no he threatened to blind me if i tried to call for help i thought he was going to but it was odd he seemed impressed he complimented me on my misdirection his voice faded as his memory trailed off into dimness how did he get in he walked in with the officer who brought the evidence from the grady hit shit sellitto said from now on we check ids everybody who walks through the friggin door i mean everybody hes talking about misdirection sachs continued hes complimented you what else is he saying i dont know rhyme muttered nothing nothing at all she asked her voice a whisper i dont know lincoln rhyme was furious at sachs because she was pushing him because she wouldnt let him have a drink to numb the terror furious mostly at himself for disappointing her but she had to understand how hard it was for him to go back there to the flames to the smoke that slipped into his nose and threatened his precious lungs wait smoke lincoln rhyme said fire fire i think that was what he talked about the most he was obsessed with it there was an illusion he mentioned the right the burning mirror that was it flames all over the stage i think the illusionist has to escape from them he turns into the devil or somebody turns into the devil both rhyme and sachs glanced at kara who was nodding ive heard of it but its rare takes a lot of setup and its pretty dangerous most theaters owners wont let performers do it nowadays he kept going on about fire how its the one thing you cant fake onstage how audiences see fire and they secretly hope maybe the illusionistll get burned wait i remember something else he go on rhyme youre on a roll dont interrupt me he snapped i told you he was acting as if he were giving a performance he seemed delusional he kept looking at the blank wall and talking to somebody it was like my something audience i dont remember what he called them he was manic an imaginary audience right hold on i think it was respected audience talking to them directly my respected audience sachs glanced at kara who shrugged we always talk to the audience its called patter in the old days performers would say things like my esteemed audience or my dear ladies and gentlemen but everybody thinks thats hokey and pretentious patters a lot less formal now lets keep going i dont know sachs i think im dry everything else is just a big blur ill bet theres more its like that one bit of evidence at the scene its there it might be the key to the whole case you just have to think a little differently to find it she leaned closer to rhyme lets say this is your bedroom youre in the flexicair where was he standing the criminalist nodded there near the foot of the bed facing me my left side closest to the door what was his pose pose i dont know try i guess facing me he kept moving his hands like he was speaking in public sachs stood and took up a position like this closer she moved in there her standing in this pose did in fact bring back a memory one thing he was talking about the victims he said killing them wasnt anything personal nothing personal he killed yes i remember now he killed them because of what they represented sachs was nodding scribbling notes to supplement the tape recording represented she mused what does that mean i didnt have any idea one musician one lawyer one makeup artist different ages sexes professions residences no known connection to one other what could they represent uppermiddleclass lifestyles urban dwellers higher education maybe one of those is the key the rationalization for picking them who knows sachs was frowning theres something wrong what she finally said something about what youre remembering well its not fucking verbatim i didnt exactly have a stenographer handy no thats not what i mean she considered for a minute then she nodded youre characterizing what he said youre using your language not his urban dwellers rationalization i want his words well i dont remember his words sachs he said he didnt have anything personal against the victims period she shook her head no ill bet he didnt say that what do you mean murderers never think of the people they kill as victims its impossible they never humanize them at least a pattern doer like the conjurer wouldnt thats hogwash from police academy psych sachs no its the real world we know theyre victims but the perps always believe they deserve to die for one reason or another think about it he didnt say victim did he well what difference does it make because he said they were representative of something and we have to find out what how did he refer to them i dont remember well he didnt say victim i know that did he talk about any of them specifically svetlana tony how about cheryl marston did he call her the blonde woman did he say lawyer did he say the woman with big boobs i guarantee he didnt say urban dweller rhyme closed his eyes tried to go back there finally he shook his head i dont and then the word came to him equestrian what youre right the word wasnt victim he called her the equestrian excellent she said rhyme felt a burst of unreasonable pride how bout the others no she was the only one he referred to rhyme was positive about this sellitto said so he thinks of the vics as people doing a particular thing that may or may not be their jobs right rhyme confirmed playing music putting makeup on people riding horses but whatta we do with that sellitto asked and as rhyme had said to her so often when she posed this very same question about crimescene evidence she replied we dont know yet detective but its a step closer to figuring him out the policewoman then consulted the notes shed been taking okay he did the razorblade tricks mentioned the burning mirror he talked to his respected audience hes obsessed with fire he picked a makeup artist a musician and a horseback rider to kill because of what they represent whatever that is can you think of anything else eyes closed again trying hard but kept seeing the razor blades the flames smelling the smoke nope he said looking back at her i think thats it okay good rhyme and he recognized the tone in her voice he knew it because it was the tone hed often use it meant she wasnt finished sachs looked up from her notes and said slowly you know youre always quoting locard rhyme nodded at the reference to the early french forensic detective and criminalist who developed a principle that was later named for him the rule held that at every crime scene theres always an exchange of evidence between the perpetrator and the victim or the locale itself however minute well im thinking there might be a psychological exchange too just like a physical one rhyme laughed at the crazy idea locard was a scientist hed have balked at having his principle applied to something as slippery as the human psyche whatre you getting at she continued you werent gagged the whole time were you no just at the end so that means you communicated something too you took part in an exchange me didnt you didnt you say anything to him sure but so what its his words thatre important im thinking he mightve said something in response to you rhyme observed sachs closely a smudge of soot the shape of a quarter moon on her cheek sweat just above her buoyant upper lip she was sitting forward and though her voice was calm he could sense the tension of concentration in her pose she wouldnt know it of course but she seemed to be feeling exactly the same emotions that he felt when he was guiding her through a crime scene miles away think about it rhyme she said imagine that youre alone with a perp not the conjurer necessarily any perp what would you say to him what would you want to know his reaction was to give a tired sigh that somehow managed to sound cynical but sure enough her question jogged something in his mind i remember he said i asked him who he was good question and he said he said he was a wizard no not just a wizard but something specific rhyme squinted as he struggled to go back to that hard place it reminded me of the wizard of oz the wicked witch of the west he frowned then he said yeah got it he said he was the wizard of the north im sure that was it does that mean anything to you sachs asked kara no he said he could escape from anything except he didnt think that hed be able to escape from us well from me he was worried wed stop him thats why he came here he said he had to stop me before tomorrow afternoon thats when he was going to start killing again wizard of the north sachs said looking over her notes now rhyme sighed i really think thats it sachs the well is dry sachs clicked the tape recorder off then leaned forward and with a tissue wiped the sweat off his forehead i figured what i was going to say was now i need a drink how bout it only if you or kara pour rhyme said to her dont let him measure it nodding sourly toward thom would you like something thom asked kara rhyme said shell want an irish coffee ill bet why doesnt starbucks start selling those kara declined the liquor but put in an order for a straight maxwell house or folgers sellitto asked about the likelihood of some food since his anticipated cubano sandwich hadnt survived the trip back to the townhouse as the aide vanished into the kitchen sachs handed kara the notes shed taken and asked if shed write down anything she thought was relevant on the magician profile board the young woman rose and went into the lab that was good sellitto told sachs that interviewing i dont know any sergeants couldve done it better she nodded an unsmiling acknowledgment but rhyme could tell she was pleased at the compliment a few minutes later mel cooper walked into the doorway his face smudged too he held up a plastic bag thiss all the evidence from the mazda the bag contained what seemed to be a fourpage folio a single folded sheet of the new york times it was clear that sachs hadnt run the scene wet evidence should be stored in paper or fiber mesh containers not plastic which promotes molds that can quickly destroy it that was all they found rhyme asked so far they havent been able to raise the car yet too dangerous rhyme asked him can you see the date cooper examined the soggy paper two days ago then it has to be the conjurers rhyme noted the car was stolen before then why would somebody save just one sheet from a newspaper and not the whole section the question as many of rhymes was purely rhetorical and he didnt bother to let anyone else have a shot at it because theres an article in it that was important to him and therefore maybe important to us of course maybe hes a dirty old man and likes the victoria s secret ads but even that might be helpful information can you read anything on it nope and i dont want to unfold it yet too wet okay get it over to the document lab if they cant open it at least they can image the headlines with infrared cooper arranged for a messenger to take the sample to the nypd crime lab in queens and then called the head document examiner at home to expedite the analysis he disappeared into the lab to transfer the newspaper to a better container for transport thom arrived with the drinks and a plate of sandwiches which sellitto promptly assaulted a few minutes later kara returned and gratefully took the coffee mug from the aide as she started pouring sugar in she said to sachs i was writing those things we found out about him on the board and i got an idea so i made a phone call i think i found his real name whose rhyme asked sipping his heavenly scotch well the conjurers the faint ring as kara stirred the sugar into her coffee became the only sound in the otherwise deadsilent room chapter twentyeight youve got his name sellitto asked who is he i think its a man named erick weir spelled rhyme asked weir more sugar into the coffee then she continued he was a performer an illusionist a few years ago i called mr balzac nobody knows the business like he does and i gave him the profile and told him some of the things hed said to lincoln tonight he got kind of weird not to mention mad a glance at sachs the way he was this morning he didnt want to help at first but finally he calmed down and told me that it sounded like weir why sachs asked well hed be about the same age early fifties and weir was known for dangerous routines sleights with razor blades and knives hes also one of the few people whos ever done the burning mirror and remember i said illusionists always specialize its really unusual to find one performer whos good at so many different tricks illusion and escape and protean and sleight even ventriloquism and mentalism well weir did all of them and he was an expert on houdini some of what hes been doing this weekend are houdinis routines or are based on them then that thing he also said about being the wizard there was a magician in the s john henry anderson thats what he called himself the wizard of the north he was real talented but he had bad luck with fires his show was nearly destroyed a couple of times david told me that weir was badly burned in a circus fire the scars rhyme said the obsession with fire and maybe his voice wasnt asthma sachs suggested the fire mightve damaged his lungs or vocal cords when was weirs accident sellitto asked three years ago the circus tent he was rehearsing in was destroyed and weirs wife was killed theyd just gotten married nobody else was badly hurt it was a good lead mel rhyme shouted forgetting his concerns about imperiling his own lungs mel a moment later cooper stepped into the room feeling better i hear lexisnexis search vicap ncic and state databases details on a erick weir weir performer illusionist magician he may be our perp kara added first name spelled erick you found his name the tech asked impressed a nod toward kara she found his name my after a few minutes cooper returned with a number of printouts he riffled through them as he addressed the team not much he said its like he kept everything about his life under wraps erick albert weir born las vegas october virtually no early history weir worked for various circuses casinos and entertainment companies as an assistant then he went out on his own as an illusionist and quickchange artist married marie cosgrove three years ago just after that he was appearing in the thomas hasbro and the keller brothers circus in cleveland during a rehearsal a fire broke out the tent was destroyed he was badly burned third degree and his wife was killed no mention of him after that track down weirs family sellitto said he would since bedding and saul were fully occupied the detective called some homicide task force detectives in the big building and put them on the job a few other things cooper said flipping through the printouts a couple of years before the fire weir was arrested and convicted of reckless endangerment in new jersey served thirty days a member of the audience was badly burned when something went wrong onstage then there were some civil lawsuits by managers for damage to theaters and injuries to employees and some suits by weir for breach of contract in one show the manager found out weir was using a real gun and real bullets in an act weir wouldnt change the routine and so the manager fired him more reading then the tech continued in one of the articles i found the names of two assistants who were working with him at the time of the fire ones in reno and ones in las vegas i got their numbers from the nevada state police its earlier their time rhyme pointed out glancing at the clock dig up the speakerphone thom no after everything tonight you need some rest just two phone calls then beddybye promise the aide debated please and thankyou thom nodded and vanished a moment later he returned with the phone plugged it in set the unit close to rhyme on the bedside table ten minutes and im pulling the main circuit breaker the aide said with enough threat in his voice to make rhyme believe hed do it fair enough sellitto finished his sandwich and dialed the number of the first assistant on coopers list the recorded voice of arthur loessers wife answered and told them that the family wasnt home but please leave a message sellitto did so then he dialed the other assistant john keating answered on the first ring and sellitto explained they were in the middle of an investigation and had some questions for him a pause then a mans nervous voice rattled out of the tiny speaker uhm whats this about thiss the new york city police thats right okay i guess its okay sellitto asked you used to work for a man named erick weir didnt you silence for a moment then the man launched into a staccato reply mr weir well uhhuh i did why the voice was edgy and high he sounded as if hed just had a dozen cups of coffee do you happen to know where he might be i mean why are you asking me about him wed like to talk to him as part of a criminal investigation oh my god about what what do you want to talk to him about we just have some general questions sellitto said have you had any contact with him lately there was a pause this was the part where the nervous man would either spill all or run for the hills rhyme knew sir sellitto asked thats funny okay you asking me i mean about him the words clattered like marbles on metal here it is ill tell you i hadnt heard from mr weir for years i thought he was dead there was this fire in ohio the last job we were working he got burned real bad he disappeared and we all thought he was dead but then maybe six or seven weeks ago he called from where rhyme asked i dont know he didnt say i didnt ask it doesnt occur to anyone to ask where somebodys calling from not the first thing you just dont think about that do you ever ask that rhyme asked what did he want okay okay he wanted to know if i still kept up with anybody at the circus where the fire happened the hasbro circus but that was ohio it was three years ago and hasbros not even in business anymore after the fire the owner folded it and it became a different show why would i keep up with anybody there here i am in reno i said i didnt and he got all ippity you know rhyme frowned again sachs tried angry oh hellooooh yeah ill say go on rhyme said struggling against impatience tell us what else he said that was it that was all what i just told you i mean there were little things oh he got his digs in like he always did the claws just like old times you know what he did when he called what was that rhyme encouraged all he said was its erick not hello not oh john how are you remember me no its erick i hadnt talked to him since the fire and what does he say its erick all these years since i got away from him working so hard to get away and then its like i havent gotten away at all i know i hadnt done anything wrong and here hes making it sound like somethings all my fault its like you take an order from a customer and then when you bring the food they claim its not what they ordered but everybody knows what happened they changed their mind and theyre making it sound like you got it wrong like its your fault and youre the one who gets in trouble sachs continued can you tell us anything about him in general other friends places he liked to go hobbies sure came the snappy voice all of the above illusion what rhyme asked that was his friends places he liked to go to hobbies you get what im saying there was nothing else he was like totally absorbed in the profession sachs tried again well what about his attitude toward people his outlook how he thought about things a long pause fifty minutes twice a week for three years ive been trying to figure him out and i cant for three years and he still hurts me i keating broke into a harsh eerie laugh you catch that i said hurts i meant to say haunts he still haunts me hows that for freudian ill have something to share next monday at nine a m wont i he still haunts me and i dont have a clue what his fucking outlook is rhyme could see everyone on the team was growing frustrated with the mans rambling he said we heard his wife was killed in the fire do you know anything about her family marie no theyd only gotten married a week or two before the fire they were really in love we thought shed calm him down make him haunt us less we were hoping that but we never got to know her can you give us the names of anybody who might know something about him art loesser was first assistant i was second we were his boys they called us ericks boys everybody did rhyme said we have a call in to loesser anyone else the only one i can think of is the manager of the hasbro circus at the time edward kadeskys his name hes a producer in chicago now i think sellitto got the spelling of the mans name then asked did weir ever call back no but he didnt need to five minutes and he got the claws in hurting and haunting its erick look i should go i have to iron my uniform im working the sunday morning shift its a busy one after they hung up sachs walked to the speakerphone to hit the disconnect button brother she muttered needs more meds sellitto observed well at least weve got a lead rhyme said track down that kadesky mel cooper disappeared for a few minutes and when he returned he had a printout of a database of theatrical companies kadesky productions had its office on south wells street in the windy city sellitto placed a call and not surprisingly being late saturday night got the answering service he left a message sellitto said okay weirs messed up his assistants life hes unstable hes injured people in the audience and now hes a pattern doer but whats making him tick sachs looked up at this lets give terry a call terry dobyns was an nypd psychologist there were several on the force but dobyns was the sole behavioral profiler a skill hed learned and honed at the fbi in quantico virginia thanks to the press and popular fiction the public hears a lot about psychological profiling and it can be valuable but only rhyme felt in a limited type of crime generally theres nothing mysterious about the workings of a perps mind but in cases where the motive is a mystery and his next target is hard to anticipate profiling can be valuable it helps investigators find informants or individuals who might know the suspect anticipate his next move set up decoys in appropriate neighborhoods run stakeouts and look for similar crimes in the past sellitto thumbed through an nypd directory of phone numbers and placed a call to dobyns at home terry lon youve got speakerphone echo let me deduce that lincoln s there too yep rhyme confirmed he had a fondness for dobyns the first person he saw when he awakened after his spinal cord accident rhyme recalled that the man loved touch football opera and the mysteries of the human mind in roughly the same degrees and all passionately sorry its late sellitto offered not sounding sorry at all but we need some help with a multiple doer weve got a name but not much else this the one in the news killed the music student this morning and that patrol officer too right he also killed a makeup artist and tried to kill a horseback rider because of what they and the student quote represented two straight women one gay man no sexual activities were at a loss and hes told lincoln that hes going to start up again tomorrow afternoon he told lincoln over the phone a letter in person rhyme said hmm that mustve been quite a conversation you dont know the half of it sellitto and rhyme gave the man a rundown on weirs crimes and what theyd learned about him dobyns asked a number of questions then he fell silent for a moment and finally said i see two forces at work in him but they reinforce each other and lead to the same result is he still performing no kara said he hasnt performed since the fire not that anybodys heard public performing dobyns said is such an intense experience its so compelling that when its denied someone who was successful the loss is profound actors and musicians magicians too id guess tend to define themselves in terms of their careers so the result is that the fire basically eradicated the man he had been the vanished man rhyme reflected that in turn means hes now motivated not by ambition to succeed or to please his audience or a devotion to his craft but by anger and thats aggravated by the second force the fire deformed him and damaged his lungs so as a public person hed be particularly selfconscious of the deformities theyd multiply the anger logarithmically we could call it the phantom of the opera syndrome i suppose hed see himself as a freak so he wants to get even yes but not necessarily in a literal sense fire quote murdered him his old persona and by murdering someone else he feels better it reduces the anxiety that the anger builds up in him why these victims no way of knowing what they represented what did they do again music student makeup stylist and a lawyer though he referred to her as an equestrian theres something about them thats tapped into his anger i dont know what it could be not yet not without more data the textbook answer is that each one of them devoted their lives to what weir would consider crucible moments important lifechanging times maybe his wife was a musician or they met at a concert the makeup stylist that could be a mother issue for instance the only happy times he mightve had with her were as a young boy sitting in the bathroom and watching her put on makeup the horses who knows maybe he and his father went horseback riding once and he enjoyed it the happiness of moments like that was taken away from him by the fire and hes targeting people who remind him of those times or it could be the opposite he has bad associations with what the victims represent you say his wife died during a rehearsal maybe there was music playing at the time hed go to all this trouble staking them out making these elaborate plans to find them and kill them rhyme asked this mustve taken months the mind has to scratch its itches dobyns said one other thing terry he also seemed to be talking to an imaginary audience wait i thought it was respected audience but i just remembered it was revered talking to them like they were really there now revered audience were going to do this or that revered the psychologist said thats important after his career and his loved one were taken away from him he shifted his reverence his love to an audience an impersonal mass people who prefer groups or crowds can be abusive even dangerous to individual human beings not only strangers but their partners wives children family members too john keating rhyme reflected in fact sounded like a child whod been abused by his father dobyns continued and in weirs case this frame of mind is even more dangerous because hes not talking to real audiences only his imaginary one this suggests to me that actual people have no value to him at all he wont have any problem killing even in large numbers this guys going to be a tough one thanks terry you get him in jar let me know id like to spend some time with him after they hung up sellitto began maybe we could go to bed thom said huh the detective asked and its not a question of could its a question of are youre going to bed lincoln and everybody else is leaving you look pale and tired no cardiovascular or neuro events on my watch if youll recall i wanted you to go to bed hours ago all right all right rhyme conceded in fact he was tired and though he wouldnt admit it to anyone the fire had scared him badly the team departed for their respective homes kara found her jacket and as she put it on rhyme observed that she was clearly upset you okay sachs asked her a dismissing shrug i had to tell mr balzac why i needed to ask him about weir hes totally pissed off ive got to go pay penance well write him a note sachs joked gently excusing you from class the girl smiled wanly rhyme called out hell with the note if it wasnt for you we wouldnt have a clue who the perp was tell him to give me a call ill fix his clock kara offered an anemic thanks youre not going to the store now are you sachs asked just for a little mr balzac is helpless with the details ill have to log in the receipts and show him my routine for tomorrow rhyme wasnt surprised that she was going to do what the man asked he noted shed said mr balzac sometimes he was david not now this echoed what theyd heard earlier despite the conjurers coming close to destroying john keatings life the assistant had referred to the killer with the same respectful appellation the power of mentors over their apprentices go on home the policewoman persisted i mean jesus you did get knifed to death today another faint laugh accompanied by a shrug i wont be there long she paused in the doorway you know i have that show in the afternoon but ill come back tomorrow morning if you want wed appreciate it rhyme said though well try to nail weirs ass before lunch so you wont have to stay long thom walked her into the corridor and out the front door sachs stepped into the doorway and inhaled the smoky air phew she exhaled then disappeared up the stairs im showering she called ten minutes later rhyme heard her walk downstairs but she didnt join him in the bedroom right away from different parts of the house came thuds and creaks muted words with thom then finally she returned to the guest room she was wearing her favorite pajamas black tshirt and silk boxers but she had two accoutrements that were atypical of her sleep gear her glock pistol and the long black tube of her issue flashlight she set them both on the bedside table that guy gets into places too damn easy she said climbing into bed next to him i checked every square inch of the house balanced chairs on all the doors and told thom if he hears anything to give a shout but to stay put im in the mood to shoot somebody but id really rather it wasnt him ii method sunday april a magical effect is like a seduction both are built through careful details planted in the mind of the subject sol stein chapter twentynine sunday morning passed in frustration as the search for erick weir stalled the team learned that after the fire in ohio the illusionist had remained in the burn unit of a local hospital for several weeks and then left on his own without officially checking out there was a record that he sold his house in downtown las vegas not long after that but no public record of buying another in that cashfat city though rhyme supposed one could easily buy a small place in the desert with a stack of greenbacks no questions asked no public filings involved the team managed to find weirs late wifes mother but mrs cosgrove knew nothing of weirs whereabouts hed never contacted them after the disaster to send his condolences about their daughters death she reported though that she wasnt surprised weir was a selfish cruel man she explained whod become obsessed with her young daughter and virtually hypnotized her into marrying him none of the other cosgrove relatives had had any contact with weir cooper compiled the remaining information from the computer searches on weir but there wasnt much no vicap or ncic reports there were no other details on the man and the officers tracking down weirs family found only that both parents were deceased that he was an only child and that no next of kin could be located late in the morning weirs other assistant art loesser returned their call from las vegas the man wasnt surprised to learn that his former boss was wanted in connection with a crime and echoed what theyd learned already that weir was one of the worlds greatest illusionists but that he took the profession far too seriously and was known for his dangerous illusions and hot temper loesser still had nightmares about being his apprentice i said hurts i meant to say haunts he still haunts me all young assistantsre influenced by their mentors loesser told the team via speakerphone but my therapist said that in weirs case we were mesmerized by him so both of them are in therapy he said being with weir created a stockholm syndrome relationship you know what that is rhyme said he was familiar with the condition where hostages form close bonds with and even feel affection and love for their kidnappers when did you last see him sachs asked the assessment exercise over she was in soft clothes today jeans and a forestgreen knit blouse in the hospital the burn unit that was about three years ago id go visit him regularly at first but all hed talk about was getting even with anybody whod ever hurt him or who didnt approve of his kind of magic then he disappeared and i never saw him after that but then the former protégé explained weir had called out of the blue about two months ago around the same time rhyme reflected hed called his other assistant loessers wife had taken the call he didnt leave a number and said hed call back but he never did thank god ill tell you i dont know that i couldve handled it do you know where he was when he called no i asked kathy i was afraid he was back in town but she said he didnt say and the call came up outofarea on callerid he didnt tell your wife what he might be calling about any clue where he might be she said he sounded odd agitated he was whispering hard to understand i remember that from after the fire his lungsd been damaged made him even scarier tell me about it rhyme thought he asked if wed heard anything about edward kadesky he was the producer of the hasbro show when the fire happened that was it loesser couldnt provide any other helpful information and they hung up thom let two policewomen into the lab sachs nodded a greeting and introduced them to rhyme diane franciscovich and nancy ausonio they were he recalled the respondings at the first murder and had been given the assignment of tracking down the antique handcuffs franciscovich said we talked to all the dealers the director of the museum recommended beneath their crisp uniforms both the tall brunette and the shorter blonde looked exhausted theyd taken their assignment seriously it seemed and probably hadnt gotten any sleep the night before the handcuffs are darbys like you thought ausonio said theyre pretty rare and expensive but weve got a list of twelve people who oh my god look franciscovich was pointing to the evidence chart where thom had written perps identity erick a weir ausonio flipped through the sheets she held erick weir placed a mail order for a pair of the cuffs from ridgeway antique weapons in seattle last month address rhyme asked excitedly post office box in denver we checked but the lease lapsed therere no records of a permanent address and no record that weir ever lived in denver method of payment sachs asked cash was the simultaneous response from ausonio and rhyme who added hes not going to make stupid mistakes nope that trails dead but at least weve got a confirmation that thiss our boy rhyme thanked the officers and sachs walked them to the door another call came in on rhymes phone the area code on the caller id looked familiar but rhyme couldnt place it command answer phone hello yessir thiss lieutenant lansing state police im trying to reach detective roland bell i was given this number as his temporary command post hey harv bell called walking closer to the speaker phone im here he explained to rhyme our liaison on the constable case up in canton falls lansing continued we got the evidence you sent up here this morning our forensic boysre going through it we had a couple of detectives go and talk to swensens wife that minister you folks took down last night she didnt say anything helpful and my boys didnt find anything in the trailer to connect him to constable or anybody else in the patriot assembly nothin bell sighed too bad i figured him to be pokeeasy careless maybe the patriot boys got there first and scoured the place clean thats moren half likely man im feeling were due a little luck here okay keep at it harv thanks well let you know we come up with anything else roland they hung up this constable cases fullup tough as this one nodding at the whiteboards another knock on the front door armed with a large coffee cup kara walked into the room looking more tired and haggard than the policewomen sellitto was delivering a monologue about new techniques for weight loss when his jenny craig lecture was interrupted by yet another phone call lincoln the voice crackled through the speakerphone bedding here we think weve narrowed the key down to three hotels reason it took so long the voice of his partner saul interrupted turns out that a lot of monthly and longterm hotels use card keys too not to mention hourlyrate places but thats a whole nother story we had to check them all out anyway thats what we found its probably i say probably either the chelsea lodge the beckman or the what is it or the lanham arms his partner supplied right theyre the only ones using this color model were at the beckman now thirtyfour and fifth were about to start trying it out what do you mean trying it out rhyme called how di put this bedding or saul wondered the keys work one way but not the other hows that rhyme asked see only the lock unit on the hotel room door can read a key the machine at the front desk that burns the room codes onto a blank key cant read one thats already been burned and tell you what room it is why not thats crazy nobody ever needs to know that except us of course which is why we have to go from door to door and try them all shit rhyme snapped summarizes our feelings too one of the detectives said sellitto asked okay you need more people nup we can only do one door at a time no other way to do it and if theres a new guest in the room this cardll be invalid which wont improve our moods any say gentlemen bell said into the phone hey there roland we recognized the accent you said the lanham arms where is that east seventyfive near lex something familiar bout the name cant quite place it bell was frowning shaking his head thats next on our list after the beckman with its six hundred and eightytwo rooms better get to it they left the twins to their arduous task coopers computer beeped and he read an incoming email fbi lab in washington finally got a report on the metal shavings in the conjurers gym bag they say the markings suggest theyre consistent with a clock mechanism well its not a clock rhyme said obviously how do you know bell asked its a detonator sachs said solemnly thats what id say rhyme confirmed a gas bomb cooper asked nodding toward the handkerchief souvenir weir had left last night which had been soaked in gasoline likely hes got a supply of gas and hes obsessed with fire hes going to burn the next victim just like what happened to him fire quote murdered him his old persona and by murdering someone else he feels better it reduces the anxiety that the anger builds up in him rhyme noticed the hour was approaching almost afternoon the next victim was going to die soon but when or a shudder of frustration and anger started at the base of his skull and vanished into his stony body they had so little time maybe no time at all but he could come to no conclusions based on the evidence they had and the day dragged on slow as an iv drip a fax arrived cooper read it from the document examiner in queens they opened up the newspaper that was in the mazda no notations anywhere and nothing was circled thosere the headlines he taped it to the board

school the gala had he tested out a gimmick that disrupted the electricity at the police station he felt all the more frustrated because they had some new evidence but its meaning remained elusive sellittos phone rang as he took the call everyone stared at him anticipating another death the time was now well into the afternoon well into the killing time but apparently the news wasnt bad the detective lifted an eyebrow in pleasant surprise and said into the receiver thats right really well thats not far away could you come over here he then gave rhymes address and hung up who edward

kadesky then asked for identification you dont mind sellitto continued explaining that theyd recently had trouble with a perp masquerading as someone else kadesky a man not used to being unrecognized let alone carded was put out but he complied and offered sellitto his illinois drivers license mel cooper took a subtle look at both the picture and the producer and then gave a nod to rhyme the tech had already gone online with illinois dmv and gotten the license particulars and a picture of the man all of which checked out your message said this was about erick weir kadesky asked his gaze was hawklike and imperious right so hes still alive that the man would ask the question was a disappointment to rhyme it meant that kadesky probably knew even less than they did rhyme said very much alive hes a suspect in a series of homicides in town no who did he kill some local residents a police officer too sellitto explained we were hoping you could give us some information thatd help find him i havent heard about him since just after the fire do you know about that a little sachs said fill us in he blamed me for it you know it was three years ago weir and his assistants were doing the illusion and quickchange acts in our show oh they were good i mean astonishing but wed been having complaints for months from the staff and from the audience weir scared people he was like a little dictator and those assistants of his we called them the moonies he had them indoctrinated illusion to him was like a religion sometimes people got hurt in rehearsal or during the show even audience volunteers and weir couldntve cared less he thought magic worked best when there was some risk he said magic should be a hot iron it should brand your soul the producer laughed grimly but we cant have that in the entertainment business now can we so i talked to sidney keller he was the owner and we decided we had to fire him one sunday morning before the matinee i told the stage manager to let him go that was the day of the fire rhyme asked kadesky nodded the manager found weir rigging the stage with propane lines for an illusion of his the burning mirror he told him what wed decided but weir lost it he shoved the manager down the stairs and kept right on rigging the trick i went down to the stage he grabbed me we werent really fighting just scuffling but a propane line was loose we fell into some metal chairs and i guess a spark ignited the gas he was burned and his wife was killed the whole tent was destroyed we talked about suing him but he snuck out of the hospital and disappeared we found a case in new jersey reckless endangerment do you know if he was arrested anywhere else rhyme asked no idea kadesky shook his head i shouldntve hired him but if youd ever seen his show youd understand he was the best the audiences may have been terrified they may have been well abused but they bought tickets to see him and you shouldve heard the ovations the producer looked at his watch the time was you know my show starts in fifteen minutes i think itd be a good idea to get a few more police cars over there with weir around and everything that happened between us over where rhyme asked to my show he nodded toward central park thats yours the cirque fantastique right i assumed you knew that you had the police car parked there you do know that cirque fantastique is the old hasbro and keller brothers circus what sellitto asked rhyme glanced at kara who was shaking her head mr balzac never told me that when i called him last night after the fire kadesky said we retooled cirque du soleil was having so much success i recommended to sid keller that we do what they were when we got the insurance money we started fantastique no no no rhyme whispered staring at the evidence charts what linc sellitto asked thats what weirs doing here he announced your shows his target cirque fantastique what scanning the evidence again applying facts to the premise rhyme nodded dogs what sachs asked goddamn dogs look at the chart look at it the animal hairs and central park dirtre from the dog knoll right outside the window a fierce nod toward the front of his townhouse he wasnt checking out cheryl marston on the bridle path he was checking out the circus the newspaper the one in his mazda look at that headline entertainment for kids young and old call up the paper see if theres information about the circus in it thom call peter hurry the aide was good friends with a reporter for the times a young man whod helped them occasionally in the past he grabbed the phone and placed the call peter hoddins worked the international desk but it took him less than a minute to find the answer he relayed the information to thom who announced the circus was the feature of the story all sorts of details hours acts bios of the employees even a sidebar on security shit rhyme snapped he was doing his research and the press pass thatd give him access to backstage rhyme was squinting as he looked at the evidence chart yes i get it now the victims what did they represent jobs in the circus a makeup artist a horseback rider and the first victim yes she was a student but what was her job singing and entertaining kids like a clownd do and the murder techniques themselves sachs pointed out they were all magic tricks yep hes after your show terry dobyns said his motive was ultimately revenge hell hes planted a fuel bomb my god kadesky said therere two thousand people there and the shows starting in ten minutes at two in the afternoon the sunday matinee rhyme added just like in ohio three years ago sellitto grabbed his motorola and called the officers stationed at the circus there was no answer the detective frowned and placed a call on rhymes speakerphone officer koslowski here the man answered a moment later sellitto identified himself and barked why isnt your radio on officer radio well were off duty lieutenant off duty you just went on duty well detective we were told to stand down you were what some detective came by a half hour ago and told us we werent needed anymore said we could take the rest of the day off im on my way to rockaway beach with my family i can describe him fifties beard brown hair whered he go no idea walked up to the car flashed his shield and dismissed us sellitto slammed the disconnect its happening oh man its happening he shouted to sachs call the sixth get the bomb squad there then he himself called central and had emergency services and fire trucks sent to the circus kadesky ran toward the door ill evacuate the tent bell said he was calling emergency medical services and having burn teams established at columbia presbyterian i want more softclothed in the park rhyme said a lot of them i have a feeling the conjurers going to be there be there sellitto asked to watch the fire hell be close i remember his eyes when he was looking at the flames in my room he likes to watch fire no he wouldnt miss this for the world chapter thirty he wasnt worried so much about the fire itself as edward kadesky sprinted the short distance from lincoln rhymes apartment to the tent of the cirque fantastique he was thinking that with new codes and fire retardants even the worst theater and circus tent fires proceed fairly slowly no the real danger is the panic the tons of human muscles the stampede that tramples and tears and crushes and suffocates bones broken lungs burst asphyxiation saving people in a circus disaster means getting them out of the facility without panic traditionally to alert the clowns and acrobats and other hands that a fire has broken out the ringmaster would send a subtle signal to the bandleader who then launched into the energetic john philip sousa march stars and stripes forever the workers were supposed to take up emergency stations and calmly lead the audience through designated exits those employees who didnt simply of course abandon ship themselves the tune had been replaced over the years by far more efficient procedures for the evacuation of a circus tent but if a gas bomb detonated spreading burning liquid everywhere the crowd would sprint to the exits and a thousand people would die in the crush edward kadesky ran into the tent and saw twentysix hundred people eagerly awaiting the opening of his show his show that was what he thought the show hed created kadesky had been a hawker in sideshows a curtain bitch at secondtier theaters in thirdtier cities a payroll manager and ticket seller in sweaty regional circuses hed struggled for years to bring to the public shows that transcended the tawdry side of the business the carny aspect of circuses hed done it once with the hasbro and keller brothers show which erick weir had destroyed then hed done it again with cirque fantastique a worldrenowned show that brought legitimacy even prestige to a profession that was so often disparaged by those who attended theater and opera and ignored by those who watched e and mtv remembering the wave of searing heat from the hasbro tent fire in ohio the flecks of ash like deadly gray snow the howl of the flames the astonishing noise as his show had lumbered to its death right in front of him there was one difference though three years ago the tent had been empty today thousands of men women and children would be in the middle of the conflagration kadeskys assistant katherine tunney a young brunette whod risen high in the disney theme park organization before coming to work with him noticed his troubled gaze and instantly joined him that was one of katherines big talents sensing his thoughts almost telepathically what she whispered he told her what hed learned from lincoln rhyme and the police her eyes began to sweep the circus tent just like his looking both for the bomb and at the victims how do we handle it she asked tersely he considered this for a moment then gave her instructions he added then you leave get out but are you staying what are do it now he said firmly then squeezed her hand in a softer voice he added ill meet you outside itll be okay she wanted to embrace him he sensed but his glance told her no they were in view of most of the seats here he didnt want anyone in the audience to think even for a moment that something was wrong walk slowly keep smiling were performers before anything else remember katherine nodded and went first to the lighting man and then to the bandleader to deliver kadeskys instructions finally she took up a position beside the main doorway straightening his tie and buttoning his jacket kadesky glanced at the orchestra nodded a drum roll began showtime he thought as he strode smiling broadly into the middle of the ring the audience began to fall silent he stopped in the direct center of the circle and the drum roll ceased a moment later two fingers of white illumination targeted him though hed told katherine to have the lighting man hit him with the main spots he still gave a brief gasp thinking for an instant that the brilliant lights were from the detonating gas bomb but his smile never wavered and he recovered instantly he lifted a cordless microphone to his lips and began to speak good afternoon ladies and gentlemen welcome to the cirque fantastique calm pleasant commanding we have a wonderful show for you today and to begin im going to ask your indulgence im afraid were going to inconvenience you a bit but i think the effort will be well worth it we have a special performance outside the tent i apologize we tried to get the plaza hotel inside here but their management wouldnt let us something about the guests not agreeing a pause for the laughter so im going to ask you to hold on to your ticket stubs and step outside into central park the crowd began murmuring wondering what the act might be he smiled find space anywhere nearby if you can see the buildings on central park south youll be able to watch the act just fine laughter and excitement now in the seats what could he mean were daredevils doing highwire acts on the skyscrapers now lower rows first in an orderly manner if you please use whatever exit is near you the houselights went up he saw katherine tunney standing at the door smiling and motioning people to leave please he thought to her get out leave the audience was chatting loudly as they rose he could vaguely see them through the blinding lights they were looking at their companions wondering who should be the first to leave which way to go then they began to gather children collecting purses and popcorn containers checking for their ticket stubs kadesky smiled as he watched them rise and amble toward the exits to safety but he was thinking chicago illinois december at a matinee performance of eddie foys famous vaudeville routine at the iroquois theater a spotlight started a fire that quickly spread from the stage to the seats the two thousand people inside raced to the exits jamming them closed so completely that firemen couldnt get through the doors more than six hundred in the audience died horrible deaths hartford connecticut july another matinee at the ringling brothers and barnum bailey circus just as the famous wallenda family was starting its renowned highwire act a small fire started in the southeast side of the tent and soon devoured the canvas which had been waterproofed with gasoline and paraffin within minutes more than one hundred fifty people had been burned suffocated or crushed to death chicago hartford so many other cities too thousands of terrible deaths in theater and circus fires over the years was that going to happen here is that how the cirque fantastique how his show would be remembered the tent was emptying smoothly yet the price of avoiding panic was a slow exit there were still many people inside and some it seemed remained in their seats preferring to stay inside and miss the spectacle in the park when most people had left hed have to tell them what was really going on when was the bomb set to go off probably not right away weir would give the latecomers a chance to arrive and take their seats to cause the most injuries it was now maybe hed set it for an even time quarter past or and where was it he had no clue where one might leave a bomb so that it would do the most damage glancing across the tent to the crowd massing at the front doorway he saw katherines silhouette the womans arm beckoning to him to leave but he was staying hed do whatever was necessary to evacuate the tent including taking people by the hand and leading them to the door pushing them out if he needed to and returning for more even if the tent was falling in sheets of fire around him he was going to be the last person out smiling broadly he shook his head to her and then lifted the microphone and continued to tell the audience what a delightful act awaited them outside suddenly loud music interrupted him he glanced at the bandstand the musicians had left as kadesky had ordered but the bandleader stood over the computer console that controlled the prerecorded music they sometimes used their eyes met and kadesky nodded in approval the leader a veteran of circus life had put on a tape and turned the volume up the tune was the stars and stripes forever amelia sachs pushed through the crowds exiting the cirque fantastique and ran into the center of the tent where marching music was blaring loudly and edward kadesky was holding a microphone and enthusiastically urging everyone outside to see a special illusion to avoid panic she assumed brilliant idea she thought picturing the horrific crush if this many people raced for the exits sachs was the first officer to arrive approaching sirens told her other rescue workers would be here soon but she didnt wait for anyone else she began the search immediately she looked around trying to decide the best place to leave a fuel bomb to cause the most fatalities she supposed hed plant it under some bleachers near an exit the device or devices would be bulky unlike dynamite or plastic explosives fuel bombs must be large to do significant damage they could be hidden in a shipping container or a large cardboard box maybe in an oil drum she noticed a plastic trash container a big one which would hold about fifty gallons she guessed it was just to the side of the main exit and dozens of people were walking slowly past it on their way outside there were twenty or twentyfive such bins inside the tent the darkgreen containers would be the perfect choice to hide bombs she ran to the one nearest her and paused at the drum she was unable to see inside the lid was in an inverted vshape with a swinging door but sachs knew the door wouldnt be rigged to trigger the detonator the brass told them he was using a timer she took a small flashlight from her back pocket and shone it into the messy foulsmelling interior the bin was already more than half full of paper and food wrappers and empty cups she couldnt see the bottom she shifted the drum slightly it was too light to hold even a gallon of gasoline another glance around the tent still hundreds of people inside heading slowly for the doors and dozens of other trash bins to check out she started for the next one then she stopped and squinted under the main bleachers and right near the south exit of the tent was an object about four feet square covered by a black tarp she thought immediately about weirs trick of using a cloth to hide himself whatever was under the cloth was virtually invisible and was big enough to hold hundreds of gallons of gas a large crowd was within twenty feet of it outside sirens grew louder and then began to go silent as the emergency vehicles parked near the tent firemen and police officers began to enter she flashed her shield to the one nearest her bomb squad here yet should be five six minutes she nodded and told them to carefully check the trash drums then she started toward the tarpcovered box and then it happened not the bomb itself but the panic which seemed to erupt as fast as a detonation sachs wasnt sure what prompted it the sight of the emergency vehicles outside and the firemen pushing their way inside probably made some patrons uneasy then sachs heard a series of pops at the main doorway she recognized the sound from yesterday the snapping of the huge commedia dellarte harlequin banner in the wind but the audience at that exit mustve thought they were gunshots and turned back panicked looking for other exits suddenly the tent filled with a huge collective voice like the inhalation of a breath in fear a deep rustling a roar then the wave broke screaming and crying out people stampeded for the doors sachs was slammed from behind by the terrified mass her cheekbone struck the shoulder of a man in front of her leaving her stunned screams rose snatches of howls and shouts about fire about bombs about terrorists dont push she cried but no one heard her words it would be impossible to stop the tide anyway a thousand individuals had become a single entity some people tried to fend off its crushing body but in the surge from behind they were pressed into it and became part of the beast which lurched desperately toward the glare of the opening sachs wrenched her arm free from between two teenage boys their ruddy faces long with fear her head was slammed forward and she glimpsed some tattered flesh on the tent floor she gasped thinking a child was being trampled but no it was a shredded balloon a babys bottle a scrap of green cloth popcorn a souvenir harlequin mask a discman were being ground apart under the massive weight of the feet if anyone was to fall theyd die in seconds sachs herself felt no balance or control it seemed she could tumble helplessly to the floor at any moment then her feet were actually lifted off the floor sandwiched between two sweating bodies a big man in a bloody izod shirt holding a sobbing young boy above his head and a woman who seemed to have passed out the screams grew louder childrens and adults mixed and fueled the panic heat enveloped her and soon it was nearly impossible to breathe the pressure on her chest threatened to crush her heart to silence claustrophobia amelia sachss one big fear now wrapped its tight arms around her and she felt herself swallowed up by an unbearable sensation of confinement when you move they cant getcha but she wasnt moving anywhere she was held tight by a suffocating mass of powerful damp bodies not even human now a collection of muscles and sweat and fists and spit and feet pressing harder and harder into itself please no please let me move let me get one hand free let me take one breath of air she thought she saw blood she thought she saw torn flesh maybe they were hers from terror as much as from the pain and the suffocation amelia sachs felt herself start to black out no dont fall under their feet dont fall please she couldnt breathe not a cubic inch of air entered her lungs then she saw a knee inches from her face it slammed into her cheek and stayed rooted there she could smell dirty jeans saw a scuffed boot in front of her eyes inches away please dont let me fall then she realized that maybe she already had chapter thirtyone wearing a bellhops uniform that closely matched those worn by the staff at the lanham arms hotel on the upper east side of manhattan malerick walked along the fifteenthfloor hallway of the hotel he carried a heavy roomservice tray on which was a domed plate cover and a vase containing a huge red tulip everything about him was in harmony with his surroundings so as not to arouse suspicion malerick himself was the model of a deferential pleasant bellhop the averted eyes the half smile the unobtrusive walk the spotless tray only one thing set him apart from the other bellhops here at the lanham under the metal warming dome on the tray was not a plate of eggs benedict or a club sandwich but a loaded beretta automatic pistol equipped with a sausagethick sound suppressor and a leather pouch of lockpicking and other tools enjoying your stay he asked one couple yes they were and they wished him a good afternoon he continued to nod and smile at the guests returning to their rooms after sunday brunch or on their way to sightsee on this fine spring afternoon he passed a window in which he could see a bit of green a portion of central park he wondered what sort of excitement was unfolding there at the moment inside the white tent of the cirque fantastique the place to which hed spent the past few days directing the police with the clues hed left at the sites of the murders or misdirecting them he should say misdirection and ruse were the keys to successful illusion and there was no one better at it than malerick the man of a million faces the man who materialized like a struck match who disappeared like a snuffed flame the man who vanished himself the police would be frantic of course looking for the gasoline bomb which they believed would go off at any moment but there was no bomb no risk at all to the two thousand people at the cirque fantastique no risk other than the possibility that some of them would be trampled to death in their mindless panic at the end of the hallway malerick glanced behind him and observed that he was alone quickly he set the tray on the floor near a doorway and lifted the cover he collected the black pistol and slipped it into a zippered pocket in his bellmans uniform he opened the leather tool pouch extracted a screwdriver and pocketed the pouch too moving fast he unscrewed the metal guard that allowed the window to open only a few inches human beings do seem to take any opportunity to kill themselves dont they he reflected and raised the window all the way he carefully replaced the screwdriver in its spot in the leather pouch and zipped it away his strong arms deftly boosted him onto the sill he stepped carefully out on the ledge feet above the ground the ledge was twenty inches wide hed measured the same ledge from the window of the room hed taken here a few days ago and though hed only done limited acrobatics in his life he had the superb balance of all great illusionists he moved along the limestone rim now as comfortably as if it were a sidewalk after a stroll of only fifteen feet he came to the corner of the hotel and stopped looking at the building next door to the lanham arms this an apartment building on east seventyfifth street had no ledges but did have a fire escape six feet away from where he now stood overlooking an air shaft filled with the restless churning of airconditioners malerick took a brief running start and leaped over the bottomless gap easily reaching the fire escape and vaulting over the railing he climbed up two flights and paused at a window on the seventeenth floor a glance inside the hallway was empty he placed the gun and the tool kit on the window ledge then stripped off the fake bellhops uniform in one fast peel revealing beneath it a simple gray suit white shirt and tie the gun went into his belt and he used the tools again to open the window lock he hopped inside standing motionless catching his breath malerick then started down the hallway toward the apartment he sought stopping at the door he dropped to his knees and opened the tool kit again into the keyhole he inserted a tension bar and above it the lock pick in three seconds hed scrubbed the lock open in five the deadbolt he pushed the door open only far enough to be able to see the hinges which he sprayed with oil from a tiny canister like breath spray to keep them silent a moment later he was inside the long dark hallway of the apartment malerick eased the door shut he oriented himself looking around the entryway on the wall were some massproduced prints of salvador dalis surreal landscapes some family portraits and most prominently a clumsy watercolor of new york city painted by a child the artists signature was chrissy a cheap table sat near the door its short leg lengthened with a folded yellow square of foolscap legal paper a single ski the binding broken leaned forlornly in the corner of the hallway the wallpaper was old and stained malerick started down the corridor toward the sound of the television in the living room but he detoured momentarily stepping into a small dark room that was dominated by an ebony kawai baby grand piano a book of music instructions noted in the margin sat open on the piano the name chrissy appeared here too penned on the cover of the book malerick only had a rudimentary knowledge of music but as he flipped through the lesson book he observed that the pieces seemed quite difficult he decided that the girl mightve been a bad artist but she was quite the talented young musician this christine grady the daughter of new york assistant district attorney charles grady the man whose apartment this was the man malerick was being paid one hundred thousand dollars to kill amelia sachs sat on the grass outside of the cirque fantastique tent wincing from the pain throbbing around her right kidney shed helped dozens of people away from the crush and had found a spot here to catch her breath staring down at her from the huge blackandwhite banner above her head was the masked arlecchino still rippling loudly in the wind hed seemed eerie yesterday now after the panic inside which hed caused the image was repulsive and grotesque she had avoided being trampled to death the knee and boot thatd clobbered her belonged to a man whod scrabbled over the heads and shoulders of the audience to beat them out the door still her back ribs and face throbbed shed sat here for nearly fifteen minutes faint and nauseated partly from the crush partly from the horrifying claustrophobia she could generally tolerate small rooms even elevators being completely restrained unable to move though physically sickened her and racked her with panic around her the injured were being treated thered been nothing serious the ems chief had reported to her mostly sprains and cuts a few dislocations and a broken arm sachs and those around her had been spewed out the south exit of the tent once outside shed fallen to her knees on the grass crawling away from the crowd no longer trapped in an enclosed space with a potential bomb or an armed terrorist the audience became better samaritans and helped those who were woozy or hurt shed flagged down an officer from the bomb squad and looking at him upside down from her grassy bed flashed her badge and told him about the tarpcovered object under the seats near the south door hed returned to his colleagues inside then the brassy music from the tent had stopped and edward kadesky stepped outside watching the bomb squad at work some of the audience realized that thered been a real threat and that kadeskys quick thinking had saved them from a worse panic they offered some impromptu applause which hed acknowledged modestly as he made the rounds checking on his employees and the audience other circusgoers injured and otherwise were less generous and scowled and demanded to know what had happened and complained that he should have handled the evacuation better meanwhile the bomb squad and a dozen firemen had scoured the tent and found no sign of a device the tarpcovered box had turned out to be cartons of toilet paper the search expanded to the trailers and supply trucks but the officers found nothing there either sachs frowned theyd been wrong how could that be she wondered the evidence was so clear it was rhymes way to make bold assumptions about evidence and sometimes sure he made mistakes but in the case of the conjurer it seemed that all the evidence had come together and pointed directly to the cirque fantastique as his target had rhyme heard that theyd found no bombs she wondered rising unsteadily she went off in search of someones radio to borrow her motorola now lying in pieces near the south door of the tent had apparently been the sole fatality of the panic stepping quietly out of the music room in charles gradys apartment malerick walked back into the darkened hallway and paused listening to the voices from the living room and kitchen wondering just how dangerous this would be hed taken steps to make it less likely that gradys bodyguards would panic and gun him down at his lunch at the riverside inn in bedford junction two weeks ago meeting with jeddy barnes and other militiamen from upstate new york malerick had laid out his plan hed decided itd be best to have someone make an attempt on the prosecutors life before malericks invasion of gradys apartment today the universal choice for a fall guy was some pervert of a minister from canton falls named ralph swensen barnes had some leverage on the reverend but explained to malerick that he hadnt fully trusted him so after his escape from the harlem river yesterday the illusionist had donned his janitors costume and had followed the reverend from his fleabag hotel to greenwich village just to make sure the loser didnt balk at the last minute malericks plan called for swensens attempt to fail the gun barnes provided had a broken firing pin malerick had theorized that catching one assassin would lull gradys guards into complacency and make them psychologically less likely to react violently when they saw a second killer well that was the theory he reflected uneasily lets see if it holds up in practice walking silently past more bad art past more family portraits past stacks of magazines law reviews and vogues and the new yorkers and scabby streetfair antiques the gradys had bought intending to refinish but that sat as permanent testimonials to the proposition that there just arent enough hours in the day malerick knew his way around the apartment hed been here once before briefly disguised as a maintenance man but that had been basic reconnaissance learning the layout the entrance and escape routes he hadnt spent any time noticing the personal side of the familys life the diplomas of grady and his wife who was also an attorney wedding photos snapshots of relatives and a gallerys worth of pictures of their blonde nineyearold daughter malerick recalled his meeting with barnes and his associates over lunch the militiamen had digressed into a cold debate about whether it made sense to kill gradys wife and daughter too according to malericks plan sacrificing swensen made sense but what was the point hed wondered of killing gradys family hed posed this question to barnes and the others between bites of very good roast turkey well now mr weir jeddy barnes had said to malerick thats a good question id say you should kill em just because and malerick had nodded offering a thoughtful expression he knew enough never to condescend to either an audience or fellow performers well i dont mind killing them hed explained but wouldnt it make more sense to leave them alive unless theyre a risk like a risk they could identify me or say the little girl goes for the phone to call the police probably there are some of your people whod object to killing women and children well its your plan mr weir barnes had said well go with what you think though the idea of temperance seemed to leave him vaguely dissatisfied now malerick stopped outside gradys living room and hung a fake nypd badge around his neck the one hed flashed at the cops near the cirque fantastique when hed sent them home for the day he glanced in a fleamarket mirror whose surface needed to be recoated yes he was in role looking just like a detective here to protect a prosecutor against whom vicious death threats had been made a deep breath no butterflies and now revered audience lights up curtain up the real show is about to begin hands held naturally at his sides malerick turned the corner of the corridor and strode into the living room chapter thirtytwo hey hows it going the man in the gray suit asked startling luis martinez the quiet bulky detective working for roland bell the guard was sitting on the couch in front of the tv a sunday new york times in his lap man surprised me he nodded a greeting glanced at the newcomers badge and id and then scanned his face you the relief thats right howd you get in they give you a key got one downtown he was speaking in a throaty whisper like he had a cold lucky you luis muttered weve gotta share one pain in the ass wheres mr grady in the kitchen with his wife and chrissy how come youre early i dunno the man replied im just the hired help thiss the time they told me story of our lives huh luis said he frowned i dont think i know you names joe david the man said usually work over in brooklyn luis nodded yeah thats where i cut my teeth the seventy this is my first rotation here bodyguard detail i mean a loud commercial came on the tv sorry luis said i missed that your first rotation you said right the big detective said okay how bout your last too luis dropped the newspaper and leaped up from the couch drawing his glock smoothly and pointing it at the man he knew was erick weir normally placid luis now shouted into his microphone hes here he got in in the living room two other officers whod been waiting in the kitchen detective bell and that fat lieutenant lon sellitto shoved through another doorway both with astonished looks on their faces they grabbed weirs arms and pulled a silenced pistol from his belt down now now now sellitto shouted in a raw edgy voice his gun pressed into the mans face and what an expression was on it luis thought hed seen a lot of surprised perps over the years but this guy took the prize he was gasping couldnt speak but luis supposed he wasnt any more surprised than the cops were where the hell dhe come from sellitto asked breathlessly bell only shook his head in dismay as luis doublecuffed weir roughly sellitto leaned close to the perp you alone you got backup outside no dont bullshit us my arms youre hurting my arms weir gasped anybody else with you no no i swear bell was calling the others on his handytalkie heaven help me he got inside i dont know how two uniformed officers assigned to the saving the witnesss ass team hurried into the apartment from the hallway where theyd been hiding near the elevator looks like he jimmied the window on this floor one of them said you know the window at the fire escape bell glanced at weir and he understood the ledge from the lanham you jumped weir said nothing but that had to be the answer theyd stationed officers in the alley between the lanham and gradys building and on the roofs of both structures too but it had never occurred to them hed walk along the ledge and leap over the air shaft bell asked the officers and no sign of anybody else nope looks like he was solo sellitto donned latex gloves and patted him down the search yielded burglary tools and various props and magic supplies the oddest were the fake fingertips glued on tightly sellitto pulled them off and deposited them in a plastic evidence bag if the situation werent so unnerving that a hired killer had actually gotten into the apartment of the family they were protecting the image of the ten finger pads in a bag wouldve been comical they looked over their prey as sellitto continued to search him weir was muscular and in excellent shape despite the fact that the fire had caused some serious damage the scarring was quite extensive any id bell asked sellitto shook his head fao schwarz meaning lowquality fake nypd badge and id card not much better than toys weir glanced toward the kitchen which he could see was empty he frowned oh the gradys arent here bell said as if it were obvious the man closed his eyes and rested his head on the threadbare carpet how how did you figure it out sellitto supplied an answer of sorts well guess what theres somebody whod love to answer that question for you come on were going for a ride looking over the shackled killer standing in the doorway of the lab lincoln rhyme said welcome back but the fire dismayed the man looked toward the stairway that led up to the bedroom sorry we ruined your performance rhyme said coldly i guess you couldnt quite escape from me after all could you weir he turned his gaze back to the criminalist and hissed thats not my name anymore you changed it weir shook his head not legally but weirs who i used to be i go by something else now rhyme recalled psychologist terry dobynss observation that the fire had murdered weirs old persona and hed become somebody else the killer now looked over rhymes body you understand that dont you youd like to forget the past and become somebody else too id imagine what are you calling yourself thats between me and my audience ah yes his revered audience doublehandcuffed looking bewildered and diminished weir wore a gray businessmans suit the wig hed worn last night was gone his real hair was thick long and dark blond in the daylight rhyme could better see the scarring above his collar it looked quite severe howd you find me the man asked in his wheezing voice i led you to to the cirque fantastique you did when rhyme had outthought a perp his mood improved considerably and he was pleased to chat you mean you misdirected us there see i was looking over the evidence and i got to thinking that the whole case seemed a bit too easy easy he coughed briefly in crimescene work therere two types of evidence therere the clues that are inadvertently left by the perp and then there are planted clues ones that are intentionally left to mislead us after everyone ran off to look for gas bombs at the circus i got this sense that some of the clues had been planted they seemed obvious the shoes you left at the second victims apartment had dog hairs and dirt and trace that led to central park it occurred to me that a smart perp mightve ground the dirt and hairs into the shoes and left them at the scene so wed find them and think about the dog knoll next to the circus and all the talk of fire when you came to see me last night he glanced toward kara verbal misdirection right kara weirs troubled eyes looked the young woman up and down yep she said pouring sugar in her coffee but i tried to kill you weir wheezed if id told you those things to lead you off id need you to be alive rhyme laughed you didnt try to kill me at all you never intended to you wanted to make it look that way to give what you told me credibility the first thing you did after you set the fire in my bedroom was to run outside and call nineoneone from a pay phone i checked with dispatch the man who called said he could see the flames from the phone kiosk except that it was around the corner you cant see my room from there thom checked on that by the way thank you thom rhyme called to the aide who happened to be passing the doorway at that moment nada came the harried reply weir closed his eyes shaking his head as he realized the depth of his mistake rhyme squinted staring at the evidence board all of the victims had jobs or interests reflecting performers in the circus the musician makeup artist horseback riding and the murder techniques were magic tricks too but if your motive really was to destroy kadesky you wouldve led us away from cirque fantastique not toward it that meant you were leading us away from something else what i looked at the evidence again at the third scene by the river we surprised you you didnt have time to pick up your jacket with the press pass and hotel key card in the pocket which meant that those couldntve been planted clues they had some legitimate connection to what you were really up to the hotel card key was from one of three hotels one of them was the lanham arms detective bell thought it sounded familiar and checked his logbook it turned out that he had coffee with charles grady in the lobby bar to talk about the security detail for his family a week ago roland told me that the lanham was right next door to gradys apartment then the press pass i called the reporter you stole it from he was covering the andrew constable trial and had interviewed charles grady several times we found some brass shavings and assumed the worst that they were from a bomb timer but they mightve just come from a key or a tool sachs took up the narrative then the new york times page we found in your car in the river it had an article about the circus yes but there was also an article about constables trial a nod toward the evidence board militia murder plot trial opens monday rhyme continued the restaurant check too you shouldve thrown that out what check weir asked frowning also in your jacket from two saturdays ago but that weekend i was he stopped speaking abruptly out of town you were going to say sachs asked yeah we know the check was from a restaurant in bedford junction i dont know what youre talking about a trooper in canton falls investigating the patriot assembly group called on my phone asking for roland rhyme said i recognized the area code from the callerid it was the same as the number of the restaurant on the check weirs eyes grew still and rhyme continued bedford junction turns out to be the town next to canton falls whichs where constable lives whos this constable you keep talking about he asked quickly but rhyme could see telltale signs of recognition in his face sellitto took over was barnes one of the people you had lunch with jeddy barnes i dont know who you mean you know the patriot assembly though just what ive read about in the paper we dont believe you sellitto said believe what you like weir snapped rhyme could see the fierce anger in the eyes the anger that dobyns had predicted after a pause he asked howd you find out my real name no one answered but weirs eyes settled on the latest additions about him on the evidence chart his face grew dark as he gasped somebody betrayed me didnt they they told you about the fire and kadesky who was it a vicious smile as he glanced from sachs to kara and finally settled on rhyme was it john keating he told you that i called him didnt he spineless shit he never stood up to me art loesser too right theyre all fucking judases ill remember them i always remember the people who betray me he had a coughing fit when it ended weir was looking across the room kara is that what he said your name is and who are you im an illusionist she said defiantly one of us weir mocked looking her up and down a girl illusionist and youre what a consultant or something maybe after im released ill come visit maybe ill vanish you sachs snapped oh you aint getting released in this lifetime weir the conjurers gasping laugh was chilly then how about when i escape walls are after all just an illusion i dont think escapes much of an option either sellitto added rhyme said well i answered your how weir or whatever youre calling yourself how bout if you answer my why we thought it was revenge against kadesky but then it turns out youre after grady what are you some kind of hitman illusionist revenge weir asked furious what the fuck good is revenge will it take the scars away and fix my lungs will it bring my wife back you dont fucking understand the only thing in my life the only thing thats ever meant anything to me is performing illusion magic my mentor groomed me for the profession all my life the fire took that away from me i dont have the strength to perform my hands deformed my voice is ruined whod come to see me i cant do the one thing that god gave me talent for if the only way i can perform is to break the law then thats what ill do phantom of the opera syndrome he glanced at rhymes body again how did you feel after your accident thinking youd never be a cop again rhyme was silent but the killers words hit home how had he felt the same anger that fueled erick weir yes and true after the accident the concepts of right and wrong vanished completely why not be a criminal hed thought in the madness of fury and depression i can find evidence better than any human being on the face of the earth that means i can also manipulate it i could commit the perfect crime in the end of course thanks to people like terry dobyns and other doctors and fellow cops and his own soul those thoughts had faded but yes he did know exactly what weir was talking about though even at the bleakest and angriest moments he never considered taking another life except of course his own so you sold your talents like a mercenary weir seemed to realize that hed lost control for a moment and had said too much he refused to say anything else sachss anger got the better of her and she stepped to the whiteboard and ripped down several pictures of the first two victims shoving them into weirs face she raged you killed these people just for diversion thats all they meant to you weir held her eye blasé then he looked around and laughed you really think you can keep me in prison do you know that for a challenge harry houdini was stripped naked and put in death row in washington dc he escaped from his cell so fast that he had time to open all the doors on the cellblock and switch the condemned prisoners to each others cells before the challenge panel got back from lunch sellitto said yeah well that was a long time ago were a little more sophisticated than that now to rhyme and sachs he said ill take him downtown see if he wants to share a little more with us but as they started for the doorway rhyme said hold on his eyes were on the evidence chart what sellitto asked when he got away from larry burke after the crafts fair he slipped the cuffs right we found saliva remember take a look in his mouth see if hes got a pick or key hidden there weir said i dont really sellitto pulled on the latex gloves that mel cooper offered open up you bite me and ill vanish your balls got it one bite no balls understood the conjurer opened his mouth and sellitto shined his flashlight into it fished around a bit nothing rhyme said theres another place we ought to check too sellitto grunted ill make sure they do that downtown linc some things i do not do for the money they pay me as the detective led weir toward the door kara said wait check his teeth wiggle them especially the molars weir stiffened as sellitto approached you cant do that open up the big detective snapped oh and the balls comment still applies the conjurer sighed right top molar right on my side i mean sellitto glanced at rhyme then reached in and gently pulled his hand emerged with a fake tooth inside was a small piece of bent metal he dumped it on an examining board and replaced the tooth the detective said its pretty small he can actually use that kara examined it oh he could open a pair of regulation handcuffs in about four seconds with that youre too much weir come on rhyme thought of something oh lon the detective glanced his way you have a feeling when he helped us find the pick in his tooth that mightve been a little misdirection kara nodded youre right weir looked disgusted as sellitto searched again this time the detective checked every tooth he found a second lock pick in a similar fake tooth on the lower left jaw im gonna make sure they put you someplace real special the detective said ominously he then called another officer into the room and had him shackle weirs feet with two sets of cuffs i cant walk this way weir complained in a wheeze baby steps sellitto said coldly take baby steps chapter thirtythree the man got the message at a diner on route which because he didnt have a phone in his trailer didnt want one didnt trust em is where he took and made all his calls sometimes a few days went by before he picked up the messages but because he was expecting an important call today hed hurried to the extent he ever hurried to elmas diner right after bible school hobbs wentworth was a bearsized man with a thin red beard around his face and a fringe of curly hair lighter than his beard the word career was one that nobody in canton falls new york had ever associated with hobbs which wasnt to say that he didnt work like an ox hed give a man his moneys worth as long as the job was out of doors didnt require too much calculating and his employer was a white christian hobbs was married to a quiet dusty woman named cindy who spent most of her time homeschooling cooking sewing and visiting with women friends who did the same hobbs himself spent most of his time working and hunting and spending evenings with men friends drinking and arguing though most of these arguments should be called agreements since he and his buddies were all extremely likeminded a lifelong resident of canton falls he liked it here there was plenty of good hunting land virtually none of it posted people were solid and goodnatured and knew their heads from their rumps likeminded applied to almost everyone in canton falls hobbs had lots of opportunities to do the things he enjoyed like teaching sunday school of all things an eighthgrade graduate with a stolen mortarboard but no learning to show for it hobbs had never in the lords universe thought anybodyd want him to teach but he had a flair for kids sunday school it turned out he didnt do prayer sessions or counseling or any jesuslovesmethisiknow singing nope all he did was tell bible stories to the youngsters but he was an instant hit thanks largely to his refusal to stick to the party line for instance in his account instead of jesus feeding the crowds with two fish and five loaves hobbs reported how the son of god went bow hunting and killed a deer from a hundred yards away and gutted and dressed it in the town square himself and he fed the people that way to illustrate the story hobbs brought his compound clearwater mx flex to the classroom and chunk sent a temperedtip arrow three inches into a cinderblock wall to the delight of the kids having finished one of those classes now he walked inside elmas the waitress walked up to him hey hobbs pie naw make it a vernors and a cheese omelette extra kraft hey di get a phone before he could finish she handed him a slip of paper on it were the words call me jb she asked that jeddy sounded like him since the policeve been round those troopers i mean i aint see him tall he ignored her question and said only hold that order for a minute as he went to the pay phone fishing hard for coins in his jeans his mind went right back to a lunch hed had two weeks ago at the riverside inn over in bedford junction itd been him and frank stemple and jeddy barnes from canton falls and a man named erick weir who barnes later took to calling magic man because he was of all things a professional conjurer barnes had puffed up hobbss day ten times by smiling and standing up when hobbs arrived saying to weir here sir meet the best shot we got in the county not to mention bow hunter and a damn sharp operator too hobbs had sat over the fancy food at the fancy restaurant proud but nervous too hed never before even dreamed about eating at the riverside poking his fork into the daily special and listening as barnes and stemple told him how theyd met weir he was sort of like a mercenary soldier which hobbs knew all about being a subscriber to soldier of fortune hobbs noticed the scars on the mans neck and the deformed fingers wondering what kind of fight hed been in thatd cause that kind of damage napalm maybe barnes had been reluctant to even meet with weir at first of course thinking entrapment but magic man had put him right at ease by telling them to watch the news on one particular day the lead story was about the murder of a mexican gardener an illegal immigrant working for a rich family in a town nearby weir brought barnes the dead mans wallet a trophy like a bucks antlers weir had been right upfront hed told them that hed picked the mexican because of barness views on immigrants but he personally didnt believe in their extreme causes his interest was only in making money with his very special talents which suited everybody just fine over lunch magic man weir had laid out his plan about charles grady then he shook their hands and left a few days ago barnes and stemple had shipped off the skippy girllovin reverend swensen to new york with instructions to kill grady on saturday night and hed bobbled the job as predicted hobbs was supposed to stay on call mr weir had said in case he was needed and apparently now he was he punched in the number of the cell phone barnes used the account in someone elses name and heard an abrupt yeah sme because of the state police all over the county looking for barnes theyd agreed to keep all conversations over the phone to a minimum barnes said you gotta do what we talked about at lunch uhhuh go to the lake right go to the lake and take the fishing gear with me hobbs said thats right yessir when now right away then i will barnes hung up abruptly and hobbs changed his omelette to a coffee and a baconandegg sandwich extra kraft to go when jeddy barnes said now right away now and right away was how you did whatever you were supposed to do when the food was ready he pushed outside fired up his pickup and drove fast onto the highway he had one stop to make his trailer then hed pick up the old junker dodge registered to somebody who didnt exist and speed down to the lake which didnt mean any kind of lake at all it meant a particular place in new york city just like the fishing gear he was supposed to take with him sure didnt mean a rod and reel either back in the tombs on one side of the floorbolted table sat a grimfaced joe roth andrew constables pudgy lawyer charles grady was on the other side flanked by his second roland bell amelia sachs stood the pungent interview room with its jaundiced milky windows gave her a renewed sense of claustrophobia which had been receding only slowly after the terrible panic at the cirque fantastique she fidgeted and rocked her weight back and forth the door opened and constables guard led the prisoner into the room recuffed his hands in front of him then he swung the door closed and returned to the corridor it didnt work was the first thing grady said to him a calm voice oddly dispassionate sachs thought considering that his family had nearly been wiped out what didnt constable began is this about that fool ralph swensen no this is about erick weir grady said who a frown that seemed genuine crossed the mans face the prosecutor went on to explain about the attempt on his familys life by the former illusionist turned professional killer no no no i didnt have anything to do with swensen and i didnt have anything to do with this the man looked helplessly at the scarred tabletop there was some graffiti scraped in the gray paint beside his hands it seemed to be an a then a c then a partial k ive told you all along charles therere some people ive known in the past whove gone way overboard with things they see you and the state as the enemies working with the jewish people and the african americans or whoever and theyre twisting my words around and using me as an excuse to come after you he said in a low voice ill say it again i promise you that i had nothing to do with this roth said to the prosecutor lets not play games here charles youre just fishing if youve got something to connect my client to the breakin of your apartment then weir killed two individuals yesterday and a police officer that makes it capital murder constable winced his lawyer added bluntly well im sorry about that but i notice you havent charged my client because you dont have any evidence linking him to weir right grady ignored this and continued were negotiating with weir right now about turning states evidence constable turned his eyes to sachs looked her up and down he seemed helpless and the gaze suggested that he was imploring her to help in some way perhaps she was supposed to provide the voice of female reason but she remained silent as did bell it wasnt their job to argue with suspects the detective was here to keep an eye on grady and see if he could learn more about the attempt on the d as life and possible future attacks sachs was here to see if she might learn more about constable and his partners to help solidify the case against weir also shed been curious about this man someone shed been told was pure evil and yet who seemed to all appearances reasonable understanding and genuinely troubled by the events of the past few days rhyme was content solely to look at the evidence he had no patience for an examination of a perps mind or soul sachs though was fascinated with questions of good and evil was she looking at an innocent man now or another adolf hitler constable shook his head look it makes no sense for me to try and kill you the stated send in a replacement d a the triald go on only id have a murder charge slapped on me whyd i want to do that what possible reason would i have to kill you because youre a bigot and a killer and constable interrupted heatedly listen here ive put up with a lot sir i was arrested humiliated in front of my family ive been abused here and in the press and you know what my only crime is he leveled his gaze to grady asking hard questions andrew roth touched his arm but with a loud jangle the prisoner pulled it away he was indignant and wouldnt be stopped right here in this room right now im going to commit the only crimes ive ever been guilty of first offense im asking if you dont agree that when government gets to be too big it loses touch with the people thats when cops end up with the power to stick a mop handle up the rectum of a black prisoner in custody an innocent prisoner by the way they were caught grady countered lethargically them going to jails not going to give that poor man back his dignity now is it and how many dont get caught look at whats happened in washington they let terrorists walk right into our country intent to kill us and we dont dare offend em by keeping em out or forcing em to be fingerprinted and carry id cards how about another offense let me ask you why dont we all just admit that therere differences between races and cultures ive never said one race is better or worse than any other but i do say you get grief if you go and try to mix them we got rid of segregation some years ago bell drawled it is a crime you know used to be a crime to sell liquor detective used to be a crime to work on sunday used to be legal for tenyearolds to work in factories then people wised up and changed those laws because they didnt reflect human nature he leaned forward and looked from bell to sachs my two police officer friends here let me ask you a hard question you get a report that a man mightve committed a murder and hes black or hispanic you see him in an alley well wont your finger be a little tighter on the trigger of your gun than if hes white or if he is a white man and looks like a smart man if he has all his teeth and wears clothes that dont smell like yesterdays piss well then are you going to be just a little slower to pull that trigger are you going to frisk him a little more gently the prisoner sat back shook his head thosere my crimes thats it asking questions like those grady said cynically great material andrew but before you play the persecution card whatta you do with the fact that erick weir had lunch with three other people at the riverside inn in bedford junction two weeks ago which is two clicks from the patriot assembly meeting hall in canton falls and about five from your house constable blinked the riverside inn he looked out the window which was so grimy it was impossible to tell if the sky was blue or polluted yellow or drizzly gray gradys eyes narrowed what you know something about that place i his lawyer touched his arm to silence him they whispered to each other for a moment grady couldnt resist pushing do you know somebody whos a regular there constable glanced at roth who shook his head and the prisoner remained silent after a moment grady asked hows your cell andrew my your cell here in detention dont much care for it as i suspect you know its worse in prison and youll have to go into solitary because the black crew in general pop would love to get come on charles roth said wearily we dont need any of that the prosecutor said well joe im about at the end of the line here all ive been hearing is i didnt do this i didnt do that that somebodys setting him up and using him well if thats the case he now turned directly to constable get off your ass and prove it to me show me you didnt have anything to do with trying to kill me and my family and you get me the name of the people who did then well talk another whispered consultation between client and attorney roth finally said my clients going to make some phone calls based on what we find he might be willing to consider cooperating thats not good enough give me some names now troubled constable said directly to grady thats the way its got to be i need to be certain about this afraid youll have to turn in some friends the prosecutor asked coolly well you say you like to ask hard questions let me ask you one what kind of friends are they if theyre willing to send you to prison for the rest of your life grady stood up if i dont hear from you by nine tonight we go to trial tomorrow as planned chapter thirtyfour it wasnt much of a stage when david balzac had retired from the illusionist circuit ten years ago and had bought smoke mirrors hed torn out the back half of the store to put in the small theater balzac didnt have a cabaret license so he couldnt charge admission but hed still hold shows here every sunday afternoon and thursday night so that his students could get up onstage and experience what performing was really like and what a difference it was kara knew that practicing at home and performing onstage were night and day something inexplicable happened when you got up in front of people impossible tricks that you continually flubbed at home went perfectly owing to some mysterious spiritual adrenaline that took over your hands and proclaimed thou shalt not fuck this one up conversely in a performance you might blow a trick that was second nature like a onecoin french drop a maneuver so simple that youd never even think to have an out prepared in case it went south a high wide black curtain separated the theater from the business end of the store it rippled occasionally in the breeze as the front door opened and closed with a faint roadrunner meepmeep from the electriceye alert on the jamb now approaching p m on sunday people were entering the theater and finding seats always beginning at the back in magic and illusion performances nobody wants to sit in the front row you never knew when you might get volunteered to be embarrassed up onstage standing behind a backdrop curtain kara looked at the stage the flat black walls were scuffed and streaked and the bowed oak floor was covered with dozens of bits of masking tape from performers blocking out their moves during rehearsal for a backdrop only a ratty burgundy shawl and the entire platform was tiny ten by twelve feet still to kara it was carnegie hall or the mgm grand itself and she was prepared to give her audience everything she had like vaudevillians or parlor magicians most illusionists simply string together a series of routines the performers might pace the tricks carefully building up to a thrilling finale but that approach kara felt was like watching fireworks each burst more or less spectacular but on the whole emotionally unsatisfying because there was no theme or continuity to the explosions an illusionists act should tell a story all the tricks linked together one leading to the next with one or more of the earlier tricks returning at the end to give the audience that delightful onetwo punch that left them she hoped breathless more people were entering the theater now she wondered if thered be many here today though it didnt really make any difference to her she loved the story about roberthoudin who walked out onstage one night to find three people in the theater he presented the same show as if the house were full except the finale was slightly different he invited the audience to his home for dinner afterward she was confident of her routine mr balzac had her practice even for these small shows for weeks and now during the last few minutes before curtain time she didnt think about her tricks but gazed at the audience enjoying this momentary peace of mind she supposed she had no right to feel this comfortable there were a lot of reasons why she shouldnt be so content her mothers worsening condition the growing money problems her slow progress in mr balzacs eyes the brunchinbed guy whod left three weeks ago today promising hed call her definitely i promise but the vanished boyfriend trick like evaporating money and the wasting mother couldnt touch her here not when she was onstage nothing mattered to her except the challenge of materializing a certain look in the faces of the audience kara could see it so clearly the mouth faintly smiling the eyes opening wide with surprise the eyebrows narrowing asking the most compelling question in every illusionist show how do they do that in closein magic there are sleightofhand gestures known as takes and puts you create the effect of transforming an object from one thing to another by subtly taking away the original and putting a second in its place though the effect the audience sees is of one object becoming something else and thats exactly what karas philosophy of performing was taking her audiences sadness or boredom or anger and putting in its place happiness fascination serenity transforming them into people with exhilaration in their hearts however momentary that might be just about starting time she peeked out through the curtain again most of the chairs were filled she was surprised to see on nice days like this the attendance was usually quite small she was pleased when jaynene from the nursing home arrived her huge figure blocking the back doorway momentarily several other nurses from stuyvesant manor were with her they walked farther inside and found seats a few of karas other friends too from the magazine and her apartment building on greenwich street then just after the back curtain opened wide and one final member of the audience entered someone she never in a million years would have expected to come see her show its accessible lincoln rhyme commented wryly driving his glossy storm arrow to a spot halfway down the aisle in smoke mirrors and parking no ada suits today an hour ago hed surprised sachs and thom by suggesting they drive down to the store in his van the rampequipped rollx to see karas performance then hed added though its a shame to waste a beautiful spring afternoon indoors when theyd stared at him even before the accident hed rarely spent a beautiful spring afternoon outside hed said im kidding could you get the van please thom a please no less the aide had said as he looked around the shabby theater he noticed a heavyset black woman glance at him she rose slowly and joined them sitting next to sachs shaking her hand and nodding to rhyme she asked him if they were the police officers karad told her about he said yes and introductions were made her name turned out to be jaynene and she was a nurse working at the aging care facility where karas mother lived the woman glanced knowingly at rhyme whod cast her a wry look at this description and said whoops di really say that meant to say old folks home im a graduate of a timc the criminalist said the woman furrowed her brow and finally shook her head thats a new one on me thom said traumatic incident mitigation center rhyme said i called it the gimp inn but hes deliberately provocative thom added ive worked spinal units we always liked the patients best who gave us crap the quiet cheerful ones scared us because rhyme reflected they were the ones who had friends slip a hundred seconal into their drinks or who if they had the use of a hand poured water onto the pilot lights of their stoves and turned the gas up high a fourburner death it was called jaynene asked rhyme you c thats it off the ventilator good for you is karas mother here sachs asked looking around jaynene frowned briefly and said well no does she ever come to see her the woman said cautiously her mothers not really involved with karas career rhyme said kara told me shes sick is she doing better a bit yes the woman said there was a story behind this rhyme sensed but the womans tone said that it wasnt for the nurse to go into confidential matters with strangers then the lights dimmed and the crowd fell silent a whitehaired man climbed up onstage despite the age and the signs of hard living a drinkers nose and tobaccostained beard his eyes were keen his posture erect and he floated to center stage with a performers presence he stood next to the only prop on the platform a wooden cutout of a roman column the surroundings were shabby but the man wore a welltailored suit as if he had some rule that whenever you were up onstage you looked the best for your audience ah rhyme deduced the infamous mentor david balzac he didnt identify himself but looked out over the audience for a moment his eyes settling on rhymes for longer than most others whatever he was thinking though remained hidden and he looked away today ladies and gentlemen im pleased to present one of my most promising students kara has been studying with me for over a year now shes going to treat you to some of the more esoteric illusions in the history of our profession and some of my own as well as some of hers dont be surprised a demonic look that seemed directed at rhyme himself or shocked at anything you see today and now ladies and gentlemen i give you kara rhyme had decided to pass this hour by being a scientist hed enjoy the challenge of spotting the methods of her illusions noting how she did the tricks how cards and coins were palmed and where her quickchange costumes were concealed kara was still several points ahead in this game of catch the moves which she undoubtedly didnt know they were playing the young woman walked out onstage wearing a tight black bodysuit with a cutout in the shape of a crescent moon on her chest under a shimmery seethrough drape like a translucent roman toga hed never thought of kara as attractive much less sexy but the clinging outfit was very sensuous she moved like a dancer swift and smooth there was a long pause while she examined the audience slowly it seemed that she looked at each person the tension began to build finally change she said in a theatrical voice change how it fascinates us alchemy changing lead and tin into gold she held up a silver coin closed it in her palm and opened it an instant later to reveal a gold coin which she flung into the air it turned into a shower of gold confetti applause from the audience and murmurs of pleasure night the houselights suddenly dimmed to blackness and a moment later no more than a few seconds came back up becoming day kara was now dressed in a similar clinging outfit except that it was golden and the cutout pattern on the front was a starburst rhyme had to laugh at the speed of the quick change life a red rose appeared in her hand becoming death she cupped the rose in her hands and it changed to a dried yellowish flower becoming life a bouquet of fresh flowers had somehow replaced the dead stalk she tossed them to a delighted woman in the audience rhyme heard a surprised whisper theyre real kara lowered her hands to her sides and looked out over the audience again with a serious expression on her face theres a book she said her voice filling the room a book written thousands of years ago by the roman writer ovid the book is called metamorphoses like metamorphosis when a caterpillar becomes a she opened her hand and a butterfly flew out and disappeared backstage rhyme had taken four years of latin he recalled struggling to translate portions of ovids book for class he remembered that it was a series of fourteen or fifteen short myths in poetic form what was kara up to lecturing about classical literature to an audience of lawyer moms and kids thinking about their xboxes and nintendos though he noticed that her tight costume held the attention of every teenage boy in the audience she continued metamorphoses its a book about change about people becoming other people animals trees inanimate objects some of ovids stories are tragic some enthralling but all of them have one thing in common a pause and then she said in a loud voice magic with a burst of light and a cloud of smoke she vanished for the next forty minutes kara captivated the audience with a series of illusions and sleightofhand tricks based on a few of the poems in the book as for catching her moves rhyme gave up on that completely true he was lost in the drama of her stories but even when he pulled himself back from her spell and concentrated on her hands he couldnt spot her method once after a long ovation and an encore during which she quickchanged into a tiny elderly woman and back again young to old old to young she left the stage five minutes later kara emerged in jeans and a white blouse and stepped into the audience to say hello to friends a shop clerk laid out a table of jug wine coffee and soda cookies no scotch rhyme asked looking over the cheap spread sorry sir the bearded young man replied sachs armed with wine nodded at kara who joined them hey this is great i never thought id see you guys here what can i say sachs offered fantastic excellent rhyme said to her then turned back to the bar maybe theres some whisky in the back thom thom nodded at rhyme and said to kara can you transform dispositions he took two glasses of chardonnay slipped a straw in one and held it out for his boss this or nothing lincoln he took a sip then said i liked the youngold ending didnt expect it i was worried you were going to become a butterfly at the end cliché you know you were supposed to be worried with me expect the unexpected sleight of mind remember kara sachs said you have to try out for the cirque fantastique the woman laughed but said nothing no im serious this was professional quality sachs insisted rhyme could tell that kara didnt want to pursue the issue she said lightly im right on schedule theres no hurry a lot of people make the mistake of jumping too fast lets get some food thom suggested im starving jaynene you come too the large woman said shed love to and suggested a new place near the jefferson market at sixth and tenth kara demurred though saying that she had to stay and work on some of the routines shed slipped up on during the performance girl no way the nurse said frowning you gotta work itll only be a couple of hours that friend of mr balzacs doing some private show tonight and hes going to close up the store early to go watch it kara hugged sachs and said goodbye they exchanged phone numbers each promising theyd be in touch rhyme thanked her again for her help in the weir case we couldntve caught him without you well come see you in las vegas thom called rhyme started to pilot the storm arrow toward the front of the store as he did he glanced to his left and saw balzacs still eyes watching him from the back room the illusionist then turned to kara as she joined him immediately in his presence she was a very different woman timid and selfconscious metamorphosis rhyme thought and he watched balzac slowly push the door closed shutting out the rest of the world from the sorcerer and his apprentice chapter thirtyfive im gonna say it again you can have a lawyer you want one i understand that erick weir muttered in his breathy whisper they were in lon sellittos office at one police plaza it was a small room mostly gray decorated with as the detective himself mightve put it in a report one infant picture one male child picture one adult female picture one scenic lake picture of indeterminate locale one plant dead sellitto had interviewed hundreds of suspects in this office the only difference between them and the present suspect was that weir was doubleshackled to the gray chair across the desk and an armed patrol officer stood behind him you understand i said i did weir announced and so the interview began unlike rhyme who specialized in forensics detective firstgrade lon sellitto was a fullservice cop he was a detective in the real sense of the word he detected the truth using all the resources that the nypd and fellow agencies had to offer as well as his own street smarts and tenacity it was the best job in the world he often said the work called on you to be an actor a politician a chess player and sometimes a gunslinger and tackle and one of the best parts was the game of interrogation getting suspects to confess or reveal the names of associates and the location of loot or victims bodies but it was clear from the beginning that this prick wasnt giving up a dustball of information now erick what do you know about the patriot assembly like i said only what i read about them weir replied scratching his chin on his shoulder as best he could you want to undo these cuffs just for a minute no i dont you only read about the assembly thats right weir coughed for a moment where time magazine i think and youre educated you speak good i wouldnt guess you go along with their philosophy of course not he wheezed they seem like rabid bigots to me so if you dont believe in their politics then the only reason to kill charles grady for them is for money which you admitted at rhymes so id like to know exactly who hired you oh i wasnt going to kill him the prisoner whispered you misunderstood me whats to misunderstand you broke into his apartment with a loaded weapon look i like challenges seeing if i can break into places nobody else can id never hurt anybody this was delivered half to sellitto and half to a battered video camera aimed at his face say how was the meatloaf or did you have the roast turkey the what in bedford junction at the riverside inn id say you had the turkey and constables boys had the meatloaf and the steak and the daily special which one did jeddy have who oh that man you asked me about barnes youre talking about that receipt right weir said wheezing the truth is i just found that i needed to write something down and i grabbed a scrap of paper the truth sellitto reflected right you just needed to write something down struggling for breath weir nodded where were you persisted an increasingly bored lon sellitto when you needed this paper i dont know a starbucks which one weir squinted dont remember criminals had started to cite starbucks a lot lately when offering up alibis sellitto decided it was because there were so many of the coffee outlets and they all looked alike criminals could credibly sound confused about which one theyd been in at a particular time why was it blank sellitto continued what was blank the back of the receipt if youd taken it to write something down why didnt you write on it oh i dont think i could find a pen they have pens at starbucks people charge things a lot there they need pens to sign their credit card vouchers the clerk was busy i didnt want to bother her what was it you wanted to write down uhm came the breathy wheeze movie show time wheres larry burkes body who the police officer who arrested you on eightyeighth street you told lincoln rhyme last night that you killed him and the body was on the west side somewhere i was just trying to make him think i was going to attack the circus lead him off feeding him false information and when you admitted killing the other victims that was false information too exactly i didnt kill anybody somebody else did and tried to pin it on me ah the oldest defense in the book the lamest the most embarrassing though one that of course did sometimes work sellitto knew depending on the gullibility of the jury who wanted to frame you i dont know but somebody who knows me obviously because theyd have access to your clothes and fibers and hairs and things to plant at the scenes exactly good then itd be a short list give me some names weir closed his eyes nothings coming to me his head slumped its really frustrating sellitto couldntve put it better himself a tedious half hour of this game passed finally the detective just gave up he was angry thinking that hed be going home soon to his girlfriend and the dinner she was making turkey ironically just like whatd been on the lunch menu at the riverside inn in bedford junction but that officer larry burke would never be returning to his wife he dropped the façade of the friendly but persistent interrogator and muttered i want you out of my sight sellitto and the other officers drove the prisoner two blocks to the manhattan detention center for booking on murder attempt assault and arson charges the detective warned the doc officers about the mans skills at escaping and they assured him that weir would be placed in special detention a virtually escapeproof facility oh detective sellitto weir called in a throaty whisper the detective turned i swear to god i didnt do it he gasped his voice echoing with what sounded like genuine remorse maybe after i get some rest ill remember some things thatll help you find the real killer i really do want to help downstairs in the tombs the two officers both with a firm grip on the prisoners arms let him shuffle his way to the booking station doesnt look so scary to me department of corrections officer linda welles thought he was strong she could tell but not like some of the beasts theyd processed here those kids from alphabet city or harlem with perfect bodies that even huge quantities of crack and smack and malt liquor couldnt soften no she didnt quite know why they were making all this fuss about this skinny old guy weir erick a keep a hold on him watch his hands all the time dont take the shackles off thatd been detective sellittos warning but the suspect just looked sad and tired and was having trouble breathing she wondered what had happened to his hands and neck the scarring a fire or hot oil the thought of the pain made her shiver welles remembered what hed told detective sellitto at the intake door i really do want to help weir had seemed like a schoolchild whod disappointed his parents despite detective sellittos concerns the fingerprinting and mug shots went without incident and soon he was back in double cuffs and ankle shackles again welles and hank gersham a large male doc officer took an arm each and then started down the long corridor to intake welles had handled thousands of criminals here and thought she was immune to their pleas and their protests and tears but there was something about weirs sad promise to detective sellitto that moved her maybe he actually was innocent he hardly seemed like a murderer he winced and welles relaxed her viselike grip on his arm slightly a moment later the prisoner moaned and slumped against her his face was contorted in pain what hank asked cramp he gasped it hurts oh god he gave a whispered scream the shackles his left leg was straight out quivering hard as wood the guard asked her undo him welles hesitated then said no to weir lets go down down on your side ill work it out a runner she knew how to handle cramps it probably wasnt fake he seemed in too much genuine agony and the muscle was rockhard oh jesus weir cried in pain the shackles weve gotta get em off her partner said no welles repeated firmly get him on the floor ill take care of it they eased weir down and welles began to massage his stiff leg hank stood back and watched her at work then she happened to glance up she noticed that weirs cuffed hands still behind his back had slid to his side and that his slacks had been pulled down a few inches she looked closely she saw that a bandaid had been peeled away from his hip and beneath it what the hell was that she realized it was a slit in the skin it was then that his palm hit her square in the nose popping the cartilage a burst of pain seared her face and took her breath away a key hed had a key or pick hidden in that little crevice of skin under the bandage her partner reached out fast but weir rose even faster and elbowed him in the throat the man went down gasping and clutching his neck coughing and struggling for air weir clamped a hand on welless pistol and tried to pull it from her holster she struggled to control it with both hands using every ounce of strength she tried to scream but the blood from her broken nose flowed down her throat and she began to choke still gripping her gun the prisoner reached down with his left hand and in what seemed like seconds unshackled his legs then with both hands he began in earnest to get the glock away from her help me she cried coughing blood somebody help weir managed to pull the weapon out of her holster but welles thinking of her children kept a vise grip on his wrist the muzzle swung around the empty corridor past hank on his hands and knees retching and struggling for breath help officer down help welles cried there was motion from the end of the corridor as a door opened and someone came running but the hallway seemed to be ten miles long and weir was getting a better grip on the pistol they rolled to the floor his desperate eyes inches from hers the muzzle of the gun turning slowly toward her it ended up between them gasping he tried to get his index finger to the trigger no please no no she whimpered the prisoner smiled cruelly as she stared at the black eye of the weapon inches from her face expecting it to fire at any instant seeing her children seeing the girls father her own mother no fucking way welles thought furious she planted her foot against the wall and shoved hard weir went over backward and she fell on top of him the pistol went off with a stunning explosion the huge kick of recoil jarring her wrist the sound deafening her blood spattered the wall no no no please let hank be okay she prayed but welles saw her partner struggling to his feet he was unhurt then she realized that she wasnt fighting for the weapon it was in her hand alone weir no longer had a grip on it quivering she leaped to her feet and backed away from him oh my god the bullet had struck the prisoner directly in the side of the head leaving a horrible wound on the wall behind him was a spatter of blood brain matter and bone weir lay on his back glazed eyes staring at the ceiling blood was flowing down his temple to the floor shaking welles wailed fuck me look what i did oh fuck help him somebody as a dozen other officers converged on the scene she turned to look at the guards but then saw them freeze and drop into defensive crouches welles gasped was there some other perp behind her she spun around and saw that the corridor was empty she turned back to see the other officers were still crouching holding up their hands in alarm shouting ears deafened from the shot she couldnt understand what they were saying finally she heard jesus your weapon linda holster it watch where youre pointing it she realized in her panic that shed been waving the glock around toward the ceiling toward the floor toward them like a child with a toy gun she barked a manic laugh at her carelessness as she bolstered the pistol she felt something hard on her belt and pulled it off she examined the splinter of bloody bone from weirs skull oh she said dropped it and laughed like her daughter during a ticklefest she spit on her hand then began wiping her palm on her pants the scrubbing grew more and more frantic until the laughter suddenly stopped and she dropped to her knees consumed with wrenching sobs chapter thirtysix you shouldve seen it mum i think i wowed em kara sat on the edge of the chair cradling the tepid starbucks cup in her hands the warmth from the cardboard perfectly matching the temperature of human skin the temperature of her mothers skin for instance still pink still glowing i had the whole stage to myself for fortyfive minutes how bout that you this word was not part of an imaginary dialogue the woman was awake and had asked the question in a firm voice you though kara had no idea what her mother meant it might mean what was it you just said or who are you why are you coming into my room and sitting down here as if we know each other or i heard the word you once but i dont know what it means and im too embarrassed to ask its important i know but i cant remember you you you then her mother looked out the window at the clinging ivy and said everything turned out fine we got through it just fine kara knew it would only be frustrating to try to carry on a conversation with her when she was in this state of mind none of her sentences would be related to any other sometimes shed even forget her train of thought within a sentence and her voice would fade to a confused silence so kara herself now just rambled on talking about the metamorphoses show shed just done and then even more excitedly she told her mother about helping the police catch a killer for a moment her mothers eyebrow arched in recognition and karas heart began to pound she leaned forward i found the tin i never thought id see it again head back in the pillow karas hands clenched into knotted fists her breath came fast its me mum me the royal kid cant you see me you goddamnit kara raged silently to the demon whod possessed the poor woman and muffled her soul leave her alone give her back to me hi there a womans voice from the doorway startled kara who subtly lifted several tears off her cheek as smoothly as executing a french drop before she turned around hey she said to amelia sachs you tracked me down im a cop thats what we do she walked into the room holding two starbucks cups she glanced at the container in karas hand sorry redundant present kara thumped the carton she was holding almost out she took the second cup gratefully caffeinell never go to waste around me she started sipping thanks you guys have fun sure did that womans a scream jaynene thoms in love with her and she actually made lincoln laugh she has that effect on people kara said a way good soul amelia said balzac dragged you away pretty fast at the end of the show i just wanted to come by and thank you again and to say that you should send us a bill for your time i never thought about it you introduced me to cuban coffee thats payment enough no invoice us something send it to me and ill make sure it goes to the city playing gwoman kara said itll be a story ill tell my grandkids hey im free for the rest of the night mr balzacs off with his friend i was going to see some people down in soho you want to come sure the policewoman said we could she looked up over karas shoulder hello kara glanced behind her and saw her mother looking with curiosity at the policewoman and sized up the gaze shes not really with us right now it was during the summer the elderly woman said june im pretty sure she closed her eyes and lay back is she okay just a temporary thing shell come back soon her minds a little funny sometimes kara stroked the old womans arm then asked sachs your parents itll sound familiar ive got a feeling fathers dead my mother lives near me in brooklyn little too close for comfort but weve come to an understanding kara knew that understandings between mother and daughter were as complex as international treaties and she didnt ask amelia to elaborate not now thered be time for that in the future a piercing beep filled the room and both women reached for the pagers on their belts amelia won i shut my cell off when i got here there was a sign in the lobby that said i couldnt use it you mind she nodded toward the telephone on the table no go ahead she picked up the phone and dialed and kara rose to straighten the blankets on her mothers bed remember that bedandbreakfast we stayed at in warwick mum near the castle do you remember tell me you remember amelias voice rhyme me karas unilateral conversation was interrupted a few seconds later though when she heard the officers voice ask a sharp what when turning to the policewoman kara frowned amelia was looking at her shaking her head ill get right down there im with her now ill tell her she hung up whats the matter kara asked looks like i cant join you guys after all we mustve missed a lock pick or key weir got out of his cuffs at detention and went for somebodys gun he was killed oh my god amelia walked to the doorway ive got to run the scene down there she paused and glanced at kara you know i was worried about keeping him under guard during the trial that man was just too slippery but i guess sometimes there is justice oh that bill whatever you were going to charge double it constables got some information the mans voice came crisply through the phone hes been playing detective has he charles grady asked the lawyer wryly wryly but not sarcastically the prosecutor had nothing against joseph roth who though he represented scum was a defense lawyer who managed to step around the slime trail left by his clients and who treated d as and cops with honesty and respect grady reciprocated yeah he has made some calls up to canton falls and put the fear of god into a couple of the patriot assembly folks they checked things out looks like some of the former membersve gone rogue who is it barnes stemple we didnt go into it indepth all i know is hes pretty upset he kept saying judas judas judas over and over grady couldnt stir up much sympathy you lie down with dogs he said to the lawyer he knows im not letting him off scotfree he understands that charles you know weirs dead yep ive got to tell you andrew was happy to hear it i really believe he didnt have anything to do with trying to hurt you charles grady didnt have any use for opinions from defense counsel even forthright ones like roth he asked and hes got solid information he does yes grady believed him roth was a man you simply could not fool if he thought constable was going to dime out some of his people then it was going to happen how successful the resulting case would be was a different matter of course but if constable gave relatively hard information and if the troopers did a halfway decent job with their investigation and arrest he was confident he could put the perps away grady would also make sure that lincoln rhyme oversaw the forensics grady had mixed feelings about weirs death while hed publicly express his concern at the mans shooting and promise to look into it officially he was privately delighted that the fuckerd been disposed of he was still shocked and infuriated that a killer had walked right into the apartment where his wife and daughter lived willing to murder them too grady looked at the glass of wine he so dearly wanted a sip of but realized that a consequence of this phone call was that it precluded alcohol for the time being the constable case was so important that he needed all his wits about him he wants to meet you facetoface roth said the wine was a grgich hills cabernet sauvignon a no less great vineyard great year roth continued how soon can you get down to detention a half hour ill leave now grady hung up and announced to his wife the good news is no trial luis the stilleyed bodyguard said ill go with you after weirs death lon sellitto had cut back the protection team to one officer no you stay here with my family luis id feel better his wife asked cautiously if thats the good news honey whats the bad news i have to miss dinner the prosecutor said tossing a handful of goldfish crackers into his mouth and washing them down with a very large sip of very nice wine thinking hell with it lets celebrate sachss wartorn yellow camaro ss pulled to a stop outside center street she tossed the nypd placard onto the dash then climbed out she nodded to a crimescene crew standing beside their rrv wheres the scene first floor in the back the corridor to intake sealed yep whose weapon linda welles doc shes pretty shook up asshole broke her nose sachs grabbed one of the suitcases and hooking it up to a wheelie luggage carrier started for the front door of the criminal courts building the other cs techs did the same and followed this scened be a grounder of course an accidental shooting involving an officer and a suspect whod tried to escape pro forma still the event was a homicide and required a complete crime scene report for the shooting incident board and any subsequent investigation and lawsuits amelia sachs would run the scene as carefully as any other a guard checked their ids and led the team through a maze of corridors into the basement finally they came to a yellow policeline tape across a closed door here she found a detective talking to a uniformed officer her nose stuffed with tissue and bandaged sachs introduced herself and explained that she was going to be running the scene the detective stepped aside and sachs asked linda welles what had happened in a halting nasal voice the guard explained that on the way from fingerprinting to intake the suspect had somehow undone his handcuffs it took him two three seconds all the cuffs just like that they were open he didnt get my key she pointed to her blouse pocket where presumably it resided he had a pick or key or something on his hip his pocket sachs asked frowning she remembered theyd searched him carefully no his leg youll see she nodded toward the corridor where weirs body lay theres a cut in his skin under a bandage everything happened so fast sachs supposed that hed cut himself to create a hiding space a queasy thought then he grabbed my weapon and we were struggling for it it just discharged i didnt mean to pull the trigger i didnt really but i tried to keep control and i couldnt it just discharged control discharge the words official copspeak were perhaps an attempt to insulate her from the guilt shed be feeling this had nothing to do with the fact that a killer was dead or that her life had been endangered or that a dozen other officers had been taken in by this man no it was that this woman had stumbled women in the nypd set the bar high the falls are always harder than for men we collared and searched him at the takedown sachs said kindly and we missed the key too yeah the officer muttered but its still gonna come up at the shooting inquiry she meant and yeah it would well sachsd do a particularly thorough job on her report to give this officer as much support as possible welles touched her nose gently oh that hurts tears were streaming from her eyes whatre my kids going to say they always ask me if i do anything dangerous and i tell em no look at this pulling on latex gloves sachs asked for the womans glock she took it dropped the clip and ejected the round in the chamber everything went into a plastic evidence bag slipping into her sergeant mode sachs said you can take an loa you know welles didnt even hear her it just discharged the woman said in a hollow voice i didnt want it to i didnt want to kill anybody linda sachs said you can take an loa a week ten days i can talk to your supervisor sure yeah i could do that welles rose and wandered over to the medic treating her partner who had a nasty bruise on his neck but who otherwise seemed all right the cs team set up shop outside the door to the corridor where the shooting had occurred opening the suitcases and arranging evidence collection equipment friction ridge supplies and video and still cameras sachs dressed in the white tyvek suit and accessorized with rubber bands around her feet she fitted the microphone over her head and asked for a radio patch to lincoln rhymes phone ripping down the police tape she opened the door thinking a slit in the skin to hide lock picks and cuff keys of all the perps she and lincoln had been up against the conjurer was oh goddamn she spat out hello to you too sachs rhyme said acerbically through her headset at least i think its you hell of a lot of static i dont believe it rhyme the m e took the body before i could process it sachs was looking into the corridor bloody but empty what he snapped who approved that the rule in crime scene work was that emergency medical personnel could enter a scene to save an injured person but in the case of homicide the body had to remain untouched by everyone including the tour doctor from the medical examiners office until itd been processed by someone from forensics this was fundamental police work and the career of whoeverd released the conjurers corpse was now in jeopardy there a problem amelia one of the techs called from the doorway look she said angrily nodding into the corridor the m e got the body before we processed it what happened the crewcut young tech frowned he glanced at his partner then said uhm well the tour docs outside he was the guy we were talking to when you showed up the one feeding the pigeons he was waiting to move the body till we were finished whats going on rhyme growled i hear voices sachs to him she said theres a crew from the m es office outside rhyme sounds like they havent picked up the body whats oh jesus christ no the chill went straight to her soul rhyme you dont think he barked out what do you see sachs whats the blood spatter look like she ran to where the shooting had happened and studied the bloodstain on the wall oh no it doesnt look normal for a gunshot rhyme brain matter bone gray matter yeah but it doesnt look right either there is some bone not much though for a closerange shot do a presumptive blood test thatll be dispositive she sped back to the doorway whats going one of the techs asked but he fell silent as he watched her dig frantically through the suitcases sachs grabbed the kastlemeyer catalytic blood kit then returned to the corridor and took a swab from the wall she treated this with phenolphthalein and a moment later she had the answer i dont know what it is but its definitely not blood she glanced down at the ruddy smears on the floor this however looked real she tested a sample and it showed positive then she noticed a bloody razor knife blade in the corner christ rhyme he faked the shooting cut himself somewhere to bleed for real and fool the guards call security sachs yelled its an escape have the exits sealed the detective jogged into the hallway and stared at the floor linda welles joined him her eyes wide the momentary relief that she hadnt in fact been involved in a mans death faded fast as she realized the farworse implications of what had happened no he was there his eyes were open he looked dead her voice was high frantic i mean his head it was all bloody i could see i could see the wound you could see the illusion of a wound sachs thought bitterly the detective called out theyve notified the guards at all the exits but christ this isnt a lockdown corridor as soon as we closed the doors here he couldve stood up and wandered anywhere hes probably stealing a car right now or on the subway to queens amelia sachs began giving orders whatever the detectives rank he was so shaken by the escape that he didnt question her authority get an escape bulletin out now she said all agencies in the metro area federal and state dont forget mta the name is erick weir white male early fifties youve got the mug shot whats he wearing the detective asked welles and her partner who both struggled to remember they gave a rough description sachs was thinking though that it hardly mattered hed be in different clothing now she gazed down the four tentacles of dim corridors she could see from here and observed silhouettes of dozens of people guards janitors cops or maybe the conjurer disguised as one of them but for the moment she left the issue of pursuit in others hands and turned back to her own area of expertise the crime scene whose search was supposed to be a brief formality but had now become a matter of life and death chapter thirtyseven making his way cautiously through the basement of the manhattan detention center malerick was reflecting on his escape offering silent patter to his revered audience let me share with you a trick of the illusionists trade to truly fool people its not enough to misdirect them during the illusion this is because when confronted with a phenomenon that defies logic the human brain continues to replay the scene afterward to try to understand what happened we illusionists call this reconstruction and unless we set up our trick cleverly enough an intelligent suspicious audience will be fooled only briefly and will figure out our method after the routine is over so how do we trick audiences like this we use the most implausible method we can either one absurdly simple or overwhelmingly complex an example one famous illusionist appears to push an entire peacock feather through a handkerchief audiences rarely can figure out what kind of sleight of hand he uses to make it seem that the feather actually penetrates the cloth whats the method it does penetrate the cloth theres a hole in the handkerchief the audience considers this method at first but then invariably decides that its too simple for such a great performer theyd rather think hes doing something far more elaborate another an illusionist met some friends for dinner at a restaurant and was asked to show them a few tricks he declined at first but finally agreed he took a spare tablecloth held it up in front of a table of two lovers dining nearby and vanished the couple and their table in one second the friends were astonished how could he have done it they never guessed that supposing that hed probably be invited to perform the illusionist had arranged with the maitre d to have a prepared collapsible table on hand and hired an actor and actress to play the couple when hed held up the cloth theyd disappeared on cue in reconstructing what theyd seen the diners rejected the actual answer as too improbable for such an apparently impromptu performance and this is what occurred with the illusion you just witnessed one i call the shot prisoner reconstruction many illusionists forget about this psychological process but malerick never did and hed considered it carefully when planning his escape in the detention center the officers escorting him down the corridor to the lockup believed they saw a prisoner slip his cuffs grab a gun and end up shot dead right in front of them there was shock there was dismay there was horror but even at such peak moments the mind does what it must and before the smoke dissipated the officers were analyzing the events and considering options and courses of action like any audience they engaged in reconstruction and knowing that erick weir was a skilled illusionist undoubtedly wondered if the shooting had been faked but their ears had heard a real gun fire a real bullet their eyes had seen a head explode under the impact and a moment later a limp body in the pose of death and blood brain bone and glazed eyes the reconstruction resulted in a conclusion that it was far too implausible for a man to go to such elaborate lengths to fake the shooting so confident he was dead theyd left him alone unshackled in the corridor while they went off to make their frantic radio or phone calls and my method revered audience as theyd walked down the corridor malerick had peeled off the bandage on his hip and removed a universal handcuff key from a tiny slit in his skin once out of the cuffs he hit the woman guard in the face the other in the throat and pulled her gun from her holster a struggle and finally hed aimed the gun behind his head and pulled the trigger at the same time he tapped the firing circuit of the tiny squib taped to a shaved portion of his scalp under his long hair blowing up a small bladder of fake blood bits of gray rubber and fragments of beef bone to add to the credibility of the act hed used a razor knife blade hidden in his hip with the key to cut his scalp an area of the body that bleeds profusely but with little pain then hed lain like a discarded rag doll breathing as shallowly as he could his eyes remained open because hed filled them with viscous eyedrops that produced a milky appearance and allowed him not to blink fuck me look what i did oh fuck help him somebody ah but officer welles it was too late to help me i was dead as a roadside deer he headed now through winding corridors in the interconnected basements of the government buildings here until he came to the supply closet where hed stashed his new disguise several days ago inside the small room he stripped and then hid the wound appliance his old clothes and shoes behind some boxes donning his new outfit and applying some makeup he was in role in less than ten seconds a glance out the door the corridor was empty he stepped outside and hurried for the stairway it was nearly time for the finale it was an out kara said the young woman had been whisked back to rhymes townhouse from stuyvesant manor a few moments ago an out the criminalist asked whats that it means an alternative plan all good illusionists have one or two backups for every routine if you screw up or the audience catches your moves you have an escape plan to save the trick he mustve figured there was a chance hed get caught so he rigged an out to let him get away howd he do it explosive squib behind a blood bladder hidden in his hair the shot it mightve been a fake gun she suggested most catchthebullet tricks use fekes phony guns they have a second barrel or theyre real guns loaded with blanks he mightve switched guns with the officer taking him to his cell i doubt it rhyme said looking at sellitto the rumpled cop agreed yeah i dont see how he couldve switched a service piece or unloaded it and reloaded it with funny slugs kara said well he couldve just pretended to shoot himself played with the angle of sight what about the eyes rhyme asked the wits said his eyes were open he never blinked and they looked glazed therere dozens of deadman fekes and gimmicks he mightve used eyedrops that lubricate the surface you can keep them open for ten or fifteen minutes and therere selflubricating contact lenses too they have a glazed look like youre a zombie zombies and fake blood christ what a mess howd he get through the goddamn metal detector they werent in the lockdown area yet sellitto explained thats what they were on their way to rhyme sighed then he snapped where the hells the evidence looking from the door to mel cooper as if the slim technician could make the delivery from the detention center materialize on command it turned out that there were two crime scenes downtown one was the corridor where the phony shooting had occurred the other scene was in the basement of the courthouse a janitors closet one of the search teams had found the fake wound appliance clothes and some other things hidden in a bag there thom answered the ringing door chime and a moment later roland bell hurried into the laboratory cant believe it he said breathlessly his hair a sweaty mop on his forehead its confirmed hes rabbited sure has rhyme muttered darkly esus scouring the place amelias down there too but they havent found any leads bell drawled he might be heading for the hills but im thinking its time to get charles and his family into a safe house until we find out whats what sellitto said absolutely the detective pulled out his cell phone and placed a call luis its roland listen here weirs escaped no no he wasnt dead at all faked it i want grady and his family in a safe house till that boys caught im sending a what at the sound of this single shocked word everyones attention swiveled to bell whos with him by himself whatre you telling me rhyme was looking at bell s face the dark cryptic frown in the otherwise comfortingly lackadaisical visage once again as had happened so often on this case rhyme had a sense that events that seemed unforeseeable but had in fact been planned a long time ago were beginning to unfold bell turned to sellitto luis said you called and had the babysitting team stand down called who called gradys house you told luis to send everybody but him home why would i do that sellitto asked fuck he did it again just like sending the guards at the circus home bell said to the team it gets worse gradys on his way downtown by himself to meet with constable about some pleabargain deal into the phone he said keep the family together luis and call the others on the team get em back right now dont let anybody into the apartment less you know em ill try and find charles he hung up and dialed another number he listened into the receiver for a long moment no answer he left a message charles this is roland weirs escaped and we dont know where hed be or what hes getting up to as soon as you hear this get next to an armed officer you know personally and then call me he gave his number and then made another call to bo haumann head of emergency services he alerted him that grady was on his way to the detention center unprotected the man with two guns hung up and shook his head missed this one by a mile he stared at the evidence charts so what is this boy up to one thing i know rhyme said hes not leaving town hes enjoying this the only thing in my life the only thing thats ever meant anything to me is performing illusion magic thank you sir thank you the guard hesitated slightly at these gentle words as he ushered the man whod spoken them andrew constable into the interview room atop the tombs in lower manhattan the prisoner smiled like a preacher thanking his parishioners for tithes the guard uncuffed constables hands from behind his back and then recuffed them in front is mr roth here yet sir siddown shutup sure thing constable sat shutup did that too the guard left and alone in the room the prisoner gazed out the greasy window at the city he was a country boy through and through but he still appreciated new york hed felt stunned and angry beyond words at september if he and the patriot assembly had had their way the incident never would have happened because the people who wished to do harm to the american way of life would have been rooted out and exposed hard questions a moment later the heavy metal door opened and the guard let joseph roth into the room hi joe gradys agreed to negotiate yeah should be here in about ten minutes id guess hes going to need something substantive from you though andrew oh hell get it the man sighed and ive found out more since i talked to you last ill tell you joseph im heartsick about whats happening up in canton falls and its been going on right under my nose for a year or so that story grady kept harping on about killing those troopers i thought it was nonsense but nope there were some folk actually planning that you have names constable said you bet i have names friends of mine good friends used to be at least that lunch at the riverside inn some of them did hire that man weir to kill grady ive got names dates places phone numbers and theres more coming therere a lot of patriotsre going to cooperate to the hilt dont worry good roth said looking relieved gradyll be tough to deal with at first thats his style but i think thingsre going to work out thanks joe constable sized up his attorney im glad i hired you i have to tell you andrew i was little surprised at first you hiring a lawyer that was jewish you know with what i heard about you but then you got to know me then i got to know you that reminds me joe ive been meaning to ask whens passover what that holiday of yours when is it about a month ago remember that night i left early right he nodded whats it mean passover when the firstborn of the egyptians were killed god passed over the jews houses he spared their sons oh i thought it meant like you passed over a border to safety or something like the red sea roth laughed yeah that makes sense anyway sorry i didnt wish you a happy holiday i appreciate that andrew then he looked into the mans eyes if things work out the way im hoping they will maybe you and your wife could come to our seder next year thats a dinner a celebration we have about fifteen people theyre not all jewish its a good time you can consider that invitation accepted the men shook hands all the more incentive to get me out of here so lets get to work tell me about the charges again and what you think we can get grady to agree to constable stretched felt good to have his hands in front of him and the shackles off his ankles he felt so good in fact that he actually found it amusing to hear his lawyer recite the laundry list of reasons why the people of the state of new york found him unfit for social relations this monologue was interrupted though a moment later when the guard came to the door he motioned roth outside when he returned the lawyer looked troubled and said were supposed to sit tight here for a bit weirs escaped no is grady safe i dont know i assume hes got guards looking out for him the prisoner sighed in disgust you know whos going to come off the heavy me thats who ive had it im just sick and tired of this crap im going to find out where weir is and what hes up to you how ill have everybody i can muster up in canton falls track down jeddy barnes maybe they can convince him to let us know where weir is and what hes doing hold on andrew roth said uneasily nothing illegal up there no ill make sure of that im sure gradyll appreciate it between you and me joe i dont give a rats ass about grady thiss for me giving em weir and jeddys head on a platter i do that and maybe at last everybodyll believe im on the upandup now lets make some phone calls and get to the bottom of this mess chapter thirtyeight hobbs wentworth didnt get away from canton falls very often dressed like a janitor wheeling a cart containing push brooms mops and his fishing gear that is his colt ar semiautomatic assault rifle hobbs wentworth realized that life in the big city had changed quite a bit in the past twenty years the last time hed been here and he noted that everything hed heard about the slow cancer eating away the white race was true lord above our green pastures look at this there were more japanese people or chinese or something who could tell than in tokyo and hispanics everywhere in this part of new york city like mosquitoes and ragheads too who he didnt see why they werent simply rounded up and shot because of the trade towers a woman in one of those moslem outfits all covered up was crossing the street he had a fast urge to kill her because she might know somebody who knew somebody whod attacked his country and indians and pakistanis too who should be sent back home because he couldnt understand what the fuck they were saying not to mention they werent christians hobbs was furious at what the government had done opening up the borders and letting these animals inside to gobble up the country and force decent people into little islands of safety places like canton falls which were getting smaller and smaller every day but god had winked at sharpoperator hobbs wentworth and given him the blessed role of freedom fighter because jeddy barnes and his friends knew that hobbs had one other talent aside from teaching bible stories to children he killed people and he did it very very well sometimes his fishing gear was a kabar knife sometimes a garrote sometimes the sweet colt sometimes the compound bow his dozen or so missions over the past few years had gone perfectly a spic in massachusetts a leftist politician in albany a nigger in burlington a babykilling doc in pennsylvania and now he was going to add a prosecutor to his list he pushed the cart through the nearly empty underground parking garage off center street and paused at one of the doors waiting looking apathetic about starting his night shift as a janitor after a few minutes the door opened and he nodded pleasantly at the woman stepping out of the downstairs lobby a middleaged woman with a briefcase wearing jeans and a white blouse she smiled but pulled the door shut firmly behind her and said sorry she couldnt let him inside he understood with security being what it was he said sure he understood and smiled back a minute later he dumped her twitching body into the cart and pulled her id card lanyard over her head he slid it through the electronic reader and the door clicked open he now took the elevator to the third floor rolling the cart in front of him the womans body obscured by wads of garbage bags hobbs found the office that mr weir had decided would be the best one to use it offered a good view of the street and since it belonged to the department of highway statistics wasnt likely to have any emergencies that would require employees to be here on sunday evening the door was locked but the big man simply kicked his way inside mr weir had said there wasnt time to teach him how to pick locks inside hobbs took his gun from the cart mounted the scope and sighted on the street below a perfect shooting blind he couldnt miss truth be told though he was uneasy it wasnt actually bagging grady that troubled him he could easily catch that trophy no problem it was getting away afterward that had him somewhat concerned he liked his life in canton falls liked telling his bible stories to the children liked hunting and fishing and sitting around with all his likeminded friends even cindy was fun on some nights given the right lighting and a bit of liquor but magic man weirs plan had made provisions for his escape when grady appeared hobbs would shoot five rounds one right after the other at him through the sealed window the first bullet would shatter the glass and might be deflected but the rest would kill the prosecutor then mr weir explained hobbs should push open a fire door but not actually leave that way it would misdirect the police into thinking that was his escape route instead he should return to the parking garage hed move the old dodge in a handicapped spot and climb into the trunk at some point possibly that night but more likely tomorrow the card be towed to the parkingviolations impound garage the towing crews were prohibited from opening either the locked doors or the trunk of cars they were towing and so theyd take the car to the garage driving right past any barricades without a clue that it contained a passenger when it seemed safe hobbs would pop the trunk from the inside and escape back to canton falls there was plenty of water and food in the trunk and an empty jar if he had to pee it was a smart plan and as a godwinked sharp operator hobbs would try his best to pull it off sighting on random passersby to get a feel for the killing field hobbs reflected that mr weir must put on some damn fine magic shows he wondered if after this was all over he could get the man to come back to canton falls and put on a show for the sunday school at the very least hobbs decided hed make up some stories about jesus being a magician and using his tricks to make the romans and heathens disappear sweating chills from the cold perspiration trickling down amelia sachss sides and back chills from fear too search well she turned down another dim corridor of the criminal courts building hand near her weapon but watch your back ah you bet rhyme love to but watch out for who a leanfaced fiftysomething who might be wearing a beard or might not an elderly woman in a cafeteria workers uniform a workman a doc guard a janitor cop medic cook fireman nurse any one of the dozens of people who were legitimately here on a sunday who who who her radio clattered it was sellitto im on the third floor amelia nothing im in the basement ive seen a dozen people all their ids match but hell who knows if hes been planning this for weeks and planted a fake badge here im going up to four they ended the transmission and she resumed the search down more corridors dozens of doors all locked but of course simple locks like these meant nothing to him he could open one in seconds and hide inside a dark storage room he could get into a judges chambers hide until monday he could slip through one of the padlocked grates that led down to the utility tunnels which in turn would give him access to half the buildings in downtown manhattan as well as the subway she turned a corner and plunged down another dark corridor testing knobs as she went she found one door unlocked if he was inside the closet he wouldve heard her the click of the knob if not her footsteps so there was nothing to do but go in fast shoving the door inward flashlight up ready to jump to her left if she saw a weapon turn her way recalling that theres a tendency for a righthanded shooter to pull the gun to the left when panic firing which sends the slug to the targets right arthritic knees screaming at the partial crouch she swung the halogen beam throughout the room a few boxes and file cabinets nothing else though as she turned to leave she recalled that hed hidden in shadows by using a simple black cloth she looked around the room again more slowly probing with the flashlight as she did she felt a touch on her neck a gasp and she spun around bringing the gun up aiming at the center of the dustcoated cobweb that had caressed her skin back into the corridor more locked doors more dead ends footsteps approached a man walked past her now bald in his sixties dressed in a guards uniform and wearing an appropriate id badge he nodded as he walked past he was taller than weir so she let him pass with no more than a glance but then she thought there might be a way for a quickchange artist to change his height turning back fast the man was gone she saw only an empty corridor or an apparently empty corridor she recalled again the silk the conjurer had hidden beneath to kill svetlana basnikov the mirror to kill tony calvert her body a knot of tension she unholstered her weapon and started toward where the guard the apparent guard had disappeared where where was weir trotting along center street roland bell surveyed the landscape in front of him cars trucks hot dog vendors in front of their steaming metal carts young people whod been working at their perpetualmotion law firms or investment banks others woozy from pitchers of beer at the south street seaport dog walkers shoppers dozens of the manhattanites who roam the streets on days beautiful and days gray simply because the citys energy draws them outside where bell thought much of life was like driving a nail shooting in his local vernacular hed been raised in the albemarle sound area of north carolina where guns were a necessity not a fetish and hed been taught to respect them part of this involved concentration even simple shots at a paper target a rattlesnake or copperhead a deer could go wide and dangerous if you didnt stay focused on the target well life was just like that and bell knew that whatever was going on inside the tombs right now he had to remain focused on his single job protecting charles grady amelia sachs called in and reported that she was checking out every human being she could find in the criminal courts building of whatever age race or size shed just tracked down and idd a bald guard who was far taller than weir and looked nothing like the killer but who had only passed muster because it turned out that hed known her late father shed finished one wing of the basement and was about to start on another teams under sellitto and bo haumann were still searching upper floors of the building and the oddest addition of all to the hunt was none other than andrew constable himself who was tracking down leads to weir in upstate new york now thatd be a kick bell thought if the man accused of the attempted murder in the first place turned out to be the one who found out where the real suspect was looking into the cars he jogged past looking at trucks on the street looking down alleyways guns ready but not drawn bell had decided that it made the most sense for them to hit grady here on the street before he entered the building where there was a better chance of escaping alive he doubted that these people were suicidal that didnt fit the profile in the moment between the time grady parked his car and stepped out until he walked into the massive doors of the grimy criminal courts building the killer would go for his shot and an easy one it would be there was virtually no cover here where was weir and just as important where was grady his wife had said hed taken the family car not the city one bell had put out an emergency vehicle locator for the prosecutors volvo but no one had spotted it bell turned slowly surveying the scene revolving like a lighthouse his eyes rose to the building across the street a government office building a new one with dozens of windows facing center street bell had been involved in a brief hostagetaking in the building and he knew that it was practically deserted now on sunday a perfect place to hide and wait for grady but then the street would be a good vantage point too for a driveby say where where roland bell recalled a time hed gone hunting with his daddy up in the great dismal swamp in southern virginia theyd been charged by a wild boar and his fatherd winged the animal it had disappeared into the brush the man had sighed and said we gotta go git him cant ever leave a wounded animal but he tried to attack us the boy had protested well now son we walked into his world he didnt walk into ours but thats neither here nor there its not a question of fairness its a question of we got to find him if it takes all day not humane to him and now hes twice as dangerous to anybody else comes along looking around them at the impossible tangle of brush and reeds and swamp grass and loblolly stretching for miles young roland said but he could be anywhere dad his father laughed grimly oh dont worry bout finding him hell find us keep your thumb on that safety son you may have to shoot fast you comfortable with that yessir i am bell now made another visual circuit of the vans the alleyways nearby the buildings next to and across the street from the courthouse nothing no charles grady no erick weir no sign of any of the killers confederates bell tapped the butt of his gun dont worry bout finding him hell find us chapter thirtynine im doing a doortodoor rhyme the last wing of the basement let esu handle it he found his head craning forward tensely as he spoke into the microphone we need everybody sachs whispered its a damn big building she was in the tombs now working her way through the corridors eerie too like the music school mysteriouser and mysteriouser someday you oughta add a chapter to your book about running crime scenes in spooky locations she joked out of nervousness okay im going silent now rhyme ill call you back rhyme and cooper returned to the evidence in the corridor on the way to intake in the tombs sachs had recovered the blade from the razor knife and fragments of beef bone and gray sponge to simulate skull and brain matter as well as samples of the fake blood sugar syrup with red food coloring hed used his jacket or shirt to wipe up as much of his real blood as he could from the floor and the cuffs but sachs had run the scene as methodically as ever and shed recovered enough of a sample for analysis hed taken with him the key or lock picks hed used to undo the cuffs there was no other helpful evidence in the corridor scene the janitors closet downstairs where hed done his quick change yielded more a paper bag in which hed hidden the bloody squib and bladder and what hed been wearing when theyd collared him at gradys the gray suit the white shirt hed used to wipe up and a pair of oxford businessmans shoes cooper had found substantial trace evidence on these items additional latex and makeup bits of magicians adhesive wax streaks of ink similar to those theyd found earlier thick nylon fibers and dried smears of more fake blood the fibers turned out to be charcoalgray carpet the phony blood was paint the databases they had access to didnt give any information about either of these materials so he sent the chemicalcomposition analysis and photos down to the fbi with an urgent request for sourcing then an idea occurred to rhyme kara he called seeing the girl sitting next to mel cooper rolling a quarter over her fingers as she stared at the computer image of a fiber can you help us out with one thing sure could you go over to the cirque fantastique and find kadesky tell him about the escape and see if theres anything else he can remember about weir any illusions he particularly liked characters or disguises he kept going back to what sort of routines he repeated most often anything thatll give us an idea of what he might look like maybe hes got some old clippings or pictures of weir in costume she suggested slinging her blackandwhite purse over her shoulder he told her that was

car which lincoln rhyme had ordered to remain after the scare that afternoon feeling a camaraderie with them since she herself had been playing cop she smiled and waved to the officers who though they didnt know her waved back no one was selling tickets yet so kara wandered inside and made her way backstage she noticed a young man holding a clipboard an employee pass sat high on his belt like amelias gun excuse me she said yes he replied in a thick french or frenchcanadian accent im looking for mr kadesky he is not here i am one of his assistants where is he not here who are you im working with the police mr kadesky met with them earlier they have some more questions for him the young man glanced at her chest presumably though not necessarily looking for id uhhuh ah police well hes at dinner he will be back soon do you know where hes eating she asked no youll have to leave you cant be back here i only need to see him do you have a ticket no i then you cant wait you must leave he never said anything about the police well i really need to see him she said firmly to the man with gallic good looks and a chill demeanor really you must go you can wait outside for him i might miss him ill have to call a guard he threatened in his thick accent i will do that ill buy a ticket she said theyre sold out and even if you could buy one you could not be back here i will walk you out he herded her out the main door where the tickettakers were now on duty outside she paused and pointed over his shoulder toward a trailer on which was a sign box office thats where i could buy a ticket a demisneer crossed his face thats what a box office is but as i said there are no more tickets you can call mr kadeskys company if you need to ask him something after hed gone kara waited a moment or two then turned the corner of the tent and proceeded to the stage entrance in back she smiled at the security guard and he smiled back giving only a cursory glance at her belt where now sat the frenchcanadians employee pass which shed easily unhooked from his belt when shed pointed and asked the foolish but quite misdirecting question about the box office now theres a rule for you she reflected never fuck with somebody who knows sleight of hand inside the backstage portion of the tent once again she hid the badge in her pocket and found a friendlier employee the woman katherine tunney nodded sympathetically when kara explained what she was doing there that a former illusionist wanted for murder had been identified as someone mr kadesky had worked with a long time ago the woman had heard about the killings and she invited kara to wait until the producer returned from dinner katherine gave kara a pass to sit in one of the vip boxes and then left on another errand promising that shed tell the guards to make sure mr kadesky came to see her as soon as he returned on her way to the box seat her pager sounded an urgent beeping she gasped when she saw the number ran to a bank of temporary pay phones and hand shaking made the call stuyvesant manor the voice said jaynene williams please a huge wait lo its me kara is mom okay oh shes fine girl but i wanted to tell you dont get your hopes up it might be nothin but a few minutes ago she woke up and asked for you she knows its sunday night and she remembered you coming by earlier you mean me the real me yep your real name then she gave this little frown and said unless all she goes by is that crazy stage name of hers kara my god could she be back and she knew me and she asked where you were said she wanted to tell you something karas heart accelerated tell me something better get over here soon honey might last but it might not you know how that goes im in the middle of something jaynene ill get there as soon as i can they hung up and frantic kara returned to her seat the tension was unbearable right this instant her mother might be asking where her daughter was frowning and disappointed that the girl wasnt there please she prayed looking again toward the doorway for kadesky nothing wishing she could tap a hickory magic wand on the battered metal railing in front of her point it at the doorway and materialize the producer please she thought again aiming the imaginary wand toward the doorway please nothing for a moment then several figures entered none of them was kadesky though they were just three women dressed in medieval costumes and wearing masks whose forlorn expressions were belied by the buoyant spring in the step of actors about to begin their evenings performance roland bell was standing in one of the canyons of downtown manhattan center street between the grimy towering criminal courts building crowned by the bridge of sighs and the nondescript office building across the street from it still no sign of charles gradys volvo the lighthouse rotation once again where where where a honk nearby in the direction of the entrance to the bridge a shout bell turned and jogged a few steps toward the sounds wondering misdirection but no it was just a traffic dispute he turned back toward the entrance to the criminal courts building and found himself looking right at charles grady who was strolling casually up the street a block away the prosecutor was walking with his head down lost in his thoughts the detective sprinted toward the man calling charles get down weirs escaped grady paused frowning down bell called breathlessly the alarmed man crouched on the sidewalk between two parked cars what happened he shouted my family ive got people with them the detective said then to the pedestrians everybody police action here clear the street people scattered instantly my family grady called desperately youre sure theyre fine but weir faked the shooting in detention hes out and somewhere around here ive got an armored van on its way turning again squinting surveying the scenery roland bell finally reached grady and stood over him his back to the dark windows of the government office building across the street just stay right where you are charles bell said well get out of this fine and pulled his handytalkie off his belt what was this hobbs wentworth watched his target below him the prosecutor cowering on the sidewalk behind a man in a sports coat a cop obviously the crosshairs of hobbs s scope poked around the officers back searching unsuccessfully for an unprotected shot at grady the prosecutor was low the cop standing it seemed to hobbs that if he shot through the cops lower back hed probably hit grady in the upper chest since he was crouching but the risk was that the shot would be deflected and gradyd only be wounded and fall to safety behind a car well he had to do something pretty soon the cop was talking on his radio thered be a hundred more of em here in a minute come on sharp operator he said to himself whatcha gonna do below him the cop was still looking around covering grady who squatted like a bitch retriever peeing all right what hed do was shoot the cop in the upper leg the thigh that way most likely the cop would fall backward exposing the prosecutor the colt was semiauto so he could fire five shots in two seconds not perfect but it was the best hobbs could think of hed give the cop a moment or two longer to step aside or sway out of the way both eyes open as the right one stared through the scope painting the back of the detective with the crosshairs and thinking that when he got back to canton falls hed make up a bible story about this jesus would play his role and would be armed with a kickass compound bow about to ambush a bunch of roman soldiers whod been torturing christians julius caesar would be hiding behind one soldier and thinking he was safe but jesus would shoot through the soldier and kill the sonofabitch good story the kidsd love it the cop was still huddled over the prosecutor well thats it hobbs thought clicking off the safety of the big colt no time left burn in brimstone christkilling romans he centered the crosshairs on the back of the cops leg and began to apply slow pressure on the trigger thinking that his only regret was that the officer was white not black but one thing hobbs wentworthd learned in life you take your targets the way you find em chapter forty roland bell smelled the distinctive plasticsweatmetal scent of the motorola handytalkie as he clutched it to his face esu four you bout ready k he drawled into the mike roger that k one of them replied okay now which is when the muffled cracks of multiple shots resounded through the canyon of the street bell jumped gunshots charles grady cried i heard shots are you hit just stay down bell said as he dropped into a crouch he spun around lifting his gun and squinting hard at the government office building across the street he was counting furiously got the location he called into the radio i make it the third floor fifth office from the north end of the building then bell examined the glass ouch say again k one of the officers called i said ouch uhm roger out grady lying on the sidewalk said whats going on he started to get up sit tight there the detective told him standing up cautiously turning now from the window and scanning the sidewalk around him there was a possibility that more shooters were nearby a moment later an armored emergency services van pulled up and five seconds after that bell and grady were inside squealing away from the attempted hit and taking the prosecutor back to the upper east side and his family bell glanced behind him to see more esu troopers streaming into the building across the street from the courthouse dont worry hell find us well he sure as hell had bell had concluded that the best way to try to hit grady would be from the office building across the street it was most likely that the killer would break into one of the lower offices facing the sidewalk the roof was unlikely because it was monitored by dozens of cctv cameras bell had remained in the open as bait because of something he knew about this particular building from the hostage situation hed run there the windows as in many of the newer government buildings here couldnt be opened and were made from bombproof glass thered been a small risk he supposed that the shooter would use armorpiercing rounds which might penetrate the inchthick glass but bell had recalled an expression hed heard during a case a couple of years ago god dont give out certain hed taken the chance of luring the sniper into shooting in hopes that the bullet would spider the window and reveal the mans location and his idea had worked though with a variation as bell had mentioned to the esu team ouch esu four to bell its haumann you were right k go ahead k the tactical commander continued were inside scene is secure only what do they call those the darwin awards you know where criminals do stupid things k roger that bell responded whered he hit himself k bell had spotted the shooters location not because of cracked glass but because of a large spatter of blood on the window the esu chief explained that the copperjacketed slugs that the man had fired toward bell had ricocheted off the glass shattered and struck the shooter himself in a halfdozen places most significantly his groin where they apparently severed a large artery or vein the man had bled out by the time the esu team had made its way to the office tell me its weir k bell said nup sorry its somebody named hobbs wentworth address canton falls bell scowled angrily so weir and maybe others working with him were still around he asked find anything thatll give us a clue what weirs up to or where he might be negative said the raspyvoiced commander only his id and get this a book of bible stories for kids there was a pause hate to say it but we got another victim roland he killed a woman to get into the building looks like okay were going to secure the place and keep looking for weir out the detective shook his head and said to grady no sign of him except that of course that was the whole problem maybe they had found plenty of signs of weir maybe theyd even found weir himself in the form of another cop a med tech an esu officer a reporter a softclothed detective a passerby or homeless man and they simply didnt know it through the yellowing window in the interview room andrew constable could see the grim face of a large black guard peer in and look at him the face disappeared as the man stepped away from the door constable rose from the metal table and walked past his lawyer to the window he looked outside and saw two guards in the hall speaking gravely to each other all right then whats that joseph roth asked his client nothing constable responded i didnt say anything oh i thought you did no though he wondered if he had made some comment uttered a prayer he returned to the table where the lawyer looked up from a pad of yellow foolscap that contained a half dozen names and phone numbers which constables associates in canton falls had just provided in response to their questions about what weir might have planned where he might be roth looked uneasy theyd just learned that a man with a rifle had made an attempt on gradys life in front of the building a few minutes ago but it hadnt been weir who was still unaccounted for the lawyer said im worried that gradyll be too spooked to deal with us i think we should call him at home and tell him what weve found tapping the sheets or at least give this stuff to that detective what was his name bell right thats it constable said moving his pudgy finger over the sheet of names and numbers roth said you think anybody herell know something specific about weir thats what theyll want something specific constable leaned forward and looked at the list then at his lawyers watch he shook his head slowly i doubt it he said you you doubt it yeah see this first number yeah its the dry cleaner on harrison street in canton falls and the one below its the iga the next ones the baptist church and those names the prisoner continued ed davis brett samuels joe james watkins right roth said jeddy barnes associates constable gave a chuckle gosh no theyre all made up what roth frowned leaning close to his lawyer the prisoner stared into the mans confused eyes im saying that those names and numbersre fake i dont understand constable whispered of course you dont you pathetic fucking jew and slammed his fists into the side of the shocked lawyers face before roth could raise his arms to protect himself chapter fortyone andrew constable was a strong man strong from hiking to remote hunting and fishing grounds from dressing deer and sawing bones from chopping wood paunchy joe roth was no match for him the lawyer tried to rise and call for help but constable struck him hard in the throat the mans shout became a gurgling sound the prisoner pulled him to the floor and began pummeling the bleeding man with his cuffed fists in a moment roth was unconscious his face swollen like a melon constable dragged him back to the table and propped him up on it his back to the door if one of the guards happened to glance in again it would look as if he were reading the papers head down constable bent down pulled off one of the lawyers shoes and socks and wiped the blood off the table as best he could and covered the rest with documents and pads of paper hed kill the lawyer later for now for a few minutes at least he needed this innocentlooking tableau a few minutes until he was free freedom which was the whole point of erick weirs plan constables best friend jeddy barnes the second in command of the patriot assembly had hired weir not to kill grady but to break the prisoner out of the notoriously secure manhattan detention center transport him to freedom over the bridge of sighs and ultimately into the new england wilderness where the assembly could resume its mission to wage war against the impure the unclean the ignorant to rid the land of blacks gays jews hispanics foreigners the them that constable railed against in his weekly lectures at the patriot assembly and in the secret websites subscribed to by the thousands of rightthinking citizens around the country constable now rose walked to the door looked out again the guards had no clue about what had just happened inside the interview room it occurred to the prisoner that he ought to have a weapon of some kind and so he lifted a metal mechanical pencil from the lawyers bloody shirt and then nestled the butt of the pencil in the waddedup sock to protect his palm the sharp point would make a fine stabbing implement then he sat back across from roth and waited thinking about the plan created by weir or magic man as barnes called him it was a masterpiece involving dozens of tricks of the illusionists trade feint and double feint careful timing clever diversions it began with weir carefully planting the idea with the police that there was a conspiracy to kill grady the reverend ralph swensen laid the groundwork for this by making one attempt on the prosecutors life the bungled killing would reinforce the cops belief that there was a plot to kill the prosecutor and theyd stop looking for any other crimes such as the planned jailbreak weir himself would then intentionally get caught during a second attempt to kill grady and be taken to detention meanwhile constable was supposed to do some misdirection of his own hed disarm his captors by being the voice of reason pleading his innocence and winning sympathy and luring grady to the courthouse this evening by offering to incriminate barnes and other conspirators constable would even try to help track down the illusionist further disarming the police and giving him the chance to deliver a coded message about his exact location in the detention center which barnes would pass on to weir when grady arrived hobbs wentworth would try to kill the prosecutor but whether he succeeded or not didnt matter the important thing was that hobbs would divert the police from the detention center then weir who was roaming free in the building after faking his own death would sneak up here in disguise kill the guards and break constable out there was one more part to the plan an aspect that constabled been looking forward to for weeks just before weir arrived at the interview room jeddy barnes had told him constable was supposed to take care of your lawyer whats that mean weir said its up to you he just said youre supposed to take care of roth so hes not in the way now watching the blood drip from the lawyers eyes and mouth he thought well the jews took care of constable was wondering how weir would kill the guards what kind of disguises hed have with him what their escape route would be when right on schedule he heard the distinctive buzz of the outer door ah his chariot to freedom had arrived constable dragged roth off the bench and dumped him in the corner of the interview room he thought about killing him now stomping on his windpipe but he supposed weir had a gun with a silencer or a knife he could use that hearing the click of the key in the lock of the interview room the door swung open for a split second he thought amazing weird managed to turn himself into a woman but then he remembered her this was the redheaded officer whod been with detective bell yesterday injury here she shouted as she glanced down at roth call ems behind her one guard grabbed a phone and the other hit a red button on the wall sending a klaxon alarm braying into the hallway what was going on constable didnt understand where was weir he glanced back at the woman to see the pepper spray the only permissible weapon in detention in her hand he thought fast and began moaning loud holding his belly somebody got in here another prisoner he tried to kill us hiding the sharp pencil he clutched his bloody hands to his belly im hurt ive been stabbed a fast glance outside still no sign of the magic man the woman frowned and looked around the cell as constable slumped to the floor thinking when she gets closer hed stab toward her face with the pencil maybe hit her eye he could get the spray away blast her in the mouth or eyes with it maybe hold the pencil to her back the guards would think it was a gun and open the door for him weir had to be close maybe he was just outside the security doors come on honey a little closershe might have a bulletproof vest on he reminded himself aim for her pretty face your lawyer she asked leaning over roth is he stabbed too yes it was some black prisoner he said i was a racist he said he wanted to teach me a lesson his head was down but he could sense her stepping closer joes hurt bad we have to save him just a few more feet or if he is a white man and looks like a smart man if he has all his teeth and wears clothes that dont smell like yesterdays piss well then are you going to be just a little slower to pull that trigger constable moaned he sensed her very close she said let me see how badly youre hurt he gripped the pencil firmly got ready to spring he looked up to find his target and saw the nozzle of the pepper spray a foot away from his eyes she pushed the button and the stream shot him square in the face a hundred hot needles pierced his mouth and nose and eyes constable screamed as the policewoman ripped the pen out of his hand and kicked him onto his back whyd you do that he cried rising up on one elbow why her answer was to debate for a brief moment then hit him with a second stream of fiery spray chapter fortytwo amelia sachs put the pepper spray canister away the potential sergeant in her was a bit troubled by the gratuitous second blast into constables face but having noticed the fourteenkarat shiv half concealed in his hand sachs the street cop with wire thoroughly enjoyed hearing the vicious bigot squeal like a pig as she sprayed him again she stepped aside as the two floor guards grabbed the prisoner and dragged him out a doctor get me to a doctor my eyes i have a right to a doctor i keep tellin yo tshuddup the guards dragged him down the hall constable lashed out with his feet they stopped shackled his ankles and then pulled him around the corner sachs and two more guards looked over joseph roth he was breathing but unconscious and badly hurt she decided it was best not to move him soon a city ems team arrived and after sachs checked their ids went to work on the lawyer clearing his airway and getting a neck brace around him then strapping him onto a backboard which they placed on a gurney they took him out of the secure area for the drive to the hospital sachs stood back and surveyed the room and the lobby to make sure that weir hadnt slipped in unnoticed no she was sure he hadnt she then went outside and it was only when she got her glock back from the officer at the desk that she began to feel more at ease she called rhyme to tell him what had happened then she added constable was expecting him rhyme expecting weir i think so he was surprised when i opened the door he tried to recover but i could tell he was waiting for somebody so thats what weirs up to breaking constable out thats what i think goddamn misdirection he muttered hes had us focused on the plot to kill grady i never thought theyd be going for a breakout then he added unless the escape is misdirection and weirs job really is to kill grady she considered this thatd work too and no sign of weir anywhere none okay im still going over what you found at detention sachs come on back and well look over it i cant rhyme she said studying the hallway in which a dozen onlookers stood gazing at the excitement in the secure portion of the lobby hes got to be here someplace im going to keep hunting suzuki piano lessons for children involve working through a series of progressively more difficult music books containing a dozen or so pieces when a student completes a book successfully the parents often throw a small party for friends family and the music teacher during which the student gives a short recital christine gradys suzuki volume three party was scheduled for a week from tonight and shed been practicing hard for her mini concert she was now sitting in the yanno room of the familys apartment finishing up schumanns the wild rider the yanno room was dark and small but chrissy loved it here it contained only a few chairs shelves of sheet music and a beautiful shiny baby grand piano hence her nickname for the place with some effort she played the andante movement of clementis sonatina in c and then rewarded herself by playing the mozart sonatina one of her favorites she didnt think her playing was all that good though she was distracted by the police in their apartment the men and women were all very nice and talked cheerfully about star wars or harry potter or xbox games with big smiles on their faces but chrissy knew they werent really smiling at all they were only doing it to make her feel comfortable but all the fake grins really did was make her more scared because even though they didnt say it the fact that the police were here meant that somebody was trying to hurt her daddy she wasnt worried about somebody trying to hurt her what scared her was that some bad man would take her daddy away from her she wished hed stop doing the court job he had once shed worked up her courage and asked him but hed said to her how much do you like playing the yanno honey lots well thats how much i like doing my job oh okay shed said even though it wasnt okay at all because playing music didnt make people hate you and want to kill you she now squinted harder and concentrated flubbed a passage once and then tried again and now shed learned they were going to have to go live someplace else for a while just a day or two her momd said but what if it was for longer than that what if they had to cancel the suzuki party upset she gave up playing closed the music book and started to put it in her book bag hey look at this resting on the music stand was a york peppermint patty not a little one but a fullsizer the kind they sell at the checkout stands at food emporium she wondered whod left it her mother didnt like anybody to eat in the yanno room and chrissy was never allowed to have candy or anything sticky when she was playing maybe itd been her daddy she knew he felt bad for her because of all the policemen around and because she hadnt been able to go to her recital last night at the neighborhood school that was it this was a secret treat from her father chrissy glanced behind her through the crack in the door she saw people walking back and forth heard the calm voice of that nice policeman from north carolina who had two boys she was going to meet someday her mother brought a suitcase out of the bedroom she had her unhappy face on and was saving this is crazy why cant you find him hes one man therere hundreds of you i dont understand it chrissy sat back opened up the foil covering and slowly ate the candy when she was finished she carefully examined her fingers yep there was chocolate on them shed go the bathroom and wash them off and while she was there shed flush the wrapper down the toilet so her mother wouldnt find out that was called disposing of the evidence which shed learned from that csi television program her parents wouldnt let her watch even though she managed to every once in a while roland bell had returned safely with charles grady to the apartment where the family was now packing up to go to an nypd safe house in the murray hill area of town hed pulled the shades down and told the family to stay away from the windows he could see that this fueled their uneasiness but his job wasnt to coddle psyches it was to keep a very clever killer from taking their lives his cell phone rang it was rhyme everything secure there the criminalist asked tight as a bed baby bell replied constables in a secure cell and we know his guards right bell asked amelia said weir might be good but hes not good enough to turn himself into two shaquille oneal lookalikes got it hows the lawyer roth hell live was a bad beating though im rhyme stopped talking as someone else in the room began speaking bell believed he heard the soft voice of mel cooper he then resumed speaking to bell im still going through what amelia found at the scenes in the detention center dont have any specific leads yet but weve got something else i wanted to mention bedding and saul finally tracked down which room at the lanham arms the key card belonged to who was it registered to fake name and address rhyme explained but the desk clerk said the guest fit weirs description perfectly cs didnt get much but they found a discarded syringe behind the dresser we dont know whether weir left it or not but im going on the assumption he did mel found traces of chocolate and sucrose on the needle sucrose thats sugar right and arsenic in the barrel of the syringe bell said so he injected poison into some sweets sounds like it ask the gradys if anybodys sent them any candy lately bell relayed the question to the prosecutor and his wife and they shook their heads dismayed to even hear the question no we dont keep candy in the house the prosecutors wife said the criminalist then asked bell you said he surprised you by getting into gradys apartment itself this afternoon yup we thought wed nail him in the lobby the basement or the roof we never expected him to get in the front door after he broke in where did he go he just showed up in the living room shook us all up so he mightve had time to leave some candy in the kitchen no couldntve been in the kitchen bell explained lon and i were in there what other rooms could he have gotten into bell posed the question to grady and his wife whats going on roland the prosecutor asked lincoln just found some more evidence ands thinking that weir mightve tried to get some poison into your house it looks like it was in some candy were not sure he did but candy from a soft high voice behind them bell the gradys and two of the other cops on protection detail turned to see the prosecutors daughter staring at the detective eyes wide with fear chrissy her mother asked what is it candy the girl whispered again a foil wrapper fell from her hand and she began to sob hands sweating bell looked at the passersby on the sidewalk in front of charles gradys apartment dozens of people was one of them weir or somebody else from that goddamn patriot assembly the ambulance rolled up and two techs jumped out but before they got through the front door the detective carefully examined their ids whats all this about one of them asked offended bell ignored him and checked out the cars on the street the passersby the windows in the buildings nearby when it was safe he gave a whistle and luis martinez the quiet bodyguard hustled the girl out and into the ambulance accompanied by her mother chrissy wasnt showing symptoms of poisoning yet though she was pale and shook from fearful crying the girl had eaten a peppermint patty that had mysteriously appeared in her piano room this was beyond evil to bell hurting children and though hed been suckered in by constables smooth talk momentarily this incident clarified the complete depravity of people like those in the patriot assembly differences between cultures between races no sir theres only one difference theres good and decency on the one side and evil on the other if the girl died bell would make it his personal quest to see that both weir and constable received the punishment that corresponded to what hed done to chrissy lethal injection dont you worry honey he now said to her as one of the medics took her blood pressure youre going to be just fine the response to this was the girls silent sobbing he glanced at chrissys mother on whose face was a look of tenderness that couldnt quite hide a fury exponentially greater than bell s the detective radioed to central and was patched through to emergency services at the hospital they were careening toward at the moment he said to the supervisor were gonna be at the admission dock in two minutes now listen here i want that area and a route to a poisoncontrol center cleared of people i dont want a soul around less theyre wearing a picture id badge well detective we cant do that the woman said thats a very busy section of the hospital im gonna be muley on this one maam youre going to be what stubborn theres an armed perpetrator whos after this little girl and her family and if i do see anybody in our line of sight without a badge theyre gonna get handcuffed and in a pretty impatient way thiss an emergency room in a city hospital detective the woman responded testily do you know how many people im looking at right now no maam i do not but imagine lookin at every one of em on their bellies and hogtied which is what theyre gonna be if theyre not gone by the time we get there and by the by thats looking to be all of two minutes from right now chapter fortythree cases change color charles grady sat hunched forward in an orange plastic chair in a room off the urgent care waiting area staring at the green linoleum scuffed by thousands of despairing feet criminal cases i mean roland bell sat next to him luiss vigilant form filled one doorway and nearby at the entrance to a busy hallway was another of bell s swat officers graham wilson a handsome intense detective with keen stern eyes and a talent for spotting people packing weapons as if he had xray vision gradys wife had accompanied chrissy into the er itself along with luis and another protectionteam officer i had a law school professor one time grady continued still as wood hed been a prosecutor and then a judge he told us once in class that in all his years of practicing law hed never seen a blackandwhite case come through the door they were all different shades of gray there was pretty damn dark gray and there was damn light gray but they were all gray bell glanced up the corridor toward the impromptu waiting room that the duty nurse had made for the injured skateboarders and bicyclists as bell had insisted this portion of the hospital had been cleared but then once you got involved in the case yourself it changed color it became black and white whether you were prosecuting or defending the gray disappeared your side was one hundred percent good the other side was one hundred percent evil right or wrong my professor said you have to guard against that you have to keep reminding yourself that cases were really gray bell noticed an orderly the young latino seemed harmless but the detective nodded to wilson who stopped him and checked his badge nonetheless he gave an okay sign to bell chrissyd been in an operating room for fifteen minutes why couldnt somebody come out and at least give them some progress grady continued but you know roland all these months since we found out about that conspiracy in canton falls i kept seeing the constable case as black and white i never once considered it gray i went after him with everything i had a sad laugh he looked up the hall again the grim smile fading where the hells that doctor lowered his head again but maybe if id seen more gray maybe if i hadnt gone after him so hard if id compromised more he might notve hired weir he might notve he nodded toward where his daughter was at the moment he choked and cried silently for a moment bell said im thinking your professor was wrong charles at least about people like constable anybody whod do what hes done well there is no gray with people like that grady wiped his face your boys roland they ever been in the hospital visiting their mother toward the end was the detectives first thought but bell didnt say anything about that off and on nothing serious fixin up whatever a softball can do to a forehead or a little finger or a shortstop running you down armed with a softball well grady said it takes your breath away another look up the empty hall takes it clean away a few minutes later the detective was aware of motion in the corridor a doctor wearing green scrubs noticed grady and walked slowly toward them bell could read nothing on his face charles the detective said softly but though his head was down grady was already watching the mans approach black and white he whispered lord he rose to meet the doctor gazing out the window at the evening sky lincoln rhyme heard his phone ring command answer phone click yes lincoln its roland mel cooper turned gravely to look at him they knew bell was at the hospital with christine grady and her family whats the word shes all right cooper closed his eyes momentarily and if ever a protestant came close to blessing himself this was the moment rhyme too felt a surge of relief no poison nothing it was just candy not a lick of toxin anywhere so that was misdirection too the criminalist mused seems to be but what the hell does it mean rhyme asked in a faint voice the question directed not so much to bell but to himself the detective offered for my money weir pointing us to grady im thinking that means hes still going to try something else to spring constable from detention hes in the courthouse somewhere you on your way to the safe house yup whole family well sit it out there till you catch this fella till how about if they hung up and rhyme turned from the window and wheeled back to the evidence chart the hand is quicker than the eye except that its not what did master illusionist erick weir have in mind feeling his neck muscles tense to the point of cramping he gazed out the window as he considered the enigma they were facing hobbs wentworth the hitman was dead and grady and his family were safe constable had clearly been preparing to escape from the interview room at the tombs but thered been no overt attempt by weir to actually spring him so it appeared that weirs plans were falling apart but rhyme couldnt accept that obvious conclusion with the supposed attempt on christine grady hed taken their attention away from downtown and rhyme now leaned toward bells conclusion that there was soon going to be another attempt to rescue constable or was there something else going on maybe an attempt to kill constable to keep him from testifying the frustration scared him rhyme had long ago accepted that with his condition he would never physically capture a perp but the compensation was the sinewy strength of a clever mind sitting motionless in his chair or bed he could at least outthink the criminals he pursued except that with erick weir the conjurer he couldnt this was a man whose soul was devoted to deception rhyme considered if there was anything else to be done to find answers to the impossible questions raised by the case sachs sellitto and esu were scouring the detention center and courts kara was at the cirque fantastique awaiting kadesky thom was placing calls to keating and loesser the killers former assistants to see if the man had contacted them in the past day or if theyd happened to remember something else that could be helpful a physical evidence response team on loan from the fbi was searching the scene of the office building where hobbs wentworth had shot himself and technicians in washington were still analyzing the fiber and fakeblood paint found by sachs at the detention center what else could rhyme do to find out what weir had in mind only one thing he decided to try something he hadnt done for years rhyme himself began to walk some grids this search started at the bloody escape scene in the detention center and took him through winding corridors lit with algaegreen fluorescence around corners banged dull from years of careening supply carts and pallets into closets and furnace rooms trying to follow the footsteps and discern the thoughts of erick weir the walk was of course conducted with his eyes closed and took place exclusively in his mind still it seemed appropriate that he should engage in a hot pursuit that was wholly imaginary when the prey he sought was a vanished man the stoplight changed to green and malerick accelerated slowly he was thinking about andrew constable a conjurer in his own right to hear jeddy barnes tell it like a mentalist constable could size up a man in seconds and assume a countenance that would put him instantly at ease speaking humorously intelligently with understanding taking rational sympathetic positions selling the medicine to the gullible of which there were plenty of course youd think that people would tip to the nonsense that groups like the patriot assembly spewed but as the great impresario of malericks own art p t barnum noted theres a sucker born every minute as he picked his way through the sunday evening traffic malerick was amused to think of constables utter bewilderment at the moment part of the plan for the prisoners escape required constable to incapacitate his lawyer two weeks ago in the restaurant in bedford junction jeddy barnes had said to him well mr weir the thing is roths jewish andrewll enjoy hurting him pretty good makes no difference to me malerick had replied he can kill him if he wants to that wont affect my plan i just want him taken care of out of the way barnes had nodded suspect thatll be good news to mr constable he could imagine the growing dismay and panic within constable as he sat over the cooling body of his lawyer waiting for weir to arrive with guns and disguises to sneak him out of the building an event that of course was never going to happen the jail door would open and a dozen guards would haul the man back to his cell the trial would go on and andrew constable as confused as barnes and wentworth and everyone else in his neanderthal clan in upstate new york would never know how theyd been used as he waited at another stoplight he wondered how the other misdirection of his was unfolding the poisoned little girl routine melodramatic malerick had assessed if not an outright cliché but hed learned from years of performing that audiences do much better with the obvious not the best misdirection in the world of course he wasnt sure theyd discover the syringe in the lanham nor could he be certain the girl or anyone else would eat the candy but rhyme and his people were so good that he guessed there was a chance they would leap to the horrifying conclusion that this was another attempt on the life of the prosecutor and his family then theyd find there was no poison in the candy after all what would they make of that was there other tainted candy or was this misdirection to lead them away from manhattan detention where malerick might be planning some other way to break constable out in short the police too would be floating in a soup of confusion having no idea what was actually going on well whats been going on for the past two days revered audience is a sublime performance featuring the perfect combination of physical and psychological misdirection physical by directing the attention of the police toward both charles gradys apartment and the detention center psychological by shifting suspicion away from what malerick was really doing and toward the very credible motive that lincoln rhyme proudly believed hed figured out the hired killing of grady and the orchestration of andrew constables escape once the police had deduced that their minds stopped looking for any other explanation as to what he was really up to which had absolutely nothing to do with the constable case all of the clues hed left so obviously the illusionisttrick attacks on the first three victims who represented aspects of the circus the shoe with the dog hairs and dirt ground into it leading to central park the references to the fire in ohio and the connection with the cirque fantastique all of those had convinced the police that his intent couldnt really be revenge against kadesky because that as lincoln rhyme had told him was too obvious he had to be up to something else but he wasnt now dressed in a medical technicians uniform he eased the ambulance he was driving through the service entrance of the tent housing the world renowned internationally heralded critically acclaimed cirque fantastique he parked under the box seats scaffolding climbed out and locked the door none of the stagehands police or the many security guards paid any attention to him or the ambulance after the bomb scare earlier in the day it was perfectly normal for an emergency vehicle to be parked here perfectly natural an illusionist would note look revered audience here is your illusionist center stage yet completely invisible hes the vanished man present but unseen no one even glanced at the vehicle which wasnt an ordinary ambulance at all but a feke in place of medical equipment it now held a dozen plastic drums containing a total of seven hundred gallons of gasoline attached to a simple detonation device which would soon spark the liquid to life sending the deadly flood erupting into the bleachers into the canvas into the audience of more than two thousand people among whom would be edward kadesky see mr rhyme when we talked before my words were just patter kadesky and the cirque fantastique destroyed my life and my love and im going to destroy him revenge is what this is all about ignored by everyone the illusionist now walked casually out of the tent and into central park hed change out of the medical workers uniform and into a new disguise and would return under cover of night becoming for a change a member of the audience himself and finding a good vantage spot to enjoy the finale of his show chapter fortyfour families clusters of friends couples children were slowly entering the tent finding their seats filling in the bleachers and box seats slowly changing from individuals into that creature called an audience the whole becoming very different from the parts metamorphosis kara turned away from the sight and stopped a security guard ive been waiting for a while you have any idea when mr kadeskyll be back its really important no he didnt know and neither did the two other people she asked another glance at her watch she felt heartsick an image came to her of her mother lying in the stuyvesant home looking around the room pierced with clarity and wondering where her daughter was kara wanted to cry in frustration at being trapped here knowing that she had to stay do what she could to stop weir yet wanting so desperately to be at her mothers side she turned back to the brightly lit interior of the huge circus tent performers waited in the wings getting ready for the opening act wearing their eerie commedia dellarte masks the kids in the audience were wearing the face gear too overpriced souvenirs from the stands outside pug and hooked noses beaks they gazed around mostly excited and giddy but some were uneasy she could see the masks and otherworldly decorations probably made the circus seem to them like a scene from a horror movie kara loved performing for children but she knew that you had to be careful their reality was different from adults and an illusionist could easily destroy youngsters shaky sense of comfort she only did funny illusions in her young childrens shows and would often gather the kids around her afterward and tip the gaff looking at all the magic around her feeling the excitement the anticipation her palms were sweating as if she herself were about to go on oh what she wouldnt give to be standing in the prep tent right now content confident yet wired feeling the accelerating heartbeat of anticipation as the clock ticked toward show time there was no sensation like that in the world she laughed sadly to herself well here shed made it to cirque fantastique but as an errand girl she wondered now am i good enough despite what david balzac said sometimes she believed she was at least as good as say harry houdini during his early shows the only escapism at those had been the audience members who snuck out of the halls bored or embarrassed to watch him flub simple sleights roberthoudin was so uncomfortable in his initial performances that he ended up offering the audience clockwork automatons like a windup turk who played chess but as she gazed backstage at the hundreds of performers whod been in the business since childhood balzacs firm voice looped through her mind not yet not yet not yet she heard these words with both disappointment yet comfort he was right she decided with finality he was the expert she was the apprentice she had to have confidence in him a year or two the wait would be worth it besides there was her mother who was maybe sitting up in bed right now chatting with jaynene wondering where her daughter was the daughter whod abandoned her on the one night when she shouldve been there kadeskys assistant katherine tunney appeared at the top of the stairs and gestured toward her was kadesky here please but the woman said he just called he had a radio interview after dinner and hes running late hell be here soon thats his box in the front why dont you wait there kara nodded and discouraged walked to the seat katherine indicated sat down and gazed back at the tent she saw that the magic transformation was finally complete every seat was filled the children the men the women were now an audience thud kara jumped as a loud hollow drum resonated through the tent the lights went down extinguished completely plunging them into a darkness broken only by the red exit lights thud the crowd was instantly silent thud thud thud the drumbeat sounded slowly you could feel it in your chest thud thud a brilliant spotlight shot into the center of the ring illuminating the actor playing arlecchino dressed in his blackandwhitecheckered bodysuit wearing his matching half mask holding a long scepter high in the air he looked around mischievously thud he stepped forward and began to march around the ring as a procession of performers appeared behind him other commedia dellarte characters as well as spirits fairies princesses and princes wizards some walking some dancing some cartwheeling slowly as if underwater some on high stilts stepping more gracefully than most people stroll down the sidewalk some riding in chariots or carts decorated with tulle and feathers and lace and tiny glowing lights everyone moving in perfect time to the drum thud thud faces masked faces painted white or black or silver or gold faces dotted with glitter hands juggling glowing balls hands carrying orbs or flares or candles or lanterns hands scattering confetti like glittering snow solemn regal playful grotesque thud both medieval and futuristic the parade was hypnotic and its message was unmistakable whatever existed outside the tent was invalid here you could forget everything youd learned about life about human nature about the laws of physics themselves your heart was now beating not to its own rhythm but in time to the crisp drum and your soul was no longer yours it had been captured by this unearthly parade making its deliberate way into the world of illusion chapter fortyfive we come now to the finale of our show revered audience its time to present our most celebrated and controversial illusion a variation on the infamous burning mirror during our show this weekend youve seen the performances of illusions created by such masters as harry houdini and p t selbit and howard thurston but not even they would attempt an act like the burning mirror our performer trapped in a likeness of hell surrounded by flames that close in inexorably and the only route for escape a tiny doorway protected by a wall of fire though of course the door might not be an escape route at all maybe its just an illusion i have to warn you revered audience that the most recent attempt to perform this trick resulted in tragedy i know because i was there so please for your own sake spend a moment looking around the tent and consider what you will do should disaster strike but on reflection no its too late for that perhaps the best you can hope for now is simply to pray malerick had returned to central park and was standing under a tree about fifty yards from the glowing white tent of the cirque fantastique bearded once more he was dressed in a jogging suit and a highnecked knit shirt tufts of sweaty blond hair poked from underneath a chase manhattan k run for the cure cap faux sweat stains out of a bottle attested to his present persona a minor financial executive at a major bank out for his sundaynight run hed stopped for a breather and was absently looking at the circus tent perfectly natural he found himself oddly calm this serenity reminded him of that moment just after the hasbro circus fire in ohio before the full implications of the disaster had become clear while by rights he should have been screaming he in fact found himself numb in an emotional coma he felt the same at this moment listening to the music the bass notes amplified it seemed by the taut canvas of the tent itself the diffuse applause laughter gasps of astonishment in his years of performing hed rarely gotten stage fright when you knew your act cold when youd rehearsed sufficiently what was there to be nervous about this is what he now experienced everything had been so carefully planned that he knew his show would unfold as intended scanning the tent in its last few minutes on earth he saw two figures just outside the large service doorway through which hed driven the ambulance not long before a man and a young woman speaking to each other ear close to mouth so they could converse over the sound of the music yes one of them was kadesky hed been worried that the producer might not be present at the time of the explosion the other was kara kadesky pointed inside and together they walked in the direction hed indicated malerick estimated that they had to be no more than ten feet from the ambulance a look at his watch almost time and now my friends my revered audience exactly at nine p m a spume of fire shot from the doorway of the tent a moment later the silhouette of the huge flames inside rolled across the glowing canvas of the tent as they consumed the bleachers the audience the decorations the music stopped abruptly replaced by screams and coils of dark smoke began to pour from the top of the tent he leaned forward mesmerized by the horror of the sight more smoke more screams struggling not to let an unnatural smile slide onto his face he offered a prayer of thanks there was no deity malerick believed in but he sent these words of gratitude to the soul of harry houdini his namesake and idol and the patron saint of magicians gasps and cries as those around him in this secluded part of the park ran forward to help or to gape malerick waited a few moments longer but he knew that soon hundreds of police would fill the park looking concerned pulling out his cell phone to pretend to call the fire department he eased toward the sidewalk still he couldnt help pausing once more he looked back to see half obscured by smoke the huge banners in front of the tent on one of them masked arlecchino reached outward holding up his empty palms look revered audience nothing in my hands except that like a sleightofhand artist the character was holding something something hidden from view in a perfect backhand finger conceal and only malerick knew what it was the coy harlequin was holding death iii tipping the gaff sunday april to thursday april to be a great magician one must be able to present an illusion in such a way that people are not only puzzled but deeply moved s h sharp chapter fortysix amelia sachss camaro hit ninety on the west side highway speeding toward central park unlike the fdr drive which was a controlledaccess expressway the roadway here was dotted with stoplights and at fourteenth street it featured a jog that sent her misaligned chevrolet into an alarming skid resulting in a sparking kiss between sheet steel and concrete barriers so the killer had tricked them with yet another geniuss touch neither charles gradys death nor andrew constables escape was weirs goal they were the ultimate misdirections the killer had been after what theyd rejected yesterday as being too obvious the cirque fantastique as shed been about to kick in one of the few remaining hiding spots in the basement of the court and detention center glock high rhyme had called her and told her the situation lon sellitto and roland bell were headed for the circus mel cooper was jogging over there to help out bo haumann and several esu teams were on their way too everybody was needed and rhyme wanted her uptown as fast as possible im on my way shed said clicking the phone off shed turned and begun to sprint out of the basement but paused returned to the door shed been standing at and kicked it in anyway just in case itd been completely empty completely silent except for the sound of the killers derisive laughter in her imagination five minutes later she was in her camaro pedaldown the light at twentythird street was against her but the cross traffic wasnt too bad so she went through it fast relying on the steering wheel rather than her brakes or the conscience of citizens to yield to her flashing blue light to get her to the other side once through it a fast downshift pedal to the floor and the rattling engine sped her up to eighty her hand found her motorola and she called rhyme to tell him where she was and to ask what exactly he needed her to do malerick wandered slowly out of the park jostled by people running the opposite way toward the fire whats going on jesus the police did somebody call the police do you hear screaming do you hear that at the corner of central park west and a cross street he collided with a young asian woman staring in concern toward the park she asked you know what happened malerick thought yes indeed i do the man and the circus that destroyed my life are dying but he frowned and said to her gravely i dont know but it seems pretty serious he continued west beginning what would be a very circuitous half hour journey back to his apartment during which hed execute several quick changes and make absolutely certain no one was following him his plans called for him to stay at his apartment tonight then in the morning leave for europe where after several months of training hed resume performing under his new name not a soul on earth other than his revered audience knew malerick and thats who hed be to the public from now on he had one regret that he wouldnt be able to perform his favorite routine the burning mirror far too many people associated that with him in fact hed have to trim a lot of the material hed give up ventriloquism mentalism and many of the closein routines hed done having such a broad repertoire could as had happened this weekend tip the gaff as to his identity malerick continued to broadway then doubled back toward his apartment he continued to check the streets behind and around him he saw no one following he stepped inside the lobby and paused studied the street for a full five minutes an elderly man malerick recognized him as a neighbor from across the street walking his poodle a kid on rollerblades two teenage girls with icecream cones no one else the street was empty tomorrow was monday a work and school day people were now home ironing clothes helping their children with lessons and glued to the tv watching cnn reporting on the terrible tragedy in central park he hurried to his apartment doused all the lights and now the show closes revered audience as they always do but it is the nature of our art that whats old to todays audience will be fresh and inventive to those elsewhere tomorrow and the day after did you know my friends that curtain calls are not to thank the performer but are intended to give him a chance to thank his audience those people who were kind enough to lend him their attention during his show so i applaud you now for gracing me with your presence during these modest performances i hope ive given you excitement and joy i hope ive brought wonder to your hearts as you joined me in this netherworld where life is transformed to death death to life and the real to the unreal i bow to you revered audience he lit a candle and settled into the couch he kept his eyes fixed on the flame tonight he knew that it would shudder that he would receive a message staring sitting forward bathed in the contentment of vengeance completed rocking back and forth hypnotically breathing slowly the candle flickered yes speak to me flicker again and indeed only a moment later it did but the shuddering wasnt a message from the supernatural spirit of a loved one long gone but solely from the gust of cool april evening air that filled the room when the half dozen police officers in riot gear broke the door in with a battering ram they flung the gasping illusionist to the floor where one of them the redhaired policewoman he recalled from lincoln rhymes apartment seated a pistol against the back of his head and gave a steady recitation of his rights chapter fortyseven their arms trembling against the weight of both lincoln rhyme and his storm arrow wheelchair two sweating esu officers carried their burden up the stairs into the building and deposited the criminalist in the lobby he then took over and maneuvered his chair into the conjurers apartment where he parked next to amelia sachs while their fellow emergency service officers cleared the rooms rhyme watched as bell and sellitto carefully searched the astonished killer rhyme had suggested they borrow a doctor from the medical examiners office to help in the search he arrived a moment later and did as requested it turned out to be a good idea the m d found several slits cut into the mans skin they looked like small scars but could be pulled open inside were tiny metal tools xray him at the detention infirmary rhyme said hell wait do an mri every square inch when the conjurer was triple cuffed and double shackled two officers pulled the man into a sitting position on the floor the criminalist was examining a bedroom in which was a huge collection of magicians props and tools the masks fake hands and latex appliances made the place eerie sure but rhyme sensed mostly loneliness seeing these objects stored here for the killers horrific purposes when they were meant to be part of a show to entertain thousands of people how the conjurer whispered rhyme noted the look of astonishment dismay too the criminalist relished the sensation all hunters will tell you that the actual search for their quarry is the best part of the game but no hunter can be truly great unless he feels peak pleasure when he finally brings down his prey how did you figure it out the man repeated in his asthmatic wheeze that your point was to hit the circus rhyme glanced at sachs she said there wasnt a lot of evidence but it suggested suggested sachs id say it screamed suggested she continued unfazed by his interjection what you were really going to do in the closet the one in the basement of the criminal courts building we found the bag with your change of clothes in it the fake wound you found the bag she continued there was some dried red paint on the shoes and your suit and carpet fibers i thought the paint was fake blood rhyme shook his head angry with himself it was logical to make that assumption but i shouldve considered other sources it turned out that the fbis paint database identified it as jenkin manufacturing automotive paint the shade is an orangered thats used exclusively for emergency vehicles that particular formula is sold in small cans for touchups the fibers were automotive too they were from heavyduty commercial carpet installed in cmc ambulances up until eight years ago sachs so lincoln deduced that youd bought or stolen an old ambulance recently and fixed it up it mightve been for an escape or for another attempt on charles gradys life but then he remembered the bits of brass what if they actually were from a timer like wed thought originally and since youd used gas on the handkerchief in lincoln s apartment well that meant that possibly you were going to hide a gas bomb in a fake ambulance rhyme offered then i simply used logic he played a hunch is what hes sayin bell chided hunches rhyme snapped are nonsense logic isnt logic is the backbone of science and criminalistics is pure science sellitto rolled his eyes at bell but insubordination in the ranks wasnt going to dampen rhymes enthusiasm logic i was saying kara had told us about pointing your audiences attention toward where you dont want them to look the best illusionistsll rig the trick so well that theyll point directly at their method directly at what theyre really going to do but you wont believe them youll look in the opposite direction when that happens youve had it youve lost and theyve won thats what you did and i have to say it was a brilliant idea not a compliment i give very often is it sachs you wanted revenge against kadesky for the fire that ruined your life and so you created a routine thatd let you do it and get away afterward just like youd create an illusion for the stage with layers of misdirections rhyme squinted in consideration he said the first misdirection you forced kara told us thats the word illusionists use right the killer said nothing im sure thats what she said first you forced the thought on us that you were going to destroy the circus for revenge but i didnt believe it too obvious and our suspicion led to misdirection two you planted the newspaper article about grady the restaurant receipt the press pass and the hotel key to make us conclude you were going to kill him oh the jogging jacket by the hudson river you were going to leave that at the scene intentionally werent you that was planted evidence you wanted us to find the conjurer nodded i was yes but it worked out better because your officers surprised me and it looked more natural for me to leave the jacket when i escaped now at that point the criminalist continued we think youre a hired assassin using illusion to get close to charles grady and kill him weve figured you out there go our suspicions to an extent the conjurer managed a faint smile an extent he wheezed see when you use misdirection to trick people smart people they continue to be suspicious so you hit us with misdirection number three to keep us focused away from the circus you made us think that you got arrested intentionally to get inside the detention center not to kill grady but to break constable out of jail by then wed forgotten completely about the circus and kadesky but in fact you didnt care a bit about either constable or grady they were props misdirections to fool you he admitted the patriot assembly theyre not going to be too happy about that sellitto muttered a nod at the shackles id say thats the least of my worries wouldnt you knowing what he did about constable and the others in the assembly rhyme wasnt too sure bell nodded at the conjurer and asked rhyme but whyd he go to the trouble to set up constable and plan the fake escape sellitto answered obviously to you know misdirect us away from the circus so hed have an easier time getting the bomb there actually no lon rhyme said slowly there was another reason at these words or perhaps at the cryptic tone in rhymes voice the killer turned toward the criminalist who could see caution in his eyes real caution if not fear for the first time that night gotcha rhyme thought he said see there was a fourth misdirection four sellitto said thats right hes not erick weir rhyme announced with what even he had to admit was excessive dramatics chapter fortyeight with a sigh the killer eased back against a chair leg eyes closing not weir sellitto asked that rhyme continued was the whole point of what he did this weekend he wanted revenge against kadesky and the hasbro circus the cirque fantastique now well its easy to get revenge if you dont care about escaping but a nod toward the conjurer he wanted to get away stay out of prison keep performing so he did an identity quick change he became erick weir got himself arrested this afternoon fingerprinted and then escaped sellitto nodded so after he killed kadesky and burned down the circus everybodyd be looking for weir and not for who he really is a frown and who the hell is he arthur loesser weirs protégé the killer gasped softly as the last shred of anonymity and hope for escape vanished but loesser called us sellitto pointed out he was out west in nevada no he wasnt i checked the phone records the call came up no caller id on my phone because he placed it through a prepaid longdistance account he was calling from a pay phone on west eightyseventh street he doesnt have a wife the message on his voice mail in vegas was fake just like he called the other assistant keating and pretended to be weir right sellitto asked yep asking about the ohio fire sounding weird and threatening to back up what we thought that weir was in new york to get revenge against kadesky he had to leave a trail that weird resurfaced like ordering the darby handcuffs in weirs name the gun he bought too rhyme looked over the killer hows the voice he asked sardonically the lungs feel better now you know theyre fine loesser snapped the whisper and wheezing were gone there was no damage to his lungs it was just another ruse to make them believe he was weir rhyme nodded toward the bedroom i saw some designs for promotional posters in there i assume you drew them the name on them was malerick thats you now right the killer nodded what i told you before is true i hated my old name i hate anything about me from before the fire it was too hard to be reminded of those times malericks how i think of myself now how did you catch on after they sealed the corridor in detention you used your shirt and wiped the floor and the cuffs rhyme explained but when i thought about that i couldnt figure out why to clean up the blood that didnt make sense no the only answer i could come up with was that you wanted to get rid of your fingerprints but youd just been printed why would you be worried about leaving them in the corridor rhyme gave a shrug suggesting that the answer was painfully obvious because your real prints were different from the ones on the card thatd just been rolled and filed how the fuck dhe manage that sellitto asked amelia found traces of fresh ink at the scene that was from his being printed tonight the trace wasnt important in itself but what was significant was that it matched the ink we found in his gym bag at the marston assault that meant hed come in contact with fingerprint ink before today i guessed that he stole a blank fingerprint card and printed it at home with the real erick weirs prints he used that adhesive wax to hide it in his jacket lining tonight we were looking for weapons and keys not pieces of cardboard and then after they rolled his prints he distracted the technicians and swapped the cards probably flushed the new one or threw it out loesser grimaced in anger a confirmation of rhymes deduction doc sent over the card they had on file and mel processed it the rolled prints were weirs but the latents were loessers he was in the apis database from when he was arrested with weir on those reckless endangerment charges in new jersey we checked the doc officers glock too she took that with her and he didnt get a chance to wipe it down those prints came back a match for loesser too oh and we got a partial from the razor knife blade rhyme glanced at the small bandage on loessers temple you forgot to take that with you i couldnt find it the killer snapped i didnt have time to look but sellitto pointed out to rhyme hed be younger than weir he is younger than weir he nodded toward loessers face the wrinklesre just latex appliances like the scars theyre all fake weir was born in loessers twenty years younger so he had to age then he muttered oh i missed that one shouldve thought better those bits of latex covered with makeup that amelia found at the scenes i assumed they were from those finger pads he was wearing but that wouldnt make sense nobodyd wear makeup on his fingers it would come off no it was from the other appliances rhyme examined the killers cheeks and brow the latex must be uncomfortable you get used to it sachs lets see what he really looks like with some difficulty she peeled off the beard and patches of wrinkles around his eyes and chin the resulting face was blotchy from the adhesive but yes he was clearly much younger the structure of his face was different too he didnt look much at all like the man hed been not like those masks in mission impossible hm put em on pull em off no real appliances arent like that at all the fingers too rhyme nodded at the killers left hand to make the fusing of the fingers credible theyd been bound together with a bandage then covered in thick latex as a result the two digits were wrinkled limp and virtually white but of course they were otherwise normal sachs examined them i was just asking rhyme why you didnt uncover them at the street fair since we were looking for a man with a deformed left hand but the two digits had their own appearance of deformity and wouldve given him away rhyme looked the killer over and said pretty close to a perfect crime a perp who made certain that we charged somebody else wed know weir was guilty wed have positive id but then hed disappear loesser would go on with his life and the escapee weir would be gone forever the vanished man and even though loesser had picked the victims yesterday to misdirect the police not out of any deep psychological urge nonetheless terry dobynss ultimate diagnosis fit perfectly seeking revenge for the fire that had destroyed a loved one the difference was that the tragedy hadnt been weirs loss of his career and the death of his wife it had been loessers loss of his mentor weir himself but theres one problem sellitto pointed out all he did by swapping the print cards was make sure wed go after the real weir why would he do that to his mentor rhyme said why do you think i made those strapping young officers carry me up the stairs into this extremely inaccessible place lon he looked around the room i wanted to walk the grid myself oh excuse me i should say roll the grid he now wheeled through the room expertly using the touchpad controller he stopped by the fireplace and glanced up i think ive found our perp lon he looked up at the mantel on which sat an inlaid box and a candle thats erick weir right his ashes loesser said softly thats right he knew he didnt have much time left he wanted to get out of the burn unit in ohio and go back to his house in vegas before he died i snuck him out one night and drove him home he lived another few weeks after we got there i bribed a nightshift operator at a mortuary to cremate him and the fingerprints rhyme asked you rolled his prints after he died had stamps made so you could do the fake fingerprint card a nod so youve been planning this for years passionately loesser said yes his death its like a burn that doesnt stop hurting bell asked you risked all of this for revenge for your boss boss he was more than my boss loesser spat out madly you dont understand i think about my father a couple times a year and hes still alive i think about mr weir every hour of the day ever since he came into the shop in vegas where i was performing young houdini that was me i was fourteen then what a day that was he told me he was going to give me the vision to be great on my fifteenth birthday i ran away from home to travel with him his voice wavered for a moment and fell silent he continued mr weir mayve beat me and screamed at me and made my life hell sometimes but he saw what was inside me he cared for me he taught me how to be an illusionist a cloud filled the mans face and then he was taken away from me because of kadesky he and that fucking business of his killed mr weir and me too arthur loesser died in that fire he looked at the box and on his face there was an expression of sorrow and hope and such odd love that rhyme felt a chill crawl down his neck until it disappeared into his numb body loesser looked back to rhyme and gave a cold laugh well you mayve caught me but mr weir and i won you didnt stop us in time the circus is gone kadeskys gone and if he isnt dead himself his careers over ah yes the cirque fantastique the fire rhyme shook his head gravely then he added still loesser frowned sweeping the room with his eyes trying to nab rhymes meaning what whatre you saying think back a little earlier tonight youre in central park watching the flames the smoke the destruction listening to the screams you figure you better leave well be looking for you soon youre on your way back here someone a young woman an asian woman in a jogging suit bumps into you you exchange a few words about whats going on you go your separate ways what the hellre you talking about loesser snapped check the back of your watchband rhyme said with a clink of the cuffs he turned his wrist over on the band was a small black disk sachs peeled it off gps tracker we used that to follow you here werent you a little surprised that we just showed up aknockin on your door but who wait it was that illusionist that girl kara i didnt recognize her rhyme said wryly well that is the whole point of illusion now isnt it we spotted you in the park but we were afraid youd get away you do have a tendency to do that you know and we assumed youd take a complicated route back to where you were staying so i asked kara to do a little disguise of her own shes good that woman hardly recognized her myself when she bumped into you she taped the sensor to your watch sachs continued we mightve been able to take you down on the street but youve been just a little too good at escaping anyway we wanted to find your hideyhole but that means you knew before the fire oh rhyme said dismissively your ambulance the bomb squad found it and rendered safe in about sixty seconds they drove it off and replaced it with another one so you wouldnt think wed caught on we knew youd want to watch the fire we got as many undercover officers as we could into the park looking for a male about your build whod watch the fire but then whod leave not long after it started a couple of them saw you and we had kara nail you with the chip and presto rhyme smiled at his choice of word here we are but the fire i saw it rhyme said to sachs see what i keep saying about evidence versus witnesses he saw the fire therefore it had to be real to loesser he said but it wasnt real now was it sachs said what you saw was smoke from a couple of national guard smoke grenades we mounted on the top of the tent with a crane the flames from a propane burner at the stage door where the ambulance was then they backlit a couple more burners in the ring and projected the shadows of the flames onto the side of the tent i heard screams loesser whispered oh that was karas idea she thought we could have kadesky tell the audience they were taking an intermission from the show so a movie studio could shoot a scene in the tent about a fire in a circus he had everybody start screaming on cue they loved it they got to be extras no the conjurer whispered it was an illusion rhyme said to him it was all an illusion some sleight of mind from the immobilized man i better run the scene here sachs said nodding around the room and frowning sure sure sachs what was i thinking of here we are sitting around chatting and contaminating a crime scene with multiple cuffs and shackles binding him and an officer on either side the killer was led out the door far less cocky than the last time hed been led down to detention as two esu officers were about to schlepp rhyme outside once more lon sellittos phone rang he took the call shes right here a glance at sachs you want to talk to her then he shook his head at her and continued to listen looking grave okay ill tell her he hung up that was marlow he said to sachs the head of patrol services what was up the criminalist wondered seeing the troubled look on sellittos face the rumpled detective continued speaking to sachs he wants you downtown tomorrow at ten a m its about your promotion sellitto then frowned there was something else he wanted me to tell you something about your score on the test what was it he shook his head stared at the ceiling clearly troubled what was it sachs looked on impassively though rhyme observed a fingernail make a brief assault on the cuticle of her thumb then the detective snapped his fingers oh yeah now i remember he said you got the third highest score in the history of the department a frown filled his face and he looked at rhyme you know what this means dontcha christ have mercy now therell be no living with her jogging breathless the corridor was a mile long kara sprinted along the gray linoleum with only one thing in her mind not the late erick weir or his psychotic assistant art loesser not the brilliance of the fire illusion at the cirque fantastique no all she thought was am i in time down the dim corridor footsteps pounding on the floor past doorways closed and doorways open hearing bits of tv and music hearing farewell conversation as families prepared to leave at the end of sunday visiting hours hearing her own hollow footsteps she paused outside the room inhaled a dozen deep breaths to steady her voice and more nervous than shed ever been going onstage stepped into the room a pause then hi mum her mother turned away from the tv she blinked in surprise and smiled why look who it is hello dear oh my god kara thought looking at the bright eyes shes back shes really back she walked over and hugged the woman then pulled the chair closer how are you fine little chilly tonight ill close the window kara rose and pulled it shut i thought you werent going to make it honey busy night ill have to tell you what ive been up to mum you wont believe it i cant wait excitedly kara asked you want some tea or something she felt a fierce urgency to pour out all the details of her life in the past six months to ramble but she told herself to slow down gushing she sensed could easily overwhelm her mother who seemed immensely fragile at the moment nope not a thing dear could you shut the tv off id rather visit with you theres that control i can never get it to work sometimes i almost think somebody sneaks in and changes the buttons im glad i got here before you went to bed i wouldve stayed up to visit with you kara gave her a smile her mother then said i was just thinking about your uncle honey my brother kara nodded her mothers late brother was the black sheep of the family hed gone out west when kara was young and never kept in touch with the family karas mother and grandparents had refused to talk about him and his name was verboten at family gatherings but of course the rumors flew he was gay he was straight and married but hed had an affair with a roma gypsy hed shot a man over another woman hed never married and was an alcoholic jazz musician karad always wanted to learn the truth about him what about him mum you want to hear oh you bet tell me some stories she now asked leaning forward and resting her hand on the womans arm well lets see when would itve been id guess may of seventy maybe seventyone not sure of the year thats my mind for you but i know it was may your uncle and some of his army buddies had come back from vietnam he was a soldier i never knew that oh he looked very handsome in his uniform well they had a terrible time over there her voice grew serious your uncles best friend was killed right next to him died in his arms a big black fellow well tom and another soldier got it into their heads that theyd like to start a business to help their dead friends family so what they did was they went down south and bought a boat can you imagine your uncle on a boat i thought it was the strangest thing ever they started a shrimp business tom made a fortune mum kara said softly her mother smiled at some memory and shook her head a boat well the company was very successful and people were surprised because well tom never seemed too bright her mothers eyes sparkled but you know what he used to say to them what mum stupid is as stupid does thats a good expression kara whispered oh you wouldve loved that man jenny did you know he met the president of the united states once and played pingpong in china not noticing her daughters quiet crying the old woman continued to tell kara the rest of the story of forrest gump the movie that shed been watching on tv a few moments before karas uncles name was gil but in her mothers fantasy he was tom presumably after the films star tom hanks kara herself had become jenny forrests girlfriend no no no kara thought in despair i didnt make it in time after all her mothers soul had come and gone leaving in its place only illusion the womans narrative became a garbled stream that moved from the shrimp boat in the gulf to a swordfish boat in the north atlantic caught in something called a perfect storm to an ocean liner sinking while her brother in tuxedo played the violin on deck thoughts memories and images from a dozen other movies or books joined real memories soon karas uncle as well as all semblance of coherence vanished completely its somewhere outside the old woman said with finality i know its outside she closed her eyes kara sat forward in her chair gently resting her hand on her mothers smooth arm until the old woman was asleep thinking but she had been in her right mind earlier jaynene wouldntve paged her if she hadnt and if it happened once she thought defiantly it could happen again finally kara rose and walked out into the dark corridor reflecting that as talented a performer as she might be she lacked the one skill she so desperately wanted to magically transport her mother to that place where hearts stoked with the fuel of affection burn warmly for all the years god assigned them where minds retain perfectly every chapter in the rich histories of families where the apparent gulfs between loved ones turn out to be in the end nothing more than effects temporary illusions chapter fortynine gerald marlow a man with thick vitaliscrisp hair was head of the nypds patrol services division his deliberate manner had been forged walking a beat for twenty years and tempered by spending another fifteen at the farriskier job of supervising officers who walked similar beats now monday morning amelia sachs stood more or less at attention in front of him willing her knees to ignore the arthritis that dug switchblades into them they were in marlows corner office high up in the big building one police plaza downtown marlow glanced up from the file hed been reading and eyed her impeccably pressed blue navies oh sit down officer sorry sit down so herman sachss daughter sitting she noted a faint hesitation between the last two words of his sentence had the word girl been quickly replaced thats right i was at the funeral i remember it was a good one as funerals go eyes on hers posture upright marlow said okay officer here it is youre in some trouble it hit her like a physical blow im sorry sir a crime scene on saturday by the harlem river car went into the water you ran it where the conjurers mazda took out crackhead carloss shack and went for a swim yes thats right you placed somebody under arrest at the scene marlow said oh that not really arrest this guy went under the tape and was digging around in a sealed area i had him escorted out and detained detained arrested the point is he was in custody for a while sure i needed him out of my hair it was an active scene sachs was starting to get her bearings the obnoxious citizen had complained happened every day nobody paid attention to crap like that she began to relax well the guy he was victor ramos yeah i think he told me that congressman victor ramos the relaxation vanished the captain opened a new york daily news lets see lets see all here he lifted the paper and held up a centerfold which featured a large picture of the man in cuffs at the scene the headline read timeout for victor you told the officers on the scene to put him in timeout he was did you i believe i did sir yes marlow offered he claimed he was looking for survivors survivors she barked laughing it was a tenbyten squatters shack that got clipped when the perps car went into the river part of a wall fell over and youre getting a little hot here officer and i think a bag of goddamn empties got ripped open that was the only damage ems cleared the shack and i sealed it the only living things left to rescue in that place were the lice uhhuh marlow said evenly uneasy with her temper he said he was simply making sure anybody living there was safe she added with uncontrolled irony the home owners walked out on their own nobody was hurt though i understand one of them later got a bruised cheek when he resisted arrest arrest he tried to steal a firemans flashlight and then urinated on him oh brother she muttered they were unharmed they were stoned and they were assholes and those were the citizens ramos was worried about the captains grimace containing shreds of both caution and sympathy faded the emotion was replaced by his rubbery bureaucratic façade do you know for a fact that there was any evidence ramos destroyed that wouldve been relevant to collaring the suspect whether there was or not doesnt make a bit of difference sir its the procedure thats important she was struggling to keep calm keep the edge out of her voice marlow was after all her bosss bosss boss trying to work things out here officer sachs he said sternly then repeated do you know for a fact that evidence was destroyed she sighed no so his being in the scene was irrelevant i irrelevant yessir she cleared her throat we were after a cop killer captain does that count for anything she asked bitterly to me to a lot of people yeah to ramos no she nodded okay what kind of firestormre we talking there were tv crews there officer you watch the news that night nup she thought i was pretty busy trying to collar a murderer sachs chose a different answer no sir well ramos was prominently featured being led off in cuffs she said you know the only reason he was in the scene in the first place was to be filmed risking his goddamn life to look for survivors im curious sir ramos running for reelection any time soon even confirming comments like that can get you early retirement or no retirement at all marlow said nothing whats the bottom line marlows lips tightened im sorry officer youve washed out ramos checked on you found out about the sergeants exam he pulled strings he got you flunked he did what flunked he talked to the examining officers i had the third highest exam in the history of the department she said laughing bitterly isnt that right yes on the multiple choice and the orals but you need to pass the assessment exercise too i did fine on it the preliminary results were good but in the final report you flunked impossible what happened one of the officers in the exercise wouldnt pass you wouldnt pass me but i her voice faded as she pictured the handsome officer with the shotgun stepping out from behind the dumpster the man shed snubbed bang bang the captain read from a piece of paper he said you didnt quote display proper respect for individuals in a supervisory position and she exhibited disrespectful behavior with regard to peers leading to situations of endangerment so ramos tracked down somebody willing to dime me out and fed him those lines im sorry captain but you really think a street cop talks that way situations of endangerment come on well pop she thought to her father hows this for sticking in the craw feeling heartsick then she looked carefully at marlow what else sir there is something else isnt there to his credit he held her eye as he said yes officer there is it gets worse im afraid lets hear how exactly it could be worse pop ramos is trying to get you suspended suspended thats bullshit he wants an inquest vindictive the prick didnt get spoken as she saw in marlows gaze the reminder that it was this sort of attitude that had gotten her into trouble in the first place he added i have to tell you that hes mad enough to well hes going for suspension without pay this punishment was usually reserved for officers accused of crimes why marlow didnt answer but he didnt need to of course sachs knew to bolster his credibility ramos had to show that the timeout woman whod embarrassed him was a loose cannon and the other reason was that he was a vindictive prick whatd the grounds be insubordination incompetence i cant lose my shield sir trying not to sound desperate theres nothing i can do about your flunking the exam amelia thats in the boards hands and theyve already made their decision but ill fight the suspension i cant promise anything though ramoss got wire all over the city a hand rose into her scalp she scratched until she felt pain lowered her hand feeling slick blood can i speak freely sir marlow slumped slightly in his chair jesus officer sure you have to know i feel bad about this say what you want and you dont have to sit at attention were not the army you know sachs cleared her throat if he tries for suspension sir my next callll be to the pba lawyers ill light this one up ill take it as far as i have to and she would though she knew how nonrank cops who fought discrimination or suspensions through the patrolmens benevolent association were unofficially redflagged many of them found their careers permanently sidetracked even if they won technical victories marlow held her steady gaze as he said noted officer so it was knuckle time her fathers expression about being a cop amie you have to understand sometimes its a rush sometimes you get to make a difference sometimes its boring and sometimes not too often thank god its knuckle time fist to fist youre all by your lonesome with nobody to help you and i dont mean just the perps sometimes itll be you against your boss sometimes against their bosses could be you against your buddies too you gonna be a cop you got to be ready to go it alone theres no getting around it well for the time being youre still on active duty yessir when will i know a day or two walking toward the door she stopped turned back sir marlow glanced up as if he was surprised she was still there ramos was in the middle of my crime scene if itd been you there or the mayor or the president himself i wouldve done exactly the same thing thats why youre your fathers daughter officer and why hed be proud of you marlow lifted his phone off the cradle well hope for the best chapter fifty thom let lon sellitto into the front hallway where lincoln rhyme sat in his candyapple red chair grumbling at construction workers to mind the woodwork as they carted refuse downstairs from the repair work currently going on in his firedamaged bedroom passing by on his way to the kitchen to fix lunch thom grumbled back leave em alone lincoln you couldnt care less about the woodwork its the principle the criminalist replied tautly its my woodwork and their clumsiness hes always this way when a cases over the aide said to sellitto have you got some really thorny robbery or murder for him a good pacifier i dont need a pacifier rhyme snapped as the aide vanished i need people to be careful with the walls sellitto said hey linc weve got to talk the criminalist noted the tone and the look in sellittos eyes theyd been working together for years and he could read every emotion the cop broadcast especially when he was troubled what now he wondered just heard from the head of patrol its about amelia sellitto cleared his throat rhymes heart undoubtedly gave an extra slam in his chest he never felt it of course though he did sense a surge of blood in his neck and head and face thinking bullet car crash he said evenly in a low voice go on she washed out the sergeants exam what yup rhymes hot relief turned instantly to sorrow for her the detective continued its not official yet but i know whered you hear cop radar a fucking bird i dont know sachss a star when something like this happens word gets out what about her score on the exam despite her score on the exam rhyme wheeled into the lab the detective looking particularly rumpled today followed the explanation was pure sachs it turned out shed ordered somebody out of an active crime scene and when he wouldnt leave had him cuffed bad for her the guy turned out to be victor ramos the congressman lincoln rhyme had virtually no interest in local government but he knew about ramos an opportunistic politico whod abandoned his latino constituents in spanish harlem until recently now that the politically correct climate and size of the electorate meant he could push for albany or a spot in washington can they wash her out come on linc they can do what they fucking want theyre even talking suspension she can fight it she will fight it and you know what happens to street cops who take on brass oddsre even if she wins theyll send her to east new york hell even worse theyll send her to a desk in east new york fuck the criminalist spat out sellitto paced around the room stepping over cables and glancing at the conjurer case whiteboards the detective dropped into a chair that creaked under his weight he kneaded a roll of fat around his waistband the conjurer case had seriously sidetracked his diet one thing he said softly a whiff of conspiracy in his voice yeah theres this guy i know he was the one cleaned up the eighteen when all that crack and smack kept disappearing from the evidence locker a few years ago yeah that was it hes got serious wire all over the big building the commissionerll listen to him and hell listen to me he owes me then he waved his arm toward the conjurer case evidence boards and fuck lookit what we just did we nailed one hell of a doer lemme give him a call pull some strings for her and rhymes eyes too took in the charts then the equipment the examining tables books all devoted to the science of analyzing the evidence that sachs had teased or muscled out of crime scenes over the past few years theyd been together i dont know he said whatsa problem if she made sergeant that way well she wouldnt be the one making it the detective replied you know what this promotion means to her linc yeah he did look all were doing is playing by ramoss rules he wants to take it down a notch well do the same make it a you know even playing field sellitto liked his idea he added ameliall never find out ill tell my guy to keep the lid on it hell do it you know what this promotion means to her so what do you think the detective asked rhyme said nothing for a moment looking for the answer in the silent forensic equipment surrounding him and then in the green mist of spring buds crowning the trees in central park the scuffs on the woodwork had been scrubbed away and all traces of the fire in the bedroom had been vanished as thom had put it rather cleverly rhyme thought a rich scent of smoke lingered but that reminded lincoln rhyme of good scotch and was therefore not a problem at all now midnight the room dark rhyme lay in his flexicair bed staring out the window outside was a flutter of motion as a falcon one of gods most fluid creatures landed on the ledge depending on the light and their degree of alertness the birds seemed to shrink or grow in size tonight they seemed larger than in the daylight their forms magnificent menacing too they werent pleased with the noises radiating from the cirque fantastique in central park well rhyme wasnt very happy about them either hed dozed off ten minutes ago only to be awakened by a loud burst of applause from the tent they should have a curfew on that rhyme grumbled to sachs lying beside him in bed i could shoot out their generator she replied her voice clear she apparently hadnt gotten to sleep at all her head was on the pillow next to his lips against his neck on which he could feel the faint tickle of her hair and the smooth cool plane of her skin also her breasts against his chest belly to hip leg over leg he knew this only by observation of course there was no sensate proof of the contact he relished that closeness all the same sachs always adhered to rhymes firm rule that those walking the grid not wear scent because they might miss olfactory evidence at crime scenes but she was off duty at the moment and he detected on her skin a pleasant complex smell which he deduced to be jasmine gardenia and synthetic motor oil they were alone in the apartment theyd shipped thom off to the movies with his friend peter and had spent the night with some new cds two ounces of sevruga caviar ritz crackers and copious moet despite the inherent difficulties in drinking champagne through a straw now in the darkness he was thinking again about music about how such a purely mechanical system of tones and pacing could consume you so completely it fascinated him the more he thought about it the more he decided that the subject might not be as mysterious as it seemed music was after all firmly rooted in his world science logic and mathematics how would one go about writing a melody if the physical therapy exercises he was doing now eventually had some effect could he actually press his fingers on a keyboard as he was considering this he noticed sachs looking up at his face in the dim light you heard about the sergeants exam she asked a hesitation then yep he replied hed scrupulously avoided bringing up the matter all night when sachs was prepared to discuss something she would until then the subject didnt exist you know what happened she asked not all the details i assume it falls into the category of a quasicorrupt selfinterested government official versus the overworked heroic crimescene cop something like that a laugh pretty much ive been there myself sachs the music from the circus kept thudding away engendering mixed responses somehow you felt you should be irritated that it was intruding but you couldnt resist enjoying the beat she then asked did lon talk to you about pulling some strings for me making calls to city hall ameliall never find out ill tell my guy to keep the lid on it he chuckled he did yeah you know lon the music stopped then applause filled the night the faint yet evocative sound of the mcs voice followed she said i heard he couldve made the whole thing go away bypassed ramos probably hes got a long reach sachs asked and whatd you say about that what do you think im asking rhyme said i said no i wouldnt let him do it you wouldnt no i told him youd make rank on your own or not at all goddamn she muttered he looked down at her momentarily alarmed had he misjudged her im pissed at lon for even considering it he meant well he believed that her arm around his chest gripped him tighter what you told him rhyme that means more to me than anything i know that it could get ugly ramoss going for suspension twelve months off duty no pay i dont know what ill do youll consult with me a civilian cant walk the grid rhyme i have to sit still ill go crazy when you move they cant getcha well get through it love you she whispered his response was to inhale her flowery quaker state scent and tell her that he loved her too man its too bright she looked toward the window filled with glare from the circus spotlights wherere the shades burned up remember i thought thom got some new ones he started to put them up but he was fussing too much measuring and everything i threw him out and told him to do it later sachs slipped out of bed and found an extra sheet draped it over the window cutting out much of the light she returned to bed curled up against him and was soon asleep but not lincoln rhyme as he lay listening to the music and the cryptic voice of the mc some ideas began to form in his mind and the opportunity for sleep came and went soon he was completely awake lost in his thoughts which were not surprisingly about the circus late the next morning thom walked into the bedroom to find that rhyme had a visitor hi he said to jaynene williams sitting in one of the new chairs beside his bed thom she shook his hand the aide whod been out shopping was clearly surprised to see someone there thanks to the computer the environmental control units and cctv rhyme was of course perfectly capable of calling someone up inviting them over and letting them inside when they arrived no need to look so shocked rhyme said caustically i have invited people over before you know blue moon comes to mind maybe ill hire jaynene here to replace you why dont you hire her as well as me with two people here we could share the abuse he smiled at her i wouldnt do that to you though ive handled worse are you a coffee lady or a tea lady rhyme said sorry where were my manners shouldve had the pot boiling by now coffeell do scotch for me rhyme said when thom glanced at the clock the criminalist added a small shot for medicinal purposes coffee all around the aide said and disappeared after hed gone rhyme and jaynene made small talk about spinal cord injury patients and the exercises he was now pursuing fanatically then impatient as ever rhyme decided hed been the polite host long enough and lowered his voice to say theres a problem something bothering me i think you can help im hoping you can she eyed him cautiously maybe could you close the door the large woman glanced at it rose and then did as he asked she returned to her seat how long have you known kara he asked kara little over a year ever since her mother came to stuyvesant thats an expensive place isnt it painfully jaynene said terrible what they charge but all of the places like ours the feesre pretty much the same does her mother have insurance medicare is all kara pays for most of it herself she added as best she can shes current now but shes in arrears a lot of the time rhyme nodded slowly im going to ask you one more question think about it before you answer and i need you to be completely honest well the nurse said uncertainly looking down at the newly varnished floor ill do the best i can that afternoon roland bell was in rhymes living room to the soundtrack of some enticing dave brubeck jazz piano they were talking about the evidence in the andrew constable case charles grady and the states attorney general himself had decided to delay the mans trial in order to include additional charges against the bigot attempted murder of his own lawyer conspiracy to commit murder and felony murder it wouldnt be an easy case linking constable to barnes and the other conspirators in the patriot assembly but if anyone could bring in convictions grady was the man to do it he was also going for the death penalty against arthur loesser for the murder of patrol officer larry burke whose body had been found in an alley on the upper west side lon sellitto was presently at the officers fulldress funeral in queens amelia sachs now walked through the doorway looking frazzled after an allday meeting with lawyers arranged through the patrolmens benevolent association about her possible suspension she was supposed to have been back hours ago and glancing at her face rhyme deduced that the results of the session were not good he himself had some news about his meeting with jaynene and what had happened after that and had tried to reach her but had been unable to now though there was no time to brief her because another visitor appeared thom ushered edward kadesky into the room mr rhyme he said nodding hed forgotten sachss name but he gave her a second nod in greeting he shook roland bells hand i got your message it said theres something more about the case rhyme nodded this morning i did some digging looking into a few loose ends what loose ends sachs asked ends i didnt know were loose unknown loose ends she frowned the producer too looked troubled weirs assistant loesser he hasnt escaped has he no no hes still in detention the doorbell rang thom vanished and a moment later kara stepped through the doorway into the room she looked around ruffling her short hair which had lost its purple sheen and was now ruddy as a freckle hi she said to the group blinking in surprise when she saw kadesky can i get anybody anything thom asked maybe if you could leave us for a minute thom please the aide glanced at rhyme and hearing the firm troubled tone in his voice nodded and left the room the criminalist said to kara thanks for coming by i just need to follow up on a few things about the case sure she said loose ends rhyme explained i want to know a few more details about the night that the conjurer drove the ambulance bomb into the circus the young woman nodded flicking her black fingernails against one another anything i can do to help id be glad to the show was scheduled to start at eight wasnt it rhyme asked kadesky thats right you werent back from your dinner and radio interview yet when loesser parked the ambulance in the doorway no i wasnt rhyme turned to kara but you were there yeah i saw the ambulance drive in i didnt think anything about it at the time where did loesser park exactly it was under the box seat scaffolding she said not under the expensive seats though rhyme asked kadesky no the man said so it was near the main fire exit the one most people would use in an evacuation thats right bell asked lincoln whatre you getting at what im getting at is loesser parked the ambulance so that it would do the most damage and yet still give a few people in the box seats a chance to escape how did he know exactly where to park it i dont know the producer responded he probably checked it out ahead of time and saw it was the best location i mean best from his point of view worst for us he mightve checked it out earlier rhyme mused but he also would be reluctant to be seen doing reconnaissance around the circus since we had officers stationed there true so isnt it possible that someone on the inside mightve told him to park there inside kadesky asked frowning are you saying somebody was helping him no none of my people would do that rhyme sachs said what are you getting at he ignored her and turned again to kara i asked you to go to the tent to find mr kadesky about when i guess it was about sevenfifteen and you were in the box seat area she nodded and he continued near the exit row the woman looked around the room awkwardly i guess yeah i was she looked at sachs whys he asking me all this whats going on rhyme answered im asking because i remembered something you told us kara about people whore involved in an illusionists act theres the assistant the person that we know is working with the illusionist then theres the volunteer from the audience then theres someone else the confederate thosere people who are actually working with the magician but seem to have nothing to do with him they pretend to be stagehands or volunteers kadesky said right lots of magicians use confederates rhyme turned to kara and said sharply which is what youve been all along havent you whats that bell asked his drawl more pronounced in his surprise the young woman gasped shaking her head shes been working with loesser from the beginning rhyme said to sachs no kadesky said her rhyme continued she needs money badly and loesser paid her fifty thousand to help him desperate kara said but loesser and i never even met before today you didnt need to see him in person balzac was the intermediary he was in on it too kara sachs whispered no i dont believe it she wouldnt do that wouldnt she what do you know about her do you even know her real name i sachss troubled eyes turned toward the young woman no she whispered she never told me tearfully the young woman shook her head finally she said amelia im so sorry but you dont understand mr balzac and weir were friends they performed together for years and he was devastated when weir died in the fire loesser told mr balzac what he was going to do and they forced me to help him but you have to believe me i didnt know they were going to hurt anybody mr balzac said it was just an extortion thing to get even with mr kadesky by the time i realized loesser was killing people it was too late they said if i didnt keep helping him he was going to give my name to the police id go to jail forever mr balzac would too she wiped her face i couldnt do that to him to your revered mentor rhyme said bitterly with a look of panic in her brilliant blue eyes the young woman shoved her way through sachs and kadesky and leaped for the door stop her roland rhyme shouted bell sprinted forward and tackled her they tumbled into the corner of the room she was strong but bell managed to cuff her he rose panting from the effort and pulled his motorola off his belt calling in for a prisoner transfer down to detention looking disgusted he put the radio away and read kara her rights rhyme sighed i tried to tell you earlier sachs i couldnt get through on the phone i wish it werent true but there you have it she and balzac were with loesser all along they gulled us like we were their audience chapter fiftyone whispering the policewoman said i just i dont see how she did it rhyme said to bell she manipulated the evidence lied to us planted fake clues roland go over to the whiteboards ill show you kara planted evidence sachs asked astonished oh you bet she did and she did a damn good job too from the first scene even before you found her you told me that she gave you that sign to meet her in the coffee shop they set it up from the beginning bell was at the whiteboards and as he pointed out items of evidence rhyme would explain how kara had tricked them a moment later thom called theres an officer here show em in rhyme said a policewoman walked through the doorway and joined sachs bell and kadesky surveying them through stylish glasses with a look of curiosity on her face she nodded to rhyme and in a hispanic accent asked bell you called for prisoner transport detective bell nodded to the corner of the room shes over there i mirandized her the woman glanced toward the corner of the room at karas prone form and said okay ill take her downtown she hesitated but i got a question first question rhyme asked frowning whatre you talking about officer bell asked ignoring the detective the officer sized up kadesky could i see some identification sir me the producer asked yessir ill need to see your drivers license you want my id again i did that the other day sir please huffily the man reached into his hip pocket and withdrew his wallet except that it wasnt his he stared at a battered zebraskin billfold wait i i dont know what this is its not yours the cop asked no he said troubled he began patting his pockets i dont know see thats what i was afraid of the policewoman said im sorry sir youre under arrest for pickpocketing you have the right to remain silent this is bullshit kadesky muttered theres some mistake he opened up the wallet and stared at it for a moment then he barked an astonished laugh held up the drivers license for everyone to see it was karas there was a handwritten note inside it dropped out he picked it up it says gotcha kadesky said narrowing his eyes and studying the policewoman closely then the drivers license wait is this you the officer laughed and removed the glasses then her cop cap and the brunette wig beneath it revealing the short reddish hair once again with a towel that roland bell now chuckling hard handed her she wiped the darkcomplexion makeup off her face and peeled away the thick eyebrows and the fake red nails covering the black glossy ones she then took her wallet back from the hands of the astonished edward kadesky and handed him his which shed dipped when shed plowed into him and sachs in her escape toward the door sachs was shaking her head too astonished to react she and kadesky were both staring at the body lying on the floor the young illusionist walked into the corner and lifted the device a lightweight frame in the shape of a person lying on her stomach short reddishpurple hair covered the head portion and the body wore clothing that resembled the jeans and windbreaker karad been in when bell had cuffed her the arms of the outfit ended in what turned out to be latex hands hooked together with bell s handcuffs which kara had escaped from and then relatched on the phony wrists its a feke rhyme now announced to the room nodding at the frame a phony kara when sachs and the others had turned away misdirected by rhyme toward the chart kara had escaped from the cuffs unfurled the body frame and then silently slipped out the door to do the quick change in the hallway she now folded up the device which compressed into a little package the size of a small pillow shed had it hidden under her jacket when shed arrived the dummy wouldnt have passed close examination but in the shadows with an unsuspecting misdirected audience no one had noticed it wasnt the girl kadesky was shaking his head you did the whole escape and the quick change in less than a minute forty seconds how you saw the effect kara said to him think ill keep the method to myself so the point of this is i assume said kadesky cynically that you want an audition kara hesitated and rhyme shot a prodding glance toward the young woman no the point is this was the audition i want a job kadesky studied her closely it was one trick you have others plenty how many changesve you done in one show fortytwo changes thirty characters during a thirtyminute routine fortytwo setups in half an hour the producer asked eyebrows raised yep he debated for only a few seconds come see me next week im not cutting back my current artists time in the ring but they could use an assistant and an understudy and maybe you can do some shows at our winter camp in florida rhyme and kara exchanged glances he nodded firmly okay the young woman said to kadesky she shook his hand kadesky glanced at the springloaded wire form that had fooled them you made that yep you might want to patent it i never thought about that thanks ill look into it he looked her over again fortytwo in thirty minutes then nodding he left the room both he and kara looked as if theyd each bought a very nice very underpriced sports car sachs laughed damn you had me going a glance at rhyme both of you wait up here bell said feigning hurt i was in on it too im the one hogtied her sachs shook her head again when did you think this up it had started last night rhyme explained lying in bed listening to the music from cirque fantastique the ringmasters muted voice the applause and laughter from the crowd his thoughts had segued to kara how good her performance at smoke mirrors had been recalling her lack of selfconfidence and balzacs sway over her recalling too what sachs had told him about her mothers advanced senility which had prompted rhymes invitation to jaynene the next morning im going to ask you one more question rhyme had said to the woman think about it before you answer and i need you to be completely honest the query was will her mother ever come out of it jaynene had said will she get back her mind is that what youre askin thats right will she recover no so karas not taking her to england a sad laugh no no no that womans not going anywhere kara said she couldnt quit her job because she needs to keep her mother in the nursing home she needs to be cared for sure but not at our place karas paying for rehab and recreation medical intervention shortterm care karas mom doesnt even know what year it is she could be anywhere sorry to say it but all she needs is maintenance at this point whatll happen to her if she goes to a longterm home shell keep getting worse until the end just the same as if she stayed with us only it wouldnt bankrupt kara after that jaynene and thom had gone off to have lunch together and undoubtedly to share war stories about the people in their care rhyme had then called kara shed come over and theyd had a talk the conversation had been awkward hed never done well with personal matters confronting a heartless killer was easy compared with intruding on the tender soul of someones life i dont know your profession too well rhyme had said but when i saw you perform at the store on sunday i was impressed and it takes a lot to impress me you were damn good for a student had been her dismissive response no hed said firmly for a performer you should be onstage im not ready yet ill get there eventually after a thick pause rhyme said the problem with that attitude is that sometimes you dont get there eventually he glanced down at his body sometimes things intervene and there you are youve put off something important and you miss it forever but mr balzac is keeping you down its obvious hes only thinking whats best for me no hes not i dont know what hes thinking of but the one thing hes not thinking of is you look at weir and loesser and keating mentors can mesmerize you thank balzac for what hes done stay friends send him box seat tickets for your first carnegie hall show but get away from him now while you can im not mesmerized shed said laughing rhyme hadnt responded and he sensed she was considering just how much she was under the mans thumb he continued weve got some juice with kadesky after everything weve done amelia told me how much you like the cirque fantastique i think you should audition even if i did i have a personal situation my mother rhymed interrupted right i had a talk with jaynene the woman had fallen silent rhymed said let me tell you a story story i headed the forensics department here in new york the job had the typical administrative crap you can imagine but the thing i loved most and what i was best at was running crime scenes so even after i was promoted i still got into the field as often as i could well we had a serial rapist working in the bronx a few years ago i wont go into the details but it was an ugly situation and i wanted that man nailed i wanted him bad i got a call from patrol that thered been another attack just a half hour before and it looked like there was some good evidence i went uptown to run the scene personally just as i got there i found out my second in command and a good friend of mine had had a heart attack a bad one big shock he was a young guy in good shape anyway he was asking for me rhyme had pushed down a hard memory and continued but i stayed and ran the scene filled out the chain of custody cards and then went to the hospital i got there as fast as i could but i was too late hed died a half hour before i wasnt proud of that it still hurts me after all these years but i wouldntve done it different so your point is that i should put my mother in some shitty home shed said bitterly a cheaper one just so i can be happy of course not put her someplace thatll give her what she needs care and companionship not what you need not a rehab center thats going to bankrupt you my point its that if theres something you know youre meant to do in life that has to take priority over everything else get a job with cirque fantastique or another show but you have to move on do you know what some of those homes are like well then your job is to find one that youre both comfortable with sorry to be blunt but i told you up front i dont do well with delicacy shed shaken her head look lincoln even if i decided to do you know how many peopled die for a job at cirque fantastique they get a hundred résumés a week finally hed smiled well now ive been thinking about that the immobilized man has an idea for a routine i think we should try rhyme now finished telling sachs the story kara said we thought wed call the trick the escaping suspect im going to add it to my repertoire sachs turned to rhyme and the reason you didnt tell me before was im sorry you were downtown i couldnt get through well it mightve worked better if youd told me you couldve left a message i am sorry there ive apologized i dont do it very often you know id think you might appreciate it though now that you brought it up i dont really see how it couldve worked better the look on your face was priceless added to the credibility and balzac sachs asked he didnt know weir he wasnt really involved rhyme nodded at kara pure fiction we wrote the script the two of us sachs eyed the young woman first you get stabbed to death when im supposed to be looking out for you then you turn into a murder suspect the policewoman gave an exasperated sigh this could be a difficult friendship kara offered to run up the street to get some more cuban takeout which theyd missed the other day though rhyme suspected it was just an excuse for her to pick up another one of the restaurants sludgy coffees but before they could decide on the order they were interrupted by rhymes ringing phone he ordered command answer phone a moment later sellittos voice came on the speakerphone linc you busy depends he grumbled whats up no rest for the wicked we need your help again we got a weird homicide last one was bizarre if i remember correctly i think you just say things like that to get my attention no really we cant figure this one out all right all right the criminalist grumbled give me the details though the translation of lincoln rhymes gruff demeanor was simply how pleased he was that boredom would be held at bay for at least a little while longer kara stood outside smoke mirrors seeing things shed never noticed in her year and a half working there a hole in the upper lefthand corner of the plate glass from a bb or pellet gunshot a tiny swirl of graffiti on the door a dusty book on houdini in the window opened to the page discussing the type of sash cord he preferred to use in his routines she saw a flare inside the store mr balzac lighting a cigarette a breath lets do it she thought and pushed inside he was by the counter with that friend of his whod been in town this past weekend an illusionist from california balzac introduced her as a student and the middleaged man shook her hand they made small talk about how his performance had gone last night other people appearing in town the typical gossip performers everywhere engage in finally the man picked up his suitcase he was on his way to kennedy airport for the flight home and had stopped at the store to return the props hed borrowed he embraced balzac nodded to kara and left the store youre late the magician said to her gruffly then observed that she wasnt putting her bag behind the counter as she always did he glanced at her hands no coffee cup that was of course the giveaway a frown what he asked drawing on his cigarette tell me im leaving youre i talked to ed kadesky ive got a job with the cirque fantastique them kadesky no no no its all wrong for you thats not magic thats its what i want to do weve been through this a dozen times youre not ready youre good youre not great that doesnt matter she said firmly what matters is getting up onstage performing if you rush it rush it david rush it when would i be ready next year in five years normally she found it difficult to hold his eye today she looked straight at him as she said would you ever let me go a pause while he ordered papers slapped them down on the scuffed cracked counter kadesky he scoffed and whatll you be doing for him assistant at first then some winter season shows of my own in florida then who knows he stubbed out the cigarette its a mistake youll be wasting your talent what he does its not the kind of illusion i taught you i got the job because of what you taught me kadesky he said again contemptuously new magic yeah it is she said but ill be doing your routines too metamorphosis remember the old becoming new he didnt smile though she could sense the reference to his act pleased him david i want to keep studying with you when im back in town i want to take lessons ill pay for them i dont think that would work you cant serve two masters the man muttered when kara said nothing he said grudgingly well have to see i might not have the time i probably wont she hitched her purse higher on her shoulder right now he asked youre leaving now yeah i think its best he nodded so kara said the illusionist said a formal goodbye then and stepped behind the counter offering nothing else struggling to keep the tears at bay she walked to the door wait he called as she started outside balzac stepped into the back of the store and then returned to her he held something in his hand and thrust it into hers it was the cigar box that contained tarbells three colored silks here take these i liked the way you did that one it was a tight trick she remembered the praise shed received for it ah kara stepped forward and embraced him fast thinking that this was the first physical contact theyd had since she shook his hand when shed met him eighteen months ago he gave her an awkward hug in return and then stepped back kara walked outside paused and turned to wave but balzac had vanished into the dim recesses of the store she slipped the box of silks into her purse and started toward sixth avenue which would take her downtown to her apartment chapter fiftytwo the homicide was indeed a weird one a double murder in a deserted part of roosevelt island that narrow strip of apartments hospitals and ghostly ruins in the east river since the tramway deposits residents not far from the united nations in manhattan many diplomats and un employees live on the island and it was two of these individuals junior emissaries from the balkans whod been found murdered each shot in the back of the head twice their hands bound there were several curious things that amelia sachs had turned up when shed run the scene shed found ash from a type of cigarette that wasnt in the state or federal tobacco database traces of a plant that wasnt indigenous to the metropolitan area and imprints of a heavy suitcase that had been set down and apparently opened next to the victims after theyd been shot and strangest of all was the fact that each man was missing his right shoe they were nowhere to be found both of them the right shoe sachs rhyme said looking at the evidence board in front of which he sat and she paced what do we make of that but the question was put on hold temporarily by sachss ringing cell phone it was captain marlows secretary asking if she could come down to a meeting at his office several days had passed since theyd closed the conjurer case several days since she learned about victor ramoss action against her thered been no further word about the suspension when sachs asked well now the woman replied sachs disconnected and with a glance and tightlipped smile toward rhyme she said thiss it gotta go they held each others eyes for a moment then rhyme nodded and she headed for the door a half hour later sachs was in captain gerald marlows office sitting across from the man who was reading one of his everpresent manila files one second officer he continued reviewing whatever so absorbed him jotting occasional notes she fidgeted picking at a cuticle then at a nail two grassgrowing minutes went by oh jesus christ she thought and finally asked okay sir whats the story did he back down marlow marked a spot on the sheet he was reading and looked up who ramos about the sergeants exam and that other vindictive prick the lecherous cop from the assessment exercise back down marlow asked he was surprised at her naiveté well officer that was never an option him backing down so that left only one reason for a facetoface an understanding that came to her with the sharp clarity of the first pistol shot at an outdoor range that first shot before your muscles and ears and skin grow numb from the repeated fire only one reason for her to be summoned here marlow was going to take possession of her weapon and her shield she was now suspended shitshitshit she bit the inside of her lip easing the folder closed marlow looked at her in a fatherly way which unnerved her it was as if the punishment to which shed been sentenced was so severe that she needed the buffer zone of paternal kindness people like ramos officer youre not going to beat em not on their turf you won the battle cuffing him at the scene but he won the war people like that always win the war you mean stupid people petty people greedy people once again the genetic makeup of a career police officer stopped him from even acknowledging the question look at this desk he said as he did just that it was awash in paper stacks and piles of folders and memos and i remember when i used to complain about all the paperwork when i was a portable he rummaged through one of the stacks apparently looking for something gave up tried another pile he came up with several documents that werent what he wanted either and took his own sweet time reorganizing them then resuming the search again oh pop i never thought a suspensiond really go through then within her the sorrow and disappointment formed into a rock and she thought okay thats the way theyre going to play maybe im going down but theyll hurt ramos and all the little prick ramoses like himre are going to lick blood knuckle time right the captain said finally finding what he wanted a large envelope with a piece of paper stapled to it he read it quickly glanced at a clock in the shape of a ships wheel on his desk darn look at the time lets get on with it officer let me have your shield heartsick she dug dutifully into her pocket how long a year officer marlow said sorry suspended for a year she thought in despair shed imagined three months at the worst thats the best i could do a year shield i was asking marlow shook his head sorry for the rush ive got another meeting any minute now meetings they drive me crazy this ones about insurance the public thinks all we do is catch perps or thinks we dont catch perps more likely uhnuhn half the job is business bushwah you know what my father called business busyness he worked for american standard for thirtynine years sales rep busyness true about our job too he held out his hand dismay pooling around her drowning her she handed him the battered leather case containing the silver shield and id card badge number five eight eight five what could she do be a fucking security guard behind him the captains phone rang and he spun around to answer it marlow here yessir weve got security arranged for that and as he continued to talk to the caller something about the andrew constable trial it seemed the captain placed the interoffice envelope in his lap he pinched the phone in the crook of his neck turned back to face sachs and continued his conversation as he unwound the red thread that was twisted around the clasps to keep the envelope sealed droning on about the trial the new charges against constable and others in the patriot assembly raids up in canton falls sachs noted the mans perfectly nuanced respectful tone how he played the deference game so perfectly maybe he was talking to the mayor or governor maybe congressman ramos playing the game playing politics is this what police work is really about it was so far from her nature that she wondered if she had any business being a cop no busyness that thought tore her apart oh rhyme whatre we going to do well get through it hed said but life isnt about getting through getting through is losing marlow still pinching the phone between ear and shoulder was rambling on and on in the language of government he finally got the envelope opened and dropped her shield into it he then reached in and extracted something wrapped in tissue paper dont have time for a ceremony well do something later this latter message was whispered and it seemed to sachs he was speaking to her ceremony a glance at her now another whisper his hand over the receiver this insurance stuff who understands it ive got to learn all about mortality tables annuities double indemnity marlow unwrapped the tissue revealing a gold nypd badge back in his normal voice as he spoke into the phone yessir well stay on top of that situation weve got people in bedford junction too and harrisonburg up the road were completely proactive whispering again to her kept your old number officer he held up the badge which glistened brilliant yellow the numbers were the same as her patrol id he slipped the badge into her leather shield holder then he found something else in the yellow envelope a temporary id which he also mounted in the holder then handed it back the card identified her as amelia sachs detective thirdgrade yessir weve heard about that and our threat assessment is that its a handleable situation good sir marlow hung up and shook his head give me a bigots trial any day over insurance meetings okay officer youll need to get your picture taken for your permanent id he considered something then added cautiously this isnt a chauvinist thing so dont take it the wrong way but they like it better with womens hair pulled back not down and all you know well down looks tougher i guess you have a problem with that but im not suspended suspended no you made detective didnt they call you oconnor was supposed to call you or his assistant or somebody dan oconnor the head of the detective bureau nobody called me except your secretary oh well they were supposed to call what happened i told you id do what i could i did i mean lets face it there was no way i was letting you go on suspension cant afford to lose you he hesitated looked at the tide of files not to mention it wouldve been a nightmare to go up against you in a pba suit or arbitration wouldve been ugly thinking oh yessir it wouldve been real ugly but the year you mentioned something about year thats the sergeants exam i was talking about you cant take it again until next april its civil service and there was nothing i could do about that but reassigning you to the detective bureau thats discretionary ramos couldnt stop that youll report to lon sellitto she stared at the golden shield i dont know what to say you can say thank you very much captain marlow ive enjoyed working with you in patrol services all these years and i regret i will no longer be doing so thats a joke officer i do have a sense of humor despite what you hear oh youre thirdgrade you mightve noticed yessir struggling to keep the breathless grin off her face i if you want to make it all the way to firstgrade and sergeant id think long and hard about who you arrest or detain at crime scenes and for that matter how you talk to who just some advice noted sir now if youll excuse me officer i mean detective ive got about five minutes to learn everything there is to know about insurance outside on center street amelia sachs walked around her camaro examining the damage to the side and front end from the collision with loessers mazda in harlem itd take some major work to get the poor vehicle in shape again cars were her forte of course and she knew the location as well as the head shape length and torque of every screw and bolt in the vehicle and she probably had all the dingpullers ballpeen hammers grinders and other tools she needed in her brooklyn garage to fix most of the damage herself yet sachs didnt enjoy bodywork she found it boring the same way that being a fashion model had been boring and that going out with handsome cocky bangbang cops had been boring not to put too much of a shrinks spin on it but maybe there was something within her that distrusted the cosmetic the superficial for amelia sachs the substance of cars was in their hearts and hot souls the furious drumbeat of rods and pistons the whine of belts the perfect kiss of gears that turned a ton of metal and leather and plastic into pure speed she decided shed take the car to a shop in astoria queens one shed used before where the mechanics were talented more or less honest and had a reverence for power wheels like this easing now into the front seat she fired up the engine whose gutsy rattle caught the attention of a halfdozen cops lawyers and businesspeople nearby pulling out of the police lot she also made another decision a few years ago after some rust work shed decided to have the factoryblack car repainted shed opted for vibrant yellow the choice had been impulsive but why not shouldnt whims be reserved for decisions about the color of your toenails your hair and your vehicles but now she thought that since the shop would have to replace a quarter of the chevys sheet metal and it would need repainting anyway shed pick a different hue fireengine red was her immediate choice this shade had a double meaning to her not only was it the color her father always said that muscle cars ought to be but it would also match rhymes own sporty vehicle his storm arrow wheelchair this was just the sort of sentiment that the criminalist would appear wholly indifferent to but that would privately please him no end yep she reflected red it would be she thought about dropping the chevy off now but on reflection decided to wait she could drive a beatup car for a few more days shed done that plenty in her teen years at the moment she wanted to get back home to lincoln rhyme to share the news with him about the alchemy that had transformed her badge from silver to gold and to get back to work unraveling the thorny mysteries that awaited them two murdered diplomats alien vegetation curious imprints in muddy ground and a couple of missing
