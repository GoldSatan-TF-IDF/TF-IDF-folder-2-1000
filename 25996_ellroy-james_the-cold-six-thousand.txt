insert verbatim fbi telephone call transcript marked recorded at the directors request classified confidential a directors eyes only speaking director hoover ward j littell jeh mr littell wjl good afternoon sir how are you jeh forgo the amenities and tell me about dallas the metapbysical dimensions of this alleged tragedy do not interest me get to the point wjl i would call things encouraging sir there has been a minimum of talk about a conspiracy and a very strong consensus seems to have settled in despite some ambiguous statements from the witnesses ive spent a good deal of time at the pd and ive been told that president johnson has called both chief curry and the da personally and has expressed his wish that the consensus be confirmed jeh lyndon johnson is a blunt and persuasive man and he speaks a language those cowpokes understand now continuing with the witnesses wjl i would say that the contradictory ones could be intimidated discredited and successfully debriefed jeh youve read the witness logs observed the interviews and have been through the inevitable glut of lunatic phone tips is that correct wjl yes sir the phone tips were especially fanciful and vindictive john kennedy had engendered a good deal of resentment in dallas jeh yes and entirely justified continuing with the witnesses have you conducted any interviews yourself wjl no sir jeh youve turned up no witnesses with especially provocative stories wjl no sir what we have is an alternative consensus pertaining to the number of shots and their trajectories its a confusing text sir i dont think it will stand up to the official version jeh how would you rate the investigation to date wjl as incompetent jeh and how would you define it wjl as chaotic jeh how would you assess the efforts to protect mr oswald wjl as shoddy jeh does that disturb you wjl no jeh the attorney general has requested periodic updates what do you suggest that i tell him wjl that a fatuous young psychopath killed his brother and that he acted alone jeh the dark prince is no cretin he must suspect the factions that most insiders would wjl yes sir and im sure he feels complicitous jeh i hear an unseemly tug of compassion in your voice mr littell i will not comment on your protractedly complex relationship with robert f kennedy wjl yes sir jeh i cannot help but think of your blowhard client james riddle hoffa the prince is his bкte noire wjl yes sir jeh im sure mr lloffa would like to know what the prince really thinks of this gaudy homicide wjl i would like to know myself sir jeh i cannot help but think of your brutish client carlos marcello i suspect that he would enjoy access to bobbys troubled thoughts wjl yes sir jeh it would be nice to have a source close to the prince wjl ill see what i can do jeh mr lloffa gloats in an unseemly manner he told the new york times quote bobby kennedy is just another lawyer now unquote its a felicitous sentiment but i think there are those in the italian aggregation who would appreciate more discretion on mr hoffas part wjl ill advise him to shut his mouth sir jeh on a related topic did you know that the bureau has a file on jefferson davis tippit wjl no sir jeh the man belonged to the ku klux klan national states rights party national renaissance party and a dubious new splinter group called the thunderbolt legion he was a close associate of a dallas pd officer named maynard delbert moore a man of similar ideological beliefs and a reportedly puerile demeanor wjl did you get your information from a dpd source sir jeh no i have a correspondent in nevada hes a conservative pamphleteer and mailorder solicitor with very deep and diverse connections on the right flank wjl a mormon sir jeh yes all the nevadan fьhrer manques are mormons and this man is arguably the most gifted wjl he sounds interesting sir jeh youre leading me mr littell i know full well that howard hughes wets his pants for mormons and has two greedy eyes on las vegas ill always share a discreet amount of information with you if you broach the request in a manner that does not insult my intelligence wjl im sorry sir you understood my design and the man does sound interesting jeh hes quite useful and diversified for example he runs a hatetract press covertly hes planted a number of his subscribers as informants in klan groups that the bureau has targeted for mailfraud indictments he helps eliminate his hatemail competition in that manner wjl and he knew the late officer tippit jeh knew or knew of judged or did not judge as ideologically unsound and outrй im always amusingly surprised by who knows who in which overall contexts for example the dallas sac told me that a former bureau man named guy williams banister is in town this weekend another agent told me independently that hes seen your friend pierre bondurant imaginative people might point to this confluence and try to link men like that to your mutual chum carlos marcello and his hatred of the royal family but i am not disposed to such flights of fancy wjl yes sir jeh your tone tells me that you wish to ask a favor for mr hughes perhaps wjl yes sir id like to see the main bureau file on the las vegas hotelcasino owners along with the files on the nevada gaming commission gaming control board and the clark county liquor board jeh the answer is yes quid pro quo wjl certainly sir jeh i would like to forestall potential talk on mr tippit if the dallas office has a separate file on him i would like it to disappear before my less trusted colleagues get an urge to take the information public wjl ill take care of it tonight sir jeh do you think the singlegunman consensus will hold wjl ill do everything i can to insure it jeh good day mr littell wjl good day sir dallas glut waste bullshit the hotel copped pleas the hotel blamed lee oswald the joint bulgedcapacityplusnewsmen shared rooms they hogged the phone lines they sapped the hot water they

intelligence report marked classified confidential a restricted agent access pertinent facts observations on major las vegas hotelcasino ownerships related topics note officially logged at southern nevada office the major las vegas hotelcasinos are situated in two locales the downtown fremont streetglitter gulch area and the strip las vegas blvd the citys main northsouth artery the downtown establishments are older less gaudy cater to local residents less affluent tourists who come to gamble enjoy lowquality entertainment engage the services of prostitutes junket groups elks kiwanis rotary shriners vfw cyo are frequent downtown hotelcasino visitors the downtown establishments are largely owned by pioneer consortiums eg native nevadans general nonorganized crime groups some of the owners have been forced to sell small interests to organizedcrime groups in exchange for continued preferential treatment eg onsite protection a service to insure the absence of labor trouble untoward onsite incidents organizedcrime associates frequently serve as casino pit bosses thus as enforcers and onsite informants for their organizedcrime patrons the downtown area is jurisdictionally covered by the las vegas police department lvpd the lvpds jurisdiction adjoins that of the clark county sheriffs department ccsd both agencies work within the others jurisdiction by mutual consent the sheriffs dept patrols the strip area south of the sahara hotel like the lvpd it provides investigatory services for its specific jurisdiction with an operational mandate inside lvpd or city jurisdiction the lvpd is similarly allowed to conduct investigations inside sheriffs dept or county jurisdiction it should be noted that both agencies are widely influenced and corrupted by factions of organized crime this corruption is of the type most identified with company towns eg casino revenue forms the financial base of las vegas thus influences the political base lawenforcement policy numerous officers within both agencies benefit from organizedcrime bestowed gratuities free hotel stays free casino gambling chips the services of prostitutes police discounts at various businesses owned by organizedcrime associates outright bribery the lvpd and sheriffs dept enforce organizedcrime policies with the implicit consent of the clark county political hierarchy by extension the consent of the nevada state legislature eg negroes are strongly discouraged from entering certain strip hotelcasinos and onsite casino personnel are allowed to see to their expulsion eg crimes against organizedcrimeconnected casino employees are frequently avenged by lvpd officers acting on orders from the casino operators council an organizedcrime front group eg lvpd officers and sheriffs deputies are often used to track down casino card cheats discourage them run them out of town the bestknown hotelcasinos are situated on the strip many of them have been infiltrated by organized crime with percentage points divvied up among the overlords of organizedcrime cartels eg the chicago crime cartel controls the stardust hotelcasino boss sam mo momo mooney giancana has an personal interest chicago hoodlum john rosselli the chicago cartels las vegas overseer has a interest chicago mob enforcer dominic michael montalvo aka butch montrose has a interest see addendum file b for complete list of crimecartel ownerships percentagepoint estimates smaller percentage points are traded between organized crime factions as part of an ongoing effort to insure that all factions have a stake in the expanding las vegas casino economy the profit base is thus shared factiontofaction rivalry is averted thus organized crime presents a unified face in las vegas the man responsible for developing maintaining this policy is morris barney moe dalitz b a former cleveland mobster organized crimes goodwill ambassador las vegas fixit man dalitz owns points in the desert inn hotel casino and is rumored to have points in several others dalitz is known as mr las vegas because of his numerous philanthropic endeavors his convincing nongangster image dalitz founded the casino operators council dictates their enforcement policies is largely responsible for the clean town policy that organizedcrime factions believe will help promote tourism thus increase hotelcasino revenue this policy is informally enforced has the implicit approval of the las vegas political machine the lvpd sheriffs dept one goal is to enforce ad hoc segregation in the strip hotelcasinos eg admit negro celebrities or perceived high class negroes refuse admittance to all others to isolate negro housing in the slum area of west las vegas restrictive realestate covenants are widely observed by las vegasbased realtors a key policy dictate is the no narcotics rule this rule applies specifically to heroin the selling of heroin is forbidden is punishable by death the rule is enforced to limit the number of narcotics addicts specifically those who might support their addiction by means of robbery burglary flimflam or other criminal activities that would sully the reputation of las vegas thus discourage tourism numerous heroin pushers have been the victims of unsolved homicides numerous others have disappeared are presumed to have been killed per the aforementioned policy see addendum file b for partial list the last homicide occurred on there appears to be no heroin traffic in las vegas as of this date it is fair to conclude that the aforementioned deaths have served as a deterrent dalitz is a close associate of teamster president james riddle hoffa b has secured large loans from the teamsters central states pension fund that have covered the cost of hotelcasino improvements the fund estimated assets billion dollars is a watering hole that organizedcrime factions borrow from routinely dubious organizedcrimeconnected businessmen also borrow from the fund at usurious interest rates that often result in the forfeiture of their businesses it is rumored that a second set of pension fund financial books exists one that is hidden from government subpoena thus official audit these books allegedly list a more accurate accounting of pension fund assets detail the illegal quasilegal loans repayment schedules many of the strip hotelcasinos routinely hide a large portion of their assets see the attached irsfiled tablebytable profit accountings for all craps roulette blackjack poker loball keno fantan e baccarat tables broken down by hotel these reported accountings are generally considered to be only accurate it is very difficult to detect sustained underestimation of taxable income in large cashbase businesses underestimated table profits are estimated to amount to untaxed revenue of over per year fiscal estimate this practice is called the skim cash receipts are taken directly from casino counting rooms and dispersed to couriers who messenger the money to prearranged spots largedenomination bills are substituted for slotmachine coins daily accountings are fraudulently tallied inside the counting rooms proper casino skim is virtually impossible to detect most hotelcasino employees subsist on low wages untaxed cash gratuities would never report irregularities this endemic corruption extends to the labor unions who supply the major hotelcasinos with workers the dealers and croupiers local is a chicago crime cartel front its members are paid a low hourly wage are given play chips presumably stolen merchandise as bonuses all chapters of this union are rigidly segregated the lounge entertainers local is a detroit crime cartel front its members are wellpaid but pay weekly kickbacks to crew stewards this union is nominally integrated negro lounge entertainers are discouraged from patronizing the hotelcasinos they work in from fraternizing with white patrons the four building buildingsupply locals who service the strip hotels are cleveland crime cartel fronts work exclusively with organizedcrimeconnected contracting firms the allfemale chambermaids local is a florida crime cartel front many of its members have been suborned into prostitution the work crews for the above mentioned locals are run by ramrods who report to the casino operators council the kitchen workers union las vegasbased only there are no other chapters is not organizedcrimeconnected is allowed to operate as a sop to the las vegas pioneer contingent the largely mormon nevada political machine the union is run by wayne tedrow sr b a conservative pamphleteer realestate investor the owner of a bottomrung or grind joint casino the land o gold the crew chiefs are all mormons the workers mostly illegal mexican aliens are paid substandard wages are given bonuses of dented cans of food play chips for the land o gold the workers live in slum hotels in a mexican enclave on the westnorth las vegas border note tedrow sr is rumored to have hidden points in north las vegas grind joints liquor storeslot machine arcades near nellis air force base if true these ownerships would constitute infractions of the nevada gaming commission charter the nevada gaming commission oversees regulates the granting of casino licenses and the hiring of casino personnel the commission is a rubberstamp panel that does the bidding of the gaming control board and the clark county liquor control board the same five men the clark county sheriff district attorney appointed civilian members serve on both boards thus the power to approve liquor and casino license applicants for the entire state rests solely in las vegas none of the board members are overtly organizedcrimeconnected it is difficult to assess the level of collusion the boards engage in because a majority of the applications they review cloak hidden organizedcrime backing that is difficult to detect there are no dossiers available on members of the above organizations the lvpd intelligence unit keeps detailed files on the gaming control liquor board men but has consistently refused to grant the fbi us attorneys office access to them as previously stated the lvpd is strongly organizedcrimeinfluenced the lvpd intelligence unit operates city countywide is the sole such unit in clark county it is a man operation the commanding officer is lieutenant byron b fritsch the adjutant of the lvpd detective bureau strongly connected to the casino operators council the only assigned officer is sergeant wayne tedrow jr sgt tedrow is the son of the aforementioned wayne tedrow

and thank you for the carbons jeh las vegas is a hellhole it is unfit for sane habitation which may explain its allure to howard hughes wjl yes sir jeh lets talk about dallas wjl the consensus feels secure sir and the oswald killing seems to be a popular denouement jeh mr ruby has gotten four thousand fan letters he is quite popular with jews wjl ill concede him a certain panache sir jeh will you concede his ability to keep his mouth shut wjl yes sir jeh i agree with you on the consensus and i want you to include your thoughts in a detailed report on the events of that hallowed weekend i will attribute the report to dallas agents and submit it directly to president johnson wjl ill begin work immediately sir jeh the president will announce a commission to investigate king jacks death i will handpick the field agents your report will provide the president with a snappy preview of their findings wjl has he formed an opinion sir jeh he suspects mr castro or unruly cuban exiles in his view the killing stemmed from king jacks reckless blunders in the caribbean wjl its an informed perspective sir jeh ill concede the point and concede that lyndon johnson is no dummy he has a conveniently dead assassin and a citizenry avenged on national television what more could he ask for wjl yes sir jeh and hes appropriately fed up with the cuban boondoggle hes going to drop it as a nationalsecurity issue and concentrate on the situation in vietnam wjl yes sir jeh your tone did not escape me mr littell i know that you disapprove of american colonialism and consider our godgiven mandate to contain global communism as illconceived wjl thats true sir jeh the attendant irony has not escaped me a closet leftist as front man for howard hughes and his colonialist designs wjl strange bedfellows sir jeh and how would you describe his designs wjl he wants to circumvent antitrust laws and purchase all the hotelcasinos on the las vegas strip he wont spend a dime until he settles his stockdivestment suit with twa and accrues at least million dollars i think the suit will resolve in three or four years jeh and your job is to precolonize las vegas wjl yes sir jeh i would like a blunt assessment of mr hughes mental state wjl mr hughes injects codeine in his arms legs and penis he eats only pizza pies and ice cream he receives frequent transfusions of germfree mormon blood his employees routinely refer to him as the count count dracula and drac jeh a vivid assessment wjl hes lucid half the time sir and hes singlemindedly fixed on las vegas jeh bobbys antimob crusade may have repercussions there wjl do you think hell remain in the cabinet jeh no he hates lyndon johnson and lyndon johnson more than reciprocates i think hell resign his appointment and his successor may have las vegas plans that i will be powerless to curtail wjl specifically sir jeh bobby had been considering skim operations wjl mr marcello and the others have plans for mr hughes holdings jeh how could they not they have a drugaddicted vampire to victimize and you to help them suck his blood wjl they know that you bear them no rancor sir theyll understand that some of bobbys plans will be implemented by his successor jeh yes and if the count buys into las vegas and cleans up its image those plans might be abandoned wjl yes sir the thought had occurred to me jeh i would like to know what the dark prince thinks about his brothers death wjl so would i jeh of course you would robert f kennedy is both your savior and your bкte noire and im hardly the one to indict you as a voyeur wjl yes sir jeh would a bugandtap approach work wjl no sir but ill talk to my other clients and see what they suggest jeh i need someone with a fallen liberal image i may ask a favor of you wjl yes sir jeh good day mr littell wjl good day sir las vegas they worked him two pros buddy fritsch and captain bob gilstrap they used the chiefs office they hemmed wayne in they deployed the chiefs

certainly hh i know that tone mollify the boss so hell get back to business wjl laughs hh heres my premonition youre going to tell me that it will take years to divest my twa stock so i should mind my ps and qs and put the whole thing out of mind wjl your premonition was accurate hh thats all you have to say youre letting me off that easy wjl i could describe the legal processes involved in divesting half a billion dollars worth of stock and tell you how much youve impeded the progress by dodging various subpoenas hh youre feeling your oats today im not up to sparring with you wjl im not sparring mr hughes im observing hh and your latest estimate is wjl were two years away from a judgment the appeals process will extend for at least nine to fourteen months you should discuss the details with your other attorneys and move things along by presubmitting your depositions hh youre my favorite attorney wjl thank you hh only mormons and fbi men have clean blood wjl im not much of an expert on blood sir hh i am you know the law and i know aerodynamics blood and germs wjl were expert in our separate fields sir hh i know business strategy as well i have the assets to purchase las vegas now but i prefer to wait and make the purchase with my stock windfall wjl thats a prudent strategy sir but i should point out a few things hh point then im listening wjl one you are not going to purchase the city of las vegas or clark county nevada two you are going to attempt to purchase numerous hotelcasinos the acquisition of which violates numerous state and federal antitrust statutes three you cannot make those purchases now you would need to deplete the cash flow necessary to operate hughes tool to do it and you have yet to ingratiate yourself with the nevada state legislature and the right people in clark county four that is my joband it will take time five i want to wait and follow some other hotelchain developments through the court process and collate the antitrust rulings and precedents hh jesus that was some speech youre a longwinded guy wjl yes sir hh you didnt mention your mafia pals wjl sir hh i talked to mr hoover he said youve got those guys in your pocket whats that guys name in new orleans wjl carlos marcello hh marcello right mr hoover said he eats out of your hand he said when the times right littell will jew those dagos down and get you your hotels at rockbottom prices wjl ill certainly try hh youll do better than that wjl ill try sir hh weve got to devise a germ policy wjl sir hh at my hotels no germs no negroes negroes are wellknown germ conduits theyll infect my slot machines wjl ill look into it sir hh my solution is mass sedation ive been reading chemistry books certain narcotic substances possess germkilling characteristics we could sedate the negroes lower their whiteblood count and keep them out of my hotels wjl mass sedation would require certain sanctions that we might not get hh youre not convinced i can tell by your voice wjl ill give it some thought hh think about this lee oswald was a germ conduit and a deadlydisease transmitter he didnt need a rifle he could have breathed on kennedy and killed him wjl its an interesting theory sir hh only mormons and fbi men have clean blood wjl youve got quite a few mormons in nevada theres a man named wayne tedrow senior that i may approach on your behalf hh ive got some good mormons here they set me up with fred otash wjl ive heard of him hh hes the private eye to the stars hes been running a string of howard hughes lookalikes all over la like pete bondurant used to those subpoena servers follow them around like robots wjl again sir dodging subpoenas only prolongs the whole process hh ward youre a goddamn killjoy wjl laughs hh freddys lebanese those people have high whitecell counts i like him but hes no pete wjl petes working with me in las vegas hh good frenchmen have low whitecell counts i read it in the national geographic wjl hell be pleased to hear it hh good tell him i said hello and tell him to procure me some medicine hell know what i mean tell him my mormons have been bringing me inferior goods wjl ill tell him hh let me make one thing clear before i hang up wjl sir hh i want to buy las vegas wjl youve made yourself clear hh the desert air kills germs wjl yes sir las vegas the partya vegas perennialwayne seniors christmas bash

mental and he thinks hes got ward in his pocket we sell him the hotels and make him keep our inside people they step up the skim he dont suspect anything cause we show him some low profit figures before he buys littell shook his head his negotiators will audit every tax return filed for every hotel going back ten years if you refuse to submit them theyll try to subpoena them or bribe the right people for copies and you cant submit doctored returns with low figures because it will bring down your initial asking prices sam said so littell sipped club soda we need the highest possible set purchase prices with the buyout money dispersed over eighteen months our longterm goal is to establish the appearance of legitimately invested money diverted into legitimate businesses and laundered within them my plan is carlos cut in the planget to it and lay it out in words we can understand littell smiled we have the buyout and skim money we purchase legitimate businesses with it the businesses belong to recipients of pensionfund loans they are the most specifically profitable and cosmetically noncriminal businesses that originated with loans from the real books thus the origin of the money is obscured thus the recipients are prone to extortion and will not protest the forced buyouts the recipients will continue to run their businesses our people will oversee the operations and divert the profits we funnel the money into foreign hotelcasinos by foreign i mean latinamerican by latinamerican i mean countries under military or strongly rightist rule the casino profits will leave said countries untaxed they will go into swiss bank accounts and accrue interest the ultimate cash withdrawals will be absolutely untraceable carlos smiled santo clapped johnny said its like

interest sir jeh your assignment would be to appear sympathetic to the civilrights cause which i know will be no great stretch you will donate numerous allotments of marked mob money to the sclc in increments over a sustained period of time my goal is to compromise the sclc and render them more tractable your goal is to convince the sclc that you have embezzled the money from organizedcrime sources in an effort to assuage your guilt over working for mobsters in the first place this will also be no great stretch im sure that you can tap the ambivalent aspects of your nature and front a convincing performance im equally sure that you can justify the continued expense to your mobster colleagues as a proactive means to avoid civilrights trouble in las vegas which will please them and

your intent was to find and apprehend wendell durfee yes brown said you wanted to apprehend him to make up for not doing it in big d yes then son heres what bothers me how did durfee know that you

in dallas fritsch said ill buy that gilstrap said i will too brown said i wont i think something happened between you and durfee maybe in dallas maybe up here before they sent you down i dont see him

the cops chased him they popped pete they filed paper the sheriffs man knew shitall about it brown said your business up here is your business i wouldnt care about any of this except for the proximity of a missing dallas officer named maynard d moore who you reportedly did not get along with wayne shrugged moore was dirty if you knew him you know thats true i didnt like him but i only had to work with him for a few days you said knew you think hes dead then thats right durfee or one of his asshole klan buddies killed him gilstrap said weve got two apbs out on durfee he wont get far brown

no protests negro leaders say at a hastily arranged press conference in washington dc a spokesman for the national association for the advancement of colored people naacp announced that that organization and several other civilrights groups will not protest the january th killings of three negro men by a white policeman in las vegas lawton j spofford told assembled reporters our decision is not based upon the recent decree from the clark county grand jury which exonerated sergeant wayne tedrow jr for the deaths of leroy williams and curtis and otis swasey that body is a rubberstamp implement of the clark county political establishment and as such has no sway with us our decision is based on information we have received from a friendly anonymous source who told us that sergeant tedrow under great personal duress acted in a somewhat heedless but recognizably nonmalicious manner that did not include racist designs the naacp along with the congress of racial equality core and the southern christian leadership conference sclc had previously announced their intention to stage protests in las vegas in order to shed light on a horribly segregated city where negro citizens live in deplorable circumstances the killings spofford said were to have been our point of redress and overall explication other negro leaders present at the press conference said that they did not rule

conversation i utilized mr rustin to forestall some trouble in las vegas it pertained to a client of mine jeh i know elements of the story well discuss it momentarily wjl yes sir jeh do you still consider it impossible to retape the dark prince wjl yes sir jeh i would enjoy some glimpses of his private pain wjl i would too jeh i doubt that youre a voyeur not a sadist and i suspect that youll never reconcile your old crush on bobby wjl yes sir jeh lyndon johnson finds him difficult to reconcile many of his advisors think he should include him on the fall ticket but he hates the dark lad too much to succumb wjl i understand how he feels sir jeh yes and you disapprove in your uniquely nondisapproving way wjl im not that complex sir or that compromised in my emotions jeh you delight me mr littell i will nominate your last statement for best falsehood of wjl im honored sir jeh bobby may run for kenneth keatings senate seat in new york wjl if he runs hell win jeh yes hell form a coalition of the deluded and morally handicapped and emerge victorious wjl is he maintaining his work at justice jeh not vigorously he still appears to be shellshocked mr katzenbach and mr clark are doing most of his work i think hell resign in a timely fashion wjl is he monitoring the agents for the warren commission jeh i havent discussed the investigation with him of course he receives summaries of all my field agents reports wjl edited summaries sir jeh you are frisky today impertinent might describe it better wjl i apologize sir jeh dont im enjoying the conversation wjl yes sir

johnson continues to share his thoughts with me in his inimitably colorful manner he has said quote it all came out of that pathetic little shithole cuba maybe its that cocksucker with the beard or those fucking lowlife exiles unquote wjl a lively and astute analysis jeh mr johnson has developed a distaste for all things cuban the exile cause has succumbed to factionalism and has scattered to the wind which pleases him no end wjl i share his delight sir i know many people who were seduced by the cause jeh yes gangsters and a frenchcanadian chap with homicidal tendencies wjl yes sir jeh cuba appeals to hotheads and the morally impaired its the cuisine and the sex plantains and women who have intercourse with donkeys wjl i have no fondness for the place sir jeh mr johnson has developed a fondness for vietnam you should inform mr hughes some military contracts may be coming his way wjl hell be delighted to hear that jeh you should inform him that ill keep you abreast of the justice departments plans in las vegas wjl im delighted to hear that jeh on a needtoknow basis mr littell as is the case with all our transactions wjl i understand sir and i neglected to thank you for

asked you to lunch wjl yes sir we havent scheduled yet jeh he thinks youre weak i told him that you are a bold and occasionally reckless man who has learned the value of restraint wjl thank you sir jeh dwight feels quite ambivalent he got the job he wanted but hes developed quite a dislike for wayne junior my sources in the us attorneys office tell me that he is determined to bypass senior and do junior some harm in the long run wjl despite his friendship with senior jeh or because of it you never know with dwight hes quite the provocateur and the rogue so i indulge him wjl yes sir jeh the same way i indulge you wjl i caught the implication sir jeh you dislike dwight and wayne senior so ill give you added cause their fathers belonged to the same klan kiavern in indiana that said i should add that it was probably more genteel than the klan groups currently marauding down south wjl im sure they never lynched any negroes jeh yes although im certain they would have enjoyed it wjl yes sir jeh most people have entertained the notion you must credit their restraint wjl yes sir jeh you might discuss the indiana klan with bayard rustin i want you to make another donation wjl ill bring it up sir im sure hell acknowledge it as a genteel institution jeh you are assuredly frisky today wjl i hope i havent offended you sir jeh anything but and i hope i havent offended you with junior wjl sir jeh i had to throw dwight holly a bone he wanted junior expelled from the lvpd so i arranged it wjl i assumed that you had sir the newspapers were kind though they said he resigned jeh

directors eyes only speaking director hoover ward j littell jeh good morning mr littell wjl good morning sir jeh describe your southern excursion i receive updates from my field agents but i would appreciate a contrasting perspective wjl mr rustin was happy to receive my donation he appeared to be pleased about the civil rights bill and praised the bureaus presence in mississippi jeh did you correct him and say forced presence wjl i did sir i stayed in character and credited president johnson jeh lyndon johnson needs wretched people to love him he is quite uncliscerning and promiscuous in his need he reminds me of king jack and his lack of discernment with women wjl yes sir jeh i do not share mr johnsons need i have a pet dog who fulfills my desire for unconsidered affection wjl yes sir jeh mr johnson and the dark prince are determined to make martyrs of those missing youths the illrevered reverend king must feel the same way wjl im sure he does sir im sure he sees the boys as christian symbols jeh i do not i cast the state of mississippi in the martyrs role their sovereignty has been abrogated in the name of dubious rights and lyndon johnson has made me a reluctant accomplice wjl im sure youll find ways to make up for it sir jeh i will indeed you will help me and you will perform your own acts of penance in an unfathomable and politically suspect manner wjl you know me very well sir jeh yes and i can decipher your inflections and determine when you wish to change the subject wjl yes sir jeh im listening mr littell ask any question or make any statement you wish wjl thank you sir my first question pertains to lyle and dwight holly jeh ask your questions i find preambles boring and taxing wjl does lyle share his sclc intelligence with dwight jeh i do not know wjl is dwight formally investigating wayne tedrow senior andor junior jeh no although im sure hes keeping tabs on them in his uniquely persistent manner an activity which i would be loath to discourage wjl i may be coopting several of wayne seniors mormons jeh into the hughes organization wjl yes sir jeh now or in due time wjl now jeh expand your answers mr littell i have a lunch date for the millennium wjl the work i have in mind is potentially risky especially if the justice department should go proactive in las vegas jeh i do not dictate justice department policy the fbi is but one cog in a much larger system as prince bobby has pointed out to me on several repugnant occasions wjl yes sir jeh tell me what you want mr littell wjl i would like a provisional commitment if the mormons incur trouble you could assess the situation and intercede on their behalf or use their trouble to put wayne senior in your debt jeh do you want me to offer the mormons covert protection wjl no sir jeh will you inform senior and the mormons of the potential federal risk wjl the job description carries its own warning i will not gild the lily beyond that jeh and who will your coopt strategy benefit wjl mr hughes and my italian clients jeh feel free to proceed then and feel free to rely on my potential assistance wjl thank you sir jeh be sure that mr hughes remains convincingly unaccountable wjl yes sir jeh good day mr littell wjl good day sir las vegas golf bored him wayne senior insistedim playing the di littell stood by the drink stand littell dodged the heat vegas heat

consultants my aides have chosen three rough and tumble nononsense men from that list you submitted and they have assured me that they are devout mormons with germfree blood their names are thomas d elwell lamar l dean and daryl d kleindienst they have extensive union experience in las vegas and according to my aides will not be afraid to negotiate and lock horns with those mafia boys that mr hoover tells me you have in your pocket according to my aides these men know the ropes they did not meet with them in person but have corresponded with your friend mr tedrow in las vegas and have solicited his advice mr tedrow is well respected in mormon circles they tell me and i confirmed that assessment with mr hoover the new men will be traveling hither and yon to advance our las vegas plans so im pleased that they are cutting down commercial airline costs by flying hughes charters ive sent memos to all the charter crews instructing them to have lots of fritos pepsicola and rocky road ice cream on hand because hardworking men deserve to eat well also thanks for getting charter clearance at nellis air force base which cuts down costs as well forewarned is forearmed ward youve convinced me that our las vegas approach will take time and i think this casino consultant plan is a winner i look forward to receiving your first report all best hh las vegas wayne senior said i know

writing jfk book says hell blow conspiracy wide open dallas timesherald reporter jim koethe has a tale to tell and hell tell it to anyone wholl listen on sunday evening november koethe along with timesherald editor robert cuthbert and reporter bill hunter of the long beach california presstelegram visited the apartment of jack ruby the convicted killer of presidential assassin lee harvey oswald the three men spent two or three hours talking to rubys roommate novelty salesman george senator i cant reveal what mr senator said koethe told this reporter but believe you me it was an eyeopener and it sure got me thinking about some things koethe went on to say that hes done quite a bit of digging into the assassination and is writing a book on the subject its a conspiracy sure as shooting he said and my book is going to blow it wide open koethe refused to name the people he believes are responsible for the death of president john f kennedy and refused to reveal the basic motive and details of the conspiracy youll have to wait for the book koethe said and believe me the book will be well worth the wait koethes friend reporter bill hunter died in april editor robert cuthbert declined to be interviewed in depth for this article jims extracurricular activities are his business cuthbert said i wish him well with his book though because i love a good potboiler personally i think oswald was the lone assassin and the warren report sure backs me up still ive got to say that jim koethe exemplifies the bulldog reporter so maybe hes on to something koethe is a colorful local scribe known for his persistence assertive behavior and connections within the dallas police department he is reputed to be a close friend of dpd officer maynard d moore who disappeared around the time of the assassination asked to comment on officer moores missing status koethe said mums the word a good reporter doesnt reveal his sources and a good book writer doesnt reveal anything i guess well have to wait for the book in the meantime though interested parties will have to make do with the volume warren report which for this reporter stands as the authoritative final word las

summary you requested as always please read and burn first off theres a consensus among agency analysts were in vietnam to stay you know how far the trouble goes backwith the japanese the chinese and the french our interest dates to it was shaped by our commitment to france and our desire to keep western europe out of the red bloc and was spurred by china going red vietnam is a key chunk of real estate well lose our foothold in southeast asia if it goes red in fact well risk losing the entire region much of the current situation derives from the viet minh defeat of the french forces at dien bien phu in march this led to geneva accords and the partitioning of what is now north and south vietnam along the th parallel the communists withdrew from the south and the french from the north a nationwide election was called for the summer of we installed our man ngo dinh diem in the south diem was a catholic who was prous antibuddhist antifrench colonialist and anticommunist agency operatives rigged a referendum that allowed diem to succeed premier bao dai it wasnt subtle our people got diem more votes than the actual number of voters diem renounced the geneva accord elections he said the presence of the viet minh insured that the elections could not be absolutely free the election deadline approached the us backed diems refusal to participate diem initiated security measures against the viet minh in the south suspected viet minh or viet minh sympathizers were tortured and tried by local province officials appointed by diem this approach was successful and diem managed to smash of the viet minh cells in the mekong delta during this time diems publicists coined the pejorative term vietnam cong san or vietnamese communist the election deadline passed the soviets and red chinese did not press for a political settlement early in the soviets proposed a permanent partition and a un sanctioning of north and south vietnam as separate states the us was unwilling to recognize a communist state and rebuffed the initiative diem built a base in the south he appointed his brothers and other relatives to positions of power and in fact turned south vietnam into a narrowly ruled albeit stridently anticommunist oligarchy diems brothers and relatives built up their individual fiefdoms they were rigidly catholic and antibuddhist diems brother can was a virtual warlord his brother ngo dinh nhu ran an antiviet cong intelligence network with cia funds diem balked at land reforms and allied himself with wealthy landowning families in the mekong delta he created the khu tru mat ie farm communities to buffer peasants from viet cong sympathizers and cells peasants were uprooted from their native villages and forced to build the communities without pay government troops often pilfered their pigs rice and chicken diems actions created a demand for reform diem closed opposition newspapers accused journalists students and intellectuals of communist ties and arrested them at this time the us had a billion dollars invested in south vietnam diem dubbed a puppet who pulls his own strings knew that we needed his regime as a strategic port against the spread of communism he spent the bulk of his usdonated money on military and police buildup to quash viet cong raids below the th parallel and quash domestic plots against him in november a military coup against diem failed diemloyalist troops fought the troops of south vietnamese army colonel vuong van dong diem rebuffed the coup but his actions earned him many enemies among the saigon and mekong delta elite in the north this internal dissent emboldened ho chi minh he embarked on a terror campaign in the south and in december announced the formation of a new insurgent group the national liberation movement ho contended that he did not violate the geneva accord by sending troops into the south this was of course a lie red troops had been steadily infiltrating the south along the ho chi mirth trail since shortly after his inauguration john kennedy read a pentagon analysis of the deteriorating vietnamese situation the analysis urged that aid to diem be increased kennedy increased the number of incountry advisors to the advisors were really military personnel in violation of the geneva accord kennedy issued a foreignaid order which served to increase the size of the south vietnamese army the arvn or army of the republic of south vietnam by men to a total of diem resented the presence of the us advisors then large viet cong units began attacking arvn posts at that juncture diem told the advisors that he wanted to form a bilateral defense pact between the us and south vietnam kennedy sent general maxwell taylor to saigon taylor reported back and reconfirmed the strategic importance of a stand against the viet cong he called for more advisors along with helicopters and pilotsupport for the arvn taylor requested troops the joint chiefs and secretary of defense mcnamara requested kennedy compromised and sent more financial aid to diem diem initiated the strategic hamlet program early in he detained peasants in armed stockades in an effort to thwart their susceptibility to the viet cong in reality the program supplied the viet cong with converts in february diem survived another coup two arvn pilots attacked the presidential palace with napalm bombs and machinegun fire diem his brother nhu and madame nhu survived ngo dinh nhu had become an embarrassment he was an opium addict prone to bouts of paranoia madame nhu had convinced diem to sponsor edicts abolishing divorce contraceptives abortion boxing matches beauty contests and opium dens these edicts spawned great resentment the us advisors noted a new groundswell of anger against the diem regime antidiem sentiment was building within the arvn command diems can lao the south vietnamese secret police stepped up its arrests and torture of suspected buddhist dissidents four buddhist monks publicly incinerated themselves in protest madame nhu praised the suicides and created more resentment kennedy and the new vietnamese ambassador henry cabot lodge concluded that the diem regime was becoming an embarrassing liability and that ngo dinh nhu and madame nhu were the heart of the problem covertly agency operatives were told to sniff out discontent within the arvn high command and discuss the viability of a coup it was determined that numerous plots already existed in various states of readiness diem sensed the existing arvn discontent and ordered a show of force against buddhists and buddhist sympathizers in saigon and hue it was diems intention to turn the buddhists against the arvn and exploit the situation to his advantage on diem troops attacked buddhist temples in saigon hue and other cities hundreds of monks and nuns were killed injured and arrested riots and protests against the diem regime followed the agency learned of diems machinations in the ensuing weeks kennedy and his advisors were furious and still convinced that ngo dinh nhu was the problem diem was instructed to get rid of nhu agency operatives were told to contact potential coup leaders should he refuse and to pledge our postcoup support ambassador lodge met with diem he became convinced that diem would never drop nhu lodge informed his agency contacts they contacted plotters within the arvn high command lodge kennedy mcnamara and the joint chiefs met they discussed the cutoff of financial aid to the diem regime the cutoff was announced the plotters proceeded chief among them were general tran van don general le van kim and general duong van minh aka big minh agency operatives met with general don and general minh and promised them continued us financial aid and support kennedy determined that his administration would remain convincingly unaccountable and that the coup would publicly present itself as an allvietnamese affair the coup was planned and postponed throughout the early fall kennedys advisors included procoup and anticoup factions the anticoup faction argued that the autonomous nature of the coup might lead to another bay of pigs fiasco internal bickering diverted the plotters the generals argued over which position of power they would assume in postcoup saigon the coup was finally scheduled for it was implemented that afternoon madame nhu was in the us premier diem and ngo dinh nhu hid in the basement of the presidential palace insurgent units captured the palace the guard barracks and the police station diem and nhu were apprehended and given safe passage in an armored personnel carrier the carrier stopped at a railroad crossing diem and nhu were shot and stabbed to death a man military revolutionary council took over and then succumbed to internal squabbles concurrent with this riots swept the south and steady streams of viet cong infiltrated from the north arvn troops deserted in large numbers concurrent with this kennedy was assassinated lyndon johnson and his advisors reevaluated the ambiguously defined vietnamese policy of the kennedy administration and decided to expand our financialmilitary commitment general nguyen khanh toppled the military revolutionary council on bloodless describes it best the other generals abdicated and returned to their military fiefdoms concurrently the viet cong stepped up its southern incursion defeating the arvn in several encounters and staging a series of terrorist attacks in saigon including the bombing of a movie theater where three americans were killed throughout early the viet cong forces doubled to mostly recruited in the south with a commensurate improvement in their ordnance red chinese and sovietsupplied aks mortars and rocket launchers secretary mcnamara visited vietnam in march and toured the south in a propaganda effort to bolster premier khanh mcnamara returned to washington he proposed and secured president johnsons approval of an action memorandum the memorandum called for increased financial aid to provide the arvn with more aircraft and other ordnance premier khanh was allowed to stage crossborder raids against communist strongholds in laos and to study the feasibility of possible incursions into cambodia to interdict viet cong supply routes pentagon specialists started pinpointing north vietnamese targets for us bombing raids ambassador lodge resigned to pursue a career in domestic politics president johnson appointed general william c westmoreland as commander of the us military advisory group macv in vietnam westmoreland remains committed to a greatly expanded american presence there is now a formidable us contingent in the south among them servicemen accountants doctors mechanics and sundry others involved in dispensing the that johnson has pledged in fiscal aid much of the us donated food weaponry medicine gasoline and fertilizer has ended up on the black market the us presence in south vietnam is rapidly becoming the foundation of the south vietnamese economy johnson has approved a covert plan called oplan a which calls for larger incursions north of the th parallel an expanded propaganda effort and covert ops to intercept communist ships delivering material to the viet cong in the south the gulf of tonkin incident wherein two us destroyers were fired upon by communist seacraft and returned said fire was largely a staged and improvised event that johnson capitalized upon to get congressional sanction for planned bombing raids the bombing sorties that followed were limited to one day so as to not give the appearance of overreaction to the gulf of tonkin provocation as of this date there are just under advisors in vietnam and the bulk of them are in fact combat troops these troops are army special forces airborne rangers and support personnel president johnson has committed to a covert escalation plan which will allow him to introduce an additional troops by next summer expected north vietnamese provocations will help him push this troop commitment through congress the plan will allow for a large deployment of marines in the winter and spring of and a large influx of army infantry in the summer johnson is also committed to sustained bombing raids into north vietnam the raids will begin in the late winterearly spring of again agency analysts believe that johnson will commit to vietnam for the long haul the consensus is that he sees vietnam as a way to establish his anticommunist credentials to their fullest advantage and use them to counterbalance any political dissension he creates with his liberal domestic reforms this overall escalation should serve to cloak our incountry activities opium and its derivatives have fueled the vietnamese economy going back to its early frenchcolonial days intelligence units of the french army ran the opium trade and managed most of the opium dens in saigon and cholon from to the opium traffic has financed dozens of coups and coup attempts and the late ngo dinh nhu was planning to circumvent premier diems antiopium edict at the time of his death since the coup opium dens have reopened in saigon and in the heavily chinese enclave of cholon cholon is miles up the ben nghe channel from central saigon premier khanh has established a handsoff policy toward the dens which will serve us well it should be noted that khanh is extremely malleable and beholden to our presence in south vietnam he loves american money and will not risk offending even adjunct agency personnel such as our cadre he is not a puppet who pulls his own strings i doubt if hell last long and i doubt that his successors will give us any trouble the crop source for our potential merchandise is situated in laos near the vietnamese border the fields near ba na key are rich in the limestone soil component that poppy bulbs thrive on and dozens of largescale farms are situated there ba na key is close to the north vietnamese border which invalidates it for our purposes a strip of acreage further south near saravan is limestonerich and accessible to the south vietnamese border several poppy camps are situated near saravan they are run by laotian warlords who employ armies of overseers who work cliques of laotianvietnamese slaves who harvest the bulbs ive been grooming an englishspeaking laotian named tran lao dinh and my plan is to have you and tran purchase or somehow coopt the services of the laotian warlords the standard procedure is to refine the poppy sap into a morphinebase that can be further refined into heroin my goal would be to accomplish that at the farms and ship the base to your chemists lab in saigon we could fly it or move it by pt boat which would require a pilotnavigator familiar with vietnamese waterways the standard way to move morphinebase out of vietnam is via freighter to europe and china thats counterproductive in our case we need your chemist to refine it incountry in order to reduce the bulk size and render it easier to ship to las vegas please think of a way we can courier the finished product stateside and limit our exposure on both ends some closing thoughts remember im in this with six other agents and were stage covert with no agency sanction youll meet the other men on a needtoknow basis youre the operations boss and im the personnel runner i know youre anxious to start funneling money to the cause but were going to accrue large operating expenses incountry and out and i want to make sure were cash fluid first the agency has a frontcompany in australia that will trade vietnamese piastres for us dollars and we may be able to utilize a swiss bankaccount system for the laundering of our ultimate profits let me stress this now no morphinebase or fully refined merchandise should be allowed to slip into the hands of the us militaryfor accountabilitys sakeor into the hands of arvn personnel most arvns are highly corruptible and cannot be trusted around saleable narcotics i think youll like my end of the cadre ive coopted an army st lt named preston chaffee hes a language whiz airbornecertified and an allaround good scout

wayne tedrow jr us army nd airborne division former las vegas policeman chemistry degreebrigham young university tedrows solid hes proficient with small arms larger weaponry hell do a solid job on the chemical side he told me he studied opiate balances narcotic component theory in college his plan is to find human test pilots or guinea pigs to test maximum dosage levels on such as junkies or opium addicts with opiate tolerances that way he can take the refining process to the final level in saigon ship streetready merchandise back to vegas tedrows father is a big wheel in nevada tedrows very estranged from him but the old man has connections at nellis afb that we may be able to use more on this later laurent guery flash elorde you know them from our miami days theyve been mercing out of

was informed that pierre bondurant and wayne tedrow junior have gone on covert contract status with a stellar spy agency little birdies tell me things and i would be remiss not to share them with you wjl i was aware of that sir jeh they are stationed in vietnam no less wjl yes sir jeh would you care to expand your answers wjl id rather not be too specific i think you know enough about petes past dealings and wayne juniors chemistry background to be able to extrapolate jeh i am extrapolating at warp speed i must conclude that our italian friends have revised their fatuously conceived cleantown policy in las vegas wjl yes but the distribution will be rigorously localized jeh i see a salutary convergence the distribution will accommodate count draculas prejudices and facilitate our italian friends desire to bilk him wjl its an astute observation sir jeh our friends must bristle at the thought of jimmy hoffas forthcoming doom wjl they know hes finished sir they know the appeals process will terminate within two years jeh the attendant irony has not escaped me a gaudy homicide served to neutralize the dark prince yet the dark prince toppled his bete noire in the end wjl i have often considered that irony sir jeh the prince is now a senatorelect have you considered how hell fare wjl i havent given it much thought jeh a barefaced lie mr littell and wholly unworthy of you wjl ill concede sir jeh do you think he will sponsor antiorganized crime legislation wjl i would hope not jeh do you think he will attack organized crime from the senate floor wjl i would hope not jeh do you think he learned an enduring lesson from that gaudy homicide wjl i would hope so jeh i will not comment on your complex relationship with robert f kennedy wjl your comments to date are most eloquent sir jeh lets jump from the frying pan to the fire im meeting with martin lucifer king tomorrow wjl the purpose of the meeting sir jeh lucifer requested it he wants to discuss my attacks in the press lyle holly has informed me that lucifer has correctly added two and two and has determined that ive run blackbag operations against him which must vex him as well wjl how did he learn do you suspect a leak jeh no i publicly referred to information that lucifer disseminated in private and betrayed bug and tap placements in that manner those references were of course deliberate wjl i concluded that sir jeh lucifer rustin and the others now shut their mouths in hotel rooms lucifer has confined his sexual antics to beds outside my electronic range wjl youre implying a larger design here sir jeh you are correct i am going to drastically upscale my operations against lucifer and the sclc you are to stop donating organizedcrime money to the organization but to continue to meet with bayard rustin you will continue to portray yourself as an ardent supporter whose mob pilfering source has run dry you will wear wires to your meetings with rustin you will wheedle him into suggesting meetings you will exploit his homosexuality and susceptibility to sincere and politically unstable men wjl yes sir jeh this endeavor will be stage covert i have dubbed it operation black rabbit the title bows to the sex drive prowess and heedlessly puerile demeanor of our longeared friends you will receive copies of most memoranda because you are a deft extrapolator of complex data code names have been assigned to the key personnel you will use them in place of real names they derive from the rabbit motif and hint at the inherent psyches of the subjects wjl youve whetted my appetite sir jeh martin luther king will be red rabbit bayard rustin will be pink rabbit lyle holly will be white rabbit you will be most appropriately known as crusader rabbit wjl its a witty touch sir jeh i want you to learn what king has planned in the south your data will supplant lyle llollys im going to launch a whitehate cointelpro in louisiana alabama and mississippi and i want information to complement that incursion wjl youve targeted the klan sir for mailfraud indictments jeh ive targeted the most violent inept felonyprone and altogether outlandish klan groups in that threestate vector god will punish them for lynchings and castrations should he lapse on the side of compassion and find them unjustified i will punish them for federal mail fraud wjl youve divided the punishment well sir jeh the cointelpro will begin in june your old chum wayne senior has recruited a man to form his own splinter klan the man will return from army service and begin his assignment in may wjl will wayne senior run jeh wayne senior will be codenamed father rabbit the klan runner will be named wild rabbit i have withdrawn the funding for all of wayne seniors longstanding informant klans with his approval i want to consolidate my antiklan broadside under the banner of wild rabbits stalwart group the regal knights of the kkk wjl the name packs a punch sir jeh youre being egregiously flip mr littell i know you are delighted and i know you disapprove as well do not underline the latter wjl i apologize sir jeh to continue both operations will be run by dwight holly who will be codenamed blue rabbit dwight has resigned from the us attorneys office and has transferred back to the bureau i chose him because he is a brilliant operative he is also lyle hollys brother and lyle knows the sclc better than any white man alive wjl im confused sir i thought dwight was estranged from wayne senior jeh estrangement comes and goes dwight and wayne senior have reconciled the negroes that wayne junior killed were simply a temporary roadblock wayne senior is estranged from wayne junior now in the manner of the patriarchy worldwide wjl will i need to deal with wayne sen jeh not directly you trumped him on your courier arrangement and hes sustained a simmering grudge wjl dwight holly has never been a friend to me sir jeh dwight acknowledges your gifts however reluctantly you saved him face on the deadnegro front which indebted him to you that said i must observe that dwight chalfont holly hates indebtedness and was having you spottailed by agents of the us attorneys office as part of an illconceived plan to build a derogatory profile against you he considered you a dangerous presence in nevada wjl given dwights nature thats a compliment jeh it pained him to pull the tails lle gives up very badly you share that trait wjl thank you sir jeh thank me with hard work on operation black rabbit wjl i will sir in the meantime would you like me to pull any of the bugs youve placed against the sclc jeh no they might get careless and talk wjl thats true sir jeh lucifer has been awarded the nobel peace prize it infuriates me as much as im sure it moves you wjl im moved yes jeh those three words define your value to me wjl yes sir jeh learn your rabbit codes wjl i will sir jeh good afternoon mr littell wjl good afternoon sir document insert washington post article hoover

abernathy and walter fauntroy the meeting took place in hoovers office at fbi headquarters a range of topics were discussed including the alleged presence of communists and communist sympathizers within the civilrights movement and the fbis handling of police brutality charges levied by negroes and civilrights workers in the south king clarified recent statements he had made pertaining to the conduct of fbi agents in mississippi and their alleged fraternizing with local lawenforcement officials hoover countered with a recitation of recent fbi successes in mississippi and alabama it was expected that rumors of fbi bugs and wiretaps allegedly deployed against king and the southern christian leadership conference would be discussed this was not the case dr abernathy said the dialogue was increasingly subsumed by mr hoovers monologues against communists and his repeated contention that in due time attitudes and practices in the south would change mr hoover encouraged dr king to get out the negro vote mr fauntroy said he did not offer a substantive pledge of support for civilrights workers in great peril at this very moment both aides described the meeting which lasted one hour

dr king as an undaunted champion of peace the first person in the western world to have shown us that a struggle can be waged without violence dr king visibly moved by the introduction climbed on stage to accept the award he said that he considered it a profound recognition that nonviolence is the answer to the crucial political and moral question of our time the need for man to overcome violence and oppression without resorting to violence and oppression speaking into glaring television lights and a sea of rapt faces dr king continued i refuse to accept the belief that man is mere flotsam and jetsam in the river of life which surrounds him he said i refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daylight of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality citing the tortuous road which has led from montgomery alabama to oslo dr king said that the nobel prize was really for the millions of negroes on whose behalf he stood here today their names will never make whos who dr king said yet when the years have rolled past and when the blazing light of truth is focused on this marvelous age in which we live men and women will know and children will be taught that we have a finer land a better people a more noble civilization because these humble children of god were willing to suffer for

be discharged from the army and will terminate his cia ops at that time we can expect him to begin work on operation black rabbit in early per targets red rabbit martin luther king and pink rabbit bayard rustin and our objectives said objectives to discredit red rabbit and pink rabbit and undermine their subversively socialistic designs via the accumulating and disseminating of incriminating andor embarrassing data pertaining to their communist associations hypocritical moral behavior and sexual degeneracy to precisely orchestrate the release of said data in order to reveal the socialistic underpinnings of the entire civilrights movement to create distrust within the civilrights movement to engender distrust and resentment against red rabbit within the negro community and undercut the recent nonnegro cache that red rabbit has engineered to reveal the socialistcommunist designs of red rabbit the sclc and the civilrights movement and influence an effective political backlash to assail red rabbits obviously disturbed and deteriorated psyche with an anonymous mail campaign to implement the whitehate arm of operation black rabbit concurrent with in order to buttress the fbis antiklan antiracist credentials and rebuff antifbi sentiment disseminated by civilrights provocateurs and members of the liberalsocialist press in addition i urge sclc mail covers the intercepting reading logging and resending of all us and foreign mail sent to the main and regional sclc offices sclc trash covers the examination logging evidentiary seizure of all garbage and discard material dumped in trash bins at all sclc offices an anonymous letter to be written from a negro perspective and sent to red rabbits home in atlanta the letter will begin king look into your heart and will recount what a grim farce the nobel peace prize and red rabbits other recent accolades are held to be within the mainstream negro community the letter will subtly urge red rabbit to commit suicide rather than risk further disfavor within the negro community and will include bugtap excerpts pertaining to red rabbits promiscuity to buttress your deliberate public statements and convince red rabbit that those statements are widely received and accepted by mainstream negroes in closing our bugs and wiretaps remain in place although they are severely compromised per our last

rabbit met pink rabbit on two occasions in washington dc and forwarded his tapes to me per stagei covert guidelines i personally transcribed the tapes and destroyed the live tape copies tape and tape transcripts are included addendum a with this memorandum per guidelines please read and burn although there were numerous moments of poor sound quality i feel confident in my assessment of the tapes it is obvious that the effeminate and witty pink rabbit is much taken with the wit beautifully feigned sincerity and ardently expressed ideals of crusader rabbit you were farsighted in your instinct to match them up pink rabbit accepted crusader rabbits stated withdrawal of pilfered organizedcrime monies with magnanimity and both men expressed a desire to keep in touch that desire expressed on tape was confirmed by the second meeting of pink rabbit and crusader rabbit recorded on tape crusader rabbit deftly questioned pink rabbit on both tapes see transcripts to date however pink rabbit has revealed only information already revealed by our inhouse sclc source white rabbit the broad outline includes a planned agitation in selma alabama picketing boycotts voterregistration drives b a projected school desegregation drive in chicago c early plans but no compelling specifics regarding sclc participation in a second freedom summer campaign of agitation in mississippi d planned agitation in and around bogalusa louisiana to commence in ive reviewed the recent tapes retrieved from our remaining hotelroom bugposts red rabbit pink rabbit and other sclc members have stayed in

remailed numerous letters of support along with large and small donations to the sclc many of them sent by notable leftistsympathizers members of communist front groups and movie stars among them danny kaye burt lancaster walter pidgeon burl ives spencer tracy rock hudson natalie wood and numerous folk singers of lesser repute see addendum list b for details per guidelines please read and burn per trash covers to date assigned agents have collected and logged large quantities of discarded leftwing periodicals and risque magazines with photographs of nude white women along with innocuous and nonitemized trash see addendum list c for inventory note an addendum list b inventory log will soon be compiled stored per stage covert guidelines it will be used to facilitate should you so direct an sclc bank account cover to determine if the abovenoted contributions were banked legally which should help us gauge the viability of an irs crosscheck of the sclcs federal and state tax returns in conclusion all covers to proceed as directed a summary report on the whitehate arm of operation black rabbit to follow respectfully blue rabbit document insert internal memorandum topic whitehateoperation black rabbit to director from blue rabbit marked stage coverteyes onlyread and burn sir my first summary report on the whitehate arm of obr i have compiled with the help of father rabbits aides a list of potentially dissident klansmen now at loose ends since father rabbit dissolved his previously funded informant klan groups in see addendum a for list of said klansmen note per stage guidelines please read and burn said addendum i have retained an original copy per guidelines also father rabbit has supplied see addendum bread burn a name list of white male hatepamphlet subscribers in louisiana and mississippi all devotees of specific segregationistantinegro tract series distributed by father rabbits organization a criminal records crosscheck of these subscribers has yielded the names of men with misdemeanor and felony arrests and memberships in extreme rightwing organizations my plan would be to have father rabbit solicit these men by mail under an anonymous patriot letterhead and refer them by mail to wild rabbit upon his release from the us army wild rabbit would assess the mail he has received contact the most promising prospects and build the nucleus of his new klan group on that basis he will establish boundaries as to what and what not his recruits can do and gather information on their previous hategroup associations wild rabbit will also define their future informant duties crusader rabbit and white rabbit have mentioned the proposed second freedom summer agitation campaign in mississippi and planned agitation in and around bogalusa louisiana wild rabbit wants to exploit these situations and i believe that if he delivers a properly restrained but somehow flamboyant show of force in that region at that time he will be able to mobilize a sizable number of recruits resultant to further induce subservience in his recruits wild rabbit will supply them with lowquality rifles and sidearms purchased by his friend charles chuck rogers white maleage a covert cia contract employee currently serving with wild rabbit in vietnam rogers has extensive gun connections among rightist cuban exile groups in the gulf coast region wild rabbit has also established a hateleaflet mail ministry among convicts and exconvicts he knew while working as a missouri state prison guard and plans to recruit from the eager beaver parolees who contact him upon their release i believe that this is also a viable recruiting approach in conclusion i believe that we are theoretically operational as of this date please respond as your schedule allows respectfully blue rabbit document insert internal memorandum topic operation black rabbito memo to blue rabbit from director marked stage coverteyes onlyread and burn blue rabbit consider the

upon reading js were operational on both ends now heres the summary you asked for its all running smooth a milt chargin greased cops working the records divisions of the vegas pd clark county sheriffs got a list of all the previously busted colored junkies in west vegas b i recruited expendable colored pushers to work the bottomrung distribution in west lv theyve got menial casino jobs e were happy to get the gigs i gave them copies of the prey mentd junkie list had them supply the junkies with free pops taken from our st stateside shipment of the free samples got them anxious for more i told my guys to push free tastes on anybody who asked colored only they got a lot of takers we got a lot of steady clients milt cs word not mine c i lean on the guys periodically up to now im convinced that they havent stolen kadre merchandise havent sold to nonnegro clients havent snitched off kadre or tiger kab personnel havent bragged to their lowlife pals implicated kadre or tiger kab personnel will not do so if they get popped which is unlikely because milt has greased the lvpd sheriffs narco squads has secured a handsoff policy if any of the is popped the plan is to bail them out clip them before they talk too much so everything is buffered tiger drivers deliver the merchandise to drop points the pushers pick it up distribute it funnel the money back the same way the drivers are all solid pros will not talk if busted on his one stateside run wayne periodically spottailed the pushers determined that they werent skimming or fucking up other ways waynes got an evil reputation on the

the federal pedig ward pulled his piece ward shot chucks eyes out part iv coercion july november document insert internal memorandum to director from blue rabbit topic operation black rabbit marked stage covert eyes only read and burn sir per the church bombing and related actions in bogalusa louisiana locally assigned agents have completed their internal investigation they have reported to me orally have filed no official reports and have confirmed the official judgment of the bogalusa police department that the accidental explosion was caused by a leaky pipe main that judgment should stand as the authoritative verdict on this matter it is crucial to the continued success of the whitehate arm of operation black rabbit ive spoken to wild rabbit his denials of complicity in the bombing were not convincing i warned him that church bombings were outside his operating parameters and that no such incidents should happen again wild rabbit seemed cowed and did not protest the reprimand it should be noted that his arms bore odd bruises and that in fact he seemed to have sustained a recent beating wild rabbit refused to comment on his bruises and overall beaten appearance i queried him on the possible presence of his known vietnam associate charles rogers per the time of the church incident and wild rabbit became visibly upset it should be noted the dismembered bodies of rogers elderly parents were found in their houston texas home on and rogers who cannot be located is the leading suspect in this double homicide i checked vietnameseus passport records for the two weeks preceding the assumed dateofdeath learned that rogers flew from saigon to houston on and that the cargo on his ifight included bomb material it is my belief that rogers supplied the explosives for the bombing and that wild rabbit assisted him in this unsanctioned provocation it should also be noted that local agents spotted crusader rabbit at the negro hospital shortly after the bombing he was visibly distraught and of unkempt appearance i checked regionwide ifight and carrental records and learned that crusader rabbit flew from las vegas to new orleans and drove to bogalusa i consider it likely that he met his client caries marcello in new orleans and took advantage of its proximity to bogalusa i view crusader rabbits trip to bogalusa as fully in character and it does not surprise me that he wished to view the planned civilrights agitation in person please respond per crusader rabbit respectfully blue rabbit document insert internal memorandum to blue rabbit from director topic operation black rabbit marked stage covert eyes only read and burn blue rabbit take all measures to see that the accidental explosion verdict is sustained in the bogalusa case allow wild rabbit to claim credit for the bombing and thus gain credibility for his new klan unit continue to discourage wild rabbit from committing acts of violence outside his operating parameters i agree crusader rabbits presence in bogalusa was entirely in character albeit marginally disturbing crusader rabbit is a close associate of pete bondurant who is a close associate of charles rogers the confluence

sclc resources and undermine the credibility of the civilrights movement it will enrage the american status quo perhaps cost him congressional and presidential support and will earn him the enmity of his limousine liberal supporters the true danger of his plans is that they may well serve to fuel and unite a coalition of hardcore communists communist sympathizers farleft intellectuals disaffected

addendum marked recorded at the director s request classified confidential a director s eyes only speaking director blue rabbit dir good morning br good morning sir dir i was saddened by the news on your brother you have my condolences br thank you sir dir he was a valued colleague that makes the circumstances surrounding his death all the more troubling br i wont apologize for him sir he indulged occasional binges and behaved accordingly dir the suicide aspect troubles me a neighbor saw him back his car off that hillside which confirmed the lapds findings and the coroners verdict br he was impetuous sir hed been married four times dir yes in the manner of one mickey rooney br sir did you dir ive reviewed the lapds paperwork and ive spoken to the las vegas sac white rabbits house had been thoroughly ransacked a neighbor told officers that white rabbits souvenir gun collection had been stolen along with the contents of his desk and file cabinets agents questioned the collection crew at the desert inn a man admitted that he broke into white rabbits house two days after the suicide and that it had already been ransacked which is undisputedly a lie the lapd officers who responded to the suicide call said that they found the door open and that they viewed the ransacked state of the living room br it fits sir my brother had run up casino debts before although never to such a large amount dir did white rabbit keep a private file on the dealings of the sclc br i dont know sir he adhered to a needtoknow policy with me on most security matters dir crusader rabbits proximity to the incident bothers me br it bothers me as well sir dir was he being spottailed during the time preceding white rabbits binge br no sir we had already set white rabbit up to meet him and i didnt want complications nevada agents had been rotating on and off of him though dir crusader rabbit keeps popping up he hops from catastrophe to catastrophe with rabbitlike aplomb br yes sir dir he appears in bogalusa voila wild rabbits friend charles rogers disappears he appears in las vegas voila he views the prelude to white rabbits suicide br you know my distaste for crusader rabbit sir that said i should add that he did call and warn you dir yes and i spoke to him yesterday he told me that he helped white rabbit outside and that white rabbit simply passed out in his car his story sounded plausible and the assigned agents have not been able to crack it they tell me that he did terminate white rabbits casino credit which further buttresses his credibility br he may have somehow capitalized on the incident sir i seriously doubt that he provoked it dir im keeping an open mind for the moment crusader rabbit is capable of outlandish provocations br yes sir dir to digress tell me how wild rabbit is behaving br hes doing well sir hes building up his klan unit nicely chiefly on the basis of father rabbits recruitments hes debriefed a number of recruits with mailfraud information on rival kiaverns and paramilitary groups the bogalusa incident appears to have chastened him and he seems to be adhering to his operational parameters dir wild rabbit is an obstreperous bunny who has endured very obvious reprimands br thats my assessment sir but i dont know who the reprimander is and the rogers angle eludes me dir the chain of events is seductive rogers kills his parents and disappears a negro church explodes miles east br i only like riddles i can solve sir dir i had the houston sac run a passport check pete bondurant and wayne tedrow junior arrived in houston shortly after rogers i think they killed him but their motive flummoxes me br again sir crusader rabbit and his proximity dir yes an additional vexation br sir do you dir red rabbit will seek to attend white rabbits funeral will you allow it br yes sir dir may i ask why br my reason may sound ifip sir dir indulge yourself walk on the wild side br my brother enjoyed red rabbit sir he knew him for what he was and liked him anyway he can come and give a big oration and repeat his i have a dream speech for all i care lyle only made so im prone to humor his memory dir the fraternal bond deconstructed bravo dwight br thank you sir dir has it occurred to you that crusader and white rabbit share certain characteristics and a common moral void br it has sir dir is your hatred for red rabbit escalating br it is sir it was my hope that we could escalate black rabbit and recoup our loss dir in due time for now i want to wait and assess an adjunct plan br covert ops dir no a formal shakedown br run by field agents dir no run by one pierre bondurant known in unpolite circles as mr extortion and the shakedown king br hes a rough piece of work dir hes close to crusader rabbit we might learn a few

operation black rabbit addendum marked recorded at the director s request classified confidential a directors eyes only speaking director blue rabbit dir good morning br good morning sir dir lets discuss wild rabbits work in mississippi the oxymoronic phrase redneck intelligence network comes to mind br wild rabbit has been doing well sir our stipends have allowed him to recruit and secure intelligence and father rabbit has supplied him with funds as well he told me that hes donating a portion of his hatetract profits to wild rabbits incursion dir and the wellfunded wild rabbit is achieving results br he is sir his regal knights have been infiltrating other hate groups and supplying wild rabbit with information i think well have some mailfraud indictments before too long dir father rabbits donations are in part selfserving he aids wild rabbits cause and depletes the resources of his hatetract rivals br yes sir dir is wild rabbit remaining tractable br he is although ive learned that hes running weaponry to pete bondurants narcotics cadre as i understand it he secures the weapons from armory heists and army base pilfering which is odd because i havent been able to find any recently filed reports on such incidents anywhere in the south dir yes odd does describe it that said do you think wild rabbit will retain an acceptable level of deniability pertaining to his gunrunning activities br i do sir but should i tell him to stop dir no i like his connection to bondurant remember well be approaching le grand pierre when we move black rabbit into the shakedown phase br i heard that he had a heart attack last month dir a pity and the prognosis br i think its guardedly positive sir dir good well let him recover and then add some stress to his overtaxed arteries br yes sir dir lets discuss crusader rabbit have you accrued any substantive data br yes and no sir weve gotten nothing off the spot tails and the trash and mail covers and im convinced that hes too technically skilled to bug and tap hes retained his friendship with pink rabbit and visits him in dc which is hardly incriminating since you urged him to do so dir your tone betrays you youre tantalizing me shall i hazard a guess br please do sir dir your revelations pertain to crusaders women br thats correct sir dir expand your answers please i have a lunch date in the year br crusader has been seeing janice lukens father rabbits exwife in las dir we know that pray continue br he lives with a woman in los angeles her alleged name is jane fentress dr alleged is correct i helped to establish her identity two years ago a new orleans agent planted her college transcript br theres much more to her sir i think she could serve as our wedge if we need to disrupt crusader dir expand your thoughts the millennium bodes br i had her spottailed my man took a set of prints off a glass she left at a restaurant we ran them and got her real name arden louise breen breen married name bruvick bruvick dir continue br her father was a leftwing unionist the teamsters killed him in and its still a st louis pd unsolved allegedly the woman held no grudge against the teamsters allegedly because her father forced her to become a callhouse prostitute she absconded on a kcpd receiving stolen goods warrant in at the same time her husband embezzled some money from a kansas city teamster local and disappeared dir continue br heres the ripe part carlos marcellos front corporation bailed her out on the kansas city bounce she disappeared then shes got a bookkeeping background and shes rumored to have had a longterm affair with that old mob hand jules schiffrin dir boffo news dwight well worth your vexing preambles br thank you sir dir i think your tale boils down to one salient truth carlos marcello does not trust crusader rabbit br i came to that conclusion sir dir pull the tails along with the trash and mail covers if we need to get at crusader well go through the woman br

black rabbit to blue rabbit from director marked stage covert eyes only read and burn blue rabbit i have been digesting my july phone call to crusader rabbit for some time i could not read his response to my mention of white rabbits alleged confession and perceived his mental state to be problematic white rabbit was of course your brother i have given your repeated assertions that his confession was fabricated considerable thought you have stated that crusader rabbit is the only one in our purview capable of such a fabrication and i cannot in any way dispute that assessment crusader rabbit troubles me as you have noted his paramour arden breenjane fentress disappeared last october and has presumably been killed by members of organized crime i suspect that her absence and assuredly grisly fate have contributed to crusader rabbits funk you have often characterized crusader rabbit as a wimp but i would add that his propensity for kamikaze action marks him as the worlds most dangerous wimp all told i think we should reinstate our spotsurveillance of crusader rabbit and reinstate our trash and mail covers these actions will supplant our decision to exclude him from all aspects of operation black rabbit per the shakedown adjunct i veto your recommendation that we target red rabbit red rabbit will simply be too wary of entrapment the target will be pink rabbit his

hes in sir along with fred otash and freddy turentine dir has he recruited his bait br he has sir hell be using a homosexual actor named sal mineo dir im delighted young mineo was boffo in exodus and the gene krupa story br hes a talented youth sir dir he is talented and given to greek proffigacy he has indulged numerous liaisons with male movie stars among them james dean the human ashtray br big rabbit has chosen well sir dir to continue br big rabbit has a wedge on mineo which he declines to reveal he wants him protected if hes arrested by an outside agency i think big rabbit is buying himself protection too dir hes buying were selling i would be delighted to protect big rabbit and young mineo br i gave big rabbit a fact sheet for mineo to memorize we want him to be able to convince pink rabbit that hes a civilrights zealot dir that will be no great stretch actors are morally decentered and psychically unhinged they cling to their scripts of the moment with great verve it fills their voids of emptiness and allots them the will to exist br yes sir dir to continue describe your meeting with crusader rabbit br to start ill finally have to concede that hes just as gifted as youve always contended that said i dont know how trustwortby he is or isnt for that matter he seemed sincerely shocked when i mentioned my brothers alleged leaks to bobby kennedy and the judiciary committee but he may have calculated his response in advance dir do you remain convinced that your brother did not write that confession br more than ever sir although now im starting to think that it was not crusader rabbit i think theres a fair chance that it could have been someone within the sclc who had a private investigator or someone of that ilk sweep and find the bugs and taps and then decide to capitalize on my brothers death and send in the confession dir i will concede the possibility br i think your basic assessment of crusader rabbit is valid sir he lives for intrigue hell

accepted immediately dir i thought he would br im glad you approved my proposal sir public opinion has turned against electronic surveillance and we need organizedcrime wires in place dir i would amend your statement we need covertly planted deniable bugs monitored by handpicked agents in place br yes sir dir how did you describe the assignment br i said sixteen cities stage covert i mentioned mike lymans restaurant in los angeles lombardos in san francisco the grapevine tavern in st louis and a few others dir did you mention the stately el encanto hotel in santa barbara br i did sir dir how did crusader react br he didnt he obviously has no idea that bobby kennedy keeps a suite there dir the attendant irony delights me crusader rabbit bugs prince bobbys hotel digs hes convinced the suite belongs to a prince of organized crime br its a pisser sir dir crusader rabbit is an entrenched bobbyphile youre sure that he has no knowledge of bobbys suite br im certain sir ive got the

digress i had a long conversation with mr hoover yesterday i expressed concern about the degree to which his antiking incursions had already become public knowledge i mentioned his statements about king the sclcs bug and wiretap accusations and reports on the letter which was sent to king and urged him to commit suicide which has been detailed in several leftwing periodicals i told him that to further protect the whitehate and antiking arms of operation black rabbit and any escalations that might arise from them a cosmeticized largely downscaled antiking file should be created and stored in the fbi archives where it would remain and stand ready for scrutiny in the event of congressional subpoena or subpoena for civil lawsuit mr hoover understood that this mockfile would serve to obfuscate the rowdier aspects of obr protect bureau prestige and buttress the validity of his earlier less vindictive digs at king and the sclc he charged me to create file entries combine them with file entries pertaining to events within public knowledge and whip them into an overall package i will undertake and accomplish this over the next several months this mockfile will of course serve to obfuscate our independent escalations im codenaming the file operation zorro a reference to the fictional dogooder with the black mask im open to suggestions per the mockfile entries let me know if
