william faulkner the sound and the fury an introduction for the sound and the fury the southern review ns i wrote this book and learned to read i had learned a little about writing from soldiers payhow to approach language words not with seriousness so much as an essayist does but with a kind of alert respect as you approach dynamite even with joy as you approach women perhaps with the same secretly unscrupulous intentions but when i finished the sound and the fury i discovered that there is actually something to which the shabby term art not only can but must be applied i discovered then that i had gone through all that i had ever read from henry james through henty to newspaper murders without making any distinction or digesting any of it as a moth or a goat might after the sound and the fury and without heeding to open another book and in a series of delayed repercussions like summer thunder i discovered the flauberts and dostoievskys and conrads whose books i had read ten years ago with the sound and the fury i learned to read and quit reading since i have read nothing since nor do i seem to have learned anything since while writing sanctuary the next novel to the sound and the fury that part of me which learned as i wrote which perhaps is the very force which drives a writer to the travail of invention and the drudgery of putting seventy five or a hundred thousand words on paper was absent because i was still reading by repercussion the books which i had swallowed whole ten years and more ago i learned only from the writing of sanctuary that there was something missing something which the sound and the fury gave me and sanctuary did not when i began as i lay dying i had discovered what it was and knew that it would be also missing in this case because this would be a deliberate book i set out deliberately to write a tourdeforce before i ever put pen to paper and set down the first word i knew what the last word would be and almost where the last period would fall before i began i said i am going to write a book by which at a pinch i can stand or fall if i never touch ink again so when i finished it the cold satisfaction was there as i had expected but as i had also expected the other quality which the sound and the fury had given me was absent that emotion definite and physical and yet nebulous to describe that ecstasy that eager and joyous faith and anticipation of surprise which the yet unmarred sheet beneath my hand held inviolate and unfailing waiting for release it was not there in as i lay dying i said it is because i knew too much about this book before i began to write it i said more than likely i shall never again have to know this much about a book before i begin to write it and next time it will return i waited almost two years then i began light in august knowing no more about it than a young woman pregnant walking along a strange country road i thought i will recapture it now since i know no more about this book than i did about the sound and the fury when i sat down before the first blank page it did not return the written pages grew in number the story was going pretty well i would sit down to it each morning without reluctance yet still without that anticipation and that joy which alone ever made writing pleasure to me the book was almost finished before i acquiesced to the fact that it would not recur since i was now aware before each word was written down just what the people would do since now i was deliberately choosing among possibilities and probabilities of behavior and weighing and measuring each choice by the scale of the jameses and conrads and balzacs i knew that i had read too much that i had reached that stage which all young writers must pass through in which he believes that he has learned too much about his trade i received a copy of the printed book and i found that i didnt even want to see what kind of jacket smith had put on it i seemed to have a vision of it and the other ones subsequent to the sound and the fury ranked in order upon a shelf while i looked at the titled backs of them with a flagging attention which was almost distaste and upon which each succeeding title registered less and less until at last attention itself seemed to say thank god i shall never need to open any one of them again i believed that i knew then why i had not recaptured that first ecstasy and that i should never again recapture it that whatever treenovels i should write in the future would be written without reluctance but also without anticipation or joy that in the sound and the fury i had already put perhaps the only thing in literature which would ever move me very much caddy climbing the pear tree to look in the window at her grandmothers funeral while quentin and jason and benjy and the negroes looked up at the muddy seat of her drawers this is the only one of the seven novels which i wrote without any accompanying feeling of drive or effort or any following feeling of exhaustion or relief or distaste when i began it i had no plan at all i wasnt even writing a book i was thinking of books publication only in the reverse in saying to myself i wont have to worry about publishers liking or not liking this at all four years before i had written soldiers pay it didnt take long to write and it got published quickly and made me about five hundred dollars i said writing novels is easy you dont make much doing it but it is easy i wrote mosquitoes it wasnt quite so easy to write and it didnt get published quite as quickly and it made me about four hundred dollars i said apparently there is more to writing novels being a novelist than i thought i wrote sartoris it took much longer and the publisher refused it at once but i continued to shop it about for three years with a stubborn and fading hope perhaps to justify the time which i had spent writing it this hope died slowly though it didnt hurt at all one day i seemed to shut a door between me and all publishers addresses and book lists i said to myself now i can write now i can make myself a vase like that which the old roman kept at his bedside and wore the rim slowly away with kissing it so i who had never had a sister and was fated to lose my daugher in infancy set out to make myself a beautiful and tragic little girl an introduction to the sound and the fury mississippi quarterly summer art is no part of southern life in the north it seems to be different it is the hardest minor stone in manhattans foundation it is a part of the glitter or shabbiness of the streets the arrowing buildings rise out of it and because of it to be torn down and arrow again there will be people leading small bourgeois lives those countless and almost invisible bones of its articulation lacking any one of which the whole skeleton might collapse whose bread will derive from itpolyglot boys and girls progressing from tenement schools to editorial rooms and art galleries men with grey hair and paunches who run linotype machines and take up tickets at concerts and then go sedately home to brooklyn and suburban stations where children and grandchildren await themlong after the descendants of irish politicians and neapolitan racketeers are as forgotten as the wild indians and the pigeon and of chicago too of that rhythm not always with harmony or tune lusty loudvoiced always changing and always young drawing from a river basin which is almost a continent young men and women into its living unrest and then spewing them forth again to write chicago in new england and virginia and europe but in the south art to become visible at all must become a ceremony a spectacle something between a gypsy encampment and a church bazaar given by a handful of alien mummers who must waste themselves in protest and active selfdefense until there is nothing left with which to speaka single week say of furious endeavor for a show to be held on friday night and then struck and vanished leaving only a paint stiffened smock or a worn out typewriter ribbon in the corner and perhaps a small bill for cheesecloth or bunting in the hands of an astonished and bewildered tradesman perhaps this is because the south i speak in the sense of the indigenous dream of any given collection of men having something in common be it only geography and climate which shape their economic and spiritual aspirations into cities into a pattern of houses or behavior is old since dead new york whatever it may believe of itself is young since alive it is still a logical and unbroken progression from the dutch and chicago even boasts of being young but the south as chicago is the middlewest and new york the east is dead killed by the civil war there is a thing known whimsically as the new south to be sure but it is not the south it is a land of immigrants who are rebuilding the towns and cities into replicas of towns and cities in kansas and iowa and illinois with skyscrapers and striped canvas awnings instead of wooden balconies and teaching the young men who sell the gasoline and the waitresses in the restaurants to say o yeah and to speak with hard rs and hanging over the intersections of quiet and shaded streets where no one save northern tourists in cadillacs and lincolns ever pass at a gait faster than a horse trots changing redandgreen lights and savage and peremptory bells yet this art which has no place in southern life is almost the sum total of the southern artist it is his breath blood flesh all not so much that it is forced back upon him or that he is forced bodily into it by the circumstance forced to choose lady and tiger fashion between being an artist and being a man he does it deliberately he wishes it so this has always been true of him and of him alone only southerners have taken horsewhips and pistols to editors about the treatment or maltreatment of their manuscript thisthe actual pistolswas in the old days of course we no longer succumb to the impulse but it is still there still within us because it is himself that the southerner is writing about not about his environment who has figuratively speaking taken the artist in him in one hand and his milieu in the other and thrust the one into the other like a clawing and spitting cat into a croker sack and he writes we have never got and probably will never get anywhere with music or the plastic forms we need to talk to tell since oratory is our heritage we seem to try in the simple furious breathing or writing span of the individual to draw a savage indictment of the contemporary scene or to escape from it into a makebelieve region of swords and magnolias and mockingbirds which perhaps never existed anywhere both of the courses are rooted in sentiment perhaps the ones who write savagely and bitterly of the incest in clayfloored cabins are the most sentimental anyway each course is a matter of violent partisanship in which the writer unconsciously writes into every line and phrase his violent despairs and rages and frustrations or his violent prophesies of still more violent hopes that cold intellect which can write with calm and complete detachment and gusto of its contemporary scene is not among us i do not believe there lives the southern writer who can say without lying that writing is any fun to him perhaps we do not want it to be i seem to have tried both of the courses i have tried to escape and i have tried to indict after five years i look back at the sound and the fury and see that that was the fuming point in this book i did both at one time when i began the book i had no plan at all i wasnt even writing a book previous to it i had written three novels with progressively decreasing ease and pleasure and reward or emolument the third one was shopped about for three years during which i sent it from publisher to publisher with a kind of stubborn and fading hope of at least justifying the paper i had used and the time i had spent writing it this hope must have died at last because one day it suddenly seemed as if a door had clapped silently and forever to between me and all publishers addresses and booklists and i said to myself now i can write now i can just write whereupon i who had three brothers and no sisters and was destined to lose my first daughter in infancy began to write about a little girl i did not realise then that i was trying to manufacture the sister which i did not have and the daughter which i was to lose though the former might have been apparent from the fact that caddy had three brothers almost before i wrote her name on paper i just began to write about a brother and a sister splashing one another in the brook and the sister fell and wet her clothing and the smallest brother cried thinking that the sister was conquered or perhaps hurt or perhaps he knew that he was the baby and that she would quit whatever water battles to comfort him when she did so when she quit the water fight and stooped in her wet garments above him the entire story which is all told by that same little brother in the first section seemed to explode on the paper before me i saw that peaceful glinting of that branch was to become the dark harsh flowing of time sweeping her to where she could not return to comfort him but that just separation division would not be enough not far enough it must sweep her into dishonor and shame too and that benjy must never grow beyond this moment that for him all knowing must begin and end with that fierce panting paused and stooping wet figure which smelled like trees that he must never grow up to where the grief of bereavement could be leavened with understanding and hence the alleviation of rage as in the case of jason and of oblivion as in the case of quentin i saw that they had been sent to the pasture to spend the afternoon to get them away from the house during the grandmothers funeral in order that the three brothers and the nigger children could look up at the muddy seat of caddys drawers as she climbed the tree to look in the window at the funeral without then realising the symbology of the soiled drawers for here again hers was the courage which was to face later with honor the shame which she was to engender which quentin and jason could not face the one taking refuge in suicide the other in vindictive rage which drove him to rob his bastard niece of the meagre sums which caddy could send her for i had already gone on to night and the bedroom and dilsey with the mudstained drawers scrubbing the naked backside of that doomed little girltrying to cleanse with the sorry byblow of its soiling that body flesh whose shame they symbolised and prophesied as though she already saw the dark future and the part she was to play in it trying to hold that crumbling household together then the story was complete finished there was dilsey to be the future to stand above the fallen ruins of the family like a ruined chimney gaunt patient and indomitable and benjy to be the past he had to be an idiot so that like dilsey he could be impervious to the future though unlike her by refusing to accept it at all without thought or comprehension shapeless neuter like something eyeless and voiceless which might have lived existed merely because of its ability to suffer in the beginning of life half fluid groping a pallid and helpless mass of all mindless agony under sun in time yet not of it save that he could nightly carry with him that fierce courageous being who was to him but a touch and a sound that may be heard on any golf links and a smell like trees into the slow bright shapes of sleep the story is all there in the first section as benjy told it i did not try deliberately to make it obscure when i realised that the story might be printed i took three more sections all longer than benjys to try to clarify it but when i wrote benjys section i was not writing it to be printed if i were to do it over now i would do it differently because the writing of it as it now stands taught me both how to write and how to read and even more it taught me what i had already read because on completing it i discovered in a series of repercussions like summer thunder the flauberts and conrads and turgenievs which as much as ten years before i had consumed whole and without assimilating at all as a moth or a goat might i have read nothing since i have not had to and i have learned but one thing since about writing that is that the emotion definite and physical and yet nebulous to describe which the writing of benjys section of the sound and the fury gave methat ecstasy that eager and joyous faith and anticipation of surprise which the yet unmarred sheets beneath my hand held inviolate and unfailingwill not return the unreluctance to begin the cold satisfaction in work well and arduously done is there and will continue to be there as long as i can do it well but that other will not return i shall never know it again so i wrote quentins and jasons sections trying to clarify benjys but i saw that i was merely temporising that i should have to get completely out of the book i realised that there would be compensations that in a sense i could then give a final turn to the screw and extract some ultimate distillation yet it took me better than a month to take pen and write the day dawned bleak and chill before i did so there is a story somewhere about an old roman who kept at his bedside a tyrrhenian vase which he loved and the rim of which he wore slowly away with kissing it i had made myself a vase but i suppose i knew all the time that i could not live forever inside of it that perhaps to have it so that i too could lie in bed and look at it would be better surely so when that day should come when not only the ecstasy of writing would be gone but the unreluctance and the something worth saying too its fine to think that you will leave something behind you when you die but its better to have made something you can die with much better the muddy bottom of a little doomed girl climbing a blooming pear tree in april to look in the window at the funeral oxford august april through the fence between the curling flower spaces i could see them hitting they were coming toward where the flag was and i went along the fence luster was hunting in the grass by the flower tree they took the flag out and they were hitting then they put the flag back and they went to the table and he hit and the other hit then they went on and i went along the fence

and kissed caddy and put his hand on my head is mother very sick caddy said no father said are you going to take good care of maury yes caddy said father went to the door and looked at us again then the dark came back and he stood black in the door and then the door turned black again caddy held me and i could hear us all and the darkness and something i could smell and then i could see the windows where the trees were buzzing then the dark began to go in smooth bright shapes like it always does even when caddy says that i have been asleep june when the shadow of the sash appeared on the curtains it was between seven and eight oclock and then i was in time again hearing the watch it was grandfathers and when father gave it to me he said i give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire its rather excruciatingly apt that you will use it to gain the reducto absurdum of all human experience which can fit your individual needs no better than it fitted his or his fathers i give it to you not that you may remember time but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all your breath trying to conquer it because no battle is ever won he said they are not even fought the field only reveals to man his own folly and despair and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools it was propped against the collar box and i lay listening to it hearing it that is i dont suppose anybody ever deliberately listens to a watch or a clock you dont have to you can be oblivious to the sound for a long while then in a second of ticking it can create in the mind unbroken the long diminishing parade of time you didnt hear like father said down the long and lonely lightrays you might see jesus walking like and the good saint francis that said little sister death that never had a sister through the wall i heard shreves bedsprings and then his slippers on the floor hishing i got up and went to the dresser and slid my hand along it and touched the watch and turned it facedown and went back to bed but the shadow of the sash was still there and i had learned to tell almost to the minute so id have to turn my back to it feeling the eyes animals used to have in the back of their heads when it was on top itching its always the idle habits you acquire which you will regret father said that that christ was not crucified he was worn away by a minute clicking of little wheels that had no sister and so as soon as i knew i couldnt see it i began to wonder what time it was father said that constant speculation regarding the position of mechanical hands on an arbitrary dial which is a symptom of mindfunction excrement father said like sweating and i saying all right wonder go on and wonder if it had been cloudy i could have looked at the window thinking what he said about idle habits thinking it would be nice for them down at new london if the weather held up like this why shouldnt it the month of brides the voice that breathed she ran right out of the mirror out of the banked scent roses roses mr and mrs jason richmond compson announce the marriage of roses not virgins like dogwood milkweed i said i have committed incest father i said roses cunning and serene if you attend harvard one year but dont see the boatrace there should be a refund let jason have it give jason a year at harvard shreve stood in the door putting his collar on his glasses glinting rosily as though he had washed them with his face you taking a cut this morning is it that late he looked at his watch bell in two minutes i didnt know it was that late he was still looking at the watch his mouth shaping ill have to hustle i cant stand another cut the dean told me last week he put the watch back into his pocket then i quit talking youd better slip on your pants and run he said he went out i got up and moved about listening to him through the wall he entered the sittingroom toward the door arent you ready yet not yet run along ill make it he went out the door closed his feet went down the corridor then i could hear the watch again i quit moving around and went to the window and drew the curtains aside and watched them running for chapel the same ones fighting the same heaving coatsleeves the same books and flapping collars flushing past like debris on a flood and spoade calling shreve my husband ah let him alone shreve said if hes got better sense than to chase after the little dirty sluts whose business in the south you are ashamed of being a virgin boys men they lie about it because it means less to women father said he said it was men invented virginity not women father said its like death only a state in which the others are left and i said but to believe it doesnt matter and he said thats whats so sad about anything not only virginity and i said why couldnt it have been me and not her who is unvirgin and he said thats why thats sad too nothing is even worth the changing of it and shreve said if hes got better sense than to chase after the little dirty sluts and i said did you ever have a sister did you did you spoade was in the middle of them like a terrapin in a street full of scuttering dead leaves his collar about his ears moving at his customary unhurried walk he was from south carolina a senior it was his clubs boast that he never ran for chapel and had never got there on time and had never been absent in four years and had never made either chapel or first lecture with a shirt on his back and socks on his feet about ten oclock hed come in thompsons get two cups of coffee sit down and take his socks out of his pocket and remove his shoes and put them on while the coffee cooled about noon youd see him with a shirt and collar on like anybody else the others passed him running but he never increased his pace at all after a while the quad was empty a sparrow slanted across the sunlight onto the window ledge and cocked his head at me his eye was round and bright first hed watch me with one eye then flick and it would be the other one his throat pumping faster than any pulse the hour began to strike the sparrow quit swapping eyes and watched me steadily with the same one until the chimes ceased as if he were listening too then he flicked off the ledge and was gone it was a while before the last stroke ceased vibrating it stayed in the air more felt than heard for a long time like all the bells that ever rang still ringing in the long dying lightrays and jesus and saint francis talking about his sister because if it were just to hell if that were all of it finished if things just finished themselves nobody else there but her and me if we could just have done something so dreadful that they would have fled hell except us i have committed incest i said father it was i it was not dalton ames and when he put dalton ames dalton ames dalton ames when he put the pistol in my hand i didnt thats why i didnt he would be there and she would and i would dalton ames dalton ames dalton ames if we could have just done something so dreadful and father said thats sad too people cannot do anything that dreadful they cannot do anything very dreadful at all they cannot even remember tomorrow what seemed dreadful today and i said you can shirk all things and he said ah can you and i will look down and see my murmuring bones and the deep water like wind like a roof of wind and after a long time they cannot distinguish even bones upon the lonely and inviolate sand until on the day when he says rise only the flatiron would come floating up its not when you realise that nothing can help youreligion pride anythingits when you realise that you dont need any aid dalton ames dalton ames dalton ames if i could have been his mother lying with open body lifted laughing holding his father with my hand refraining seeing watching him die before he lived one minute she was standing in the door i went to the dresser and took up the watch with the face still down i tapped the crystal on the corner of the dresser and caught the fragments of glass in my hand and put them into the ashtray and twisted the hands off and put them in the tray the watch ticked on i turned the face up the blank dial with little wheels clicking and click ing behind it not knowing any better jesus walking on galilee and washington not telling lies father brought back a watchcharm from the saint louis fair to jason a tiny opera glass into which you squinted with one eye and saw a skyscraper a ferris wheel all spidery niagara falls on a pinhead there was a red smear on the dial when i saw it my thumb began to smart i put the watch down and went into shreves room and got the iodine and painted the cut i cleaned the rest of the glass out of the rim with a towel i laid out two suits of underwear with socks shirts collars and ties and packed my trunk i put in everything except my new suit and an old one and two pairs of shoes and two hats and my books i carried the books into the sittingroom and stacked them on the table the ones i had brought from home and the ones father said it used to be a gentleman was known by his books nowadays he is known by the ones he has not returned and locked the trunk and addressed it the quarter hour sounded i stopped and listened to it until the chimes ceased i bathed and shaved the water made my finger smart a little so i painted it again i put on my new suit and put my watch on and packed the other suit and the accessories and my razor and brushes in my hand bag and folded the trunk key into a sheet of paper and put it in an envelope and addressed it to father and wrote the two notes and sealed them the shadow hadnt quite cleared the stoop i stopped inside the door watching the shadow move it moved almost perceptibly creeping back inside the door driving the shadow back into the door only she was running already when i heard it in the mirror she was running before i knew what it was that quick her train caught up over her arm she ran out of the mirror like a cloud her veil swirling in long glints her heels brittle and fast clutch ing her dress onto her shoulder with the other hand run ning out of the mirror the smells roses roses the voice that breathed oer eden then she was across the porch i couldnt hear her heels then in the moonlight like a cloud the floating shadow of the veil running across the grass into the bellowing she ran out of her dress clutching her bridal running into the bellowing where t p in the dew whooey sassprilluh benjy under the box bellowing father had a vshaped silver cuirass on his running chest shreve said well you didnt is it a wedding or a wake i couldnt make it i said not with all that primping whats the matter you think this was sunday i reckon the police wont get me for wearing my new suit one time i said i was thinking about the square students theyll think you go to harvard have you got too proud to at tend classes too im going to eat first the shadow on the stoop was gone i stepped into sunlight finding my shadow again i walked down the steps just ahead of it the half hour went then the chimes ceased and died away deacon wasnt at the postoffice either i stamped the two envelopes and mailed the one to father and put shreves in my inside pocket and then i remembered where i had last seen the deacon it was on decoration day in a gar uniform in the middle of the parade if you waited long enough on any corner you would see him in whatever parade came along the one before was on columbus or garibaldis or somebodys birthday he was in the street sweepers section in a stovepipe hat carrying a two inch italian flag smoking a cigar among the brooms and scoops but the last time was the gar one because shreve said there now just look at what your grandpa did to that poor old nigger yes i said now he can spend day after day marching in parades if it hadnt been for my grandfather hed have to work like whitefolks i didnt see him anywhere but i never knew even a working nigger that you could find when you wanted him let alone one that lived off the fat of the land a car came along i went over to town and went to parkers and had a good breakfast while i was eating i heard a clock strike the hour but then i suppose it takes at least one hour to lose time in who has been longer than history getting into the mechanical progression of it when i finished breakfast i bought a cigar the girl said a fifty cent one was the best so i took one and lit it and went out to the street i stood there and took a couple of puffs then i held it in my hand and went on toward the corner i passed a jewellers window but i looked away in time at the corner two bootblacks caught me one on either side shrill and raucous like blackbirds i gave the cigar to one of them and the other one a nickel then they let me alone the one with the cigar was trying to sell it to the other for the nickel there was a clock high up in the sun and i thought about how when you dont want to do a thing your body will try to trick you into doing it sort of unawares i could feel the muscles in the back of my neck and then i could hear my watch ticking away in my pocket and after a while i had all the other sounds shut away leaving only the watch in my pocket i turned back up the street to the window he was working at the table behind the window he was going bald there was a glass in his eyea metal tube screwed into his face i went in the place was full of ticking like crickets in september grass and i could hear a big clock on the wall above his head he looked up his eye big and blurred and rushing beyond the glass i took mine out and handed it to him i broke my watch he flipped it over in his hand i should say you have you must have stepped on it yes sir i knocked it off the dresser and stepped on it in the dark its still running though he pried the back open and squinted into it seems to be all right i cant tell until i go over it though ill go into it this afternoon ill bring it back later i said would you mind telling me if any of those watches in the window are right he held my watch on his palm and looked up at me with his blurred rushing eye i made a bet with a fellow i said and i forgot my glasses this morning why all right he said he laid the watch down and half rose on his stool and looked over the barrier then he glanced up at the wall its twen dont tell me i said please sir just tell me if any of them are right he looked at me again he sat back on the stool and pushed the glass up onto his forehead it left a red circle around his eye and when it was gone his whole face looked naked whatre you celebrating today he said that boat race aint until next week is it no sir this is just a private celebration birthday are any of them right no but they havent been regulated and set yet if youre thinking of buying one of them no sir i dont need a watch we have a clock in our sitting room ill have this one fixed when i do i reached my hand better leave it now ill bring it back later he gave me the watch i put it in my pocket i couldnt hear it now above all the others im much obliged to you i hope i havent taken up your time thats all right bring it in when you are ready and you better put off this celebration until after we win that boat race yes sir i reckon i had i went out shutting the door upon the ticking i looked back into the window he was watching me across the barrier there were about a dozen watches in the window a dozen different hours and each with the same assertive and contradictory assurance that mine had without any hands at all contradicting one another i could hear mine ticking away inside my pocket even though nobody could see it even though it could tell nothing if anyone could and so i told myself to take that one because father said clocks slay time he said time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels only when the clock stops does time come to life the hands were extended slightly off the horizontal at a faint angle like a gull tilting into the wind holding all i used to be sorry about like the new moon holding water niggers say the jeweller was working again bent over his bench the tube tunnelled into his face his hair was parted in the center the part ran up into the bald spot like a drained marsh in december i saw the hardware store from across the street i didnt know you bought flatirons by the pound maybe you want a tailors goose the clerk said they weigh ten pounds only they were bigger than i thought so i got two sixpound little ones because they would look like a pair of shoes wrapped up they felt heavy enough together but i thought again how father had said about the reducto absurdum of human experience thinking how the only opportunity i seemed to have for the application of harvard maybe by next year thinking maybe it takes two years in school to learn to do that properly but they felt heavy enough in the air a car came i got on i didnt see the placard on the front it was full mostly prosperous looking people reading newspapers the only vacant seat was beside a nigger he wore a derby and shined shoes and he was holding a dead cigar stub i used to think that a southerner had to be always conscious of niggers i thought that northerners would expect him to when i first came east i kept thinking youve got to remember to think of them as colored people not niggers and if it hadnt happened that i wasnt thrown with many of them id have wasted a lot of time and trouble before i learned that the best way to take all people black or white is to take them for what they think they are then leave them alone that was when i realisedthat a digger is not a person so much as a form of behavior a sort of obverse reflection of the white people he lives among but i thought at first that i ought to miss having a lot of them around me because i thought that northerners thought i did but i didnt know that i really had missed roskus and dilsey and them until that morning in virginia the train was stopped when i waked and i raised the shade and looked out the car was blocking a road crossing where two white fences came down a hill and then sprayed outward and downward like part of the skeleton of a horn and there was a nigger on a mule in the middle of the stiff ruts waiting for the train to move how long he had been there i didnt know but he sat straddle of the mule his head wrapped in a piece of blanket as if they had been built there with the fence and the road or with the hill carved out of the hill itself like a sign put there saying you are home again he didnt have a saddle and his feet dangled almost to the ground the mule looked like a rabbit i raised the window hey uncle i said is this the way suh he looked at me then he loosened the blanket and lifted it away from his ear christmas gift i said sho comin boss you done caught me aint you ill let you off this time i dragged my pants out of the little hammock and got a quarter out but look out next time ill be coming back through here two days after new year and look out then i threw the quarter out the window buy yourself some santy claus yes suh he said he got down and picked up the quarter and rubbed it on his leg thanky young marster thanky then the train began to move i leaned out the window into the cold air looking back he stood there beside the gaunt rabbit of a mule the two of them shabby and motionless and unimpatient the train swung around the curve the engine puffing with short heavy blasts and they passed smoothly from sight that way with that quality about them of shabby and timeless patience of static serenity that blending of childlike and ready incompetence and paradoxical reliability that tends and protects them it loves out of all reason and robs them steadily and evades responsibility and obligations by means too barefaced to be called subterfuge even and is taken in theft or evasion with only that frank and spontaneous admiration for the victor which a gentleman feels for anyone who beats him in a fair contest and withal a fond and unflagging tolerance for whitefolks vagaries like that of a grandparent for unpredictable and troublesome children which i had forgotten and all that day while the train wound through rushing gaps and along ledges where movement was only a laboring sound of the exhaust and groaning wheels and the eternal mountains stood fading into the thick sky i thought of home of the bleak station and the mud and the niggers and country folks thronging slowly about the square with toy monkeys and wagons and candy in sacks and roman candles sticking out and my insides would move like they used to do in school when the bell rang i wouldnt begin counting until the clock struck three then i would begin counting to sixty and folding down one finger and thinking of the other fourteen fingers waiting to be folded down or thirteen or twelve or eight or seven until all of a sudden id realise silence and the unwinking minds and id say maam your name is quentin isnt it miss laura would say then more silence and the cruel unwinking minds and hands jerking into the silence tell quentin who discovered the mississippi river henry desoto then the minds would go away and after a while id be afraid i had gotten behind and id count fast and fold down another finger then id be afraid i was going too fast and id slow up then id get afraid and count fast again so i never could come out even with the bell and the released surging of feet moving already feeling earth in the scuffed floor and the day like a pane of glass struck a light sharp blow and my insides would move sitting still moving sitting still my bowels moved for thee one minute she was standing in the door benjy bellowing benjamin the child of mine old age bellowing caddy caddy im going to run away he began to cry she went and touched him hush im not going to hush he hushed dilsey he smell what you tell him when he want to dont have to listen nor talk can he smell that new name they give him can he smell bad luck what he want to worry about luck for luck cant do him no hurt what they change his name for then if aint trying to help his luck the car stopped started stopped again below the window i watched the crowns of peoples heads passing beneath new straw hats not yet unbleached there were women in the car now with market baskets and men in workclothes were beginning to outnumber the shined shoes and collars the nigger touched my knee pardon me he said i swung my legs out and let him pass we were going beside a blank wall the sound clattering back into the car at the women with market baskets on their knees and a man in a stained hat with a pipe stuck in the band i could smell water and in a break in the wall i saw a glint of water and two masts and a gull motionless in midair like on an invisible wire between the masts and i raised my hand and through my coat touched the letters i had written when the car stopped i got off the bridge was open to let a schooner through she was in tow the tug nudging along under her quarter trailing smoke but the ship herself was like she was moving without visible means a man naked to the waist was coiling down a line on the focsle head his body was burned the color of leaf tobacco another man in a straw hat withoutany crown was at the wheel the ship went through the bridge moving under bare poles like a ghost in broad day with three gulls hovering above the stern like toys on invisible wires when it closed i crossed to the other side and leaned on the rail above the boathouses the float was empty and the doors were closed crew just pulled in the late afternoon now resting up before the shadow of the bridge the tiers of railing my shadow leaning flat upon the water so easily had i tricked it that would not quit me at least fifty feet it was and if i only had something to blot it into the water holding it until it was drowned the shadow of the package like two shoes wrapped up lying on the water niggers say a drowned mans shadow was watching for him in the water all the time it twinkled and glinted like breathing the float slow like breathing too and debris half submerged healing out to the sea and the caverns and the grottoes of the sea the displacement of water is equal to the something of something reducto absurdum of all human experience and two sixpound flatirons weigh more than one tailors goose what a sinful waste dilsey would say benjy knew it when damuddy died he cried he smell hit he smell hit the tug came back downstream the water shearing in long rolling cylinders rocking the float at last with the echo of passage the float lurching onto the rolling cylinder with a plopping sound and a long jarring noise as the door rolled back and two men emerged carrying a shell they set it in the water and a moment later bland came out with the sculls he wore flannels a gray jacket and a stiff straw hat either he or his mother had read somewhere that oxford students pulled in flannels and stiff hats so early one march they bought gerald a one pair shell and in his flannels and stiff hat he went on the river the folks at the boathouse threatened to call a policeman but he went anyway his mother came down in a hired auto in a fur suit like an arctic explorers and saw him off in a twentyfive mile wind and a steady drove of ice floes like dirty sheep ever since then i have believed that god is not only a gentleman and a sport he is a kentuckian too when he sailed away she made a detour and came down to the river again and drove along parallel with him the car in low gear they said you couldnt have told theyd ever seen one another before like a king and queen not even looking at one another just moving side by side across massachusetts on parallel courses like a couple of planets he got in and pulled away he pulled pretty well now he ought to they said his mother tried to make him give rowing up and do something else the rest of his class couldnt or wouldnt do but for once he was stubborn if you could call it stubbornness sitting in his attitudes of princely boredom with his curly yellow hair and his violet eyes and his eyelashes and his new york clothes while his mamma was telling us about geralds horses and geralds niggers and geralds women husbands and fathers in kentucky must have been awful glad when she carried gerald off to cambridge she had an apartment over in town and gerald had one there too besides his rooms in college she approved of gerald associating with me because i at least revealed a blundering sense of noblesse oblige by getting myself born below mason and dixon and a few others whose geography met the requirements minimum forgave at least or condoned but since she met spoade coming out of chapel one he said she couldnt be a lady no lady would be out at that hour of the night she never had been able to forgive him for having five names including that of a present english ducal house im sure she solaced herself by being convinced that some misfit maingault or mortemar had got mixed up with the lodgekeepers daughter which was quite probable whether she invented it or not spoade was the worlds champion sitteraround no holds barred and gouging discretionary the shell was a speck now the oars catching the sun in spaced glints as if the hull were winking itself along him along did you ever have a sister no but theyre all bitches did you ever have a sister one minute she was bitches not bitch one minute she stood in the door dalton ames dalton ames dalton shirts i thought all the time they were khaki army issue khaki until i saw they were of heavy chinese silk or finest flannel because they made his face so brown his eyes so blue dalton ames it just missed gentility theatrical fixture just papiermache then touch oh asbestos not quite bronze but wont see him at the house caddys a woman too remember she must do things for womens reasons too why wont you bring him to the house caddy why must you do like nigger women do in the pasture the ditches the dark woods hot hidden furious in the dark woods and after a while i had been hearing my watch for some time and i could feel the letters crackle through my coat against the railing and i leaned on the railing watching my shadow how i had tricked it i moved along the rail but my suit was dark too and i could wipe my hands watching my shadow how i had tricked it i walked it into the shadow of the quad then i went east harvard my harvard boy harvard harvard that pimplefaced infant she met at the fieldmeet with colored ribbons skulking along the fence trying to whistle her out like

backlooking you neednt be jealous though its just an old woman hes flattering a grown married daughter i cant believe it nonsense you look like a girl you are lots younger than candace color in your cheeks like a girl a face reproachful tearful an odor of camphor and of tears a voice weeping steadily and softly beyond the twilit door the twilightcolored smell of honeysuckle bringing empty trunks down the attic stairs they sounded like coffins french lick found not death at the salt lick hats not unbleached and not hats in three years i can not wear a hat i could not was will there be hats then since i was not and not harvard then where the best of thought father said clings like dead ivy vines upon old dead brick not harvard then not to me anyway again sadder than was again saddest of all again spoade had a shirt on then it must be when i can see my shadow again if not careful that i tricked into the water shall tread again upon my impervious shadow but no sister i wouldnt have done it i wont have my daughter spied on i wouldnt have how can i control any of them when you have always taught them to have no respect for me and my wishes i know you look down on my people but is that any reason for teaching my children my own children i suffered for to have no respect trampling my shadows bones into the concrete with hard heels and then i was hearing the watch and i touched the letters through my coat i will not have my daughter spied on by you or quentin or anybody no matter what you think she has done at least you agree there is reason for having her watched i wouldnt have i wouldnt have i know you wouldnt i didnt mean to speak so sharply but have no respect for each other for themselves but why did she the chimes began as i stepped on my shadow but it was the quarter hour the deacon wasnt in sight anywhere think i would have could have she didnt mean that thats the way women do things its because she loves caddy the street lamps would go down the hill then rise toward town i walked upon the belly of my shadow i could extend my hand beyond it feeling father behind me beyond the rasping darkness of summer and august the street lamps father and i protect women from one another from themselves our women women are like that they dont acquire knowledge of people we are for that they are just born with a practical fertility of suspicion that makes a crop every so often and usually right they have an affinity for evil for supplying whatever the evil lacks in itself for drawing it about them instinctively as you do bedclothing in slumber fertilising the mind for it until the evil has served its purpose whether it ever existed or no he was coming along between a couple of freshmen he hadnt quite recovered from the parade for he gave me a salute a very superiorofficerish kind i want to see you a minute i said stopping see me all right see you again fellows he said stopping and turning back glad to have chatted with you that was the deacon all over talk about your natural psychologists they said he hadnt missed a train at the beginning of school in forty years and that he could pick out a southerner with one glance he never missed and once he had heard you speak he could name your state he had a regular uniform he met trains in a sort of uncle toms cabin outfit patches and all yes suh right dis way young marster hyer we is taking your bags hyer boy come hyer and git dese grips whereupon a moving mountain of luggage would edge up revealing a white boy of about fifteen and the deacon would hang another bag on him somehow and drive him off now den dont you crap hit yes suh young marster jes give de old nigger yo room number and hitll be done got cold afar when you arrives from then on until he had you completely subjugated he was always in or out of your room ubiquitous and garrulous though his manner gradually moved northward as his raiment improved until at last when he had bled you until you began to learn better he was calling you quentin or whatever and when you saw him next hed be wearing a castoff brooks suit and a hat with a princeton club i forget which band that someone had given him and which he was pleasantly and unshakably convinced was a part of abe lincolns military sash someone spread the story years ago when he first appeared around college from wherever he came from that he was a graduate of the divinity school and when he came to understand what it meant he was so taken with it that he began to retail the story himself until at last he must have come to believe he really had anyway he related long pointless anecdotes of his undergraduate days speaking familiarly of dead and departed professors by their first names usually incorrect ones but he had been guide mentor and friend to unnumbered crops of innocent and lonely freshmen and i suppose that with all his petty chicanery and hypocrisy he stank no higher in heavens nostrils than any other havent seen you in threefour days he said staring at me from his still military aura you been sick no ive been all right working i reckon ive seen you though yes in the parade the other day oh that yes i was there i dont care nothing about that sort of thing you understand but the boys likes to have me with them the vetruns does ladies wants all the old vetruns to turn out you know so i has to oblige them and on that wop holiday too i said you were obliging the w c t u then i reckon that i was doing that for my soninlaw he aims to get a job on the city forces street cleaner i tells him all he wants is a broom to sleep on you saw me did you both times yes i mean in uniform howd i look you looked fine you looked better than any of them they ought to make you a general deacon he touched my arm lightly his hand that worn gentle quality of niggers hands listen this aint for outside talking i dont mind telling you because you and mes the same folks come long and short he leaned a little to me speaking rapidly his eyes not looking at me ive got strings out right now wait till next year just wait then see where im marching i wont need to tell you how im fixing it i say just wait and see my boy he looked at me now and clapped me lightly on the shoulder and rocked back on his heels nodding at me yes sir i didnt turn democrat three years ago for nothing my soninlaw on the city me yes sir if just turning democratll make that son of a bitch go to work and me just you stand on that corner yonder a year from two days ago and see i hope so you deserve it deacon and while i think about it i took the letter from my pocket take this around to my room tomorrow and give it to shreve hell have something for you but not till tomorrowmind he took the letter and examined it its sealed up yes and its written inside not good until tomorrow hm he said he looked at the envelope his mouth pursed something for me you say yes a present im making you he was looking at me now the envelope white in his black hand in the sun his eyes were soft and irisless and brown and suddenly i saw roskus watching me from behind all his whitefolks claptrap of uniforms and politics and harvard manner diffident secret inarticulate and sad you aint playing a joke on the old nigger is you you know im not did any southerner ever play a joke on you youre right theyre fine folks but you cant live with them did you ever try i said but roskus was gone once more he was that self he had long since taught himself to ill confer to your wishes my boy not until tomorrow remember sure he said understood my boy well i hope i said he looked down at me benignant profound suddenly i held out my hand and we shook he gravely from the pompous height of his municipal and military dream youre a good fellow deacon i hope youve helped a lot of young fellows here and there ive tried to treat all folks right he said i draw no petty social lines a man to me is a man wherever i find him i hope youll always find as many friends as youve made young fellows i get along with them they dont forget me neither he said waving the envelope he put it into his pocket and buttoned his coat yes sir he said ive had good friends the chimes began again the half hour i stood in the belly of my shadow and listened to the strokes spaced and tranquil along the sunlight among the thin still little leaves spaced and peaceful and serene with that quality of autumn always in bells even in the month of brides lying on the ground under the window bellowing he took one look at her and knew out of the mouths of babes the street lamps the chimes ceased i went back to the postoffice treading my shadow into pavement go down the hill then they rise toward town like lanterns hung one above another on a wall father said because she loves caddy she loves people through their shortcomings uncle maury straddling his legs before the fire must remove one hand long enough to drink christmas jason ran on his hands in his pockets fell down and lay there like a trussed fowl until versh set him up whynt you keep them hands outen your pockets when you running you could stand up then rolling his head in the cradle rolling it flat across the back caddy told jason and versh that the reason uncle maury didnt work was that he used to roll his head in the cradle when he was little shreve was coming up the walk shambling fatly earnest his glasses glinting beneath the running leaves like little pools i gave deacon a note for some things i may not be in this afternoon so dont you let him have anything until tomorrow will you all right he looked at me say whatre you doing today anyhow all dressed up and mooning around like the prologue to a suttee did you go to psychology this morning im not doing anything not until tomorrow now whats that you got there nothing pair of shoes i had halfsoled not until tomorrow you hear sure all right oh by the way did you get a letter off the table this morning no its there from semiramis chauffeur brought it before ten oclock all right ill get it wonder what she wants now another band recital i guess tumpty ta ta gerald blah a little louder on the drum quentin god im glad im not a gentleman he went on nursing a book a little shapeless fatly intent the street lamps do you think so because one of our forefathers was a governor and three were generals and mothers werent any live man is better than any dead man but no live or dead man is very much better than any other live or dead man done in mothers mind though finished finished then we were all poisoned you are confusing sin and morality women dont do that your mother is thinking of morality whether it be sin or not has not occurred to her jason i must go away you keep the others ill take jason and go where nobody knows us so hell have a chance to grow up and forget all this the others dont love me they have never loved anything with that streak of compson selfishness and false pride jason was the only one my heart went out to without dread nonsense jason is all right i was thinking that as soon as you feel better you and caddy might go up to french lick and leave jason here with nobody but you and the darkies she will forget him then all the talk will die away found not death at the salt licks maybe i could find a husband for her not death at the salt licks the car came up and stopped the bells were still ring ing the half hour i got on and it went on again blotting the half hour no the three quarters then it would be ten minutes anyway to leave harvard your mothers dream for sold benjys pasture for what have i done to have been given children like these benjamin was punishment enough and now for her to have no more regard for me her own mother ive suffered for her dreamed and planned and sacrificed i went down into the valley yet never since she opened her eyes has she given me one unselfish thought at times i look at her i wonder if she can be my child except jason he has never given me one moments sorrow since i first held him in my arms i knew then that he was to be my joy and my salvation i thought that benjamin was punishment enough for any sins i have committed i thought he was my punishment for putting aside my pride and marrying a man who held himself above me i dont complain i loved him above all of them because of it because my duty though jason pulling at my heart all the while but i see now that i have not suffered enough i see now that i must pay for your sins as well as mine what have you done what sins have your high and mighty people visited upon me but youll take up for them you always have found excuses for your own blood only jason can do wrong because he is more bascomb than compson while your own daughter my little daughter my baby girl she is she is no better than that when i was a girl i was unfortunate i was only a bascomb i was taught that there is no halfway ground that a woman is either a lady or not but i never dreamed when i held her in my arms that any daughter of mine could let herself dont you know i can look at her eyes and tell you may think shed tell you but she doesnt tell things she is secretive you dont know her i know things shes done that id die before id have you know thats it go on criticise jason accuse me of setting him to watch her as if it were a crime while your own daughter can i know you dont love him that you wish to believe faults against him you never have yes ridicule him as you always have maury you cannot hurt me any more than your children already have and then ill be gone and jason with no one to love him shield him from this i look at him every day dreading to see this compson blood beginning to show in him at last with his sister slipping out to see what do you call it then have you ever laid eyes on him will you even let me try to find out who he is its not for myself i couldnt bear to see him its for your sake to protect you but who can fight against bad blood you wont let me try we are to sit back with our hands folded while she not only drags your name in the dirt but corrupts the very air your children breathe jason you must let me go away i cannot stand it let me have jason and you keep the others theyre not my flesh and blood like he is strangers nothing of mine and i am afraid of them i can take jason and go where we are not known ill go down on my knees and pray for the absolution of my sins that he may escape this curse try to forget that the others ever were if that was the three quarters not over ten minutes now one car had just left and people were already waiting for the next one i asked but he didnt know whether another one would leave before noon or not because youd think that interurbans so the first one was another trolley i got on you can feel noon i wonder if even miners in the bowels of the earth thats why whistles because people that sweat and if just far enough from sweat you wont hear whistles and in eight minutes you should be that far from sweat in boston father said a man is the sum of his misfortunes one day youd think misfortune would get tired but then time is your misfortune father said a gull on an invisible wire attached through space dragged you carry the symbol of your frustration into eternity then the wings are bigger father said only who can play a harp i could hear my watch whenever the car stopped but not often they were already eating who would play a eating the business of eating inside of you space too space and time confused stomach saying noon brain saying eat oclock all right i wonder what time it is what of it people were getting out the trolley didnt stop so often now emptied by eating then it was past i got off and stood in my shadow and after a while a car came along and i got on and went back to the interurban station there was a car ready to leave and i found a seat next the window and it started and i watched it sort of frazzle out into slack tide flats and then trees now and then i saw the river and i thought how nice it would be for them down at new london if the weather and geralds shell going solemnly up the glinting forenoon and i wondered what the old woman would be wanting now sending me a note before ten oclock in the morning what picture of gerald i to be one of the dalton ames oh asbestos quentin has shot background something with girls in it women do have always his voice above the gabble voice that breathed an affinity for evil for believing that no woman is to be trusted but that some men are too innocent to protect themselves plain girls remote cousins and family friends whom mere acquaintanceship invested with a sort of blood obligation noblesse oblige and she sitting there telling us before their faces what a shame it was that gerald should have all the family looks because a man didnt need it was better off without it but without it a girl was simply lost telling us about geralds women in a quentin has shot herbert he shot his voice through the floor of caddys room tone of smug approbation when he was seventeen i said to him one day what a shame that you should have a mouth like that it should be on a girls face and can you imagine the curtains leaning in on the twilight upon the odor of the apple tree her head against the twilight her arms behind her head kimonowinged the voice that breathed oer eden clothes upon the bed by the nose seen above the apple what he said just seventeen mind mother he said it often is and him sitting there in attitudes regal watching two or three of them through his eyelashes they gushed like swallows swooping his eyelashes shreve said he always had are you going to look after benjy and father the less you say about benjy and father the better when have you ever considered them caddy promise you neednt worry about them youre getting out in good shape promise im sick youll have to promise wondered who invented that joke but then he always had considered mrs bland a remarkably preserved woman he said she was grooming gerald to seduce a duchess sometime she called shreve that fat canadian youth twice she arranged a new roommate for me without consulting me at all once for me to move out once for he opened the door in the twilight his face looked like a pumpkin pie well ill say a fond farewell cruel fate may part us but i will never love another never what are you talking about im talking about cruel fate in eight yards of apricot silk and more metal pound for pound than a galley slave and the sole owner and proprietor of the unchallenged peripatetic john of the late confederacy then he told me how she had gone to the proctor to have him moved out and how the proctor had revealed enough low stubbornness to insist on consulting shreve first then she suggested that he send for shreve right off and do it and he wouldnt do that so after that she was hardly civil to shreve i make it a point never to speak harshly of females shreve said but that woman has got more ways like a bitch than any lady in these sovereign states and dominions and now letter on the table by hand command orchid scented colored if she knew i had passed almost beneath the window knowing it there without my dear madam i have not yet had an opportunity of receiving your communication but i beg in advance to be excused today or yesterday and tomorrow or when as i remember that the next one is to be how gerald throws his nigger downstairs and how the nigger plead to be allowed to matriculate in the divinity school to be near marster marse gerald and how he ran all the way to the station beside the carriage with tears in his eyes when marse gerald rid away i will wait until the day for the one about the sawmill husband came to the kitchen door with a shotgun gerald went down and bit the gun in two and

their voices through the floor of caddys room the car stopped i got off into the middle of my shadow a road crossed the track there was a wooden marquee with an old man eating something out of a paper bag and then the car was out of hearing too the road went into trees where it would be shady but june foliage in new england not much thicker than april at home i could see a smoke stack i turned my back to it tramping my shadow into the dust there was something terrible in me sometimes at night i could see it grinning at me i could see it through them grinning at me through their faces its gone

peaceful grottoes tumbling peacefully they would and when he said rise only the flat irons when versh and i hunted all day we wouldnt take any lunch and at twelve oclock id get hungry id stay hungry until about one then all of a sudden id even forget that i wasnt hungry anymore the street lamps go down the hill then heard the car go down the hill the chairarm flat cool smooth under my forehead

are sick that blackguard ive got to marry somebodythen they told me the bone would have to be broken again at last i couldnt see the smoke stack the road went beside a wall trees leaned over the wall sprayed with sunlight the stone was cool walking near it you could feel the coolness only our country was not like this country there was something about just walking through it a kind of still and violent fecundity that satisfied even breadhunger like flowing around you not brooding and nursing every niggard stone like it were put to makeshift for enough green to go around among the trees and even the blue of distance not that rich chimaera told me the bone would have to be broken again and inside me it began to say ah ah ah and i began to sweat what do i care i know what a broken leg is all it is it wont be anything ill just have to stay in the house a little longer thats all and my jawmuscles getting numb and my mouth saying wait wait just a minute through the sweat ah ah ah behind

little with the slow respiration of our waiting and with the slow breathing of the earth and the windless october the rank smell of the lantern fouling the brittle air listening to the dogs and to the echo of louis voice dying away he never raised it yet on a still night we have heard it from our front porch when he called the dogs in he sounded just like the horn he carried slung on his shoulder and never used but clearer mellower as though his voice were a part of darkness and silence coiling out of it coiling into it again whoooooo whoooooo whooooooooooooooooo got to marry somebody have there been very many caddy i dont know too many will you look after benjy and father you dont know whose it is then does he know dont touch me will you look after benjy and father i began to feel the water before i came to the bridge the bridge was of gray stone lichened dappled with slow moisture where the fungus crept beneath it the water was clear and still in the shadow whispering and clucking about the stone in fading swirls of spinning sky caddy that ive got to marry somebody versh told me about a man who mutilated himself he went into the woods and did it with a razor sitting in a ditch a broken razor flinging them backward over his shoulder the same motion complete the jerked skein of blood backward not looping but thats not it its not not having them its never to have had them then i could say o that thats chinese i dont know chinese and father said its because you are a virgin dont you see women are never virgins purity is a negative state and therefore contrary to nature its nature is hurting you not caddy and i said thats just words and he said so is virginity and i said you dont know you cant know and he said yes on the instant when we come to realise that tragedy is secondhand where the shadow of the bridge fell i could see down for a long way but not as far as the bottom when you leave a leaf in water a long time after a while the tissue will be gone and the delicate fibers waving slow as the motion of sleep they dont touch one another no matter how knotted up they once were no matter how close they lay once to the bones and maybe when he says rise the eyes will come floating up too out of the deep quiet and the sleep to look on glory and after a while the flat irons would come floating up i hid them under the end of the bridge and went back and leaned on the rail i could not see the bottom but i could see a long way into the motion of the water before the eye gave out and then i saw a shadow hanging like a fat arrow stemming into the current mayflies skimmed in and out of the shadow of the bridge just above the surface if it could just be a hell beyond that the clean flame the two of us more than dead then you will have only me then only me then the two of us amid the pointing and the horror beyond the clean flame the arrow increased without motion then in a quick swirl the trout lipped a fly beneath the surface with that sort of gigantic delicacy of an elephant picking up a peanut the fading vortex drifted away down stream and then i saw the arrow again nose into the current wavering delicately to the motion of the water above which the may flies slanted and poised only you and me then amid the pointing and the horror walled by the clean flame the trout hung delicate and motionless among the wavering shadows three boys with fishing poles came onto the bridge and we leaned on the rail and looked down at the trout they knew the fish he was a neighborhood character theyve been trying to catch that trout for twentyfive years theres a store in boston offers a twentyfive dollar fishing rod to anybody that can catch him why dont you all catch him then wouldnt you like to have a twentyfive dollar fishing rod yes they said they leaned on the rail looking down at the trout i sure would one said i wouldnt take the rod the second said id take the money instead maybe they wouldnt do that the first said i bet hed make you take the rod then id sell it you couldnt get twentyfive dollars for it id take what i could get then i can catch just as many fish with this pole as i could with a twentyfive dollar one then they talked about what they would do with twentyfive dollars they all talked at once their voices insistent and contradictory and impatient making of unreality a possibility then a probability then an incontrovertible fact as people will when their desires become words id buy a horse and wagon the second said yes you would the others said i would i know where i can buy one for twentyfive dollars i know the man who is it thats all right who it is i can buy it for twentyfive dollars yah the others said he dont know any such thing hes just talking do you think so the boy said they continued to jeer at him but he said nothing more he leaned on the rail looking down at the trout which he had already spent and suddenly the acrimony the conflict was gone from their voices as if to them too it was as though he had captured the fish and bought his horse and wagon they too partaking of that adult trait of being convinced of anything by an assumption of silent superiority i suppose that people using themselves and each other so much by words are at least consistent in attributing wisdom to a still tongue and for a while i could feel the other two seeking swiftly for some means by which to cope with him to rob him of his horse and wagon you couldnt get twentyfive dollars for that pole the first said i bet anything you couldnt he hasnt caught that trout yet the third said suddenly then they both cried yah whatd i tell you whats the mans name i dare you to tell there aint any such man ah shut up the second said look here he comes again they leaned on the rail motionless identical their poles slanting slenderly in the sunlight also identical the trout rose without haste a shadow in faint wavering increase again the little vortex faded slowly downstream gee the first one murmured we dont try to catch him anymore he said we just watch boston folks that come out and try is he the only fish in this pool yes he ran all the others out the best place to fish around here is down at the eddy no it aint the second said its better at bigelows mill two to one then they argued for a while about which was the best fishing and then left off all of a sudden to watch the trout rise again and the broken swirl of water suck down a little of the sky i asked how far it was to the nearest town they told me but the closest car line is that way the second said pointing back down the road where are you going nowhere just walking you from the college yes are there any factories in that town factories they looked at me no the second said not there they looked at my clothes you looking for work how about bigelows mill the third said thats a factory factory my eye he means a sure enough factory one with a whistle i said i havent heard any one oclock whistles yet oh the second said theres a clock in the unitarial steeple you can find out the time from that havent you got a watch on that chain i broke it this morning i showed them my watch they examined it gravely its still running the second said what does a watch like that cost it was a present i said my father gave it to me when i graduated from high school are you a canadian the third said he had red hair canadian he dont talk like them the second said ive heard them talk he talks like they do in minstrel shows say the third said aint you afraid hell hit you hit me you said he talks like a colored man ah dry up the second said you can see the steeple when you get over that hill there i thanked them i hope you have good luck only dont catch that old fellow down there he deserves to be let alone cant anybody catch that fish the first said they leaned on the rail looking down into the water the three poles like three slanting threads of yellow fire in the sun i walked upon my shadow tramping it into the dappled shade of trees again the road curved mounting away from the water it crossed the hill then descended winding carrying the eye the mind on ahead beneath a still green tunnel and the square cupola above the trees and the round eye of the clock but far enough i sat down at the roadside the grass was ankle deep myriad the shadows on the road were as still as if they had been put there with a stencil with slanting pencils of sunlight but it was only a train and after a while it died away beyond the trees the long sound and then i could hear my watch and the train dying away as though it were running through another month or another summer somewhere rushing away under the poised gull and all things rushing except gerald he would be sort of grand too pulling in lonely state across the noon rowing himself right out of noon up the long bright air like an apotheosis mounting into a drowsing infinity where only he and the gull the one terrifically motionless the other in a steady and measured pull and recover that partook of inertia itself the world punily beneath their shadows on the sun caddy that blackguard that blackguard caddy their voices came over the hill and the three slender poles like balanced threads of running fire they looked at me passing not slowing well i said i dont see him we didnt try to catch him the first said you cant catch that fish theres the clock the second said pointing you can tell the time when you get a little closer yes i said all right i got up you all going to town were going to the eddy for chub the first said you cant catch anything at the eddy the second said i guess you want to go to the mill with a lot of fellows splashing and scaring all the fish away you cant catch any fish at the eddy we wont catch none nowhere if we dont go on the third said i dont see why you keep on talking about the eddy the second said you cant catch anything there you dont have to go the first said youre not tied to me lets go to the mill and go swimming the third said im going to the eddy and fish the first said you can do as you please say how long has it been since you heard of anybody catching a fish at the eddy the second said to the third lets go to the mill and go swimming the third said the cupola sank slowly beyond the trees with the round face of the clock far enough yet we went on in the dappled shade we came to an orchard pink and white it was full of bees already we could hear them lets go to the mill and go swimming the third said a lane turned off beside the orchard the third boy slowed and halted the first went on flecks of sunlight slipping along the pole across his shoulder and down the back of his shirt come on the third said the second boy stopped too why must you marry somebody caddy do you want me to say it do you think that if i say it it wont be lets go up to the mill he said come on the first boy went on his bare feet made no sound falling softer than leaves in the thin dust in the orchard the bees sounded like a wind getting up a sound caught by a spell just under crescendo and sustained the lane went along the wall arched over shattered with bloom dissolving into trees sunlight slanted into it sparse and eager yellow butterflies flickered along the shade like flecks of sun what do you want to go to the eddy for the second boy said you can fish at the mill if you want to ah let him go the third said they looked after the first boy sunlight slid patchily across his walking shoulders glinting along the pole like yellow ants kenny the second said say it to father will you i will am my fathers progenitive i invented him created i him say it to him it will not be for he will say i was not and then you and i since philoprogenitive ah come on the third boy said theyre already in they looked after the first boy yah they said suddenly go on then mammas boy if he goes swimming hell get his head wet and then hell get a licking they turned into the lane and went on the yellow butterflies slanting about them along the shade it is because there is nothing else i believe there is something else but there may not be and then i you will find that even injustice is scarcely worthy of what you believe yourself to be he paid me no attention his jaw set in profile his face turned a little away beneath his broken hat why dont you go swimming with them i said that blackguard caddy were you trying to pick a fight with him were you a liar and a scoundrel caddy was dropped from his club for cheating at cards got sent to coventry caught cheating at midterm exams and expelled well what about it im not going to play cards with do you like fishing better than swimming i said the sound of the bees diminished sustained yet as though instead of sinking into silence silence merely increased between us as water rises the road curved again and became a street between shady lawns with white houses caddy that blackguard can you think of benjy and father and do it not of me what else can i think about what else have i thought about the boy turned from the street he climbed a picket fence without looking back and crossed the lawn to a tree and laid the pole down and climbed into the fork of the tree and sat there his back to the road and the dappled sun motionless at last upon his white shirt else have i thought about i cant even cry i died last year i told you i had but i didnt know then what i meant i didnt know what i was saying some days in late august at home are like this the air thin and eager like this with something in it sad and nostalgic and familiar man the sum of his climatic experiences father said man the sum of what have you a problem in impure properties carried tediously to an unvarying nil stalemate of dust and desire but now i know im dead i tell you then why must you listen we can go away you and benjy and me where nobody knows us where the buggy was drawn by a white horse his feet cropping in the thin dust spidery wheels chattering thin and dry moving uphill beneath a rippling shawl of leaves elm no ellum ellum on what on your school money the money they sold the pasture for so you could go to harvard dont you see youve got to finish now if you dont finish hell have nothing sold the pasture his white shirt was motionless in the fork in the flickering shade the wheels were spidery beneath the sag of the buggy the hooves neatly rapid like the motions of a lady doing embroidery diminishing without progress like a figure on a treadmill being drawn rapidly offstage the street turned again i could see the white cupola the round stupid assertion of the clock sold the pasture father will be dead in a year they say if he doesnt stop drinking and he wont stop he cant stop since i since last summer and then theyll send benjy to jackson i cant cry i cant even cry one minute she was standing in the door the next minute he was pulling at her dress and bellowing his voice hammered back and forth between the walls in waves and she shrinking against the wall getting smaller and smaller with her white face her eyes like thumbs dug into it until he pushed her out of the room his voice hammering back and forth as though its own momentum would not let it stop as though there were no place for it in silence bellowing when you opened the door a bell tinkled but just once high and clear and small in the neat obscurity above the door as though it were gauged and tempered to make that single clear small sound so as not to wear the bell out nor to require the expenditure of too much silence in restoring it when the door opened upon the recent warm scent of baking a little dirty child with eyes like a toy bears and two patentleather pigtails hello sister her face was like a cup of milk dashed with coffee in the sweet warm emptiness anybody here but she merely watched me until a door opened and the lady came above the counter where the ranks of crisp shapes behind the glass her neat gray face her hair tight and sparse from her neat gray skull spectacles in neat gray rims riding approaching like something on a wire like a cash box in a store she looked like a librarian something among dusty shelves of ordered certitudes long divorced from reality desiccating peacefully as if a breath of that air which sees injustice done two of these please maam from under the counter she produced a square cut from a newspaper and laid it on the counter and lifted the two buns out the little girl watched them with still and unwinking eyes like two currants floating motionless in a cup of weak coffee land of the kike home of the wop watching the bread the neat gray hands a broad gold band on the left forefinger knuckled there by a blue knuckle do you do your own baking maam sir she said like that sir like on the stage sir five cents was there anything else no maam not for me this lady wants something she was not tall enough to see over the case so she went to the end of the counter and looked at the little girl did you bring her in here no maam she was here when i came you little wretch she said she came out around the counter but she didnt touch the little girl have you got anything in your pockets she hasnt got any pockets i said she wasnt doing anything she was just standing here waiting for you why didnt the bell ring then she glared at me she just needed a bunch of switches a blackboard behind her x e shell hide it under her dress and a bodyd never know it you child howd you get in here the little girl said nothing she looked at the woman then she gave me a flying black glance and looked at the woman again them foreigners the woman said howd she get in without the bell ringing she came in when i opened the door i said it rang once for both of us she couldnt reach anything from here anyway besides i dont think she would would you sister the little girl looked at me secretive contemplative what do you want bread she extended her fist it uncurled upon a nickel moist and dirty moist dirt ridged into her flesh the coin was damp and warm i could smell it faintly metallic have you got a five cent loaf please maam from beneath the counter she produced a square cut from a newspaper sheet and laid it on the counter and wrapped a loaf into it i laid the coin and another one on the counter and another one of those buns please maam she took another bun from the case give me that parcel she said i gave it to her and she unwrapped it and put the third bun in and wrapped it and took up the coins and found two coppers in her apron and gave them to me i handed them to the little girl her fingers closed about them damp and hot like worms you going to give her that bun the woman said yessum i said i expect your cooking smells as good to her as it does to me i took up the two packages and gave the bread to the little girl the woman all irongray behind the counter watching us with cold certitude you wait a minute she said she went to the rear the door opened again and closed the little girl watched me holding the bread against her dirty dress whats your name i said she quit looking at me bu she was still motionless she didnt even seem to breathe the woman returned she had a funny looking thing in her hand she carried it sort of like it might have been a dead pet rat here she said the child looked at her take it the woman said jabbing it at the little girl it just looks peculiar i calculate you wont know the difference when you eat it here i cant stand here all day the child took it still watching her the woman rubbed her hands on her apron i got to have that bell fixed she said she went to the door and jerked it open the little bell tinkled once faint and clear and invisible we moved toward the door and the womans peering back thank you for the cake i said them foreigners she said staring up into the obscurity where the bell tinkled take my advice and stay clear of them young man yessum i said come on sister we went out thank you maam she swung the door to then jerked it open again making the bell give forth its single small note foreigners she said peering up at the bell we went on well i said how about some ice cream she was eating the gnarled cake do you like ice cream she gave me a black still look chewing come on we came to the drugstore and had some ice cream she wouldnt put the loaf down why not put it down so you can eat better i said offering to take it but she held to it chewing the ice cream like it was taffy the bitten cake lay on the table she ate the ice cream steadily then she fell to on the cake again looking about at the showcases i finished mine and we went out which way do you live i said a buggy the one with the white horse it was only doc peabody is fat three hundred pounds you ride with him on the uphill side holding on children walking easier than holding uphill seen the doctor yet have you seen caddy i dont have to i cant ask now afterward it will be all right it wont matter because women so delicate so mysterious father said delicate equilibrium of periodical filth between two moons balanced moons he said full and yellow as harvest moons her hips thighs outside outside of them always but yellow feet soles with walking like then know that some man that all those mysterious and imperious concealed with all that inside of them shapes an outward suavity waiting for a touch to liquid putrefaction like drowned things floating like pale rubber flabbily filled getting the odor of honeysuckle all mixed up youd better take your bread on home hadnt you she looked at me she chewed quietly and steadily at regular intervals a small distension passed smoothly down her throat i opened my package and gave her one of the buns goodbye i said i went on then i looked back she was behind me do you live down this way she said nothing she walked beside me under my elbow sort of eating we went on it was quiet hardly anyone about getting the odor of honeysuckle all mixed she would have told me not to let me sit there on the steps hearing her door twilight slamming hearing benjy still crying supper she would have to come down then getting honeysuckle all mixed up in it we reached the corner well ive got to go down this way i said goodbye she stopped too she swallowed the last of the cake then she began on the bun watching me across it goodbye i said i turned into the street and went on but i went to the next corner before i stopped which way do you live i said this way i pointed down the street she just looked at me do you live over that way i bet you live close to the station where the trains are dont you she just looked at me serene and secret and chewing the street was empty both ways with quiet lawns and houses neat among the trees but no one at all except back there we turned and went back two men sat in chairs in front of a store do you all know this little girl she sort of took up with me and i cant find where she lives they quit looking at me and looked at her must be one of them new italian families one said he wore a rusty frock coat ive seen her before whats your name little girl looked at them blackly for a while her jaws moving steadily she swallowed without ceasing to chew maybe she cant speak english the other said they sent her after bread i said she must be able to speak something whats your pas name the first said pete joe name john huh she took another bite from the bun what must i do with her i said she just follows me ive got to get back to boston you from the college yes sir and ive got to get on back you might go up the street and turn her over to anse hell be up at the livery stable the marshal i reckon thats what ill have to do i said ive got to do something with her much obliged come on sister we went up the street on the shady side where the shadow of the broken facade blotted slowly across the road we came to the livery stable the marshal wasnt there a man sitting in a chair tilted in the broad low door where a dark cool breeze smelling of ammonia blew among the ranked stalls said to look at the postoffice he didnt know her either them furriners i cant tell one from another you might take her across the tracks where they live and maybe somebodyll claim her we went to the postoflice it was back down the street the man in the frock coat was opening a newspaper anse just drove out of town he said i guess youd better go down past the station and walk past them houses by the river somebody therell know her i guess ill have to i said come on sister she pushed the last piece of the bun into her mouth and swallowed it want another i said she looked at me chewing her eyes black and unwinking and friendly i took the other two buns out and gave her one and bit into the other i asked a man where the station was and he showed me come on sister we reached the station and crossed the tracks where the river was a bridge crossed it and a street of jumbled frame houses followed the river backed onto it a shabby street but with an air heterogeneous and vivid too in the center of an untrimmed plot enclosed by a fence of gaping and broken pickets stood an ancient lopsided surrey and a weathered house from an upper window of which hung a garment of vivid pink does that look like your house i said she looked at me over the bun this one i said pointing she just chewed but it seemed to me that i discerned something affirmative acquiescent even if it wasnt eager in her air this one i said come on then i entered the broken gate i looked back at her here i said this look like your house she nodded her head rapidly looking at me gnawing into the damp halfmoon of the bread we went on a walk of broken random flags speared by fresh coarse blades of grass led to the broken stoop there was no movement about the house at all and the pink garment hanging in no wind from the upper window there was a bell pull with a porcelain knob attached to about six feet of wire when i stopped pulling and knocked the little girl had the crust edgeways in her chewing mouth a woman opened the door she looked at me then she spoke rapidly to the little girl in italian with a rising inflexion then a pause interrogatory she spoke to her again the little girl looking at her across the end of the crust pushing it into her mouth with a dirty hand she says she lives here i said i met her down town is this your bread no spika the woman said she spoke to the little girl again the little girl just looked at her no live here i said i pointed to the girl then at her then at the door the woman shook her head she spoke rapidly she came to the edge of the porch and pointed down the road speaking i nodded violently too you come show i said i took her arm waving my other hand toward the road she spoke swiftly pointing you come show i said trying to lead her down the steps si si she said holding back showing me whatever it was i nodded again thanks thanks thanks i went down the steps and walked toward the gate not running but pretty fast i reached the gate and stopped and looked at her for a while the crust was gone now and she looked at me with her black friendly stare the woman stood on the stoop watching us come on then i said well have to find the right one sooner or later she moved along just under my elbow we went on the houses all seemed empty not a soul in sight a sort of breathlessness that empty houses have yet they couldnt all be empty all the different rooms if you could just slice the walls away all of a sudden madam your daughter if you please no madam for gods sake your daughter she moved along just under my elbow her shiny tight pigtails and then the last house played out and the road curved out of sight beyond a wall following the river the woman was emerging from the broken gate with a shawl over ner head and clutched under her chary the road curved on empty i found a coin and gave it to the little girl a quarter goodbye sister i said then i ran i ran fast not looking back just before the road curved away i looked back she stood in the road a small figure clasping the loaf of bread to her filthv little dress her eyes still and black and unwinking i ran on a lane turned from the road i entered it and after a while i slowed to a fast walk the lane went between back premises unpainted houses with more of those gay and startling colored garments on lines a barn brokenbacked decaying quietly among rank orchard trees unpruned and weedchoked pink and white and murmurous with sunlight and with bees i looked back the entrance to the lane was empty i slowed still more my shadow pacing me dragging its head through the weeds that hid the fence the lane went back to a barred gate became defunctive in grass a mere path scarred quietly into new grass i climbed the gate into a woodlot and crossed it and came to another wall and followed that one my shadow behind me now there were vines and creepers where at home would be honeysuckle coming and coming especially in the dusk when it rained getting honeysuckle all mixed up in it as though it were not enough without that not unbearable enough what did you let him for kiss kiss i didnt let him i made him watching me getting mad what do you think of that red print of my hand coming up through her face like turning a light on under your hand her eyes going bright its not for kissing i slapped you girls elbows at fifteen father said you swallow like you had a fishbone in your throat whats the matter with you and caddy across the table not to look at me its for letting it be some darn town squirt i slapped you you will will you now i guess you say calf rope my red hand coming up out of her face what do you think of that scouring her head into the grass sticks criescrossed into the flesh tingling scouring her head say calf rope say it i didnt kiss a dirty girl like natalie anyway the wall went into shadow and then my shadow i had tricked it again i had forgot about the river curving along the road i climbed the wall and then she watched me jump down holding the loaf against her dress i stood in the weeds and we looked at one another for a while why didnt you tell me you lived out this way sister the loaf was wearing slowly out of the paper already it needed a new one well come on then and show me the house not a dirty girl like natalie it was raining we could hear it on the roof sighing through the high sweet emptiness of the barn there touching her not there there not raining hard but we couldnt hear anything but the roof and if it was my blood or her blood she pushed me down the ladder and ran off and left me caddy did was it there it hurt you when caddy did ran off was it there oh she walked just under my elbow the top of her patent leather head the loaf fraying out of the newspaper if you dont get home pretty soon youre going to wear that loaf out and then whatll your mamma say i bet i can lift you up you cant im too heavy did caddy go away did she go to the house you cant see the barn from our house did you ever try to see the barn from it was her fault she pushed me she ran away i can lift you up see how i can oh her blood or my blood oh we went on in the thin dust our feet silent as rubber in the thin dust where pencils of sun slanted in the trees and i could feel water again running swift and peaceful in the secret shade you live a long way dont you youre mighty smart to go this far to town by yourself its like dancing sitting down did you ever dance sitting down we could hear the rain a rat in the crib the empty barn vacant with horses how do you hold to dance do you hold like this oh i used to hold like this you thought i wasnt strong enough didnt you oh oh oh oh i hold to use like this i mean did you hear what i said i said oh oh oh oh the road went on still and empty the sun slanting more and more her stiff little pigtails were bound at the tips with bits of crimson cloth a corner of the wrapping flapped a little as she walked the nose of the loaf naked i stopped look here do you live down this road we havent passed a house in a mile almost she looked at me black and secret and friendly where do you live sister dont you live back there in town there was a bird somewhere in the woods beyond the broken and infrequent slanting of sunlight your papas going to be worried about you dont you reckon youll get a whipping for not coming straight home with that bread the bird whistled again invisible a sound meaningless and profound inflexionless ceasing as though cut off with the blow of a knife and again and that sense of water swift and peaceful above secret places felt not seen not heard oh hell sister about half the paper hung limp thats not doing any good now i tore it off and dropped it beside the road come on well have to go back to town well go back along the river we left the road among the moss little pale flowers grew and the sense of water mute and unseen i hold to use like this i mean i use to hold she stood in the door looking at us her hands on her hips you pushed me it was your fault it hurt me too we were dancing sitting down i bet caddy cant dance sitting down stop that stop that i was just brushing the trash off the back of your dress you keep your nasty old hands off of me it was your fault you pushed me down im mad at you i dont care she looked at us stay mad she went away we began to hear the shouts the splashings i saw a brown body gleam for an instant stay mad my shirt was getting wet and my hair across the roof hearing the roof loud now i could see natalie going through the garden among the rain get wet i hope you catch pneumonia go on home cowface i jumped hard as i could into the hogwallow the mud yellowed up to my waist stinking i kept on plunging until i fell down and rolled over in it hear them in swimming sister i wouldnt mind doing that myself if i had time when i have time i could hear my watch mud was warmer than the rain it smelled awful she had her back turned i went around in front of her you know what i was doing she turned her back i went around in front of her the rain creeping into the mud flatting her bod ice through her dress it smelled horrible i was hugging her thats what i was doing she turned her back i went around in front of her i was hugging her i tell you i dont give a damn what you were doing you dont you dont ill make you ill make you give a damn she hit my hands away i smeared mud on her with the other hand i couldnt feel the wet smacking of her hand i wiped mud from my legs smeared it on her wet hard turning body hearing her fingers going into my face but i couldnt feel it even when the rain began to taste sweet on my lips they saw us from the water first heads and shoulders they yelled and one rose squatting and sprang among them they looked like beavers the water ripping about their chins yelling take that girl awayl what did you want to bring a girl here for go on awayl she wont hurt you we just want to watch you for a while they squatted in the water their heads drew into a clump atching us then they broke and rushed toward us hurling water with their hands we moved quick look out boys she wont hurt you go on away harvard it was the second boy the one that thought the horse and wagon back there at the bridge splash them fellows lets get out and throw them in another said i aint afraid of any girl splash them splash them they rushed toward us hurling water we moved back go on away they yelled go on away we went away they huddled just under the bank their slick heads in a row against the bright water we went on thats not for us is it the sun slanted through to the moss here and there leveller poor kid youre just a girl little flowers grew among the moss littler than i had ever seen youre just a girl poor kid there was a path curving along beside the water then the water was still again dark and still and swift nothing but a girl poor sister we lay in the wet grass panting the rain like cold shot on my back do you care now do you do you my lord we sure are in a mess get up where the rain touched my forehead it began to smart my hand came red away streaking off pink in the rain does it hurt of course it does what do you reckon i tried to scratch your eyes out my lord we sure do stink we better try to wash it off in the branch theres town again sister youll have to go home now ive got to get back to school look how late its getting youll go home now wont you but she just looked at me with her black secret friendly gaze the halfnaked loaf clutched to her breast its wet i thought we jumped back in time i took my handkerchief and tried to wipe the loaf but the crust began to come off so i stopped well just have to let it dry itself hold it like this she held it like that it looked kind of like rats had been eating it now and the water building and building up the squatting back the sloughed mud stinking surfaceward pocking the pattering surface like grease on a hot stove i told you id make you i dont give a goddam what you do then we heard the running and we stopped and looked back and saw him coming up the path running the level shadows flicking upon his legs hes in a hurry wed then i saw another man an oldish man running heavily clutching a stick and a boy naked from the waist up clutching his pants as he ran theres julio the little girl said and then i saw his italian face and his eyes as he sprang upon me we went down his hands were jabbing at my face and he was saying something and trying to bite me i reckon and then they hauled him off and held him heaving and thrashing and yelling and they held his arms and he tried to kick me until they dragged him back the little girl was howling holding the loaf in both arms the half naked boy was darting and jumping up and down clutching his trousers and someone pulled me up in time to see another stark naked figure come around the tranquil bend in the path running and change direction in midstride and leap into the woods a couple of garments rigid as boards behind it julio still struggled the man who had pulled me up said whoa now we got you he wore a vest but no coat upon it was a met shield in his other hand he clutched a knotted polished stick youre anse arent you i said i was looking for you whats the matter i warn you that anything you say will be used aganst you he said youre under arrest i killa heem julio said he struggled two men held him the little girl howled steadily holding the bread you

home julio shouted at her i beat hell outa you we went down the street and turned into a bit of lawn in which set back from the street stood a one storey building of brick trimmed with white we went up the rock path to the door where anse halted everyone except us and made them remain outside we entered a bare room smelling of stale tobacco there was a sheet iron stove in the center of a wooden frame filled with sand and a faded map on the wall and the dingy plat of a township behind a scarred littered table a man with a fierce roach of iron gray hair peered at us over steel spectacles got him did ye anse he said got him squire he opened a huge dusty book and drew it to him and dipped a foul pen into an inkwell filled with what looked like coal dust look here mister shreve said the

boston after this you damned fool shreve said what the hell do you mean anyway straggling off here fooling with these damn wops come on spoade said they must be getting impatient mrs bland was talking to them they were miss holmes and miss daingerfield and they quit listening to her and looked at me again with that delicate and curious horror their veils turned back upon their little white noses and their eyes fleeing and mysterious beneath the veils quentin compson mrs bland said what would your mother say a young man naturally gets into scrapes but to be arrested on foot by a country policeman what did they think hed done gerald nothing gerald said nonsense what was it you spoade he was trying to kidnap that little dirty girl but they caught him in time spoade said nonsense mrs bland said but her voice sort of died away and she stared at me for a moment and the girls drew their breaths in with a soft concerted sound fiddlesticks mrs bland said briskly if that isnt just like these ignorant lowclass yankees get in quentin shreve and i sat on two small collapsible seats gerald cranked the car and got in and we started now quentin you tell me what all this foolishness is about mrs bland said i told them shreve hunched and furious on his little seat and spoade sitting again on the back of his neck beside miss daingerfield and the joke is all the time quentin had us all fooled spoade said all the time we thought he was the model youth that anybody could trust a daughter with until the police showed him up at his nefarious work hush up spoade mrs bland said we drove down the street and crossed the bridge and passed the house where the pink garment hung in the window thats what you get for not reading my note why didnt you come and get it mr mackenzie says he told you it was there yessum i intended to but i never went back to the room youd have let us sit there waiting i dont know how long if it hadnt been for mr mackenzie when he said you hadnt come back that left an extra place so we asked him to come were very glad to have you anyway mr mackenzie shreve said nothing his arms were folded and he glared straight ahead past geralds cap it was a cap for motoring in england mrs bland said so we passed that house and three others and another yard where the little girl stood by the gate she didnt have the bread now and her face looked like it had been streaked with coaldust i waved my hand but she made no reply only her head turned slowly as the car passed following us with her unwinking gaze then we ran beside the wall our shadows running along the wall and after a while we passed a piece of torn newspaper lying beside the road and i began to laugh again i could feel it in my throat and i looked off into the trees where the afternoon slanted thinking of afternoon and of the bird and the boys in swimming but still i couldnt stop it and then i knew that if i tried too hard to stop it id be crying and i thought about how id thought about i could not be a virgin with so many of them walking along in the shadows and whispering with their soft girlvoices lingering in the shadowy places and the words coming out and perfume and eyes you could feel not see but if it was that simple to do it wouldnt be anything and if it wasnt anything what was i and then mrs bland said quentin is he sick mr mackenzie and then shreves fat hand touched my knee and spoade began talking and i quit trying to stop it if that hamper is in his way mr mackenzie move it over on your side i brought a hamper of wine because i think young gentlemen should drink wine although my father geralds grandfather ever do that have you ever done that in the gray darkness a little light her hands locked about they do when they can get it spoade said hey shreve her knees her face looking at the sky the smell of honeysuckle upon her face and throat beer too shreve said his hand touched my knee again i moved my knee again like a thin wash of lilac colored paint talking about him bringing youre not a gentleman spoade said him between us until the shape of her blurred not with dark no im canadian shreve said talking about him the oar blades winking him along winking the cap made for motoring in england and all time rushing beneath and they two blurred within the other forever more he had been in the army had killed men i adore canada miss daingerfield said i think its marvellous did you ever drink perfume spoade said with one hand he could lift her to his shoulder and run with her running running no shreve said running the beast with two backs and she blurred in the winking oars running the swine of euboeleus running coupled within how many caddy neither did i spoade said i dont know too many there was something terrible in me terrible in me father i have committed have you ever done that we didnt we didnt do that did we do that and geralds grandfather always picked his own mint before breakfast while the dew was still on it he wouldnt even let old wilkie touch it do you remember gerald but always gathered it himself and made his own julep he was as crotchety about his julep as an old maid measuring everything by a recipe in his head there was only one man he ever gave that recipe to that was we did how can you not know it if youll just wait ill tell you how it was it was a crime we did a terrible crime it cannot be hid you think it can but wait poor quentin youve never done that have you and ill tell you how it was ill tell father then itll have to be because you love father then well have to go away

you thought i was in the house where that damn honeysuckle trying not to think the swing the cedars the secret surges the breathing locked drinking the wild breath the yes yes yes yes never be got to drink wine himself but he always said that a hamper what book did you read that in the one where geralds rowing suit of wine was a necessary part of any gentlemens picnic basket did you love them caddy did you love them when they touched me i died one minute she was standing there the next he was yelling and pulling at her dress they went into the hall and up the stairs yelling and shoving at her up the stairs to the bathroom door and stopped her back against the door and her arm across her face yelling and trying to shove her into the bathroom when she came in to supper t p was feeding him he started again just whimpering at first until she touched him then he yelled she stood there her eyes like cornered rats then i was running in the gray darkness it smelled of rain and all flower scents the damp warm air released and crickets sawing away in the grass pacing me with a small travelling island of silence fancy watched me across the fence blotchy like a quilt on a line i thought damn that nigger he forgot to feed her again i ran down the hill in that vacuum of crickets like a breath travelling across a mirror she was lying in the water her head on the sand spit the water flowing about her hips there was a little more light in the water her skirt half saturated flopped along her flanks to the waters motion in heavy ripples going nowhere renewed themselves of their own movement i stood on the bank i could smell the honeysuckle on the water gap the air seemed to drizzle with honeysuckle and with the rasping of crickets a substance you could feel on the flesh is benjy still crying i dont know yes i dont know poor benjy i sat down on the bank the crass was damn a little then i found my shoes wet get out of that water are you crazy but she didnt move her face was a white blur framed out of the blur of the sand by her hair get out now she sat up then she rose her skirt flopped against her draining she climbed the bank her clothes flopping sat down why dont you wring it out do you want to catch cold yes the water sucked and gurgled across the sand spit and on in the dark among the willows across the shallow the water rippled like a piece of cloth holding still a little light as water does hes crossed all the oceans all around the world then she talked about him clasping her wet knees her face tilted back in the gray light the smell of honeysuckle there was a light in mothers room and in benjys where t p was putting him to bed do you love him her hand came out i didnt move it fumbled down my arm and she held my hand flat against her chest her heart thudding no no did he make you then he made you do it let him he was stronger than you and he tomorrow ill kill him i swear i will father neednt know until afterward and then you and i nobody need ever know we can take my school money we can cancel my matriculation caddy you hate him dont you dont you she held my hand against her chest her heart thudding i turned and caught her arm caddy you hate him dont you she moved my hand up against her throat her heart was hammering there poor quentin her face looked at the sky it was low so low that all smells and sounds of night seemed to have been crowded down like under a slack tent especially the honeysuckle it had got into my breathing it was on her face and throat like paint her blood pounded against my hand i was leaning on my other arm it began to jerk and jump and i had to pant to get any air at all out of that thick gray honeysuckle yes i hate him i would die for him ive already died for him i die for him over and over again everytime this goes when i lifted my hand i could still feel crisscrossed twigs and grass burning into the palm poor quentin she leaned back on her arms her hands locked about her knees youve never done that have you what done what that what i have what i did yes yes lots of times with lots of girls then i was crying her hand touched me again and i was crying against her damp blouse then she lying on her back looking past my head into the sky i could see a rim of white under her irises i opened my knife do you remember the day damuddy died when you sat down in the water in your drawers

touch your hand to it dont cry poor quentin but i couldnt stop she held my head against her damp hard breast i could hear her heart going firm and slow now not hammering and the water gurgling among the willows in the dark and waves of honeysuckle coming up the air my arm and shoulder were twisted under me what is it what are you doing her muscles gathered i sat up its my knife i dropped it she sat up what time is it i dont know she rose to her feet i fumbled along the ground im going let it go to the house i could feel her standing there i could smell her damp clothes feeling her there its

beyond damn that honeysuckle i wish it would stop you used to like it we crossed the crest and went on toward the trees she walked into me she gave over a little the ditch was a black scar on the gray grass she walked into me again she looked at me and gave over we reached the ditch lets go this way what for lets see if you can still see nancys bones i havens thought to look in a long time have you

into the gray toward us coming toward us tall and flat and still even moving like he was still she went to him this is quentin im wet im wet all over you dont have to if you dont want to their shadows one shadow her head rose it was above his on the sky higher their two heads you dont have to if you dont want to then not two heads the darkness smelled of rain of damp grass and leaves the gray light drizzling like rain the honeysuckle coming up in damp waves i could see her face a blur against his shoulder he held her in one arm like she was no bigger than a child he extended his hand glad to know you we shook hands then we stood there her shadow high against his shadow one shadow whatre you going to do quentin walk a while i think ill go through the woods to the road and come back through

honeysuckle come here what do you want come here quentin i went back she touched my shoulder leaning down her shadow the blur of her face leaning down from his high shadow i drew back look out you go on home im not sleepy im going to take a walk wait for me at the branch im going for a walk ill be there soon wait for me you wait no im going through the woods i didnt look back the tree frogs didnt pay me any mind the gray light like moss in the trees drizzling but still it wouldnt rain after a while i turned went back to the edge of the woods as soon as i got there i began to smell honeysuckle again i could see the lights on the courthouse clock and the glare of town the square on the sky and the dark willows along the branch and the light in mothers windows the light still on in benjys room and i stooped through the fence and went across the pasture running i ran in the gray grass among the crickets the honeysuckle getting stronger and stronger and the smell of water then i could see the water the color of gray honeysuckle i lay down on the bank with my face close to the ground so i couldnt smell the honeysuckle i couldnt smell it then and i lay there feeling the earth going through my clothes listening to the water and after a while i wasnt breathing so hard and i lay there thinking that if i didnt move my face i wouldnt have to breathe hard and smell it and then i wasnt thinking about anything at all she came along the bank and stopped i didnt move its late you go on home what you go on home its late all right her clothes rustled i didnt move they stopped rustling are you going in like i told you i didnt hear anything caddy yes i will if you want me to i will i sat up she was sitting on the ground her hands clasped about her knee go on to the house like i told

going to walk i went down the drive and out the gate i turned into the lane then i ran before i reached the bridge i saw him leaning on the rail the horse was hitched in the woods he looked over his shoulder then he turned his back he didnt look up until i came onto the bridge and stopped he had a piece of bark in his hands breaking pieces from it and dropping them over the rail into the water i came to tell you to leave town he broke a piece of bark deliberately dropped it carefully into the water watched it float away i said you must leave town he looked at me did she send you to me i say you must go not my father not anybody i say it listen save this for a while i want to know if shes all right have they been bothering her up there thats something you dont need to trouble yourself about then i heard myself saying ill give you until sundown to leave town he broke a piece of bark and dropped it into the water then he laid the bark on the rail and rolled a cigarette with those two swift motions spun the match over the rail what will you do if i dont leave ill kill you dont think that just because i look like a kid to you the smoke flowed in two jets from his nostrils across his face how old are you i began to shake my hands were on the rail i thought if i hid them hed know why ill give you until tonight listen buddy whets your name benjys the natural isnt he quentin my mouth said it i didnt say it at all quentin he raked the cigarette ash carefully off against the rail he did it slowly and carefully like sharpening a pencil my hands had quit shaking listen no good taking it so hard its not your fault kid it would have been some other fellow did you ever have a sister did you no but theyre all bitches i hit him my open hand beat the impulse to shut it to his face his hand moved as fast as mine the cigarette went over the rail i swung with the other hand he caught it too before the cigarette reached the water he held both my wrists in the same hand his other hand flicked to his armpit under his coat behind him the sun slanted and a bird sing ing somewhere beyond the sun we looked at one another while the bird singing he turned my hands loose look here he took the bark from the rail and dropped it into the water it bobbed up the current took it floated away his hand lay on the rail holding the pistol loosely we waited you cant hit it now no it floated on it was quite still in the woods i heard the bird again and the water afterward the pistol came up he didnt aim at all the bark disappeared then pieces of it floated up spreading he hit two more of them pieces of bark no bigger than silver dollars thats enough i guess he swung the cylinder out and blew into the barrel a thin wisp of smoke dissolved he reloaded the three chambers shut the cylinder he handed it to me butt first what for i wont try to beat that youll need it from what you said im giving you this one because youve seen what itll do to hell with your gun i hit him i was still trying to hit him long after he was holding my wrists but i still tried then it was like i was looking at him through a piece of colored glass i could hear my blood and then i could see the sky again and branches against it and the sun slanting through them and he holding me on my feet did you hit me i couldnt hear what yes how do you feel all right let go he let me go i leaned against the rail do you feel all right let me alone im all right can you make it home all right go on let me alone youd better not try to walk take my horse no you go on you can hang the reins on the pommel and turn him loose hell go back to the stable let me alone you go on and let me alone i leaned on the rail looking at the water i heard him untie the horse and ride off and after a while i couldnt hear anything but the water and then the bird again i left the bridge and sat down with my back against a tree and leaned my head against the tree and shut my eyes a patch of sun came through and fell across my eyes and i moved a little further around the tree i heard the bird again and the water and then everything sort of rolled away and i didnt feel anything at all i felt almost good after all those days and the nights with honeysuckle coming up out of the darkness into my room where i was trying to sleep even when after a while i knew that he hadnt hit me that he had lied about that for her sake too and that i had just passed out like a girl but even that didnt matter anymore and i sat there against the tree with little flecks of sunlight brushing across my face like yellow leaves on a twig listening to the water and not thinking about anything at all even when i heard the horse coming fast i sat there with my eyes closed and heard its feet bunch scuttering the hissing sand and feet running and her hard running hands fool fool are you hurt i opened my eyes her hands running on my face i didnt know which way until i heard the pistol i didnt know where i didnt think he and you running off slipping i didnt think he would have she held my face between her hands bumping my head against the tree stop stop that i caught her wrists quit that quit it i knew he wouldnt i knew he wouldnt she tried to bump my head against the tree i told him never to speak to me again i told him she tried to break her wrists free let me go stop it im stronger than you stop it now let me go ive got to catch him and ask his let me go quentin please let me go let me go all at once she quit her wrists went lax yes i can tell him i can make him believe anytime i can make him caddy she hadnt hitched prince he was liable to strike out for home if the notion took him anytime he will believe me do you love him caddy do i what she looked at me then everything emptied out of her eyes and they looked like the eyes in statues blank and unseeing and serene put your hand against my throat she took my hand and held it flat against her throat now say his name dalton ames i felt the first surge of blood there it surged in strong accelerating beats say it again her face looked off into the trees where the sun slanted and where the bird say it again dalton ames her blood surged steadily beating and beating against my hand it dept on running for a long time but my face felt cold and sort of dead and my eye and the cut place on my finger was smarting again i could hear shreve working the pump then he came back with the basin and a round blob of twilight wobbling in it with a yellow edge like a fading balloon then my reflection i tried to see my face in it has it stopped shreve said give me the rag he tried to take it from my hand look out i said i can do it yes its about stopped now i dipped the rag again breaking the balloon the rag stained the water i wish i had a clean one you need a piece of beefsteak for that eye shreve said damn if you wont have a shiner tomorrow the son of a bitch he said did i hurt him any i wrung out the handkerchief and tried to clean the blood off of my vest you cant get that off shreve said youll have to send it to the cleaners come on hold it on your eye why dont you i can get some of it off i said but i wasnt doing much good what sort of shape is my collar in i dont know shreve said hold it against your eye here look out i said i can do it did i hurt him any you may have hit him i may have looked away just then or blinked or something he boxed the hell out of you he boxed you all over the place what did you want to fight him with your fists for you goddam fool how do you feel i feel fine i said i wonder if i can get something to clean my vest oh forget your damn clothes does your eye hurt i feel fine i said everything was sort of violet and still the sky green paling into gold beyond the gable of the house and a plume of smoke rising from the chimney without any wind i heard the pump again a man was filling a pail watching us across his pumping shoulder a woman crossed the door but she didnt look out i could hear a cow lowing somewhere come on shreve said let your clothes alone and put that rag on your eye ill send your suit out first thing tomorrow all right im sorry i didnt bleed on him a little at least son of a bitch shreve said spoade came out of the house talking to the woman i reckon and crossed the yard he looked at me with his cold quizzical eyes well bud he said looking at me ill be damned if you dont go to a lot of trouble to have your fun kidnapping then fighting what do you do on your holidays burn houses im all right i said what did mrs bland say shes giving gerald hell for bloodying you up shell give you hell for letting him when she sees you she dont object to the fighting its the blood that annoys her i think you lost caste with her a little by not holding your blood better how do you feel sure shreve said if you cant be a bland the next best thing is to commit adultery with one or get drunk and fight him as the case may be quite right spoade said but i didnt know quentin was drunk he wasnt shreve said do you have to be drunk to want to hit that son of a bitch well i think id have to be pretty drunk to try it after seeing how quentin came out whered he learn to

i dont know why i did the first i knew was when you jumped up all of a sudden and said did you ever have a sister did you and when he said no you hit him i noticed you kept on looking at him but you didnt seem to be paying any attention to what anybody was saying until you jumped up and asked him if he had any sisters ah he was blowing off as usual shreve said about his women you know like he does before girls so they dont know exactly what hes saying all his damn innuendo and lying and a lot of stuff that dont make sense even telling us about some wench that he made a date with to meet at a dance hall in atlantic city and stood her up and went to the hotel and went to bed and how he lay there being sorry for her waiting on the pier for him without him there to give her what she wanted talking about the bodys beauty and the sorry ends thereof and how tough women have it without anything else they can do except lie on their backs leda lurking in the bushes whimpering and moaning for the swan see the son of a bitch id hit him myself only id grabbed up her damn hamper of wine and done it if it had been me oh spoade said the champion of dames bud you excite not only admiration but horror he looked at me cold and quizzical good god he said im sorry i hit him i said do i look too bad to go back and get it over with apologies hell shreve said let them go to hell were going to town he ought to go back so theyll know he fights like a gentleman spoade said gets licked like one i mean like this shreve said with his clothes all over blood why all right spoade said you know best he

spoade said tell them you and quentin had a fight too tell them nothing shreve said tell her her option expired at sunset come on quentin ill ask that woman where the nearest interurban no i said im not going back to town shreve stopped looking at me turning his glasses looked like small yellow moons what are you going to do im not going back to town yet you go on back to the picnic tell them i wouldnt come back because my clothes were spoiled look here he said what are you up to nothing im all right you and spoade go on back ill see you tomorrow i went on across the yard toward the road do you know where the station is shreve said ill find it ill see you all tomorrow tell mrs bland im sorry i spoiled her party they stood watching me i went around the house a rock path went down to the road roses grew on both sides of the path i went through the gate onto the road it dropped downhill toward the woods and i could make out the auto beside the road i went up the hill the light increased as i mounted and before i reached the top i heard a car it sounded far away across the twilight and i stopped and listened to it i couldnt make out the auto any longer but shreve was standing in the road before the house looking up the hill behind him the yellow light lay like a wash of paint on the roof of the house i lifted my hand and went on over the hill listening to the car then the house was gone and i stopped in the green and yellow light and heard the car growing louder and louder until just as it began to die away it ceased all together i waited until i heard it start again then i went on as i descended the light dwindled slowly yet at the same time without altering its quality as if i and not light were changing decreasing though even when the road ran into trees you could have read a newspaper pretty soon i came to a lane i turned into it it was closer and darker than the road but when it came out at the trolley stopanother wooden marqueethe light was still unchanged after the lane it seemed brighter as though i had walked through night in the lane and come out into morning again pretty soon the car came i got on it they turning to look at my eye and found a seat on the left side the lights were on in the car so while we ran between trees i couldnt see anything except my own face and a woman across the aisle with a hat sitting right on top of her head with a broken feather in it but when we ran out of the trees i could see the twilight again that quality of light as if time really had stopped for a while with the sun hanging just under the horizon and then we passed the marquee where the old man had been eating out of the sack and the road going on under the twilight into twilight and the sense of water peaceful and swift beyond then the car went on the draft building steadily up in the open door until it was drawing steadily through the car with the odor of summer and darkness except honeysuckle honeysuckle was the saddest odor of all i think i remember lots of them wistaria was one on the rainy days when mother wasnt feeling quite bad enough to stay away from the windows we used to play under it when mother stayed in bed dilsey would put old clothes on us and let us go out in the rain because she said rain never hurt young folks but if mother was up we always began by playing on the porch until she said we were making too much noise then we went out and played under the wisteria frame this was where i saw the river for the last time this morning about here i could feel water beyond the twilight smell when it bloomed in the spring and it rained the smell was everywhere you didnt notice it so much at other times but when it rained the smell began to come into the house at twilight either it would rain more at twilight or there was something in the light itself but it always smelled strongest then until i would lie in bed thinking when will it stop when will it stop the draft in the door smelled of water a damp steady breath sometimes i could put myself to sleep saying that over and over until after the honeysuckle got all mixed up in it the whole thing came to symbolis night and unrest i seemed to be lying neither asleep nor awake looking down a long corridor of gray halflight where all stable things had become shadowy paradoxical all i had done shadows all i had felt suffered taking visible form antic and perverse mocking without relevance inherent themselves with the denial of the significance they should have affirmed thinking i was i was not who was not was not who i could smell the curves of the river beyond the dusk and i saw the last light supine and tranquil upon tideflats like pieces of broken mirror then beyond them lights began in the pale clear air trembling a little like butterflies hovering a long way off benjamin the child of how he used to sit before that mirror refuge unfailing in which conflict tempered silenced reconciled benjamin the child of mine old age held hostage into egypt o benjamin dilsey said it was because mother was too proud for him they come into white peoples lives like that in sudden sharp black trickles that isolate white facts for an instant in unarguable truth like under a microscope the rest of the time just voices that laugh when you see nothing to laugh at tears when no reason for tears they will bet on the odd or even number of mourners at a funeral a brothel full of them in memphis went into a religious trance ran naked into the street it took three policemen to subdue one of them yes jesus o good man jesus o that good man the car stopped i got out with them looking at my eye when the trolley came it was full i stopped on the back platform seats up front the conductor said i looked into the car there were no seats on the left side im not going far i said ill just stand here we crossed the river the bridge that is arching slow and high into space between silence and nothingness where lights yellow and red and greentrembled in the clear air repeating themselves better go up front and get a seat the conductor said i get off pretty soon i said a couple of blocks i got off before we reached the postoffice theyd all be sitting around somewhere by now though and then i was hearing my watch and i began to listen for the chimes and i touched shreves letter through my coat the bitten shadows of the elms flowing upon my hand and then as i turned into the quad the chimes did begin and i went on while the notes came up like ripples on a pool and passed me and went on saying quarter to what all right quarter to what our windows were dark the entrance was empty i walked close to the left wall when i entered but it was empty just the stairs curving up into shadows echoes of feet in the sad generations like light dust upon the shadows my feet waking them like dust lightly to settle again i could see the letter before i turned the light on propped against a book on the table so i would see it calling him my husband and then spoade said they were going somewhere would not be back until late and mrs bland would need another cavalier but i would have seen him and he cannot get another car for an hour because after six oclock i took out my watch and listened to it clicking away not knowing it couldnt even lie then i laid it face up on the table and took mrs blands letter and tore it across and dropped the pieces into the waste basket and took off my coat vest collar tie and shirt the tie was spoiled too but then niggers maybe a pattern of blood he could call that the one christ was wearing i found the gasoline in shreves room and spread the vest on the table where it would be flat and opened the gasoline the first car in town a girl girl thats what jason couldnt bear smell of gasoline making him sick then got madder than ever because a girl girl had no sister but benjamin benjamin the child of my sorrowful if id just had a mother so i could say mother mother it took a lot of gasoline and then i couldnt tell if it was still the stain or just the gasoline it had started the cut to smarting again so when i went to wash i hung the vest on a chair and lowered the light cord so that the bulb would be drying the splotch i washed my face and hands but even then i could smell it within the soap stinging constricting the nostrils a little then i opened the bag and took the shirt and collar and tie out and put the bloody ones in and closed the bag and dressed while i was brushing my hair the half hour went but there was until the three quarters anyway except suppose seeing on the rushing darkness only his own face no broken feather unless two of them but not two like that going to boston the same night then my face his face for an instant across the crashing when out of darkness two lighted windows in rigid fleeing being crash gone his face and mine just i see saw did i see not goodbye the marquee empty of eating the road empty in darkness in silence the bridge arching into silence darkness sleep the water peaceful and swift not goodbye i turned out the light and went into my bedroom out of the gasoline but i could still smell it i stood at the window the curtains moved slow out of the darkness touching my face like someone breathing asleep breathing slow into the darkness again leaving the touch after they had gone up stairs mother lay back in her chair the camphor handker chief to her mouth father hadnt moved he still sat beside her holding her hand the bellowing hammering away like no place for it in silence when i was little there was a picture in one of our books a dark place into which a single weak ray of light came slanting upon two faces lifted out of the shadow you know what id do if i were king she never was a queen or a fairy she was always a king or a giant or a general id break that place open and drag them out and id whip them good it was torn out jagged out i was glad id have to turn back to it until the dungeon was mother herself she and father upward into weak light holding hands and us lost somewhere below even them without even a ray of light then the honeysuckle got into it as soon as i turned off the light and tried to go to sleep it would begin to come into the room in waves building and building up until i would have to pant to get any air at all out of it until i would have to get up and feel my way like when i was a little boy hands can see touching in the mind shaping unseen door door now nothing hands can see my nose could see gasoline the vest on the table the door the corridor was still empty of all the feet in sad generations seeking water yet the eyes unseeing clenched like teeth not disbelieving doubting even the absence of pain shin ankle knee the long invisible flowing of the stairrailing where a misstep in the darkness filled with sleeping mother father caddy jason maury door i am not afraid only mother father caddy jason maury getting so far ahead sleeping i will sleep fast when i door door door it was empty too the pipes the porcelain the stained quiet walls the throne of contemplation i had forgotten the glass but i could hands can see cooling fingers invisible swanthroat where less than moses rod the glass touch tentative not to drumming lean cool throat drumming cooling the metal the glass full overfull cooling the glass the fingers flushing sleep leaving the taste of dampened sleep in the long silence of the throat i returned up the corridor waking the lost feet in whispering battalions in the silence into the gasoline the watch telling its furious lie on the dark table then the curtains breathing out of the dark upon my face leaving the breathing upon my face a quarter hour yet and then ill not be the peacefullest words peacefullest words non fui sum fui non sum somewhere i heard bells once mississippi or massachusetts i was i am not massachusetts or mississippi shreve has a bottle in his trunk arent you even going to open it mr and mrs jason richmond compson announce the three times days arent you even going to open it marriage of their daughter candace that liquor teaches you to confuse the means with the end i am drink i was not let us sell benjys pasture so that quentin may go to harvard and i may knock my bones together and together i will be dead in was it one year caddy said shreve has a bottle in his trunk sir i will not need shreves i have sold benjys pasture and i can be dead in harvard caddy said in the caverns and the grottoes of the sea tumbling peacefully to the wavering tides because harvard is such a fine sound forty acres is no high price for a fine sound a fine dead sound we will swap benjys pasture for a fine dead sound it will last him a long time because he cannot hear it unless he can smell it as soon as she came in the door he began to cry i thought all the time it was just one of those town squirts that father was always teasing her about until i didnt notice him any more than any other stranger drummer or what thought they were army shirts until all of a sudden i knew he wasnt thinking of me at all as a potential source of harm but was thinking of her when he looked at me was looking at me through her like through a piece of colored glass why must you meddle with me dont you know it wont do any good i thought youd have left that for mother and jason did mother set jason to spy on you i wouldnt have women only use other peoples codes of honor its because she loves caddy staying downstairs even when she was sick so father couldnt kid uncle maury before jason father said uncle maury was too poor a classicist to risk the blind immortal boy in person he should have chosen jason because jason would have made only the same kind of blunder uncle maury himself would have made not one to get him a black eye the patterson boy was smaller than jason too they sold the kites for a nickel a piece until the trouble over finances jason got a new partner still smaller one small enough anyway because t p said jason still treasurer but father said why should uncle maury work if he father could support five or six niggers that did nothing at all but sit with their feet in the oven he certainly could board and lodge uncle maury now and then and lend him a little money who kept his fathers belief in the celestial derivation of his own species at such a fine heat then mother would cry and say that father believed his people were better than hers that he was ridiculing uncle maury to teach us the same thing she couldnt see that father was teaching us that all men are just accumulations dolls stuffed with sawdust swept up from the trash heaps where all previous dolls had been thrown away the sawdust flowing from what wound in what side that not for me died not it used to be i thought of death as a man something like grandfather a friend of his a kind of private and particular friend like we used to think of grandfathers desk not to touch it not even to talk loud in the room where it was i always thought of them as being together somewhere all the time waiting for old colonel sartoris to come down and sit with them waiting on a high place beyond cedar trees colonel sartoris was on a still higher place looking out across at something and they were waiting for him to get done looking at it and come down grandfather wore his uniform and we could hear the murmur of their voices from beyond the cedars they were always talking and grandfather was always right the three quarters began the first note sounded measured and tranquil serenely peremptory emptying the unhurried silence for the next one and thats it if people could only change one another forever that way merge like a flame swirling up for an instant then blown cleanly out along the cool eternal dark instead of iying there trying not to think of the swing until all cedars came to have that vivid dead smell of perfume that benjy hated so just by imagining the clump it seemed to me that i could hear whispers secret surges smell the beating of hot blood under wild unsecret flesh watching against red eyelids the swine untethered in pairs rushing coupled into the sea and he we must just stay awake and see evil done for a little while its not always and i it doesnt have to be even that long for a man of courage and he do you consider that courage and i yes sir dont you and he every man is the arbiter of his own virtues whether or not you consider it courageous is of more importance than the act itself than any act otherwise you could not be in earnest and i you dont believe i am serious and he i think you are too serious to give me any cause for alarm you wouldnt have felt driven to the expedient of telling me you had committed incest otherwise and i i wasnt lying i wasnt lying and he you wanted to sublimate a piece of natural human folly into a horror and then exorcise it with truth and i it was to isolate her out of the loud world so that it would have to flee us of necessity and then the sound of it would be as though it had never been and he did you try to make her do it and i i was afraid to i was afraid she might and then it wouldnt have done any good but if i could tell you we did it would have been so and then the others wouldnt be so and then the world would roar away and he and now this other you are not lying now either but you are still blind to what is in yourself to that part of general truth the sequence of natural events and their causes which shadows every mans brow even benjys you are not thinking of finitude you are contemplating an apotheosis in which a temporary state of mind will become symmetrical above the flesh and aware both of itself and of the flesh it will not quite discard you will not even be dead and i temporary and he you cannot bear to think that someday it will no longer hurt you like this now were getting at it you seem to regard it merely as an experience that will whiten your hair overnight so to speak without altering your appearance at all you wont do it under these conditions it will be a gamble and the strange thing is that man who is conceived by accident and whose every breath is a fresh cast with dice already loaded against him will not face that final main which he knows before hand he has assuredly to face without essaying expedients ranging all the way from violence to petty chicanery that would not deceive a child until someday in very disgust he risks everything on a single blind turn of a card no man ever does that under the first fury of despair or remorse or bereavement he does it only when he has realised that even the despair or remorse or bereavement is not particularly important to the dark diceman and i temporary and he it is hard believing to think that a love or a sorrow is a bond purchased without design and which matures willynilly and is recalled without warning to be replaced by whatever issue the gods happen to be floating at the time no you will not do that until you come to believe that even she was not quite worth despair perhaps and i i will never do that nobody knows what i know and he i think youd better go on up to cambridge right away you might go up into maine for a month you can afford it if you are careful it might be a good thing watching pennies has healed more scars than jesus and i suppose i realise what you believe i will realise up there next week or next month and he then you will remember that for you to go to harvard has been your mothers dream since you were born and no compson has ever disappointed a lady and i temporary it will be better for me for all of us and he every man is the arbiter of his own virtues but let no man prescribe for another mans wellbeing and i temporary and he was the saddest word of all there is nothing else in the world its not despair until time its not even time until it was the last note sounded at last it stopped vibrating and the darkness was still again i entered the sitting room and turned on the light i put my vest on the gasoline was faint now barely noticeable and in the mirror the stain didnt show not like my eye did anyway i put on my coat shreves letter crackled through the cloth and i took it out and examined the address and put it in my side pocket then i carried the watch into shreves room and put it in his drawer and went to my room and got a fresh handkerchief and went to the door and put my hand on the light switch then i remembered i hadnt brushed my teeth so i had to open the bag again i found my toothbrush and got some of shreves paste and went out and brushed my teeth i squeezed the brush as dry as i could and put it back in the bag and shut it and went to the door again before i snapped the light out i looked around to see if there was anything else then i saw that i had forgotten my hat id have to go by the postoffice and id be sure to meet some of them and theyd think i was a harvard square student making like he was a senior i had forgotten to brush it too but shreve had a brush so i didnt have to open the bag any more april once a bitch always a bitch what i say i says youre lucky if her playing out of school is all that worries you i says she ought to be down there in that kitchen right now instead of up there in her room gobbing paint on her face and waiting for six niggers that cant even stand up out of a chair unless theyve got a pan full of bread and meat to balance them to fix breakfast for her and mother says but to have the school authorities think that i have no control over her that i cant well i says you cant can you you never have tried to do anything with her i says how do you expect to begin this late when shes seventeen years old she thought about that for a while but to have them think that i didnt even know she had a report card she told me last fall that they had quit using them this year and now for professor junkin to call me on the telephone and tell me if shes absent one more time she will have to leave school how does she do it where does she go youre down town all day you ought to see her if she stays on the streets yes i says if she stayed on the streets i dont reckon shed be playing out of school just to do something she could do in public i says what do you mean she says i dont mean anything i says i just answered your question then she begun to cry again talking about how her own flesh and blood rose up to curse her you asked me i says i dont mean you she says you are the only one of them that isnt a reproach to me sure i says i never had time to be i never had time to go to harvard or drink myself into the ground i had to work but of course if you want me to follow her around and see what she does i can quit the store and get a job where i can work at night then i can watch her during the day and you can use ben for the night shift i know im just a trouble and a burden to you she says crying on the pillow i ought to know it i says youve been telling me that for thirty years even ben ought to know it now do you want me to say anything to her about it do you think it will do any good she says not if you come down there interfering just when i get started i says if you want me to control her just say so and keep your hands off everytime i try to you come butting in and then she gives both of us the laugh remember shes your own flesh and blood she says sure i says thats just what im thinking offlesh and a little blood too if i had my way when people act like niggers no matter who they are the only thing to do is treat them like a nigger im afraid youll lose your temper with her she says well i says you havent had much luck with your system you want me to do anything about it or not say one way or the other ive got to get on to work i know you have to slave your life away for us she says you know if i had my way youd have an office of your own to go to and hours that became a bascomb because you are a bascomb despite your name i know that if your father could have foreseen well i says i reckon hes entitled to guess wrong now and then like anybody else even a smith or a jones she begun to cry again to hear you speak bitterly of your dead father she says all right i says all right have it your way but as i havent got an office ill have to get on to what i have got do you want me to say anything to her im afraid youll lose your temper with her she says all right i says i wont say anything then but something must be done she says to have people think i permit her to stay out of school and run about the streets or that i cant prevent her doing it jason jason she says how could you how could you leave me with these burdens now now i says youll make yourself sick why dont you either lock her up all day too or turn her over to me and quit worrying over her my own flesh and blood she says crying so i says all right ill tend to her quit crying now dont lose your temper she says shes just a child remember no i says i wont i went out closing the door jason she says i didnt answer i went down the hall jason she says beyond the door i went on down stairs there wasnt anybody in the

satdy dont mean nothin atall to him saturday wouldnt mean nothing to you either i says if it depended on me to pay you wages get those things out of the crates now and drag them inside i opened her letter first and took the check out just like a woman six days late yet they try to make men believe that theyre capable of conducting a business how long would a man that thought the first of the month came on the sixth last in business and like as not when they sent the bank statement out she would want to know why i never deposited my salary until the sixth things like that never occur to a woman i had no answer to my letter about quentins easter dress did it arrive all right ive had no answer to the last two letters i wrote her though the check in the second one was cashed with the other check is she sick let me know at once or ill come there and see for myself you promised you would let me know when she needed things i will expect to hear from you before the th no youd better wire me at once you are opening my letters to her i know that as well as if i were looking at you youd better wire me at once about her to this address about that time earl started yelling at job so i put them away and went over to try to put some life into him what this country needs is white labor let these dam trifling niggers starve for a couple of years then theyd see what a soft thing they have along toward ten oclock i went up front there was a drummer there it was a couple of minutes to ten and i invited him up the street to get a dope we got to talking about crops theres nothing to it i says cotton is a speculators crop they fill the farmer full of hot air and get him to raise a big crop for them to whipsaw on the market to trim the suckers with do you think the farmer gets anything out of it except a red neck and a hump in his back you think the man that sweats to put it into the ground gets a red cent more than a bare living i says let him make a big crop and it wont be worth picking let him make a small crop and he wont have enough to gin and what for so a bunch of dam eastern jews im not talking about men of the jewish religion i says ive known some jews that were fine citizens you might be one yourself i says no he says im an american no offense i says i give every man his due regardless of religion or anything else i have nothing against jews as an individual i says its just the race youll admit that they produce nothing they follow the pioneers into a new country and sell them clothes youre thinking of armenians he says arent you a pioneer wouldnt have any use for new clothes no offense i says i dont hold a mans religion against him sure he says im an american my folks have some french blood why i have a nose like this im an american all right so am i i says not many of us left what im talking about is the fellows that sit up there in new york and trim the sucker gamblers thats right he says nothing to gambling for a poor man there ought to be a law against it dont you think im right i says yes he says i guess youre right the farmer catches it coming and going i know im right i says its a sucker game unless a man gets inside information from somebody that knows whats going on i happen to be associated with some people whore right there on the ground they have one of the biggest manipulators in new york for an adviser way i do it i says i never risk much at a time its the fellow that thinks he knows it all and is trying to make a killing with three dollars that theyre laying for thats why they are in the business then it struck ten i went up to the telegraph office it opened up a little just like they said i went into the corner and took out the telegram again just to be sure while i was looking at it a report came in it was up two points they were all buying i could tell that from what they were saying getting aboard like they didnt know it could go but one way like there was a law or something against doing anything but buying well i reckon those eastern jews have got to live too but ill be damned if it hasnt come to a pretty pass when any dam foreigner that cant make a living in the country where god put him can come to this one and take money right out of an americans pockets it was up two points more four points but hell they were right there and knew what was going on and if i wasnt going to take the advice what was i paying them ten dollars a month for i went out then i remembered and came back and sent the wire all well q writing today q the operator says yes i says q cant you spell q i just asked to be sure he says you send it like i wrote it and ill guarantee you to be sure i says send it collect what you sending jason doc wright says looking over my shoulder is that a code message to buy thats all right about that i says you boys use your own judgment you know more about it than those new york folks do well i ought to doc says id a saved money this year raising it at two cents a pound another report came in it was down a point jasons selling hopkins says look at his face thats all right about what im doing i says you boys follow your own judgment those rich new york jews have got to live like everybody else i says i went on back to the store earl was busy up front i went on back to the desk and read lorraines letter dear daddy wish you were here no good parties when daddys out of town i miss my sweet daddy i reckon she does last time i gave her forty dollars gave it to her i never promise a woman anything nor let her know what im going to give her thats the only way to manage them always keep them guessing if you cant think of any other way to surprise them give them a bust in the jaw i tore it up and burned it over the spittoon i make it a rule never to keep a scrap of paper bearing a womans hand and i never write them at all lorraine is always after me to write to her but i says anything i forgot to tell you will save till i get to memphis again but i says i dont mind you writing me now and then in a plain envelope but if you ever try to call me up on the telephone memphis wont hold you i says i says when im up there im one of the boys but im not going to have any woman calling me on the telephone here i says giving her the forty dollars if you ever get drunk and take a notion to call me on the phone just remember this and count ten before you do it whenll that be she says what i says when youre coming back she says ill let you know i says then she tried to buy a beer but i wouldnt let her keep your money i says buy yourself a dress with it i gave the maid a five too after all like i say money has no value its just the way you spend it it dont belong to anybody so why try to hoard it it just belongs to the man that can get it and keep it theres a man right here in jefferson made a lot of money selling rotten goods to niggers lived in a room over the store about the size of a pigpen and did his own cooking about four or five years ago he was taken sick scared the hell out of him so that when he was up again he joined the church and bought himself a chinese missionary five thousand dollars a year i often think how mad hell be if he was to die and find out theres not any heaven when he thinks about that five thousand a year like i say hed better go on and die now and save money when it was burned good i was just about to shove the others into my coat when all of a sudden something told me to open quentins before i went home but about that time earl started yelling for me up front so i put them away and went and waited on the dam redneck while he spent fifteen minutes deciding whether he wanted a twenty cent hame string or a thirtyfive cent one youd better take that good one i says how do you fellows ever expect to get ahead trying to work with cheap equipment if this one aint any good he says why have you got it on sale i didnt say it wasnt any good i says i said its not as good as that other one how do you know its not he says you ever use airy one of them because they dont ask thirtyfive cents for it i says thats how i know its not as good he held the twenty cent one in his hands drawing it through his fingers i reckon ill take this hyer one he says i offered to take it and wrap it but he rolled it up and put it in his overalls then he took out a tobacco sack and finally got it untied and shook some coins out he handed me a quarter that fifteen cents will buy me a snack of dinner he says all right i says youre the doctor but dont come complaining to me next year when you have to buy a new outfit i aint makin next years crop yit he says finally i got rid of him but every time i took that letter out something would come up they were all in town for the show coming in in droves to give their money to something that brought nothing to the town and wouldnt leave anything except what those grafters in the mayors office will split among themselves and earl chasing back and forth like a hen in a coop saying yes maam mr compson will wait on you jason show this lady a churn or a nickels worth of screen hooks well jason likes work i says no i never had university advantages because at harvard they teach you how to go for a swim at night without knowing how to swim and at sewanee they dont even teach you what water is i says you might send me to the state university maybe ill learn how to stop my clock with a nose spray and then you can send ben to the navy i says or to the cavalry anyway they use geldings in the cavalry then when she sent quentin home for me to feed too i says i guess thats right too instead of me having to go way up north for a job they sent the job down here to me and then mother begun to cry and i says its not that i have any objection to having it here if its any satisfaction to you ill quit work and nurse it myself and let you and dilsey keep the flour barrel full or ben rent him out to a sideshow there must be folks somewhere that would pay a dime to see him then she cried more and kept saying my poor afflicted baby and i says yes hell be quite a help to you when he gets his growth not being more than one and a half times as high as me now and she says shed be dead soon and then wed all be better off and so i says all right all right have it your way its your grandchild which is more than any other grandparents its got can say for certain only i says its only a question of time if you believe shell do what she says and not try to see it you fool yourself because the first time that was the mother kept on saying thank god you are not a compson except in name because you are all i have left now you and maury and i says well i could spare uncle maury myself and then they came and said they were ready to start mother stopped crying then she pulled her veil down and we went down stairs uncle maury was coming out of the diningroom his handkerchief to his mouth they kind of made a lane and we went out the door just in time to see dilsey driving ben and t p back around the corner we went down the steps and got in uncle maury kept saying poor little sister poor little sister talking around his mouth and patting mothers hand talking around whatever it was have you got your band on she says why dont they go on before benjamin comes out and makes a spectacle poor little boy he doesnt know he cant even realise there there uncle maury says patting her hand talking around his mouth its better so let him be unaware of bereavement until he has to other women have their children to support them in times like this mother says you have jason and me he says its so terrible to me she says having the two of them like this in less than two years there there he says after a while he kind of sneaked his hand to his mouth and dropped them out the window then i knew what i had been smelling clove stems i reckon he thought that the least he could do at fathers or maybe the sideboard thought it was still father and tripped him up when he passed like i say if he had to sell something to send quentin to harvard wed all been a dam sight better off if hed sold that sideboard and bought himself a onearmed strait jacket with part of the money i reckon the reason all the compson gave out before it got to me like mother says is that he drank it up at least i never heard of him offering to sell anything to send me to harvard so he kept on patting her hand and saying poor little sister patting her hand with one of the black gloves that we got the bill for four days later because it was the twentysixth because it was the same day one month that father went up there and got it and brought it home and wouldnt tell anything about where she was or anything and mother crying and saying and you didnt even see him you didnt even try to get him to make any provision for it and father says no she shall not touch his money not one cent of it and mother says he can be forced to by law he can prove nothing unlessjason compson she says were you fool enough to tell hush caroline father says then he sent me to help dilsey get that old cradle out of the attic and i says well they brought my job home tonight because all the time we kept hoping theyd get things straightened out and hedfool keep her because mother kept saying she would at least have enough regard for the family not to jeopardise my chance after she and quentin had had theirs and whar else do she belong dilsey says who else gwine raise her cep me aint i raised evy one of yall and a dam fine job you made of it i says anyway itll give her something to sure enough worry over now so we carried the cradle down and dilsey started to set it up in her old room then mother started sure enough hush miss cahline dilsey says you gwine wake her up in there mother says to be contaminated by that atmosphere itll be hard enough as it is with the heritage she already has hush father says dont be silly why aint she gwine sleep in here dilsey says in the same room whar i put her maw to bed evy night of her life since she was big enough to sleep by herself you dont know mother says to have my own daughter cast off by her husband poor little innocent baby she says looking at quentin you will never know the suffering youve caused hush caroline father says what you want to go on like that fo jason fer dilsey says ive tried to protect him mother says ive always tried to protect him from it at least i can do my best to shield her how sleepin in dis room gwine hurt her i like to know dilsey says i cant help it mother says i know im just a troublesome old woman but i know that people cannot flout gods laws with impunity nonsense father says fix it in miss carolines room then dilsey you can say nonsense mother says but she must never know she must never even learn that name dilsey i forbid you ever to speak that name in her hearing if she could grow up never to know that she had a mother i would thank god dont be a fool father says i have never interfered with the way you brought them up mother says but now i cannot stand anymore we must decide this now tonight either that name is never to be spoken in her hearing or she must go or i will go take your choice hush father says youre just upset fix it in here dilsey en yous about sick too dilsey says you looks like a hant you git in bed and ill fix you a toddy and see kin you sleep i bet you aint had a full nights sleep since you lef no mother says dont you know what the doctor says why must you encourage him to drink thats whats the matter with him now look at me i suffer too but im not so weak that i must kill myself with whiskey fiddlesticks father says what do doctors know they make their livings advising people to do whatever they are not doing at the time which is the extent of anyones knowledge of the degenerate ape youll have a minister in to hold my hand next then mother cried and he went out went down stairs and then i heard the sideboard i woke up and heard him going down again mother had gone to sleep or something because the house was quiet at last he was trying to be quiet too because i couldnt hear him only the bottom of his nightshirt and his bare legs in front of the sideboard dilsey fixed the cradle and undressed her and put her in it she never had waked up since he brought her in the house she pretty near too big fer hit dilsey says dar now i gwine spread me a pallet right across de hall so you wont need to git up in de night i wont sleep mother says you go on home i wont mind ill be happy to give the rest of my life to her if i can just prevent hush now dilsey says we gwine take keer of her en you go on to bed too she says to me you got to go to school tomorrow so i went out then mother called me back and cried on me a while you are my only hope she says every night i thank god for you while we were waiting there for them to start she says thank god if he had to be taken too it is you left me and not quentin thank god you are not a compson because all i have left now is you and maury and i says well i could spare uncle maury myself well he kept on patting her hand with his black glove talking away from her he took them off when his turn with the shovel came he got up near the first where they were holding the umbrellas over them stamping every now and then and trying to kick the mud off their feet and sticking to the shovels so theyd have to knock it off making a hollow sound when it fell on it and when i stepped back around the hack i could see him behind a tombstone taking another one out of a bottle i thought he never was going to stop because i had on my new suit too but it happened that there wasnt much mud on the wheels yet only mother saw it and says i dont know when youll ever have another one and uncle maury says now now dont you worry at all you have me to depend on always and we have always the fourth letter was from him but there wasnt any need to open it i could have written it myself or recited it to her from memory adding ten dollars just to be safe but i had a hunch about that other letter i just felt that it was about time she was up to some of her tricks again she got pretty wise after that first time she found out pretty quick that i was a different breed of cat from father when they begun to get it filled up toward the top mother started crying sure enough so uncle maury got in with her and drove off he says you can come in with somebody theyll be glad to give you a lift ill have to take your mother on and i thought about saying yes you ought to brought two bottles instead of just one only i thought about where we were so i let them go on little they cared how wet i got because then mother could have a whale of a time being afraid i was taking pneumonia well i got to thinking about that and watching them throwing dirt into it slapping it on anyway like they were making mortar or something or building a fence and i began to feel sort of funny and so i decided to walk around a while i thought that if i went toward town theyd catch up and be trying to make me get in one of them so i went on back toward the nigger graveyard i got under some cedars where the rain didnt come much only dripping now and then where i could see when they got through and went away after a while they were all gone and i waited a minute and came out i had to follow the path to keep out of the wet grass so i didnt see her until i was pretty near there standing there in a black cloak looking at the flowers i knew who it was right off before she turned and looked at me and lifted up her veil hello jason she says holding out her hand we shook hands what are you doing here i says i thought you promised her you wouldnt come back here i thought you had more sense than that yes she says she looked at the flowers again there must have been fifty dollars worth somebody had put one bunch on quentins you did she says im not surprised though i says i wouldnt put anything past you you dont mind anybody you dont give a dam about anybody oh she says that job she looked at the grave im sorry about that jason i bet you are i says youll talk mighty meek now but you neednt have come back theres not anything left ask uncle maury if you dont believe me i dont want anything she says she looked at the grave why didnt they let me know she says i just happened to see it in the paper on the back page just happened to i didnt say anything we stood there looking at the grave and then i got to thinking about when we were little and one thing and another and i got to feeling funny again kind of mad or something thinking about now wed have uncle maury around the house all the time running things like the way he left me to come home in the rain by myself i says a fine lot you care sneaking in here soon as hes dead but it wont do you any good dont think that you can take advantage of this to come sneaking back if you cant stay on the horse youve got youll have to walk i says we dont even know your name at that house i says do you know that we dont even know your name youd be better off if you were down there with him and quentin i says do you know that i know it she says jason she says looking at the grave if youll fix it so i can see her a minute ill give you fifty dollars you havent got fifty dollars i says will you she says not looking at me lets see it i says i dont believe youve got fifty dollars i could see where her hands were moving under her cloak then she held her hand out dam if it wasnt full of money i could see two or three yellow ones does he still give you money i says how much does he send you ill give you a hundred she says will you just a minute i says and just like i say i wouldnt have her know it for a thousand dollars yes she says just like you say do it just so i see her a minute i wont beg or do anything ill go right on away give me the money i says ill give it to you afterward she says dont you trust me i says no she says i know you i grew up with you youre a fine one to talk about trusting people i says well i says i got to get on out of the rain goodbye i made to go away jason she says i stopped yes i says hurry up im getting wet all right she says here there wasnt anybody in sight i went back and took the money she still held to it youll do it she says looking at me from under the veil you promise let go i says you want somebody to come along and see us she let go i put the money in my pocket youll do it jason she says i wouldnt ask you if there was any other way you dam right theres no other way i says sure ill do it i said i would didnt i only youll have to do just like i say now yes she says i will so i told her where to be and went to the livery stable i hurried and got there just as they were unhitching the hack i asked if they had paid for it yet and he said no and i said mrs compson forgot something and wanted it again so they let me take it mink was driving i bought him a cigar so we drove around until it begun to get dark on the back streets where they wouldnt see him then mink said hed have to take the team on back and so i said id buy him another cigar and so we drove into the lane and i went across the yard to the house i stopped in the hall until i could hear mother and uncle maury upstairs then i went on back to the kitchen she and ben were there with dilsey i said mother wanted her and i took her into the house i found uncle maurys raincoat and put it around her and picked her up and went back to the lane and got in the hack i told mink to drive to the depot he was afraid to pass the stable so we had to go the back way and i saw her standing on the corner under the light and i told mink to drive close to the walk and when i said go on to give the team a bat then i took the raincoat off of her and held her to the window and caddy saw her and sort of jumped forward hit em mink i says and mink gave them a cut and we went past her like a fire engine now get on that train like you promised i says i could see her running after us through the back window hit em again i says lets get on home when we turned the corner she was still running and so i counted the money again that night and put it away and i didnt feel so bad i says i reckon thatll show you i reckon youll know now that you cant beat me out of a job and get away with it it never occurred to me she wouldnt keep her promise and take that train but i didnt know much about them then i didnt have any more sense than to believe what they said because the next morning dam if she didnt walk right into the store only she had sense enough to wear the veil and not speak to anybody it was saturday morning because i was at the store and she came right on back to the desk where i was walking fast liar she says liar are you crazy i says what do you mean coming in here like this she started in but i shut her off i says you already cost me one job do you want me to lose this one too if youve got anything to say to me ill meet you somewhere after dark what have you got to say to me i says didnt i do everything i said i said see her a minute didnt i well didnt you she just stood there looking at me shaking like an aguefit her hands clenched and kind of jerking i did just what i said i would i says youre the one that lied you promised to take that train didnt you didnt you promise if you think you can get that money back just try it i says if itd been a thousand dollars youd still owe me after the risk i took and if i see or hear youre still in town after number runs i says ill tell mother and uncle maury then hold your breath until you see her again she just stood there looking at me twisting her hands together damn you she says damn you sure i says thats all right too mind what i say now after number and i tell them after she was gone i felt better i says i reckon youll think twice before you deprive me of a job that was promised me i was a kid then i believed folks when they said theyd do things ive learned better since besides like i say i guess i dont need any mans help to get along i can stand on my own feet like i always have then all of a sudden i thought of dilsey and uncle maury i thought how shed get around dilsey and that uncle maury would do anything for ten dollars and there i was couldnt even get away from the store to protect my own mother like she says if one of you had to be taken thank god it was you left me i can depend on you and i says well i dont reckon ill ever get far enough from the store to get out of your reach somebodys got to hold on to what little we have left i reckon so as soon as i got home i fixed dilsey i told dilsey she had leprosy and i got the bible and read where a mans flesh rotted off and i told her that if she ever looked at her or ben or quentin theyd catch it too so i thought i had everything all fixed until that day when i came home and found ben bellowing raising hell and nobody could quiet him mother said well get him the slipper then dilsey made out she didnt hear mother said it again and i says id go i couldnt stand that dam noise like i say i can stand lots of things i dont expect much from them but if i have to work all day long in a dam store dam if i dont think i deserve a little peace and quiet to eat dinner in so i says id go and dilsey says quick jason well like a flash i knew what was up but just to make sure i went and got the slipper and brought it back and just like i thought when he saw it youd thought we were killing him so i made dilsey own up then i told mother we had to take her up to bed then and after things got quieted down a little i put the fear of god into dilsey as much as you can into a nigger that is thats the trouble with nigger servants when theyve been with you for a long time they get so full of self importance that theyre not worth a dam think they run the whole family i like to know whuts de hurt in lettin dat po chile see her own baby dilsey says if mr jason was still here hit ud be different only mr jasons not here i says i know you wont pay me any mind but i reckon youll do what mother says you keep on worrying her like this until you get her into the graveyard too then you can fill the whole house full of ragtag and bobtail but what did you want to let that dam boy see her for yous a cold man jason if man you is she says i thank de lawd i got mo heart den cat even ef hit is black at least im man enough to keep that flour barrel full i says and if you do that again you wont be eating out of it either so the next time i told her that if she tried dilsey again mother was going to fire dilsey and send ben to jackson and take quentin and go away she looked at me for a while there wasnt any street light close and i couldnt see her face much but i could feel her looking at me when we were little when shed get mad and couldnt do anything about it her upper lip would begin to jump everytime it jumped it would leave a little more of her teeth showing and all the time shed be as still as a post not a muscle moving except her lip jerking higher and higher up her teeth but she didnt say anything she just said all right how much well if one look through a hack window was worth a hundred i says so after that she behaved pretty well only one time she asked to see a statement of the bank account i know they have mothers indorsement on them she says but i want to see the bank statement i want to see myself where those checks go thats in mothers private business i says if you think you have any right to pry into her private affairs ill tell her you believe those checks are being misappropriated and you want an audit because you dont trust her she didnt say anything or move i could hear her whispering damn you oh damn you oh damn you say it out i says i dont reckon its any secret what you and i think of one another maybe you want the money back i says listen jason she says dont lie to me now about her i wont ask to see anything if that isnt enough ill send more each month just promise that shellthat sheyou can do that things for her be kind to her little things that i cant they wont let but you wont you never had a drop of warm blood in you listen she says if youll get mother to let me have her back ill give you a thousand dollars you havent got a thousand dollars i says i know youre lying now yes i have i will have i can get it and i know how youll get it i says youll get it the same way you got her and when she gets big enough then i thought she really was going to hit at me and then i didnt know what she was going to do she acted for a minute like some kind of a toy thats wound up too tight and about to burst all to pieces oh im crazy she says im insane i cant take her keep her what am i thinking of jason she says grabbing my arm her hands were hot as fever youll have to promise to take care of her to shes kin to you your own flesh and blood promise jason you have fathers name do you think id have to ask him twice once even thats so i says he did leave me something what do you want me to do i says buy an apron and a gocart i never got you into this i says i run more risk than you do because you havent got anything at stake so if you expect no she says then she begun to laugh and to try to hold it back all at the same time no i have nothing at stake she says making that noise putting her hands to her mouth nuhnuhnothing she says here i says stop that im trtrying to she says holding her hands over her mouth oh god oh god im going away from here i says i cant be seen here you get on out of town now you hear wait she says catching my arm ive stopped i wont again you promise jason she says and me feeling her eyes almost like they were touching my face you promise motherthatmoney if sometimes she needs things if i send checks for her to you other ones besides those youll give them to her you wont tell youll see that she has things like other girls sure i says as long as you behave and do like i tell you and so when earl came up front with his hat on he says im going to step up to rogers and get a snack we wont have time to go home to dinner i reckon whats the matter we wont have time i says with this show in town and all he says theyre going to give an afternoon performance too and theyll all want to get done trading in time to go to it so wed better just run up to rogers all right i says its your stomach if you want to make a slave of yourself to your business its all right with me i reckon youll never be a slave to any business he says not unless its jason compsons business i says so when i went back and opened it the only thing that surprised me was it was a money order not a check yes sir you cant trust a one of them after all the risk id taken risking mother finding out about her coming down here once or twice a year sometimes and me having to tell mother lies about it thats gratitude for you and i wouldnt put it past her to try to notify the postoffice not to let anyone except her cash it giving a kid like that fifty dollars why i never saw fifty dollars until i was twentyone years old with all the other boys with the afternoon off and all day saturday and me working in a store like i say how can they expect anybody to control her with her giving her money behind our backs she has the same home you had i says and the same raising i reckon mother is a better judge of what she needs than you are that havent even got a home if you want to give her money i says you send it to mother dont be giving it to her if ive got to run this risk every few months youll have to do like i say or its out and just about the time i got ready to begin on it because if earl thought i was going to dash up the street and gobble two bits worth of indigestion on his account he was bad fooled i may not be sitting with my feet on a mahogany desk but i am being payed for what i do inside this building and if i cant manage to live a civilised life outside of it ill go where i can i can stand on my own feet i dont need any mans mahogany desk to prop me up so just about the time i got ready to start id have to drop everything and run to sell some redneck a dimes worth of nails or something and earl up there gobbling a sandwich and half way back already like as not and then i found that all the blanks were gone i remembered then that i had aimed to get some more but it was too late now and then i looked up and there she came in the back door i heard her asking old job if i was there i just had time to stick them in the drawer and close it she came around to the desk i looked at my watch you been to dinner already i says its just twelve i just heard it strike you must have flown home and back im not going home to dinner she says did i get a letter today were you expecting one i says have you got a sweetie that can write from mother she says did i get a letter from mother she says looking at me mother got one from her i says i havent opened it youll have to wait until she opens it shell let you see it i imagine please jason she says not paying any attention did i get one whats the matter i says i never knew you to be this anxious about anybody you must expect some money from her she said she she says please jason she says did i you must have been to school today after all i says

pen shaking in her hand just like her mother oh god she says oh god yes i says thats one thing youll have to learn if you never learn anything else sign it now and get on out of here she signed it wheres the money she says i took the order and blotted it and put it in my pocket then i gave her the ten dollars now you go on back to school this afternoon you hear i says she didnt answer she crumpled the bill up in her hand like it was a rag or something and went on out the front door just as earl came in a customer came in with him and they stopped up front i gathered up the things and put on my hat and went up front been much busy earl says not much i says he looked out the door that your car over yonder he says better not try to go out home to dinner well likely have another rush just before the show opens get you a lunch at rogers and put a ticket in the drawer much obliged i says i can still manage to feed myself i reckon and right there hed stay watching that door like a hawk until i came through it again well hed just have to watch it for a while i was doing the best i could the time before i says thats the last one now youll have to remember to get some more right away but who can remember anything in all this hurrah and now this dam show had to come here the one day id have to hunt all over town for a blank check besides all the other things i had to do to keep the house running and earl watching the door like a hawk i went to the printing shop and told him i wanted to play a joke on a fellow but he didnt have anything then he told me to have a look in the old opera house where somebody had stored a lot of papers and junk out of the old merchants and farmers bank when it failed so i dodged up a few more alleys so earl couldnt see me and finally found old man simmons and got the key from him and went up there and dug around at last i found a pad on a saint louis bank and of course shed pick this one time to look at it close well it would have to do i couldnt waste any more time now i went back to the store forgot some papers mother wants to go to the bank i says i went back to the desk and fixed the check trying to hurry and all i says to myself its a good thing her eyes are giving out with that little whore in the house a christian forbearing woman like mother i says you know just as well as i do what shes going to grow up into but i says thats your business if you want to keep her and raise her in your house just because of father then she would begin to cry and say it was her own flesh and blood so i just says all right have it your way i can stand it if you can i fixed the letter up again and glued it back and went out try not to be gone any longer than you can help earl says all right i says i went to the telegraph office the smart boys were all there any of you boys made your million yet i says who can do anything with a market like that doc says whats it doing i says i went in and looked it was three points under the opening you boys are not going to let a little thing like the cotton market beat you are you i says i thought you were too smart for that smart hell doc says it was down twelve points at twelve oclock cleaned me out twelve points i says why the hell didnt somebody let me know why didnt you let me know i says to the operator i take it as it comes in he says im not running a bucket shop youre smart arent you i says seems to me with the money i spend with you you could take time to call me up or maybe your dam companys in a conspiracy with those dam eastern sharks he didnt say anything he made like he was busy youre getting a little too big for your pants i says first thing you know youll be working for a living whats the matter with you doc says youre still three points to the good yes i says if i happened to be selling i havent mentioned that yet i think you boys all cleaned out i got caught twice doc says i switched just in time well i o snopes says ive picked hit i reckon taint no more than fair fer hit to pick me once in a while so i left them buying and selling among themselves at a nickel a point i found a nigger and sent him for my car and stood on the corner and waited i couldnt see earl looking up and down the street with one eye on the clock because i couldnt see the door from here after about a week he got back with it where the hell have you been i says riding around where the wenches could see you i come straight as i could he says i had to drive clean around the square wid all dem wagons i never found a nigger yet that didnt have an airtight alibi for whatever he did but just turn one loose in a car and hes bound to show off i got in and went on around the square i caught a glimpse of earl in the door across the square i went straight to the kitchen and told dilsey to hurry up with dinner quentin aint come yit she says what of that i says youll be telling me next that lusters not quite ready to eat yet quentin knows when meals are served in this house hurry up with it now mother was in her room i gave her the letter she opened it and took the check out and sat holding it in her hand i went and got the shovel from the corner and gave her a match come on i says get it over with youll be crying in a minute she took the match but she didnt strike it she sat there looking at the check just like i said it would be i hate to do it she says to increase your burden by adding quentin i guess well get along i says come on get it over with but she just sat there holding the check this one is on a different bank she says they have been on an indianapolis bank yes i says women are allowed to do that too do what she says keep money in two different banks i says oh she says she looked at the check a while im glad to know shes so she has so much god sees that i am doing right she says come on i says finish it get the fun over fun she says when i think i thought you were burning this two hundred dollars a month for fun i says come on now want me to strike the match i could bring myself to accept them she says for my childrens sake i have no pride youd never be satisfied i says you know you wouldnt youve settled that once let it stay settled we can get along i leave everything to you she says but sometimes i become afraid that in doing this i am depriving you all of what is rightfully yours perhaps i shall be punished for it if you want me to i will smother my pride and accept them what would be the good in beginning now when youve been destroying them for fifteen years i says if you keep on doing it you have lost nothing but if youd begin to take them now youll have lost fifty thousand dollars weve got along so far havent we i says i havent seen you in the poorhouse yet yes she says we bascombs need nobodys charity certainly not that of a fallen woman she struck the match and lit the check and put it in the shovel and then the envelope and watched them burn you dont know what it is she says thank god you will never know what a mother feels there are lots of women in this world no better than her i says but they are not my daughters she says its not myself she says id gladly take her back sins and all because she is my flesh and blood its for quentins sake well i could have said it wasnt much chance of anybody hurting quentin much but like i say i dont expect much but i do want to eat and sleep without a couple of women squabbling and crying in the house and yours she says i know how you feel toward her let her come back i says far as im concerned no she says i owe that to your fathers memory when he was trying all the time to persuade you to let her come home when herbert threw her out i says you dont understand she says i know you dont intend to make it more difficult for me but its my place to suffer for my children she says i can bear it seems to me you go to a lot of unnecessary trouble doing it i says the paper burned out i carried it to the grate and put it in it just seems a shame to me to burn up good money i says let me never see the day when my children will have to accept that the wages of sin she says id rather see even you dead in your coffin first have it your way i says are we going to have dinner soon i says because if were not ill have to go on back were pretty busy today she got up ive told her once i says it seems shes waiting on quentin or luster or somebody here ill call her wait but she went to the head of the stairs and called quentin aint come yit dilsey says well ill have to get on back i says i can get a sandwich downtown i dont want to interfere with dilseys arrangements i says well that got her started again with dilsey hobbling and mumbling back and forth saying all right all right ise puttin hit on fast as i kin i try to please you all mother says i try to make things as easy for you as i can im not complaining am i i says have i said a word except i had to go back to work i know she says i know you havent had the chance the others had that youve had to bury yourself in a little country store i wanted you to get ahead i knew your father would never realise that you were the only one who had any business sense and then when everything else failed i believed that when she married and herbert after his promise well he was probably lying too i says he may not have even had a bank and if he had i dont reckon hed have to come all the way to mississippi to get a man for it we ate a while i could hear ben in the kitchen where luster was feeding him like i say if weve got to feed another mouth and she wont take that money why not send him down to jackson hell be happier there with people like him i says god knows theres little enough room for pride in this family but it dont take much pride to not like to see a thirty year old man playing around the yard with a nigger boy running up and down the fence and lowing like a cow whenever they play golf over there i says if theyd sent him to jackson at first wed all be better off today i says youve done your duty by him youve done all anybody can expect of you and more than most folks would do so why not send him there and get that much benefit out of the taxes we pay then she says ill be gone soon i know im just a burden to you and i says youve been saying that so long that im beginning to believe you only i says youd better be sure and not let me know youre gone because ill sure have him on number seventeen that night and i says i think i know a place where theyll take her too and the name of its not milk street and honey avenue either then she begun to cry and i says all right all right i have as much pride about my kinfolks as anybody even if i dont always know where they come from we ate for a while mother sent dilsey to the front to look for quentin again i keep telling you shes not coming to dinner i says she knows better than that mother says she knows i dont permit her to run about the streets and not come home at meal time did you look good dilsey dont let her then i says what can i do she says you have all of you flouted me always if you wouldnt come interfering id make her mind i says it wouldnt take me but about one day to straighten her out youd be too brutal with her she says you have your uncle maurys temper that reminded me of the letter i took it out and handed it to her you wont have to open it i says the bank will let you know how much it is this time its addressed to you she says go on and open it i says she opened it and read it and handed it to me my dear young nephew it says you will be glad to learn that i am now in a position to avail myself of an opportunity regarding which for reasons which i shall make obvious to you i shall not go into details until i have an opportunity to divulge it to you in a more secure manner my business experience has taught me to be chary of committing anything of a confidential nature to any more concrete medium than speech and my extreme precaution in this instance should give you some inkling of its value needless to say i have just completed a most exhaustive examination of all its phases and i feel no hesitancy in telling you that it is that sort of golden chance that comes but once in a lifetime and i now see clearly before me that goal toward which i have long and unflaggingly striven ie the ultimate solidification of my affairs by which i may restore to its rightful position that family of which i have the honor to be the sole remaining male descendant that family in which i have ever included your lady mother and her children as it so happens i am not quite in a position to avail myself of this opportunity to the uttermost which it warrants but rather than go out of the family to do so i am today drawing upon your mothers bank for the small sum necessary to complement my own initial investment for which i herewith enclose as a matter of formality my note of hand at eight percent per annum needless to say this is merely a formality to secure your mother in the event of that circumstance of which man is ever the plaything and sport for naturally i shall employ this sum as though it were my own and so permit your mother to avail herself of this opportunity which my exhaustive investigation has shown to be a bonanzaif you will permit the vulgarismof the first water and purest ray serene this is in confidence you will understand from one business man to another we will harvest our own vineyards eh and knowing your mothers delicate health and that timorousness which such delicately nurtured southern ladies would naturally feel regarding matters of business and their charming proneness to divulge unwittingly such matters in conversation i would suggest that you do not mention it to her at all on second thought i advise you not to do so it might be better to simply restore this sum to the bank at some future date say in a lump sum with the other small sums for which i am indebted to her and say nothing about it at all it is our duty to shield her from the crass material world as much as possible your affectionate uncle maury l bascomb what do you want to do about it i says flipping it across the table i know you grudge what i give him she says its your money i says if you want to throw it to the birds even its your business hes my own brother mother says hes the last bascomb when we are gone there wont be any more of them thatll be hard on somebody i guess i says all right all right i says its your money do as you please with it you want me to tell the bank to pay it i know you begrudge him she says i realise the burden on your shoulders when im gone it will be easier on you i could make it easier right now i says all right all right i wont mention it again move all bedlam in here if you want to hes your own brother she says even if he is afflicted ill take your bank book i says ill draw my check today he kept you waiting six days she says are you sure the business is sound it seems strange to me that a solvent business cannot pay its employees promptly hes all right i says safe as a bank i tell him not to bother about mine until we get done collecting every month thats why its late sometimes i just couldnt bear to have you lose the little i had to invest for you she says ive often thought that earl is not a good business man i know he doesnt take you into his confidence to the extent that your investment in the business should warrant im going to speak to him no you let him alone i says its his business you have a thousand dollars in it you let him alone i says im watching things i have your power of attorney itll be all right you dont know what a comfort you are to me she says you have always been my pride and joy but when you came to me of your own accord and insisted on banking your salary each month in my name i thanked god it was you left me if they had to be taken they were all right i says they did the best they could i reckon when you talk that way i know you are thinking bitterly of your fathers memory she says you have a right to i suppose but it breaks my heart to hear you i got up if youve got any crying to do i says youll have to do it alone because ive got to get on back ill get the bank book ill get it she says keep still i says ill get it i went up stairs and got the bank book out of her desk and went back to town i went to the bank and deposited the check and the money order and the other ten and stopped at the telegraph office it was one point above the opening i had already lost thirteen points all because she had to come helling in there at twelve worrying me about that letter what time did that report come in i says about an hour ago he says an hour ago i says what are we paying you for i says weekly reports how do you expect a man to do anything the whole dam top could blow off and wed not know it i dont expect you to do anything he says they changed that law making folks play the cotton market they have i says i hadnt heard they must have sent the news out over the western union i went back to the store thirteen points dam if i believe anybody knows anything about the dam thing except the ones that sit back in those new york offices and watch the country suckers come up and beg them to take their money well a man that just calls shows he has no faith in himself and like i say if you arent going to take the advice whats the use in paying money for it besides these people are right up there on the ground they know everything thats going on i could feel the telegram in my pocket id just have to prove that they were using the telegraph company to defraud that would constitute a bucket shop and i wouldnt hesitate that long either only be damned if it doesnt look like a company as big and rich as the western union could get a market report out on time half as quick as theyll get a wire to you saying your account closed out but what the hell do they care about the people theyre hand in glove with that new york crowd anybody could see that when i came in earl looked at his watch but he didnt say anything until the customer was gone then he says you go home to dinner i had to go to the dentist i says because its not any of his business where i eat but ive got to be in the store with him all the afternoon and with his jaw running off after all ive stood you take a little two by four country storekeeper like i say it takes a man with just five hundred dollars to worry about it fifty thousand dollars worth you might have told me he says i expected you back right away ill trade you this tooth and give you ten dollars to boot any time i says our agreement was an hour for dinner i says and if you dont like the way i do you know what you can do about it ive known that some time he says if it hadnt been for your mother id have done it before now too shes a lady ive got a lot of sympathy for jason too bad some other folks i know cant say as much then you can keep it i says when we need any sympathy ill let you know in plenty of time ive protected you about that business a long time jason he says yes i says letting him go on listening to what he would say before i shut him up i believe i know more about where that automobile came from than she does you think so do you i says when are you going to spread the news that i stole it from my mother i dont say anything he says i know you have her power of attorney and i know she still believes that thousand dollars is in this business all right i says since you know so much ill tell you a little more go to the bank and ask them whose account ive been depositing a hundred and sixty dollars on the first of every month for twelve years i dont say anything he says i just ask you to be a little more careful after this i never said anything more it doesnt do any good ive found that when a man gets into a rut the best thing you can do is let him stay there and when a man gets it in his head that hes got to tell something on you for your own good goodnight im glad i havent got the sort of conscience ive got to nurse like a sick puppy all the time if id ever be as careful over anything as he is to keep his little shirt tail full of business from making him more than eight percent i reckon he thinks theyd get him on the usury law if he netted more than eight percent what the hell chance has a man got tied down in a town like this and to a business like this why i could take his business in one year and fix him so hed never have to work again only hed give it all away to the church or something if theres one thing gets under my skin its a dam hypocrite a man that thinks anything he dont understand all about must be crooked and that first chance he gets hes morally bound to tell the third party whats none of his business to tell like i say if i thought every time a man did something i didnt know all about he was bound to be a crook i reckon i wouldnt have any trouble finding something back there on those books that you wouldnt see any use for running and telling somebody i thought ought to know about it when for all i knew they might know a dam sight more about it now than i did and if they didnt it was dam little of my business anyway and he says my books are open to anybody anybody that has any claim or believes she has any claim on this business can go back there and welcome sure you wont tell i says you couldnt square your conscience with that youll just take her back there and let her find it you wont tell yourself im not trying to meddle in your business he says i know you missed out on some things like quentin had but your mother has had a misfortunate life too and if she was to come in here and ask me why you quit id have to tell her it aint that thousand dollars you know that its because a man never gets anywhere if fact and his ledgers dont square and im not going to lie to anybody for myself or anybody else well then i says i reckon that conscience of yours is a more valuable clerk than i am it dont have to go home at noon to eat only dont let it interfere with my appetite i says because how the hell can i do anything right with that dam family and her not making any effort to control her nor any of them like that time when she happened to see one of them kissing caddy and all next day she went around the house in a black dress and a veil and even father couldnt get her to say a word except crying and saying her little daughter was dead and caddy about fifteen then only in three years shed been wearing haircloth or probably sandpaper at that rate do you think i can afford to have her running about the streets with every drummer that comes to town i says and them telling the new ones up and down the toad where to pick up a hot one when they made jefferson i havent got much pride i cant afford it with a kitchen full of niggers to feed and robbing the state asylum of its star freshman blood i says governors and generals its a dam good thing we never had any kings and presidents wed all be down there at jackson chasing butterflies i says itd be bad enough if it was mine id at least be sure it was a bastard to begin with and now even the lord doesnt know that for certain probably so after a while i heard the band start up and then they begun to clear out headed for the show every one of them haggling over a twenty cent hame string to save fifteen cents so they can give it to a bunch of yankees that come in and pay maybe ten dollars for the privilege i went on out to the back well i says if you dont look out that bolt will grow into your hand and then im going to take an axe and chop it out what do you reckon the bollweevilsll eat if you dont get those cultivators in shape to raise them a crop i says sage grass dem folks sho do play dem horns he says tell me man in dat show kin play a tune on a handsaw pick hit like a banjo listen i says do you know how much that showll spend in this town about ten dollars i says the ten dollars buck turpin has in his pocket right now whut dey give mr buck ten dollars fer he says for the privilege of showing here i says you can put the balance of what theyll spend in your eye you mean dey pays ten dollars jest to give dey show here he says thats all i says and how much do you reckon gret day he says you mean to tell me dey chargin um to let um show here id pay ten dollars to see dat man pick dat saw ef i had to i figures dat tomorrow mawnin i be still owin um nine dollars and six bits at dat rate and then a yankee will talk your head off about niggers getting ahead get them ahead what i say get them so far ahead you cant find one south of louisville with a blood hound because when i told him about how theyd pick up saturday night and carry off at least a thousand dollars out of the county he says i dont begridge um i kin sho afford my two bits two bits hell i says that dont begin it how about the dime or fifteen cents youll spend for a dam two cent box of candy or something how about the time youre wasting right now listening to that band dats de troof he says well ef i lives swell night hits wine to be two bits mo dey takin out of town cats shot then youre a fool i says well he says i dont spute dat neither ef dat uz a crime all chaingangs wouldnt be black well just about that time i happened to look up the alley and saw her when i stepped back and looked at my watch i didnt notice at the time who he was because i was looking at the watch it was just two thirty fortyfive minutes before anybody but me expected her to be out so when i looked around the door the first thing i saw was the red tie he had on and i was thinking what the hell kind of a man would wear a red tie but she was sneaking along the alley watching the door so i wasnt thinking anything about him until they had gone past i was wondering if shed have so little respect for me that shed not only play out of school when i told her not to but would walk right past the store daring me not to see her only she couldnt see into the door because the sun fell straight into it and it was like trying to see through an automobile searchlight so i stood there and watched her go on past with her face painted up like a dam clowns and her hair all gummed and twisted and a dress that if a woman had come out doors even on gayoso or beale street when i was a young fellow with no more than that to cover her legs and behind shed been thrown in jail ill be damned if they dont dress like they were trying to make every man they passed on the street want to reach out and clap his hand on it and so i was thinking what kind of a dam man would wear a red tie when all of a sudden i knew he was one of those show folks well as if shed told me well i can stand a lot if i couldnt dam if i wouldnt be in a hell of a fix so when they turned the corner i jumped down and followed me without any hat in the middle of the afternoon having to chase up and down back alleys because of my mothers good name like i say you cant do anything with a woman like that if shes got it in her if its in her blood you cant do anything with her the only thing you can do is to get rid of her let her go on and live with her own sort i went on to the street but they were out of sight and there i was without any hat looking like i was crazy too like a man would naturally think one of them is crazy and another one drowned himself and the other one was turned out into the street by her husband whats the reason the rest of them are not crazy too all the time i could see them watching me like a hawk waiting for a chance to say well im not surprised i expected it all the time the whole familys crazy selling land to send him to harvard and paying taxes to support a state university all the time that i never saw except twice at a baseball game and not letting her daughters name be spoken on the place until after a while father wouldnt even come down town anymore but just sat there all day with the decanter i could see the bottom of his nightshirt and his bare legs and hear the decanter clinking until finally tp had to pour it for him and she says you have no respect for your fathers memory and i says i dont know why not it sure is preserved well enough to last only if im crazy too god knows what ill do about it just to look at water makes me sick and id just as soon swallow gasoline as a glass of whiskey and lorraine telling them he may not drink but if you dont believe hes a man i can tell you how to find out she says if i catch you fooling with any of these whores you know what ill do she says ill whip her grabbing at her ill whip her as long as i can find her she says and i says if i dont drink thats my business but have you ever found me short i says ill buy you enough beer to take a bath in if you want it because ive got every respect for a good honest whore because with mothers health and the position i try to uphold to have her with no more respect for what i try to do for her than to make her name and my name and my mothers name a byword in the town she had dodged out of sight somewhere saw me coming and dodged into another alley running up and down the alleys with a dam show man in a red tie that everybody would look at and think what kind of a dam man would wear a red tie well the boy kept speaking to me and so i took the telegram without knowing i had taken it i didnt realise what it was until i was signing for it and i tore it open without even caring much what it was i knew all the time what it would be i reckon that was the only thing else that could happen especially holding it up until i had already had the check entered on the pass book i dont see how a city no bigger than new york can hold enough people to take the money away from us country suckers work like hell all day every day send them your money and get a little piece of paper back your account closed at teasing you along letting you pile up a little paper profit then banal your account closed at and if that wasnt enough paying ten dollars a month to somebody to tell you how to lose it fast that either dont know anything about it or is in cahoots with the telegraph company well im done with them theyve sucked me in for the last time any fool except a fellow that hasnt got any more sense than to take a jews word for anything could tell the market was going up all the time with the whole dam delta about to be flooded again and the cotton washed right out of the ground like it was last year let it wash a mans crop out of the ground year after year and them up there in washington spending fifty thousand dollars a day keeping an army in nicarauga or some place of course itll overflow again and then cottonll be worth thirty cents a pound well i just want to hit them one time and get my money back i dont want a killing only these small town gamblers are out for that i just want my money back that these dam jews have gotten with all their guaranteed inside dope then im through they can kiss my foot for every other red cent of mine they get i went back to the store it was half past three almost dam little time to do anything in but then i am used to that i never had to go to harvard to learn that the band had quit playing got them all inside now and they wouldnt have to waste any more wind earl says he found you did he he was in here with it a while ago i thought you were out back somewhere yes i says i got it they couldnt keep it away from me all afternoon the towns too small ive got to go out home a minute i says you can dock me if itll make you feel any better go ahead he says i can handle it now no bad news i hope youll have to go to the telegraph office and find that out i says theyll have time to tell you i havent i just asked he says your mother knows she can depend on me shell appreciate it i says i wont be gone any longer than i have to take your time he says i can handle it now you go ahead i got the car and went home once this morning twice at noon and now again with her and having to chase all over town and having to beg them to let me eat a little of the food i am paying for sometimes i think whats the use of anything with the precedent ive been set i must be crazy to keep on and now i reckon ill get home just in time to take a nice long drive after a basket of tomatoes or something and then have to go back to town smelling like a camphor factory so my head wont explode right on my shoulders i keep telling her theres not a dam thing in that aspirin except flour and water for imaginary invalids i says you dont know what a headache is i says you think id fool with that dam car at all if it depended on me i says i can get along without one ive learned to get along without lots of things but if you want to risk yourself in that old wornout surrey with a halfgrown nigger boy all right because i says god looks after bens kind god knows he ought to do something for him but if you think im going to trust a thousand dollars worth of delicate machinery to a halfgrown nigger or a grown one either youd better buy him one yourself because i says you like to ride in the car and you know you do dilsey said she was in the house i went on into the hall and listened but i didnt hear anything i went up stairs but just as i passed her door she called me i just wanted to know who it was she says im here alone so much that i hear every sound you dont have to stay here i says you could spend the whole day visiting like other women if you wanted to she came to the door i thought maybe you were sick she says having to hurry through your dinner like you did better luck next time i says what do you want is anything wrong she says what could be i says cant i come home in the middle of the afternoon without upsetting the whole house have you seen quentin she says shes in school i says its after three she says i heard the clock strike at least a half an hour ago she ought to be home by now ought she i says when have you ever seen her before dark she ought to be home she says when i was a girl you had somebody to make you behave yourself i says she hasnt i cant do anything with her she says ive tried and ive tried and you wont let me for some reason i says so you ought to be satisfied i went on to my room i turned the key easy and stood there until the knob turned then she says jason what i says i just thought something was wrong not in here i says youve come to the wrong place i dont mean to worry you she says im glad to hear that i says i wasnt sure i thought i might have been mistaken do you want anything after a while she says no not any thing then she went away i took the box down and counted out the money and hid the box again and unlocked the door and went out i thought about the camphor but it would be too late now anyway and id just have one more round trip she was at her door waiting you want anything from town i says no she says i dont mean to meddle in your affairs but i dont know what id do if anything happened to you jason im all right i says just a headache i wish youd take some aspirin she says i know youre not going to stop using the car whats the car got to do with it i says how can a car give a man a headache you know gasoline always made you sick she says ever since you were a child i wish youd take some aspirin keep on wishing it i says it wont hurt you i got in the car and started back to town i had just turned onto the street when i saw a ford coming helling toward me all of a sudden it stopped i could hear the wheels sliding and it slewed around and backed and whirled and just as i was thinking what the hell they were up to i saw that red tie then i recognised her face looking back through the window it whirled into the alley i saw it turn again but when i got to the back street it was just disappearing running like hell i saw red when i recognised that red tie after all i had told her i forgot about everything i never thought about my head even until i came to the first forks and had to stop yet we spend money and spend money on roads and dam if it isnt like trying to drive over a sheet of corrugated iron roofing id like to know how a man could be expected to keep up with even a wheelbarrow i think too much of my car im not going to hammer it to pieces like it was a ford chances were they had stolen it anyway so why should they give a dam like i say blood always tells if youve got blood like that in you youll do anything i says whatever claim you believe she has on you has already been discharged i says from now on you have only yourself to blame because you know what any sensible person would do i says if ive got to spend half my time being a dam detective at least ill go where i can get paid for it so i had to stop there at the forks then i remembered it it felt like somebody was inside with a hammer beating on it i says ive tried to keep you from being worried by her i says far as im concerned let her go to hell as fast as she pleases and the sooner the better i says what else do you expect except every dam drummer and cheap show that comes to town because even these town jellybeans give her the goby now you dont know what goes on i says you dont hear the talk that i hear and you can just bet i shut them up too i says my people owned slaves here when you all were running little shirt tail country stores and farming land no nigger would look at on shares if they ever farmed it its a good thing the lord did something for this country the folks that live on it never have friday afternoon and from right here i could see three miles of land that hadnt even been broken and every able bodied man in the county in town at that show i might have been a stranger starving to death and there wasnt a soul in sight to ask which way to town even and she trying to get me to take aspirin i says when i eat bread ill do it at the table i says you always talking about how much you give up for us when you could buy ten new dresses a year on the money you spend for those dam patent medicines its not something to cure it i need its just an even break not to have to have them but as long as i have to work ten hours a day to support a kitchen full of niggers in the style theyre accustomed to and send them to the show where every other nigger in the county only he was late already by the time he got there it would be over after a while he got up to the car and when i finally got it through his head if two people in a ford had passed him he said yes so i went on and when i came to where the wagon road turned off i could see the tire tracks ab russell was in his lot but i didnt bother to ask him and i hadnt got out of sight of his barn hardly when i saw the ford they had tried to hide it done about as well at it as she did at everything else she did like i say its not that i object to so much maybe she cant help that its because she hasnt even got enough consideration for her own family to have any discretion im afraid all the time ill run into them right in the middle of the street or under a wagon on the square like a couple of dogs i parked and got out and now id have to go way around and cross a plowed field the only one i had seen since i left town with every step like somebody was walking along behind me hitting me on the head with a club i kept thinking that when i got across the field at least id have something level to walk on that wouldnt jolt me every step but when i got into the woods it was full of underbrush and i had to twist around through it and then i came to a ditch full of briers i went along it for a while but it got thicker and thicker and all the time earl probably telephoning home about where i was and getting mother all upset again when i finally got through i had had to wind around so much that i had to stop and figure out just where the car would be i knew they wouldnt be far from it just under the closest bush so i turned and worked back toward the road then i couldnt tell just how far i was so id have to stop and listen and then with my legs not using so much blood it all would go into my head like it would explode any minute and the sun getting down just to where it could shine straight into my eyes and my ears ringing so i couldnt hear anything i went on trying to move quiet then i heard a dog or something and i knew that when he scented me hed have to come helling up then it would be all off i had gotten beggar lice and twigs and stuff all over me inside my clothes and shoes and all and then i happened to look around and i had my hand right on a bunch of poison oak the only thing i couldnt understand was why it was just poison oak and not a snake or something so i didnt even bother to move it i just stood there until the dog went away then i went on i didnt have any idea where the car was now i couldnt think about anything except my head and id just stand in one place and sort of wonder if i had really seen a ford even and i didnt even care much whether i had or not like i say let her lay out all day and all night with everthing in town that wears pants what do i care i dont owe anything to anybody that has no more consideration for me that wouldnt be a dam bit above planting that ford there and making me spend a whole afternoon and earl taking her back there and showing her the books just because hes too dam virtuous for this world i says youll have one hell of a time in heaven without anybodys business to meddle in only dont you ever let me catch you at it i says i close my eyes to it because of your grandmother but just you let me catch you doing it one time on this place where my mother lives these dam little slick haired squirts thinking they are raising so much hell ill show them something about hell i says and you too ill make him think that dam red tie is the latch string to hell if he thinks he can run the woods with my niece with the sun and all in my eyes and my blood going so i kept thinking every time my head would go on and burst and get it over with with briers and things grabbing at me then i came onto the sand ditch where they had been and i recognised the tree where the car was and just as i got out of the ditch and started running i heard the car start it went off fast blowing the horn they kept on blowing it like it was saying yah yah yaaahhhhhhhh going out of sight i got to the road just in time to see it go out of sight by the time i got up to where my car was they were clean out of sight the horn still blowing well i never thought anything about it except i was saying run run back to town run home and try to convince mother that i never saw you in that car try to make her believe that i dont know who he was try to make her believe that i didnt miss ten feet of catching you in that ditch try to make her believe you were standing up too it kept on saying yahhhhh yahhhhh yaaahhhhhhhhh getting fainter and fainter then it quit and i could hear a cow lowing up at russells barn and still i never thought i went up to the door and opened it and raised my foot i kind of thought then that the car was leaning a little more than the slant of the road would be but i never found it out until i got in and started off well i just sat there it was getting on toward sundown and town was about five miles they never even had guts enough to puncture it to jab a hole in it they just let the air out i just stood there for a while thinking about that kitchen full of niggers and not one of them had time to lift a tire onto the rack and screw up a couple of bolts it was kind of funny because even she couldnt have seen far enough ahead to take the pump out on purpose unless she thought about it while he was letting out the air maybe but what it probably was was somebody took it out and gave it to ben to play with for a squirt gun because theyd take the whole car to pieces if he wanted it and dilsey says aint nobody teched yo car what we want to fool with hit fer and i says youre a nigger youre lucky do you know it i says ill swap with you any day because it takes a white man not to have anymore sense than to worry about what a little slut of a girl does i walked up to russells he had a pump that was just an oversight on their part i reckon only i still couldnt believe shed have had the nerve to i kept thinking that i dont know why it is i cant seem to learn that a womanll do anything i kept thinking lets forget for a while how i feel toward you and how you feel toward me i just wouldnt do you this way i wouldnt do you this way no matter what you had done to me because like i say blood is blood and you cant get around it its not playing a joke that any eight year old boy could have thought of its letting your own uncle be laughed at by a man that would wear a red tie they come into town and call us all a bunch of hicks and think its too small to hold them well he doesnt know just how right he is and her too if thats the way she feels about it shed better keep right on going and a dam good riddance i stopped and returned russells pump and drove on to town i went to the drugstore and got a shot and then i went to the telegraph office it had closed at forty points down forty times five dollars buy something with that if you can and shell say ive got to have it ive just got to and ill say thats too bad youll have to try somebody else i havent got any money ive been too busy to make any i just looked at him ill tell you some news i says youll be astonished to learn that i am interested in the cotton market i says that never occurred to you did it i did my best to deliver it he says i tried the store twice and called up your house but they didnt know where you were he says digging in the drawer deliver what i says he handed me a telegram what time did this come i says about half past three he says and now its ten minutes past five i says i tried to deliver it he says i couldnt find you thats not my fault is it i says i opened it just to see what kind of a lie theyd tell me this time they must be in one hell of a shape if theyve got to come all the way to mississippi to steal ten dollars a month sell it says the market will be unstable with a general downward tendency do not be alarmed following government report how much would a message like this cost i says he told me they paid it he says then i owe them that much i says i already knew this send this collect i says taking a blank buy i wrote market just on point of blowing its head off occasional flurries for purpose of hooking a few more country suckers who havent got in to the telegraph office yet do not be alarmed send that collect i says he looked at the message then he looked at the clock market closed an hour ago he says well i says thats not my fault either i didnt invent it i just bought a little of it while under the impression that the telegraph company would keep me informed as to what it was doing a report is posted whenever it comes in he says yes i says and in memphis they have it on a blackboard every ten seconds i says i was within sixtyseven miles of there once this afternoon he looked at the message you want to send this he says i still havent changed my mind i says i wrote the other one out and counted the money and this one too if youre sure you can spell buy i went back to the store i could hear the band from down the street prohibitions a fine thing used to be theyd come in saturday with just one pair of shoes in the family and him wearing them and theyd go down to the express office and get his package now they all go to the show barefooted with the merchants in the door like a row of tigers or something in a cage watching them pass earl says i hope it wasnt anything serious what i says he looked at his watch then he went to the door and looked at the courthouse clock you ought to have a dollar watch i says it wont cost you so much to believe its lying each time what he says nothing i says hope i havent inconvenienced you we were not busy much he says they all went to the show its all right if its not all right i says you know what you can do about it i said it was all right he says i heard you i says and if its not all right you know what you can do about it do you want to quit he says its not my business i says my wishes dont matter but dont get the idea that you are protecting me by keeping me youd be a good business man if youd let yourself jason he says at least i can tend to my own business and let other peoples alone i says i dont know why you are trying to make me fire you he says you know you could quit anytime and there wouldnt be any hard feelings between us maybe thats why i dont quit i says as long as i tend to my job thats what you are paying me for i went on to the back and got a drink of water and went on out to the back door job had the cultivators all set up at last it was quiet there and pretty soon my head got a little easier i could hear them singing now and then the band played again well let them get every quarter and dime in the county it was no skin off my back ive done what i could a man that can live as long as i have and not know when to quit is a fool especially as its no business of mine if it was my own daughter now it would be different because she wouldnt have time to shed have to work some to feed a few invalids and idiots and niggers because how could i have the face to bring anybody there ive too much respect for anybody to do that im a man i can stand it its my own flesh and blood and id like to see the color of the mans eyes that would speak disrespectful of any woman that was my friend its these dam good women that do it id like to see the good churchgoing woman thats half as square as lorraine whore or no whore like i say if i was to get married youd go up like a balloon and you know it and she says i want you to be happy to have a family of your own not to slave your life away for us but ill be gone soon and then you can take a wife but youll never find a woman who is worthy of you and i says yes i could youd get right up out of your grave you know you would i says no thank you i have all the women i can take care of now if i married a wife shed probably turn out to be a hophead or something thats all we lack in this family i says the sun was down beyond the methodist church now and the pigeons were flying back and forth around the steeple and when the band stopped i could hear them cooing it hadnt been four months since christmas and yet they were almost as thick as ever i reckon parson walthall was getting a belly full of them now youd have thought we were shooting people with him making speeches and even holding onto a mans gun when they came over talking about peace on earth good will toward all and not a sparrow can fall to earth but what does he care how thick they get he hasnt got anything to do what does he care what time it is he pays no taxes he doesnt have to see his money going every year to have the courthouse clock cleaned to where itll run they had to pay a man fortyfive dollars to clean it i counted over a hundred halfhatched pigeons on the ground youd think theyd have sense enough to leave town its a good thing i dont have anymore ties than a pigeon ill say that the band was playing again a loud fast tune like they were breaking up i reckon theyd be satisfied now maybe theyd have enough music to entertain them while they drove fourteen or fifteen miles home and unharnessed in the dark and fed the stock and milked all theyd have to do would be to whistle the music and tell the jokes to the live stock in the barn and then they could count up how much theyd made by not taking the stock to the show too they could figure that if a man had five children and seven mules he cleared a quarter by taking his family to the show just like that earl came back with a couple of packages heres some more stuff going out he says wheres uncle job gone to the show i imagine i says unless you watched him he doesnt slip off he says i can depend on him meaning me by that i says he went to the door and looked out listening thats a good band he says its about time they were breaking up id say unless theyre going to spend the night there i says the swallows had begun and i could hear the sparrows beginning to swarm in the trees in the courthouse yard every once in a while a bunch of them would come swirling around in sight above the roof then go away they are as big a nuisance as the pigeons to my notion you cant even sit in the courthouse yard for them first thing you know bing right on your hat but it would take a millionaire to afford to shoot them at five cents a shot if theyd just put a little poison out there in the square theyd get rid of them in a day because if a merchant cant keep his stock from running around the square hed better try to deal in something besides chickens something that dont eat like plows or onions and if a man dont keep his dogs up he either dont want it or he hasnt any business with one like i say if all the businesses in a town are run like country businesses youre going to have a country town it wont do you any good if they have broke up i says theyll have to hitch up and take out to get home by midnight as it is well he says they enjoy it let them spend a little money on a show now and then a hill farmer works pretty hard and gets mighty little for it theres no law making them farm in the hills i says or anywhere else where would you and me be if it wasnt for the farmers he says id be home right now i says lying down with an ice pack on my head you have these headaches too often he says why dont you have your teeth examined good did he go over them all this morning did who i says you said you went to the dentist this morning do you object to my having the headache on your time i says is that it they were crossing the alley now coming up from the show there they come he says i reckon i better get up front he went on its a curious thing how no matter whats wrong with you a manll tell you to have your teeth examined and a womanll tell you to get married it always takes a man that never made much at any thing to tell you how to run your business though like these college professors without a whole pair of socks to his name telling you how to make a million in ten years and a woman that couldnt even get a husband can always tell you how to raise a family old man job came up with the wagon after a while he got through wrapping the lines around the whip socket well i says was it a good show i aint been yit he says but i kin be arrested in dat tent tonight dough like hell you havent i says youve been away from here since three oclock mr earl was just back here looking for you i been tendin to my business he says mr earl knows whar i been you may can fool him i says i wont tell on you den hes de onliest man here id try to fool he says whut i want to waste my time foolin a man whut i dont keer whether i sees him satdy night er not i wont try to fool you he says you too smart fer me yes suh he says looking busy as hell putting five or six little packages into the wagon yous too smart fer me aint a man in dis town kin keep up wid you fer smartness you fools a man whut so smart he cant even keep up wid hisself he says getting in the wagon and unwrapping the reins whos that i says dats mr jason compson he says git up dar dan one of the wheels was just about to come off i watched to see if hed get out of the alley before it did just turn any vehicle over to a nigger though i says that old rattletraps just an eyesore yet youll keep it standing there in the carriage house a hundred years just so that boy can ride to the cemetery once a week i says hes not the first fellow thatll have to do things he doesnt want to id make him ride in that car like a civilised man or stay at home what does he know about where he goes or what he goes in and us keeping a carriage and a horse so he can take a ride on sunday afternoon a lot job cared whether the wheel came off or not long as he wouldnt have too far to walk back like i say the only place for them is in the field where theyd have to work from sunup to sundown they cant stand prosperity or an easy job let one stay around white people for a while and hes not worth killing they get so they can outguess you about work before your very eyes like roskus the only mistake he ever made was he got careless one day and died shirking and stealing and giving you a little more lip and a little more lip until some day you have to lay them out with a scantling or something well its earls business but id hate to have my business advertised over this town by an old doddering nigger and a wagon that you thought every time it turned a corner it would come all to pieces the sun was all high up in the air now and inside it was beginning to get dark i went up front the square was empty earl was back closing the safe and then the clock begun to strike you lock the back door he says i went back and locked it and came back i suppose youre going to the show tonight he says i gave you those passes yesterday didnt i yes i says you want them back no no he says i just forgot whether i gave them to you or not no sense in wasting them he locked the door and said goodnight and went on the sparrows were still rattling away in the trees but the square was empty except for a few cars there was a ford in front of the drugstore but i didnt even look at it i know when ive had enough of anything i dont mind trying to help her but i know when ive had enough i guess i could teach luster to drive it then they could chase her all day long if they wanted to and i could stay home and play with ben i went in and got a couple of cigars then i thought id have another headache shot for luck and i stood and talked with them a while well mac says i reckon youve got your money on the yankees this year what for i says the pennant he says not anything in the league can beat them like hell theres not i says theyre shot i says you think a team can be that lucky forever i dont call it luck mac says i wouldnt bet on any team that fellow ruth played on i says even if i knew it was going to win yes mac says i can name you a dozen men in either league whore more valuable than he is i says what have you got against ruth mac says nothing i says i havent got any thing against him i dont even like to look at his picture i went on out the lights were coming on and people going along the streets toward home sometimes the sparrows never got still until full dark the night they turned on the new lights around the courthouse it waked them up and they were flying around and blundering into the lights all night long they kept it up two or three nights then one morning they were all gone then after about two months they all came back again i drove on home there were no lights in the house yet but theyd all be looking out the windows and dilsey jawing away in the kitchen like it was her own food she was having to keep hot until i got there youd think to hear her that there wasnt but one supper in the world and that was the one she had to keep back a few minutes on my account well at least i could come home one time without finding ben and that nigger hanging on the gate like a bear and a monkey in the same cage just let it come toward sundown and hed head for the gate like a cow for the barn hanging onto it and bobbing his head and sort of moaning to himself thats a hog for punishment for you if what had happened to him for fooling with open gates had happened to me i never would want to see another one i often wondered what hed be thinking about down there at the gate watching the girls going home from school trying to want something he couldnt even remember he didnt and couldnt want any longer and what hed think when theyd be undressing him and hed happen to take a look at himself and begin to cry like hed do but like i say they never did enough of that i says i know what you need you need what they did to ben then youd behave and if you dont know what that was i says ask dilsey to tell you there was a light in mothers room i put the car up and went on into the kitchen luster and ben were there wheres dilsey i says

biscuit up her face bent over her plate yes mother says i suppose women who stay shut up like i do have no idea what goes on in this town yes i says they dont my life has been so different from that mother says thank god i dont know about such wickedness i dont even want to know about it im not like most people i didnt say any more quentin sat there crumbling the biscuit until i quit eating then she says can i go now without looking at anybody what i says sure you can go were you waiting on us she looked at me she had crumpled all the bread but her hands still went on like they were crumpling it yet and her eyes looked like they were cornered or something and then she started biting her mouth like it ought to have poisoned her with all that red lead grandmother she says grandmother did you want something else to eat i says why does he treat me like this grandmother she says i never hurt him i want you all to get along with one another mother says you are all thats left now and i do want you all to get along better its his fault she says he wont let me alone and i have to if he doesnt want me here why wont he let me go back to thats enough i says not another word then why wont he let me alone she says hehe just he is the nearest thing to a father youve ever had mother says its his bread you and i eat its only right that he should expect obedience from you its his fault she says she jumped up he makes me do it if he would just she looked at us her eyes cornered kind of jerking her arms against her sides if i would just what i says whatever i do its your fault she says if im bad its because i had to be you made me i wish i was dead i wish we were all dead then she ran we heard her run up the stairs then a door slammed thats the first sensible thing she ever said i says she didnt go to school today mother says how do you know i says were you down town i just know she says i wish you could be kinder to her if i did that id have to arrange to see her more than once a day i says youll have to make her come to the table every meal then i could give her an extra piece of meat every time there are little things you could do she says like not paying any attention when you ask me to see that she goes to school i says she didnt go to school today she says i just know she didnt she says she went for a car ride with one of the boys this afternoon and you followed her how could i i says when somebody had my car all afternoon whether or not she was in school today is already past i says if youve got to worry about it worry about next monday i wanted you and she to get along with one another she says but she has inherited all of the headstrong traits quentins too i thought at the time with the heritage she would already have to give her that name too sometimes i think she is the judgment of both of them upon me good lord i says youve got a fine mind no wonder you keep yourself sick all the time what she says i dont understand i hope not i says a good woman misses a lot shes better off without knowing they were both that way she says they would make interest with your father against me when i tried to correct them he was always saying they didnt need controlling that they already knew what cleanliness and honesty were which was all that anyone could hope to be taught and now i hope hes satisfied youve got ben to depend on i says cheer up they deliberately shut me out of their lives she says it was always her and quentin they were always conspiring against me against you too though you were too young to realise it they always looked on you and me as outsiders like they did your uncle maury i always told your father that they were allowed too much freedom to be together too much when quentin started to school we had to let her go the next year so she could be with him she couldnt bear for any of you to do anything she couldnt it was vanity in her vanity and false pride and then when her troubles began i knew that quentin would feel that he had to do something just as bad but i didnt believe that he would have been so selfish as toi didnt dream that he maybe he knew it was going to be a girl i says and that one more of them would be more than he could stand he could have controlled her she says he seemed to be the only person she had any consideration for but that is a part of the judgment too i suppose yes i says too bad it wasnt me instead of him youd be a lot better off you say things like that to hurt me she says i deserve it though when they began to sell the land to send quentin to harvard i told your father that he must make an equal provision for you then when herbert offered to take you into the bank i said jason is provided for now and when all the expense began to pile up and i was forced to sell our furniture and the rest of the pasture i wrote her at once because i said she will realise that she and quentin have had their share and part of jasons too and that it depends on her now to compensate him i said she will do that out of respect for her father i believed that then but im just a poor old woman i was raised to believe that people would deny themselves for their own flesh and blood its my fault you were right to reproach me do you think i need any mans help to stand on my feet i says let alone a woman that cant name the father of her own child jason she says all right i says i didnt mean that of course not if i believed that were possible after all my suffering of course its not i says i didnt mean it i hope that at least is spared me she says sure it is i says shes too much like both of them to doubt that i couldnt bear that she says then quit thinking about it i says has she been worrying you any more about getting out at night no i made her realise that it was for her own good and that shed thank me for it some day she takes her books with her and studies after i lock the door i see the light on as late as eleven oclock some nights how do you know shes studying i says i dont know what else shed do in there alone she says she never did read any no i says you wouldnt know and you can thank your stars for that i says only what would be the use in saying it aloud it would just have her crying on me again i heard her go up stairs then she called quentin and quentin says what through the door goodnight mother says then i heard the key in the lock and mother went back to her room when i finished my cigar and went up the light was still on i could see the empty keyhole but i couldnt hear a sound she studied quiet maybe she learned that in school i told mother goodnight and went on to my room and got the box out and counted it again i could hear the great american gelding snoring away like a planing mill i read somewhere theyd fix men that way to give them womens voices but maybe he didnt know what theyd done to him i dont reckon he even knew what he had been trying to do or why mr burgess knocked him out with the fence picket and if theyd just sent him on to jackson while he was under the ether hed never have known the difference but that would have been too simple for a compson to think of not half complex enough having to wait to do it at all until he broke out and tried to run a little girl down on the street with her own father looking at him well like i say they never started soon enough with their cutting and they quit too quick i know at least two more that needed something like that and one of them not over a mile away either but then i dont reckon even that would do any good like i say once a bitch always a bitch and just let me have twentyfour hours without any dam new york jew to advise me what its going to do i dont want to make a killing save that to suck in the smart gamblers with i just want an even chance to get my money back and once ive done that they can bring all beale street and all bedlam in here and two of them can sleep in my bed and another one can have my place at the table too april the day dawned bleak and chill a moving wall of gray light out of the northeast which instead of dissolving into moisture seemed to disintegrate into minute and venomous particles like dust that when dilsey opened the door of the cabin and emerged needled laterally into her flesh precipitating not so much a moisture as a substance partaking of the quality of thin not quite congealed oil she wore a stiff black straw hat perched upon her turban and a maroon velvet cape with a border of mangy and anonymous fur above a dress of purple silk and she stood in the door for a while with her myriad and sunken face lifted to the weather and one gaunt hand flacsoled as the belly of a fish then she moved the cape aside and examined the bosom of her gown the gown fell gauntly from her shoulders across her fallen breasts then tightened upon her paunch and fell again ballooning a little above the nether garments which she would remove layer by layer as the spring accomplished and the warm days in color regal and moribund she had been a big woman once but now her skeleton rose draped loosely in unpadded skin that tightened again upon a paunch almost dropsical as though muscle and tissue had been courage or fortitude which the days or the years had consumed until only the indomitable skeleton was left rising like a ruin or a landmark above the somnolent and impervious guts and above that the collapsed face that gave the impression of the bones themselves being outside the flesh lifted into the driving day with an expression at once fatalistic and of a childs astonished disappointment until she turned and entered the house again and closed the door the earth immediately about the door was bare it had a patina as though from the soles of bare feet in generations like old silver or the walls of mexican houses which have been plastered by hand beside the house shading it in summer stood three mulberry trees the fledged leaves that would later be broad and placid as the palms of hands streaming flatly undulant upon the driving air a pair of jaybirds came up from nowhere whirled up on the blast like gaudy scraps of cloth or paper and lodged in the mulberries where they swung in raucous tilt and recover screaming into the wind that ripped their harsh cries onward and away like scraps of paper or of cloth in turn then three more joined them and they swung and tilted in the wrung branches for a time screaming the door of the cabin opened and dilsey emerged once more this time in a mans felt hat and an army overcoat beneath the frayed skirts of which her blue gingham dress fell in uneven balloonings streaming too about her as she crossed the yard and mounted the steps to the kitchen door a moment later she emerged carrying an open umbrella now which she slanted ahead into the wind and crossed to the woodpile and laid the umbrella down still open immediately she caught at it and arrested it and held to it for a while looking about her then she closed it and laid it down and stacked stovewood into her crooked arm against her breast and picked up the umbrella and got it open at last and returned to the steps and held the wood precariously balanced while she contrived to close the umbrella which she propped in the corner just within the door she dumped the wood into the box behind the stove then she removed the overcoat and hat and took a soiled apron down from the wall and put it on and built a fire in the stove while she was doing so rattling the grate bars and clattering the lids mrs compson began to call her from the head of the stairs she wore a dressing gown of quilted black satin holding it close under her chin in the other hand she held a red rubber hot water bottle and she stood at the head of the back stairway calling dilsey at steady and inflectionless intervals into the quiet stairwell that descended into complete darkness then opened again where a gray window fell across it dilsey she called without inflection or emphasis or haste as though she were not listening for a reply at all dilsey dilsey answered and ceased clattering the stove but before she could cross the kitchen mrs compson called her again and before she crossed the diningroom and brought her head into relief against the gray splash of the window still again all right dilsey said all right here i is ill fill hit soon ez i git some hot water she gathered up her skirts and mounted the stairs wholly blotting the gray light put hit down dar en gawn back to bed i couldnt understand what was the matter mrs compson said ive been lying awake for an hour at least without hearing a sound from the kitchen you put hit down and gawn back to bed dilsey said she toiled painfully up the steps shapeless breathing heavily ill have de fire gwine in a minute en de water hot in two mot ive been lying there for an hour at least mrs compson said i thought maybe you were waiting for me to come down and start the fire dilsey reached the top of the stairs and took the water bottle ill fix hit in a minute she said luster overslep dis mawnin up half de night at dat show i gwine build de fire myself go on now so you wont wake de others swell i ready if you permit luster to do things that interfere with his work youll have to suffer for it yourself mrs compson said jason wont like this if he hears about it you know he wont twusnt none of jasons money he went on dilsey said dats one thing shot she went on down the stairs mrs compson returned to her room as she got into bed again she could hear dilsey yet descending the stairs with a sort of painful and terrific slowness that would have become maddening had it not presently ceased beyond the flapping diminishment of the pantry door she entered the kitchen and built up the fire and began to prepare breakfast in the midst of this she ceased and went to the window and looked out toward her cabin then she went to the door and opened it and shouted into the driving weather luster she shouted standing to listen tilting her face from the wind you luster she listened then as she prepared to shout again luster appeared around the corner of the kitchen maam he said innocently so innocently that dilsey looked down at him for a moment motionless with something more than mere surprise whar you at she said nowhere he said jes in de cellar whut you coin in de cellar she said dont stand dar in de rain fool she said aint coin nothin he said he came up the steps dont you dare come in dis do widout a armful of wood she said here i done had to tote yo wood en build yo fire bofe

she said and git on up dar en see bout benjy she shut the door luster went to the woodpile the five jaybirds whirled over the house screaming and into the mulberries again he watched them he picked up a rock and threw it whoo he said git on back to hell whar you belong at taint monday yit he loaded himself mountainously with stove wood he could not see over it and he staggered to the steps and up them and blundered crashing against the door shedding billets then dilsey came and opened the door for him and he blundered across the kitchen you lusterhah she shouted but he had already hurled the wood into the box with a thunderous crash hah he said is you tryin to wake up de whole house dilsey said she hit him on the back of his head with the flat of her hand go on up dar and git benjy dressed now yessum he said he went toward the outer door whar you gwine dilsey said i thought i better go round de house en in by de front so i wont wake up miss cahline en dem you go on up dem back stairs like i tole you en git benjys clothes on him dilsey said go on now yessum luster said he returned and left by the diningroom door after a while it ceased to flap dilsey prepared to make biscuit as she ground the sifter steadily above the bread board she sang to herself at first something without particular tune or words repetitive mournful and plaintive austere as she ground a faint steady snowing of flour onto the bread board the stove had begun to heat the room and to fill it with murmurous minors of the fire and presently she was singing louder as if her voice too had been thawed out by the growing warmth and then mrs compson called her name again from within the house dilsey raised her face as if her eyes could and did penetrate the walls and ceiling and saw the old woman in her quilted dressing gown at the head of the stairs calling her name with machinelike regularity oh lawd dilsey said she set the sifter down and swept up the hem of her apron and wiped her hands and caught up the bottle from the chair on which she had laid it and gathered her apron about the handle of the kettle which was now jetting faintly jes a minute she called de water jes dis minute got hot it was not the bottle which mrs compson wanted however and clutching it by the neck like a dead hen dilsey went to the foot of the stairs and looked upward aint luster up dar wid him she said luster hasnt been in the house ive been lying here listening for him i knew he would be late but i did hope hed come in time to keep benjamin from disturbing jason on jasons one day in the week to sleep in the morning i dont see how you expect anybody to sleep wid you standin in de hall hollin at folks fum de crack of dawn dilsey said she began to mount the stairs toiling heavily i sent dat boy up dar half an hour ago mrs compson watched her holding the dressing gown under her chin what are you going to do she said gwine git benjy dressed en bring him down to de kitchen whar he wont wake jason en quentin dilsey said havent you started breakfast yet ill tend to dat too dilsey said you better git back in bed swell luster make yo fire hit cold dis mawnin i know it mrs compson said my feet are like ice they were so cold they waked me up she watched dilsey mount the stairs it took her a long while you know how it frets jason when breakfast is late mrs compson said i cant do but one thing at

jason acts when its late en who gwine eat yo messin dilsey said tell me dat go on now she said toiling upward mrs compson stood watching her as she mounted steadying herself against the wall with one hand holding her skirts up with the other are you going to wake him up just to dress him she said dilsey stopped with her foot lifted to the next step she stood there her hand against the wall and the gray splash of the window behind her motionless and shapeless she loomed he aint awake den she said he wasnt when i looked in mrs compson said but its past his time he never does sleep after half past seven you know he doesnt dilsey said nothing she made no further move but though she could not see her save as a blobby shape without depth mrs compson knew that she had lowered her face a little and that she stood now like cows do in the rain holding the empty water bottle by its neck youre not the one who has to bear it mrs compson said its not your responsibility you can go away you dont have to bear the brunt of it day in and day out you owe nothing to them to mr compsons memory i know you have never had any tenderness for jason youve never tried to conceal it dilsey said nothing she turned slowly and descended lowering her body from step to step as a small child does her hand against the wall you go on and let him alone she said dont go in dar no mo now ill send luster up soon as i find him let him alone now she returned to the kitchen she looked into the stove then she drew her apron over her head and donned the overcoat and opened the outer door and looked up and down the yard the weather drove upon her flesh harsh and minute but the scene was empty of all else that moved she descended the steps gingerly as if for silence and went around the corner of the kitchen as she did so luster emerged quickly and innocently from the cellar door dilsey stopped whut you up to she said nothin luster said mr jason say fer me to find out whar dat water leak in de cellar fum en when wus hit he say fer you to do dat dilsey said last new years day wasnt hit i thought i jes be lookin whiles dey sleep luster said dilsey went to the cellar door he stood aside and she peered down into the obscurity odorous of dank earth and mold and rubber huh dilsey said she looked at luster again he met her gaze blandly innocent and open i dont know whut you up to but you aint got no business coin hit you jes tryin me too dis mawnin cause de others is aint you you git on up dar en see to benjy you hear yessum luster said he went on toward the kitchen steps swiftly here dilsey said you git me another armful of wood while i got you yessum he said he passed her on the steps and went to the woodpile when he blundered again at the door a moment later again invisible and blind within and beyond his wooden avatar dilsey opened the door and guided him across the kitchen with a firm hand jes thow hit at dat box again she said jes thow hit i got to luster said panting i cant put hit down no other way den you stand dar en hold hit a while dilsey said she unloaded him a stick at a time whut got into you dis mawnin here i vent you fer wood en you aint never brought mon six sticks at

you befo she said and i dont want nobody else yellin down dem stairs at me swell i rings de bell you hear me yessum luster said he vanished through the swing door dilsey put some more wood in the stove and returned to the bread board presently she began to sing again the room grew warmer soon dilseys skin had taken on a rich lustrous quality as compared with that as of a faint dusting of wood ashes which both it and lusters had worn as she moved about the kitchen gathering about her the raw materials of food coordinating the meal on the wall above a cupboard invisible save at night by lamp light and even then evincing an enigmatic profundity because it had but one hand a cabinet clock ticked then with a preliminary sound as if it had cleared its throat struck five times eight oclock dilsey said she ceased and tilted her head upward listening but there was no sound save the clock and the fire she opened the oven and looked at the pan of bread then stooping she paused while someone descended the stairs she heard the feet cross the diningroom then the swing door opened and luster entered followed by a big man who appeared to have been shaped of some substance whose particles would not or did not cohere to one another or to the frame which supported it his skin was dead looking and hairless dropsical too he moved with a shambling gait like a trained bear his hair was pale and fine it had been brushed smoothly down upon his brow like that of children in daguerrotypes his eyes were clear of the pale sweet blue of cornflowers his thick mouth hung open drooling a little is he cold dilsey said she wiped her hands on her apron and touched his hand ef he aint i is luster said always cold easter aint never seen hit fail miss cahline say ef you aint got time to fix her hot water bottle to never mind about hit oh lawd dilsey said she drew a chair into the corner between the woodbox and the stove the man went obediently and sat in it look in de dinin room and see whar i laid dat bottle down dilsey said luster fetched the bottle from the diningroom and dilsey filled it and gave it to him hurry up now she said see ef jason wake now tell em hits all ready luster went out ben sat beside the stove he sat loosely utterly motionless save for his head which made a continual bobbing sort of movement as he watched dilsey with his sweet vague gaze as she moved about luster returned he up he said miss cahline say put hit on de table he came to the stove and spread his hands palm down above the firebox he up too he said gwine hit wid bofe feet dis mawnin whuts de matter now dilsey said git away fum dar how kin i do anything wid you standin over de stove i cold luster said you ought to thought about dat whiles you was down dar in dat cellar dilsey said whut de

fur dilsey said watch him now so he cant burn his hand again swell i git de table set she went to the diningroom where they heard her moving about then she returned and set a plate at the kitchen table and set food there ben watched her slobbering making a faint eager sound all right honey she said here yo breakfast bring his chair luster luster moved the chair up and ben sat down whimpering and slobbering dilsey tied a cloth about his neck and wiped his mouth with the end of it and see kin you keep fum messin up his clothes one time she said handing luster a spoon ben ceased whimpering he watched the spoon as it rose to his mouth it was as if even eagerness were musclebound in him too and hunger itself inarticulate not knowing it is hunger luster fed him with skill and detachment now and then his attention would return long enough to enable him to feint the spoon and cause ben to close his mouth upon the empty air but it was apparent that lusters mind was elsewhere his other hand lay on the back of the chair and upon that dead surface it moved tentatively delicately as if he were picking an inaudible tune out of the dead void and once he even forgot to tease ben with the spoon while his fingers teased out of the slain wood a soundless and involved arpeggio until ben recalled him by whimpering again in the diningroom dilsey moved back and forth presently she rang a small clear bell then in the kitchen luster heard mrs compson and jason descending and jasons voice and he rolled his eyes whitely with listening sure i know they didnt break it jason said sure i know that maybe the change of weather broke it i dont see how it could have mrs compson said your room stays locked all day long just as you leave it when you go to town none of us ever go in there except sunday to clean it i dont want you to think that i would go where im not wanted or that i would permit anyone else to i never said you broke it did i jason said i dont want to go in your room mrs compson said i respect anybodys private affairs i wouldnt put my foot over the threshold even if i had a key yes jason said i know your keys wont fit thats why i had the lock changed what i want to

it jason said you go and do what i told you en i wouldnt blame her none ef she did dilsey said going toward the stairs wid you naggin at her all de blessed time you in de house hush dilsey mrs compson said its neither your place nor mine to tell jason what to do sometimes i think he is wrong but i try to obey his wishes for you alls sakes if im strong enough to come to the table quentin can too dilsey went out they heard her mounting the stairs they heard her a long while on the stairs youve got a prize set of servants jason said he helped his mother and himself to food did you ever have one that was worth killing you must have had some before i was big enough to remember i have to humor them mrs compson said i have to depend on them so completely its not as if i were strong i wish i were i wish i could do all the house work myself i could at least take that much off your shoulders and a fine pigsty wed live in too jason said hurry up dilsey he shouted i know you blame me mrs compson said for letting them off to go to church today go where jason said hasnt that damn show left yet to church mrs compson said the darkies are having a special easter service i promised dilsey two weeks ago that they could get off which means well eat cold dinner jason said or none at all i know its my fault mrs compson said i know you blame me for what jason said you never resurrected christ did you they heard dilsey mount the final stair then her slow feet overhead quentin she said when she called the first time jason laid his knife and fork down and he and his mother appeared to wait across the table from one another in identical attitudes the one cold and shrewd with closethatched brown hair curled into two stubborn hooks one on either side of his forehead like a bartender in caricature and hazel eyes with blackringed irises like marbles the other cold and querulous with perfectly white hair and eyes pouched and baffled and so dark as to appear to be all pupil or all iris quentin dilsey said get up honey dey waitin breakfast on you i cant understand how that window got broken mrs compson said are you sure it was done yesterday it could have been like that a long time with the warm weather the upper sash behind the shade like that ive told you for the last time that it happened yesterday jason said dont you reckon i know the room i live in do you reckon i could have lived in it a week with a hole in the window you could stick your hand his voice ceased ebbed left him staring at his mother with eyes that for an instant were quite empty of anything it was as though his eyes were holding their breath while his mother looked at him her face flaccid and querulous interminable clairvoyant yet obtuse as they sat so dilsey said quentin dont play wid me honey come on to breakfast honey dey waitin fer you i cant understand it mrs compson said its just as if somebody had tried to break into the house jason sprang up his chair crashed over backward what mrs compson said staring at him as he ran past her and went jumping up the stairs where he met dilsey his face was now in shadow and dilsey said she sullin yo maw aint unlocked but jason ran on past her and along the corridor to a door he didnt call he grasped the knob and tried it then he stood with the knob in his hand and his head bent a little as if he were listening to something much further away than the dimensioned room beyond the door and which he already heard his attitude was that of one who goes through the motions of listening in order to deceive himself as to what he already hears behind him mrs compson mounted the stairs calling his name then she saw dilsey and she quit calling him and began to call dilsey instead i told you she aint unlocked dat do yit dilsey said when she spoke he turned and ran toward her but his voice was quiet matter of fact she carry the key with her he said has she got it now i mean or will she have dilsey mrs compson said on the stairs is which dilsey said whynt you let the key jason said to that room does she carry it with her all the time mother then he saw mrs compson and he went down the stairs and met her give me the key he said he fell to pawing at the pockets of the rusty black dressing sacque she wore she resisted jason she said jason are you and dilsey trying to put me to bed again she said trying to fend him off cant you even let me have sunday in peace the key jason said pawing at her give it here he looked back at the door as if he expected it to fly open before he could get back to it with the key he did not yet have you dilsey mrs compson said clutching her sacque about her give me the key you old fool jason cried suddenly from her pocket he tugged a huge bunch of rusted keys on an iron ring like a mediaeval jailers and ran back up the hall with the two women behind him you jason mrs compson said he will never find the right one she said you know i never let anyone take my keys dilsey she said she began to wail hush dilsey said he aint gwine do nothin to her i aint gwine let him but on sunday morning in my own house mrs compson said when ive tried so hard to raise them christians let me find the right key jason she said she put her hand on his arm then she began to struggle with him but he flung her aside with a motion of his elbow and looked around at her for a moment his eyes cold and harried then he turned to the door again and the unwieldy keys hush dilsey said you jason something terrible has happened mrs compson said wailing again i know it has you jason she said grasping at him again he wont even let me find the key to a room in my own house now now dilsey said whut kin happen i right here i aint gwine let him hurt her quentin she said raising her voice dont you be skeered honey ise right here the door opened swung inward he stood in it for a moment hiding the room then he stepped aside go in he said in a thick light voice they went in it was not a girls room it was not anybodys room and the faint scent of cheap cosmetics and the few feminine objects and the other evidences of crude and hopeless efforts to feminise it but added to its anonymity giving it that dead and stereotyped transience of rooms in assignation houses the bed had not been disturbed on the floor lay a soiled undergarment of cheap silk a little too pink from a half open bureau drawer dangled a single stocking the window was open a pear tree grew there close against the house it was in bloom and the branches scraped and rasped against the house and the myriad air driving in the window brought into the room the forlorn scent of the blossoms dar now dilsey said didnt i told you she all right all right mrs compson said dilsey followed her into the room and touched her you come on and lay down now she said i find her in ten minutes mrs compson shook her off find the note she said quentin left a note when he did it all right dilsey said ill find hit you come on to yo room now i knew the minute they named her quentin this would happen mrs compson said she went to the bureau and began to turn over the scattered objects therescent bottles a box of powder a chewed pencil a pair of scissors with one broken blade lying upon a darned scarf dusted with powder and stained with rouge find the note she said i is dilsey said you come on now me and jasonll find hit you come on to yo room jason mrs compson said where is he she went to the door dilsey followed her on down the hall to another door it was closed jason she called through the door there was no answer she tried the knob then she called him again but there was still no answer for he was hurling things backward out of the closet garments shoes a suitcase then he emerged carrying a sawn section of tongueandgroove planking and laid it down and entered the closet again and emerged with a metal box he set it on the bed and stood looking at the broken lock while he dug a keyring from his pocket and selected a key and for a time longer he stood with the selected key in his hand looking at the broken lock then he put the keys back in his pocket and carefully tilted the contents of the box out upon the bed still carefully he sorted the papers taking them up one at a time and shaking them then he upended the box and shook it too and slowly replaced the papers and stood again looking at the broken lock with the box in his hands and his head bent outside the window he heard some jaybirds swirl shrieking past and away their cries whipping away along the wind and an automobile passed somewhere and died away also his mother spoke his name again beyond the door but he didnt move he heard dilsey lead her away up the hall and then a door closed then he replaced the box in the closet and flung the garments back into it and went down stairs to the telephone while he stood there with the receiver to his ear waiting dilsey came down the stairs she looked at him without stopping and went on the wire opened this is jason compson he said his voice so harsh and thick that he had to repeat himself jason compson he said controlling his voice have a car ready with a deputy if you cant go in ten minutes ill be there what robbery my house i know who it robbery i say have a car read what arent you a paid law enforcement yes ill be there in five minutes have that car ready to leave at once if you dont ill report it to the governor he clapped the receiver back and crossed the diningroom where the scarce broken meal lay cold now on the table and entered the kitchen dilsey was filling the hot water bottle ben sat tranquil and empty beside him luster looked like a fice dog brightly watchful he was eating something jason went on across the kitchen aint you going to eat no breakfast dilsey said he paid her no attention go on en eat

head en now he gone fer de doctor dats whut i bet the clock ticktocked solemn and profound it might have been the dry pulse of the decaying house itself after a while it whirred and cleared its throat and struck six times ben looked up at it then he looked at the bulletlike silhouette of lusters head in the window and he begun to bob his head again drooling he whimpered hush up looney luster said without turning look like we aint gwine git to go to no church today but ben sat in the chair his big soft hands dangling between his knees moaning faintly suddenly he wept a slow bellowing sound meaningless and sustained hush luster said he turned and lifted his hand you want me to whup you but ben looked at him bellowing slowly with each expiration luster came and shook him you hush dis minute he shouted here he said he hauled ben out of the chair and dragged the chair around facing the stove and opened the door to the firebox and shoved ben into the chair they looked like a tug nudging at a clumsy tanker in a narrow dock ben sat down again facing the rosy door he hushed then they heard the clock again and dilsey slow on the stairs when she entered he began to whimper again then he lifted his voice whut you done to him dilsey said why cant you let him lone dis mawnin of all times i aint doin nothin to him luster said mr jason skeered him dats whut hit is he aint kilt

go out dos they went out dilsey stood for a while at the table then she went and cleared the breakfast things from the diningroom and ate her breakfast and cleaned up the kitchen then she removed her apron and hung it up and went to the foot of the stairs and listened for a moment there was no sound she donned the overcoat and the hat and went across to her cabin the rain had stopped the air now drove out of the southeast broken overhead into blue patches upon the crest of a hill beyond the trees and roofs and spires of town sunlight lay like a pale scrap of cloth was blotted away upon the air a bell came then as if at a signal other bells took up the sound and repeated it the cabin door opened and dilsey emerged again in the maroon cape and the purple gown and wearing soiled white elbowlength gloves and minus her headcloth now she came into the yard and called luster she waited a while then she went to the house and around it to the cellar door moving close to the wall and looked into the door ben sat on the steps before him luster squatted on the damp floor he held a saw in his left hand the blade sprung a little by pressure of his hand and he was in the act of striking the blade with the worn wooden mallet with which she had been making beaten biscuit for more than thirty years the saw gave forth a single sluggish twang that ceased with lifeless alacrity leaving the blade in a thin clean curve between lusters hand and the floor still inscrutable it bellied dats de way he done hit luster said i jes aint foun de right thing to hit it wid dats whut you doin is it dilsey said bring me dat mallet she said i aint hurt hit luster said bring hit here dilsey said put dat saw whar you got hit first he put the saw away and brought the mallet to her then ben wailed again hopeless and prolonged it was nothing just sound it might have been all time and injustice and sorrow become vocal for an instant by a conjunction of planets listen at him luster said he been gwine on dat way evy since you vent us outen de house i dont know whut got in to him dis mawnin bring him here dilsey said come on benjy luster said he went back down the steps and took bens arm he came obediently wailing that slow hoarse sound that ships make that seems to begin before the sound itself has started seems to cease before the sound itself has stopped run and git his cap dilsey

hit is smell whut mammy luster said you go git dat cap dilsey said luster went on they stood in the cellar door ben one step below her the sky was broken now into scudding patches that dragged their swift shadows up out of the shabby garden over the broken fence and across the yard dilsey stroked bens head slowly and steadily smoothing the bang upon his brow he wailed quietly unhurriedly hush dilsey said hush now we be gone in a minute hush now he wailed quietly and steadily luster returned wearing a stiff new straw hat with a colored band and carrying a cloth cap the hat seemed to isolate lusters skull in the beholders eye as a spotlight would in all its individual planes and angles so peculiarly individual was its shape that at first glance the hat appeared to be on the head of someone standing immediately behind luster dilsey looked at the hat whynt you wear yo old hat she said couldnt find hit luster said i bet you couldnt i bet you fixed hit last night so you couldnt find hit you fixin to ruin dat un aw mammy luster said hit aint gwine rain how you know you go git dat old hat en put dat new un away aw mammy den you go git de umbreller aw mammy take yo choice dilsey

toward the gate hush dilsey said from time to time as they went down the drive they reached the gate dilsey opened it luster was coming down the drive behind them carrying the umbrella a woman was with him here dey come dilsey said they passed out the gate now den she said ben ceased luster and his mother overtook them frony wore a dress of bright blue silk and a flowered hat she was a thin

street along its quiet length white people in bright clumps moved churchward under the windy bells walking now and then in the random and tentative sun the wind was gusty out of the southeast chill and raw after the warm days i wish you wouldnt keep on bringin him to church mammy frony said folks talkin whut folks dilsey said i hears em frony said and i knows whut kind of folks dilsey said trash white folks dats who it is thinks he aint good enough fer white church but nigger church aint good enough fer him dey talks jes de same frony said den you send um to me dilsey said tell um de good lawd dont keer whether he bright er not dont nobody but white trash keer dat a street turned off at right angles descending and became a dirt road on either hand the land dropped more sharply a broad flat dotted with small cabins whose weathered roofs were on a level with the crown of the road they were set in small grassless plots littered with broken things bricks planks crockery things of a once utilitarian value what growth there was consisted of rank weeds and the trees were mulberries and locusts and sycamorestrees that partook also of the foul desiccation which surrounded the houses trees whose very burgeoning seemed to be the sad and stubborn remnant of september as if even spring had passed them by leaving them to feed upon the rich and unmistakable smell of negroes in which they grew from the doors negroes spoke to them as they passed to dilsey usually sis gibson how you dis mawnin im well is you well im right well i thank you they emerged from the cabins and struggled up the sharing levee to the roadmen in staid hard brown or black with gold watch chains and now and then a stick young men in cheap violent blues or stripes and swaggering hats women a little stiffly sibilant and children in garments bought second hand of white people who looked at ben with the covertness of nocturnal animals i bet you wont go up en tech him how come i wont i bet you wont i bet you skeered to he wont hurt folks he des a looney how come a looney wont hurt folks sat un wont i teched him i bet you wont now case miss dilsey lookin you wont no ways he dont hurt folks he des a looney and steadily the older people speaking to dilsey though unless they were quite old dilsey permitted frony to respond mammy aint feelin well dis mawnin dats too bad but revun shegogll kyo dat hell give her de comfort en de unburdenin the road rose again to a scene like a painted backdrop notched into a cut of red clay crowned with oaks the road appeared to stop short off like a cut ribbon beside it a weathered church lifted its crazy steeple like a painted church and the whole scene was as flat and without perspective as a painted cardboard set upon the ultimate edge of the flat earth against the windy sunlight of space and april and a midmorning filled with bells toward the church they thronged with slow sabbath deliberation the women and children went on in the men stopped outside and talked in quiet groups until the bell ceased ringing then they too entered the church had been decorated with sparse flowers from kitchen gardens and hedgerows and with streamers of colored crepe paper above the pulpit hung a battered christmas bell the accordion sort that collapses the pulpit was empty though the choir was already in place fanning themselves although it was not warm most of the women were gathered on one side of the room they were talking then the bell struck one time and they dispersed to their seats and the congregation sat for an instant expectant the bell struck again one time the choir rose and began to sing and the congregation turned its head as one as six small childrenfour girls with tight pigtails bound with small scraps of cloth like butterflies and two boys with close napped headsentered and marched up the aisle strung together in a harness of white ribbons and flowers and followed by two men in single file the second man was huge of a light coffee color imposing in a frock coat and white tie his head was magisterial and profound his neck rolled above his collar in rich folds but he was familiar to them and so the heads were still reverted when he had passed and it was not until the choir ceased singing that they realised that the visiting clergyman had already entered and when they saw the man who had preceded their minister enter the pulpit still ahead of him an indescribable sound went up a sigh a sound of astonishment and disappointment the visitor was undersized in a shabby alpaca coat he had a wizened black face like a small aged monkey and all the while that the choir sang again and while the six children rose and sang in thin frightened tuneless whispers they watched the insignificant looking man sitting dwarfed and countrified by the ministers imposing bulk with something like consternation they were still looking at him with consternation and unbelief when the minister rose and introduced him in rich rolling tones whose very unction served to increase the visitors insignificance en dey brung dat all de way fum saint looey frony whispered ive knowed de lawd to use cuiser tools den dat dilsey said hush now she said to ben dey fixin to sing again in a minute when the visitor rose to speak he sounded like a white man his voice was level and cold it sounded too big to have come from him and they listened at first through curiosity as they would have to a monkey talking they began to watch him as they would a man on a tight rope they even forgot his insignificant appearance in the virtuosity with which he ran and poised and swooped upon the cold inflectionless wire of his voice so that at last when with a sort of swooping glide he came to rest again beside the reading desk with one arm resting upon it at shoulder height and his monkey body as reft of all motion as a mummy or an emptied vessel the congregation sighed as if it waked from a collective dream and moved a little in its seats behind the pulpit the choir fanned steadily dilsey whispered hush now dey fixin to sing in a minute then a voice said brethren the preacher had not moved his arm lay yet across the desk and he still held that pose while the voice died in sonorous echoes between the walls it was as different as day and dark from his former tone with a sad timbrous quality like an alto horn sinking into their hearts and speaking there again when it had ceased in fading and cumulate echoes brethren and sisteren it said again the preacher removed his arm and he began to walk back and forth before the desk his hands clasped behind him a meagre figure hunched over upon itself like that of one long immured in striving with the implacable earth i got the recollection and the blood of the lamb he tramped steadily back and forth beneath the twisted paper and the christmas bell hunched his hands clasped behind him he was like a worn small rock whelmed by the successive waves of his voice with his body he seemed to feed the voice that succubus like had fleshed its teeth in him and the congregation seemed to watch with its own eyes while the voice consumed him until he was nothing and they were nothing and there was not even a voice but instead their hearts were speaking to one another in chanting measures beyond the need for words so that when he came to rest against the reading desk his monkey face lifted and his whole attitude that of a serene tortured crucifix that transcended its shabbiness and insignificance and made it of no moment a long moaning expulsion of breath rose from them and a womans single soprano yes jesus as the scudding day passed overhead the dingy windows glowed and faded in ghostly retrograde a car passed along the road outside laboring in the sand died away dilsey sat bolt upright her hand on bens knee two tears slid down her fallen cheeks in and out of the myriad coruscations of immolation and abnegation and time brethren the minister said in a harsh whisper without moving yes jesus the womans voice said hushed yet breddren en sistuhn his voice rang again with the horns he removed his arm and stood erect and raised his hands i got de ricklickshun en de blood of de lamb they did not mark just when his intonation his pronunciation became negroid they just sat swaying a little in their seats as the voice took them into itself when de

breddren look at dem little chiller settin dar jesus wus like dat once he mammy suffered de glory en de pangs sometime maybe she heft him at de nightfall whilst de angels singin him to sleep maybe she

de arisen dead whut got de blood en de ricklickshun of de lamb in the midst of the voices and the hands ben sat rapt in his sweet blue gaze dilsey sat bolt upright beside crying rigidly and quietly in the annealment and the blood of the remembered lamb as they walked through the bright noon up the sandy road with the dispersing congregation talking easily again group to group she continued to weep unmindful of the talk he sho a preacher mon he didnt look like much at first but hush he seed de power en de glory yes suh he seed hit face to face he seed hit dilsey made no sound her face did not quiver as the tears took their sunken and devious courses walking with her head up making no effort to dry them away even whynt you quit dat mammy frony said wid all dese people lookin we be passin white folks soon ive seed de first en de last dilsey said never you mind me first en last whut frony said never you mind dilsey said i seed de beginnin en now i sees de endin before they reached the street though she stopped and lifted her skirt and dried her eyes on the hem of her topmost underskirt then they went on ben shambled along beside dilsey watching luster who anticked along ahead the umbrella in his hand and his new straw hat slanted viciously in the sunlight like a big foolish dog watching a small clever one they reached the gate and entered immediately ben began to whimper again and for a while all of them looked up the drive at the square paintless house with its rotting portico whuts gwine on up dar today frony said somethin is nothin dilsey said you tend to yo business en let de whitefolks tend to deirn somethin is frony said i heard him first thing dis mawnin taint none of my business dough en i knows whut too luster said you knows mo den you got any use fer dilsey

frony went to the cabin after a while dilsey emerged again in the faded calico dress and went to the kitchen the fire had died down there was no sound in the house she put on the apron and went up stairs there was no sound anywhere quentins room was as they had left it she entered and picked up the undergarment and put the stocking back in the drawer and closed it mrs compsons door was closed dilsey stood beside it for a moment listening then she opened it and entered entered a pervading reek of camphor the shades were drawn the room in halflight and the bed so that at first she thought mrs compson was asleep and was about to close the door when the other spoke well she said what is it hits me dilsey said you want anything mrs compson didnt answer after a while without moving her head at all she said wheres jason he aint come back yit dilsey said whut you want mrs compson said nothing like so many cold weak people when faced at last by the incontrovertible disaster she exhumed from somewhere a sort of fortitude strength in her case it was an unshakable conviction regarding the yet unplumbed event well she said presently did you find it find whut whut you talkin about the note at least she would have enough consideration to leave a note even quentin did that whut you talkin about dilsey said dont you know she all right i bet she be walkin right in dis do befo dark

black robe lay across the foot of the bed dilsey stood with her hand on the door knob well mrs compson said what do you want are you going to fix some dinner for jason and benjamin or not jason aint come yit dilsey said i gwine fix somethin you sho you dont want nothin yo bottle still hot enough you might hand me my bible i give hit to you dis mawnin befo i left you laid it on the edge of the bed how long did you expect it to stay there dilsey crossed to the bed and groped among the shadows beneath the edge of it and found the bible face down she smoothed the bent pages and laid the book on the bed again mrs compson didnt open her eyes her hair and the pillow were the same color beneath the wimple of the medicated cloth she looked like an old nun praying dont put it there again she said without opening her eyes thats where you put it before do you want me to have to get out of bed to pick it up dilsey reached the book across her and laid it on the broad side of the bed you cant see to read noways she said you want me to raise de shade a little no let them alone go on and fix jason something to eat dilsey went out she closed the door and returned to the kitchen the stove was almost cold while she stood there the clock above the cupboard struck ten times one oclock she said aloud jason aint comin home ise seed de first en de last she said looking at the cold stove i seed de first en de last she set out some cold food on a table as she moved back and forth she sang a hymn she sang the first two lines over and over to the complete tune she arranged the meal and went to the door and called luster and after a time luster and ben entered ben was still moaning a little as to himself he aint never quit luster said yall come on en eat dilsey said jason aint comin to dinner they sat down at the table ben could manage solid food pretty well for himself though even now with cold food before him dilsey tied a cloth about his neck he and luster ate dilsey moved about the kitchen singing the two lines of the hymn which she remembered yall kin gawn en eat she said jason aint comin home he was twenty miles away at that time when he left the house he drove rapidly to town overreaching the slow sabbath groups and the peremptory bells along the broken air he crossed the empty square and turned into a narrow street that was abruptly quieter even yet and stopped before a frame house and went up the flower bordered walk to the porch beyond the screen door people were talking as he lifted his hand to knock he heard steps so he withheld his hand until a big man in black broadcloth trousers and a stiff bosomed white shirt without collar opened the door he had vigorous untidy irongray hair and his gray eyes were round and shiny like a little boys he took jasons hand and drew him into the house still shaking it come right in he said come right in you ready to go now jason said walk right in the other said propelling him by the elbow into a room where a man and a woman sat you know myrtles husband dont you jason compson vernon yes jason said he did not even look at the man and as the sheriff drew a chair across the room the man said well go out so you can talk come on myrtle no no the sheriff said you folks keep your seat i reckon it aint that serious jason have a seat ill tell you as we go along jason said get your hat and coat well go out the man said rising keep your seat the sheriff said me and jason will go out on the porch you get your hat and coat jason said theyve already got a twelve hour start the sheriff led the way back to the porch a man and a woman passing spoke to him he responded with a hearty florid gesture bells were still ringing from the direction of the section known as nigger hollow get your hat sheriff jason said the sheriff drew up two chairs have a seat and tell me what the trouble is i told you over the phone jason said standing i did that to save time am i going to have to go to law to compel you to do your sworn duty you sit down and tell me about it the sheriff said ill take care of you all right care hell jason said is this what you call taking care of me youre the one thats holding us up the sheriff said you sit down and tell me about it jason told him his sense of injury and impotence feeding upon its own sound so that after a time he forgot his haste in the violent cumulation of his self justification and his outrage the sheriff watched him steadily with his cold shiny eyes but you dont know they done it he said you just think so dont know jason said when i spent two damn days chasing her through alleys trying to keep her away from him after i told her what id do to her if i ever caught her with him and you say i dont know that that little b now then the sheriff said thatll do thats enough of that he looked out across the street his hands in his pockets and when i come to you a commissioned officer of the law jason said that shows in mottson this week the sheriff said yes jason said and if i could find a law officer that gave a solitary damn about protecting the people that elected him to office id be there too by now he repeated his story harshly recapitulant seeming to get an actual pleasure out of his outrage and impotence the sheriff did not appear to be listening at all jason he said what were you doing with three thousand dollars hid in the house what jason said thats my business where i keep my money your business is to help me get it back did your mother know you had that much on the place look here jason said my house has been robbed i know who did it and i know where they are i come to you as the commissioned officer of the law and i ask you once more are you going to make any effort to recover my property or not what do you aim to do with that girl if you catch them nothing jason said not anything i wouldnt lay my hand on her the bitch that cost me a job the one chance ever had to get ahead that killed my father and is shortening my mothers life every day and made my name a laughing stock in the town i wont do anything to her he said not anything you drove that girl into running off jason the sheriff said how i conduct my family is no business of yours jason said are you going to help me or not you drove her away from home the sheriff said and i have some suspicions about who that money belongs to that i dont reckon ill ever know for certain jason stood slowly wringing the brim of his hat in his hands he said quietly youre not going to make any effort to catch them for me thats not any of my business jason if you had any actual proof id have to act but without that i dont figger its any of my business thats your answer is it jason said think well now thats it jason all right jason said he put his hat on youll regret this i wont be helpless this is not russia where just because he wears a little metal badge a man is immune to law he went down the steps and got in his car and started the engine the sheriff watched him drive away turn and rush past the house toward town the bells were ringing again high in the scudding sunlight in bright disorderly tatters of sound he stopped at a filling station and had his tires examined and the tank filled gwine on a trip is you the negro asked him he didnt answer look like hit gwine fair off after all the negro said fair off hell jason said itll be raining like hell by twelve oclock he looked at the sky thinking about rain about the slick clay roads himself stalled somewhere miles from town he thought about it with a sort of triumph of the fact that he was going to miss dinner that by starting now and so serving his compulsion of haste he would be at the greatest possible distance from both towns when noon came it seemed to him that in this circumstance was giving him a break so he said to the negro what the hell are you doing has somebody paid you to keep this car standing here as long as you can dis here ti aint got no air atall in hit the negro said then get the hell away from there and let me have that tube jason said hit up now the negro said rising you kin ride now jason got in and started the engine and drove off he went into second gear the engine spluttering and gasping and he raced the engine jamming the throttle down and snapping the choker in and out savagely its going to rain he said get me half way there and rain like hell and he drove on out of the bells and out of town thinking of himself slogging through the mud hunting a team and every damn one of them will be at church he thought of how hed find a church at last and take a team and of the owner coming out shouting at him and of himself striking the man down im jason compson see if you can stop me see if you can elect a man to office that can stop me he said thinking of himself entering the courthouse with a file of soldiers and dragging the sheriff out thinks he can sit with his hands folded and see me lose my job ill show him about jobs of his niece he did not think at all nor of the arbitrary valuation of the money neither of them had had entity or individuality for him for ten years together they merely symbolised the job in the bank of which he had been deprived before he ever got it the air brightened the running shadow patches were now the obverse and it seemed to him that the fact that the day was clearing was another cunning stroke on the part of the foe the fresh battle toward which he was carrying ancient wounds from time to time he passed churches unpainted frame buildings with sheet iron steeples surrounded by tethered teams and shabby motorcars and it seemed to him that each of them was a picketpost where the rear guards of circumstance peeped fleetingly back at him and damn you too he said see if you can stop me thinking of himself his file of soldiers with the manacled sheriff in the rear dragging omnipotence down from his throne if necessary of the embattled legions of both hell and heaven through which he tore his way and put his hands at last on his fleeing niece the wind was out of the southeast it blew steadily upon his cheek it seemed that he could feel the prolonged blow of it sinking through his skull and suddenly with an old premonition he clapped the brakes on and stopped and sat perfectly still then he lifted his hand to his neck and began to curse and sat there cursing in a harsh whisper when it was necessary for him to drive for any length of time he fortified himself with a handkerchief soaked in camphor which he would tie about his throat when clear of town thus inhaling the fumes and he got out and lifted the seat cushion on the chance that there might be a forgotten one there he looked beneath both seats and stood again for a while cursing seeing himself mocked by his own triumphing he closed his eyes leaning on the door he could return and get the forgotten camphor or he could go on in either case his head would be splitting but at home he could be sure of finding camphor on sunday while if he went on he could not be sure but if he went back he would be an hour and a half later in reaching mottson maybe i can drive slow he said maybe i can drive slow thinking of something else he got in and started ill think of something else he said so he thought about lorraine he imagined himself in bed with her only he was just lying beside her pleading with her to help him then he thought of the money again and that he had been outwitted by a woman a girl if he could just believe it was the man who had robbed him but to have been robbed of that which was to have compensated him for the lost job which he had acquired through so much effort and risk by the very symbol of the lost job itself and worst of all by a bitch of a girl he drove on shielding his face from the steady wind with the corner of his coat he could see the opposed forces of his destiny and his will drawing swiftly together now toward a junction that would be irrevocable he became cunning i cant make a blunder he told himself there would be just one right thing without alternatives he must do that he believed that both of them would know him on sight while hed have to trust to seeing her first unless the man still wore the red tie and the fact that he must depend on that red tie seemed to be the sum of the impending disaster he could almost smell it feel it above the throbbing of his head he crested the final hill smoke lay in the valley and roofs a spire or two above trees he drove down the hill and into the town slowing telling himself again of the need for caution to find where the tent was located first he could not see very well now and he knew that it was the disaster which kept telling him to go directly and get something for his head at a filling station they told him that the tent was not up yet but that the show cars were on a siding at the station he drove there two gaudily painted pullman cars stood on the track he reconnoitred them before he got out he was trying to breathe shallowly so that the blood would not beat so in his skull he got out and went along the station wall watching the cars a few garments hung out of the windows limp and crinkled as though they had been recently laundered on the earth beside the steps of one sat three canvas chairs but he saw no sign of life at all until a man in a dirty apron came to the door and emptied a pan of dishwater with a broad gesture the sunlight glinting on the metal belly of the pan then entered the car again now ill have to take him by surprise before he can warn them he thought it never occurred to him that they might not be there in the car that they should not be there that the whole result should not hinge on whether he saw them first or they saw him first would be opposed to all nature and contrary to the whole rhythm of events and more than that he must see them first get the money back then what they did would be of no importance to him while otherwise the whole world would know that he jason compson had been robbed by quentin his niece a bitch he reconnoitred again then he went to the car and mounted the steps swiftly and quietly and paused at the door the galley was dark rank with stale food the man was a white blur singing in a cracked shaky tenor an old man he thought and not as big as i am he entered the car as the man looked up hey the man said stopping his song where are they jason said quick now in the sleeping car wheres who the man said dont lie to me jason said he blundered on in the cluttered obscurity whats that the other said who you calling a liar and when jason grasped his shoulder he exclaimed look out fellow dont lie jason said where are they why you bastard the man said his arm was frail and thin in jasons grasp he tried to wrench free then he turned and fell to scrabbling on the littered table behind him come on jason said where are they ill tell you where they are the man shrieked lemme find my butcher knife here jason said trying to hold the other im just asking you a question you bastard the other shrieked scrabbling at the table jason tried to grasp him in both arms trying to prison the puny fury of him the mans body felt so old so frail yet so fatally singlepurposed that for the first time jason saw clear and unshadowed the disaster toward which he rushed quit it he said here here ill get out give me time and ill get out call me a liar the other wailed lemme go lemme go just one minute ill show you jason glared wildly about holding the other outside it was now bright and sunny swift and bright and empty and he thought of the people soon to be going quietly home to sunday dinner decorously festive and of himself trying to hold the fatal furious little old man whom he dared not release long enough to turn his back and run will you quit long enough for me to get out he said will you but the other still struggled and jason freed one hand and struck him on the head a clumsy hurried blow and not hard but the other slumped immediately and slid clattering among pans and buckets to the floor jason stood above him panting listening then he turned and ran from the car at the door he restrained himself and descended more slowly and stood there again his breath made a hah hah hah sound and he stood there trying to repress it darting his gaze this way and that when at a scuffling sound behind him he turned in time to see the little old man leaping awkwardly and furiously from the vestibule a rusty hatchet high in his hand he grasped at the hatchet feeling no shock but knowing that he was falling thinking so this is how itll end and he believed that he was about to die and when something crashed against the back of his head he thought how did he hit me there only maybe he hit me a long time ago he thought and i just now felt it and he thought hurry hurry get it over with and then a furious desire not to die seized him and he struggled hearing the old man wailing and cursing in his cracked voice he still struggled when they hauled him to his feet but they held him and he ceased am i bleeding much he said the back of my head am i bleeding he was still saying that while he felt himself being propelled rapidly away heard the old mans thin furious voice dying away behind him look at my head he said wait i wait hell the man who held him said that damn little waspll kill you keep going you aint hurt he hit me jason said am i bleeding keep going the other said he led jason on around the corner of the station to the empty platform where an express truck stood where grass grew rigidly in a plot bordered with rigid flowers and a sign in electric lights keep your on mottson the gap filled by a human eye with an electric pupil the man released him now he said you get on out of here and stay out what were you trying to do commit suicide i was looking for two people jason said i just asked him where they were who you looking for its a girl jason said and a man he had on a red tie in jefferson yesterday with this show they robbed me oh the man said youre the one are you well they aint here i reckon so jason said he leaned against the wall and put his hand to the back of his head and looked at his palm i thought i was bleeding he said i thought he hit me with that hatchet you hit your head on the rail the man said you better go on they aint here yes he said they were not here i thought he was lying do you think im lying the man said no jason said i know theyre not here i told him to get the hell out of there both of them the man said i wont have nothing like that in my show i run a respectable show with a respectable troupe yes jason said you dont know where they went no and i dont want to know no member of my show can pull a stunt like that you her brother no jason said it dont matter i just wanted to see them you sure he didnt hit me no blood i mean there would have been blood if i hadnt got there when i did you stay away from here now that little bastardll kill you that your car yonder yes well you get in it and go back to jefferson if you find them it wont be in my show i run a respectable show you say they robbed you no jason said it dont make any difference he went to the car and got in what is it i must do he thought then he remembered he started the engine and drove slowly up the street until he found a drugstore the door was locked he stood for a while with his hand on the knob and his head bent a little then he turned away and when a man came along after a while he asked if there was a drugstore open anywhere but there was not then he asked when the northbound train ran and the man told him at two thirty he crossed the pavement and got in the car again and sat there after a while two negro lads passed he called to them can either of you boys drive a car yes suh whatll you charge to drive me to jefferson right away they looked at one another murmuring ill pay a dollar jason said they murmured again couldnt go fer dat one said what will you go for kin you go one said i cant git off the other said whynt you drive him up dar you aint got nothin to do yes i is whut you got to do they murmured again laughing ill give you two dollars jason said either of you i cant git away neither the first said all right jason said go on he sat there for some time he heard a clock strike the half hour then people began to pass in sunday and easter clothes some looked at him as they passed at the man sitting quietly behind the wheel of a small car with his invisible life ravelled out about him like a wornout sock and went on after a while a negro in overalls came up is you de one wants to go to jefferson he said yes jason said whatll you charge me fo dollars give you two cant go fer no lessn fo the man in the car sat quietly he wasnt even looking at him the negro said you want me er not all right jason said get in he moved over and the negro took the wheel jason closed his eyes i can get something for it at jefferson he told himself easing himself to the jolting i can get something there they drove on along the streets where people were turning peacefully into houses and sunday dinners and on out of town he thought that he wasnt thinking of home where ben and luster were eating cold dinner at the kitchen table somethingthe absence of disaster threat in any constant evilpermitted him to forget jefferson as any place which he had ever seen before where his life must resume itself when ben and luster were done dilsey sent them outdoors and see kin you let him alone swell fo oclock t p be here den yessum luster said they went out dilsey ate her dinner and cleared up the kitchen then she went to the foot of the stairs and listened but there was no sound she returned through the kitchen and out the outer door and stopped on the steps ben and luster were not in sight but while she stood there she heard another sluggish twang from the direction of the cellar door and she went to the door and looked down upon a repetition of the mornings scene he done hit jes dat way luster said he contemplated the motionless saw with a kind of hopeful dejection i aint got de right thing to hit it wid yit he said en you aint

whimpering is you gwine hush er aint you luster said he got up and followed and came upon ben squatting before a small mound of earth at either end of it an empty bottle of blue glass that once contained poison was fixed in the ground in one was a withered stalk of jimson weed ben squatted before it moaning a slow inarticulate sound still moaning he sought vaguely about and found a twig and put it in the other bottle whynt you hush luster said you want me to give you somethin to sho nough moan about sposin i does dis he knelt and swept the bottle suddenly up and behind him ben ceased

slobbering when the foursome went on he followed along the fence bobbing and moaning one said here caddie bring the bag hush benjy luster said but ben went on at his shambling trot clinging to the fence wailing in his hoarse hopeless voice the man played and went on ben keeping pace with him until the fence turned at right angles and he clung to the fence watching the people move on and away will you hush now luster said will you hush now he shook bens arm ben clung to the fence wailing steadily and hoarsely aint you gwine stop luster said or is you ben gazed through the fence all right

tears the grave hopeless sound of all voiceless misery under the sun luster returned carrying a white satin slipper it was yellow now and cracked and soiled and when they gave it into bens hand he

motion you luster dilsey said hum up dar luster said he flapped the lines again with subterranean rumblings queenie jogged slowly down the drive and turned into the street where luster exhorted her into a gait resembling a prolonged and suspended fall in a forward direction ben quit whimpering he sat in the middle of the seat holding the repaired flower upright in his fist his eyes serene and ineffable directly before him lusters bullet head turned backward continually until the house passed from view then he pulled to the side of the street and while ben watched him he descended and broke a switch from a hedge queenie lowered her head and fell to cropping the grass until luster mounted and hauled her head up and harried her into motion again then he squared his elbows and with the switch and the reins held high he assumed a swaggering attitude out of all proportion to the sedate cropping of queenies hooves and the organlike basso of her internal accompaniment motors passed them and pedestrians once a group of half grown negroes dar luster whar you gwine luster to de boneyard hi luster said aint de same boneyard yall headed fen hum up elefump they approached the square where the confederate soldier gazed with empty eyes beneath his marble hand in wind and weather luster took still another notch in himself and gave the impervious queenie a cut with the switch casting his glance about the square dar mr jason car he said then he spied another group of negroes les show dem niggers how quality does benjy he said whut you say he looked back ben sat holding the flower in his fist his gaze empty and untroubled luster hit queenie again and swung her to the left at the monument for an instant ben sat in an utter hiatus then he bellowed bellow on bellow his voice mounted with scarce interval for breath there was more than astonishment in it it was horror shock agony eyeless tongueless just sound and lusters eyes backrolling for a white instant gret god he said hush hush gret god he whirled again and struck queenie with the switch it broke and he cast it away and with bens voice mounting toward its unbelievable crescendo luster caught up the end of the reins and leaned forward as jason came jumping across the square and onto the step with a backhanded blow he hurled luster aside and caught the reins and sawed queenie about and doubled the reins back and slashed her across the hips he cut her again and again into a plunging gallop while bens hoarse agony roared about them and swung her about to the right of the monument then he struck luster over the head with his fist dont you know any better than to take him to the left he said he reached back and struck ben breaking the flower stalk again shut up he said shut up he jerked queenie back and jumped down get to hell on home with him if you ever cross that gate with him again ill kill you yes suh luster said he took the reins and hit queenie with the end of them git up git up dar benjy fer gods sake bens voice roared and roared queenie moved again her feet began to clopclop steadily again and at once ben hushed luster looked quickly back over his shoulder then he drove on the broken flower drooped over bens fist and his eyes were empty and blue and serene again as cornice and faccircade flowed smoothly once more from left to right post and tree window and doorway and signboard each in its ordered place new york ny october appendix compson ikkemotubbe a dispossessed american king called lhomme and sometimes de lhomme by his fosterbrother a chevalier of france who had he not been born too late could have been among the brightest in that glittering galaxy of knightly blackguards who were napoleons marshals who thus translated the chickasaw title meaning the man which translation ikkemotubbe himself a man of wit and imagination as well as a shrewd judge of character including his own carried one step further and anglicised it to doom who granted out of his vast lost domain a solid square mile of virgin north mississippi dirt as truly angled as the four corners of a cardtable top forested then because these were the old days before when the stars fell and jefferson mississippi was one long rambling onestorey mudchinked log building housing the chickasaw agent and his tradingpost store to the grandson of a scottish refugee who had lost his own birthright by casting his lot with a king who himself had been dispossessed this in partial return for the right to proceed in peace by whatever means he and his people saw fit afoot or a horse provided they were chickasaw horses to the wild western land presently to be called oklahoma not knowing then about the oil jackson a great white father with a sword an old duellist a brawling lean fierce mangy durable imperishable old lion who set the wellbeing of the nation above the white house and the health of his new political party above either and above them all set not his wifes honor but the principle that honor must be defended whether it was or not because defended it was whether or not who patented sealed and countersigned the grant with his own hand in his gold tepee in wassi town not knowing about the oil either so that one day the homeless descendants of the dispossessed would ride supine with drink and splendidly comatose above the dusty allotted harborage of their bones in specially built scarletpainted hearses and fireengines these were compsons quentin maclachan son of a glasgow printer orphaned and raised by his mothers people in the perth highlands fled to carolina from culloden moor with a claymore and the tartan he wore by day and slept under by night and little else at eighty having fought once against an english king and lost he would not make that mistake twice and so fled again one night in with his infant grandson and the tartan the claymore had vanished along with his son the grandsons father from one of tarletons regiments on a georgia battlefield about a yea ago into kentucky where a neighbor named boon or boone had already established a settlement charles stuart attainted and proscribed by name and grade in his british regiment left for dead in a georgia swamp by his own retreating army and then by the advancing american one both of which were wrong he still had the claymore even when on his homemade wooden leg he finally overtook his father and son four years later at harrodsburg kentucky just in time to bury the father and enter upon a long period of being a split personality while still trying to be the schoolteacher which he believed he wanted to be until he gave up at last and became the gambler he actually was and which no compson seemed to realize they all were provided the gambit was desperate and the odds long enough succeeded at last in risking not only his neck but the security of his family and the very integrity of the name he would leave behind him by joining the confederation headed by an acquaintance named wilkinson a man of considerable talent and influence and intellect and power in a plot to secede the whole mississippi valley from the united states and join it to spain fled in his turn when the bubble burst as anyone except a compson schoolteacher should have known it would himself unique in being the only one of the plotters who had to flee the country this not from the vengeance and retribution of the government which he had attempted to dismember but from the furious revulsion of his late confederates now frantic for their own safety he was not expelled from the united states he talked himself countryless his expulsion due not to the treason but to his having been so vocal and vociferant in the conduct of it burning each bridge vocally behind him before he had even reached the place to build the next one so that it was no provost marshal nor even a civic agency but his late coplotters themselves who put afoot the movement to evict him from kentucky and the united states and if they had caught him probably from the world too fled by night running true to family tradition with his son and the old claymore and the tartan jason lycurgus who driven perhaps by the compulsion of the flamboyant name given him by the sardonic embittered woodenlegged indomitable father who perhaps still believed with his heart that what he wanted to be was a classicist schoolteacher rode up the natchez trace one day in with a pair of fine pistols and one meagre saddlebag on a small lightwaisted but stronghocked mare which could do the first two furlongs in definitely under the halfminute and the next two in not appreciably more though that was all but it was enough who reached the chickasaw agency at okatoba which in was still called old jefferson and went no further who within six months was the agents clerk and within twelve his partner officially still the clerk though actually halfowner of what was now a considerable store stocked with the mares winnings in races against the horses of ikkemotubbes young men which he compson was always careful to limit to a quarter or at most three furlongs and in the next year it was ikkemotubbe who owned the little mare and compson owned the solid square mile of land which someday would be almost in the center of the town of jefferson forested then and still forested twenty years later though rather a park than a forest by that time with its slavequarters and stables and kitchengardens and the formal lawns and promenades and pavilions laid out by the same architect who built the columned porticoed house furnished by steamboat from france and new orleans and still the square intact mile in with not only the little white village called jefferson beginning to enclose it but an entire white county about to surround it because in a few years now ikkemotubbes descendants and people would be gone those remaining living not as warriors and hunters but as white menas shiftless farmers or here and there the masters of what they too called plantations and the owners of shiftless slaves a little dirtier than the white man a little lazier a little cruelleruntil at last even the wild blood itself would have vanished to be seen only occasionally in the noseshape of a negro on a cottonwagon or a white sawmill hand or trapper or locomotive fireman known as the compson domain then since now it was fit to breed princes statesmen and generals and bishops to avenge the dispossessed compsons from culloden and carolina and kentucky then known as the governors house because sure enough in time it did produce or at least spawn a governorquentin maclachan again after the culloden grandfatherand still known as the old governors even after it had spawned a generalcalled so by predetermined accord and agreement by the whole town and county as though they knew even then and beforehand that the old governor was the last compson who would not fail at everything he touched save longevity or suicidethe brigadier jason lycurgus ii who failed at shiloh in and failed again though not so badly at resaca in who put the first mortgage on the still intact square mile to a new england carpetbagger in after the old town had been burned by the federal general smith and the new little town in time to be populated mainly by the descendants not of compsons but of snopeses had begun to encroach and then nibble at and into it as the failed brigadier spent the next forty years selling fragments of it off to keep up the mortgage on the remainder until one day in he died quietly on an army cot in the hunting and fishing camp in the tallahatchie river bottom where he passed most of the end of his days and even the old governor was forgotten now what was left of the old square mile was now known merely as the compson placethe weedchoked traces of the old ruined lawns and promenades the house which had needed painting too long already the scaling columns of the portico where jason iii bred for a lawyer and indeed he kept an office upstairs above the square where entombed in dusty filingcases some of the oldest names in the countyholston and sutpen grenier and beauchamp and coldfieldfaded year by year among the bottomless labyrinths of chancery and who knows what dream in the perennial heart of his father now completing the third of his three avatarsthe one as son of a brilliant and gallant statesman the second as battleleader of brave and gallant men the third as a sort of privileged pseudodaniel boone robinson crusoe who had not returned to juvenility because actually he had never left itthat that lawyers office might again be the anteroom to the governors mansion and the old splendor sat all day long with a decanter of whiskey and a litter of dogeared horaces and livys and catulluses composing it was said caustic and satiric eulogies on both his dead and his living fellowtownsmen who sold the last of the property except that fragment containing the house and the kitchengarden and the collapsing stables and one servants cabin in which dilseys family lived to a golfclub for the ready money with which his daughter candace could have her fine wedding in april and his son quentin could finish one year at harvard and commit suicide in the following june of already known as the old compson place even while compsons were still living in it on that spring dusk in when the old governors doomed lost nameless seventeenyearold greatgreatgranddaughter robbed her last remaining sane male relative her uncle jason iv of his secret hoard of money and climbed down a rainpipe and ran off with a pitchman in a travelling streetshow and still known as the old compson place long after all traces of compsons were gone from it after the widowed mother died and jason iv no longer needing to fear dilsey now committed his idiot brother benjamin to the state asylum in jackson and sold the house to a countryman who operated it as a boarding house for juries and horse and muletraders and still known as the old compson place even after the boardinghouse and presently the golfcourse too had vanished and the old square mile was even intact again in row after row of small crowded jerrybuilt individuallyowned demiurban bungalows and these quentin iii who loved not his sisters body but some concept of compson honor precariously and he knew well only temporarily supported by the minute fragile membrane of her maidenhead as a miniature replica of all the whole vast globy earth may be poised on the nose of a trained seal who loved not the idea of the incest which he would not commit but some presbyterian concept of its eternal punishment he not god could by that means cast himself and his sister both into hell where he could guard her forever and keep her forevermore intact amid the eternal fires but who loved death above all who loved only death loved and lived in a deliberate and almost perverted anticipation of death as a lover loves and deliberately refrains from the waiting willing friendly tender incredible body ofhis beloved until he can no longer bear not the refraining but the restraint and so flings hurls himself relinquishing drowning committed suicide in cambridge massachusetts june two months after his sisters wedding waiting first to complete the current academic year and so get the full value of his paidinadvance tuition not because he had his old culloden and carolina and kentucky grandfathers in him but because the remaining piece of the old compson mile which had been sold to pay for his sisters wedding and his year at harvard had been the one thing excepting that same sister and the sight of an open fire which his youngest brother born an idiot had loved candace caddy doomed and knew it accepted the doom without either seeking or fleeing it loved her brother despite him loved not only him but loved in him that bitter prophet and inflexible corruptless judge of what he considered the familys honor and its doom as he thought he loved but really hated in her what he considered the frail doomed vessel of its pride and the foul instrument of its disgrace not only this she loved him not only in spite of but because of the fact that he himself was incapable of love accepting the fact that he must value above all not her but the virginity of which she was custodian and on which she placed no value whatever the frail physical stricture which to her was no more than a hangnail would have been knew the brother loved death best of all and was not jealous would and perhaps in the calculation and deliberation of her marriage did have handed him the hypothetical hemlock was two months pregnant with another mans child which regardless of what its sex would be she had already named quentin after the brother whom they both she and her brother knew was already the same as dead when she married an extremely eligible young indianian she and her mother had met while vacationing at french lick the summer before divorced by him married to a minor movingpicture magnate hollywood california divorced by mutual agreement mexico vanished in paris with the german occupation skill beautiful and probably still wealthy too since she did not look within fifteen years of her actual fortyeight and was not heard of again except there was a woman in jefferson the county librarian a mousesized and colored woman who had never married who had passed through the city schools in the same class with candace compson and then spent the rest of her life trying to keep forever amber in its orderly overlapping avatars and jurgen and tom jones out of the hands of the highschool juniors and seniors who could reach them down without even having to tiptoe from the back shelves where she herself would have to stand on a box to hide them one day in after a week of a distraction bordering on disintegration almost during which those entering the library would find her always in the act of hurriedly closing her desk drawer and turning the key in it so that the matrons wives of the bankers and doctors and lawyers some of whom had also been in that old highschool class who came and went in the afternoons with the copies of the forever ambers and the volumes of thorne smith carefully wrapped from view in sheets of memphis and jackson newspapers believed she was on the verge of illness or perhaps even loss of mind she closed and locked the library in the middle of the afternoon and with her handbag clasped tightly under her arm and two feverish spots of determination in her ordinarily colorless cheeks she entered the farmers supply store where jason iv had started as a clerk and where he now owned his own business as a buyer of and dealer in cotton striding on through that gloomy cavern which only men ever entereda cavern cluttered and walled and stalagmitehung with plows and discs and loops of tracechain and singletrees and mulecollars and sidemeat and cheap shoes and horselinament and flour and molasses gloomy because the goods it contained were not shown but hidden rather since those who supplied mississippi farmers or at least negro mississippi farmers for a share of the crop did not wish until that crop was made and its value approximately computable to show them what they could learn to want but only to supply them on specific demand with what they could not help but needand strode on back to jasons particular domain in the rear a railed enclosure cluttered with shelves and pigeonholes bearing spiked dustandlintgathering gin receipts and ledgers and cottonsamples and rank with the blended smell of cheese and kerosene and harnessoil and the tremendous iron stove against which chewed tobacco had been spat for almost a hundred years and up to the long high sloping counter behind which jason stood and not looking again at the overalled men who had quietly stopped talking and even chewing when she entered with a kind of fainting desperation she opened the handbag and fumbled something out of it and laid it open on the counter and stood trembling and breathing rapidly while jason looked down at ita picture a photograph in color clipped obviously from a slick magazinea picture filled with luxury and money and sunlighta cannebière backdrop of mountains and palms and cypresses and the sea an open powerful expensive chromiumrimmed sports car the womans face hatless between a rich scarf and a seal coat ageless and beautiful cold serene and damned beside her a handsome lean man of middleage in the ribbons and tabs of a german staffgeneraland the mousesized mousecolored spinster trembling and aghast at her own temerity staring across it at the childless bachelor in whom ended that long line of men who had had something in them of decency and pride even after they had begun to fail at the integrity and the pride had become mostly vanity and selfpity from the expatriate who had to flee his native land with little else except his life yet who still refused to accept defeat through the man who gambled his life and his good name twice and lost twice and declined to accept that either and the one who with only a clever small quarterhorse for tool avenged his dispossessed father and grandfather and gained a principality and the brilliant and gallant governor and the general who though he failed at leading in battle brave and gallant men at least risked his own life too in the failing to the cultured dipsomaniac who sold the last of his patrimony not to buy drink but to give one of his descendants at least the best chance in life he could think of its caddy the librarian whispered we must save her its cad all right jason said then he began to laugh he stood there laughing above the picture above the cold beautiful face now creased and dogeared from its weeks sojourn in the desk drawer and the handbag and the librarian knew why he was laughing who had not called him anything but mr compson for thirtytwo years now ever since the day in when candace cast off by her husband had brought her infant daughter home and left the child and departed by the next train to return no more and not only the negro cook dilsey but the librarian too divined by simple instinct that jason was somehow using the childs life and its illegitimacy both to blackmail the mother not only into staying away from jefferson for the rest of her life but into appointing him sole unchallengeable trustee of the money she would send for the childs maintenance and had refused to speak to him at all since that day in when the daughter climbed down the rainpipe and ran away with the pitchman jason she cried we must save her jason jasonand still crying it even when he took up the picture between thumb and finger and threw it back across the counter toward her that candace he said dont make me laugh this bitch aint thirty yet the other ones fifty now and the library was still locked all the next day too when at three oclock in the afternoon footsore and spent yet still unflagging and still clasping the handbag tightly under her arm she turned into a neat small yard in the negro residence section of memphis and mounted the steps of the neat small house and rang the bell and the door opened and a black woman of about her own age looked quietly out at her its frony isnt it the librarian said dont you remember memelissa meek from jefferson yes the negress said come in you want to see mama and she entered the room the neat yet cluttered bedroom of an old negro rank with the smell of old people old women old negroes where the old woman herself sat in a rocker beside the hearth where even though it was june a fire smoldereda big woman once in faded clean calico and an immaculate turban wound round her head above the bleared and now apparently almost sightless eyesand put the dogeared clipping into the black hands which like the women of her race were still as supple and delicately shaped as they had been when she was thirty or twenty or even seventeen its caddy the librarian said it is dilsey dilsey what did he say the old negress said and the librarian knew whom she meant by he nor did the librarian marvel not only that the old negress would know that she the librarian would know whom she meant by the he but that the old negress would know at once that she had already shown the picture to jason dont you know what he said she cried when he realised she was in danger he said it was her even if i hadnt even had a picture to show him but as soon as he realised that somebody anybody even just me wanted to save her would try to save her he said it wasnt but it is look at it look at my eyes the old negress said how can i see that picture call frony the librarian cried she will know her but already the old negress was folding the clipping carefully back into its old creases handing it back my eyes aint any good anymore she said i cant see it and that was all at six oclock she fought her way through the crowded bus terminal the bag clutched under one arm and the return half of her roundtrip ticket in the other hand and was swept out onto the roaring platform on the diurnal tide of a few middleaged civilians but mostly soldiers and sailors enroute either to leave or to death and the homeless young women their companions who for two years now had lived from day to day in pullmans and hotels when they were lucky and in daycoaches and busses and stations and lobbies and public restrooms when not pausing only long enough to drop their foals in charity wards or policestations and then move on again and fought her way into the bus smaller than any other there so that her feet touched the floor only occasionally until a shape a man in khaki she couldnt see him at all because she was already crying rose and picked her up bodily and set her into a seat next the window where still crying quietly she could look out upon the fleeing city as it streaked past and then was behind and presently now she would be home again safe in jefferson where life lived too with all its incomprehensible passion and turmoil and grief and fury and despair but here at six oclock you could close the covers on it and even the weightless hand of a child could put it back among its unfeatured kindred on the quiet eternal shelves and turn the key upon it for the whole and dreamless night yes she thought crying quietly that was it she didnt want to see it know whether it was caddy or not because she knows caddy doesnt want to be saved hasnt anything anymore worth being saved for nothing worth being lost that she can lose jason iv the first sane compson since before culloden and a childless bachelor hence the last logical rational contained and even a philosopher in the old stoic tradition thinking nothing whatever of god one way or the other and simply considering the police and so fearing and respecting only the negro woman his sworn enemy since his birth and his mortal one since that day in when she too divined by simple clairvoyance that he was somehow using his infant nieces illegitimacy to blackmail its mother who cooked the food he ate who not only fended off end held his own with compsons but competed and held his own with the snopeses who took over the little town following the turn of the century as the compsons and sartorises and their ilk faded from it no snopes but jason compson himself who as soon as his mother diedthe niece had already climbed down the rainpipe and vanished so dilsey no longer had either of these clubs to hold over him committed his idiot younger brother to the state and vacated the old house first chopping up the vast oncesplendid rooms into what he called apartments and selling the whole thing to a countryman who opened a boardinghouse in it though this was not difficult since to him all the rest of the town and the world and the human race too except himself were compsons inexplicable yet quite predictable in that they were in no sense whatever to be trusted who all the money from the sale of the pasture having gone for his sisters wedding and his brothers course at harvard used his own niggard savings out of his meagre wages as a storeclerk to send himself to a memphis school where he learned to class and grade cotton and so established his own business with which following his dipsomaniac fathers death he assumed the entire burden of the rotting family in the rotting house supporting his idiot brother because of their mother sacrificing what pleasures might have been the right and just due and even the necessity of a thirtyyearold bachelor so that his mothers life might continue as nearly as possible to what it had been this not because he loved her but a sane man always simply because he was afraid of the negro cook whom he could not even force to leave even when he tried to stop paying her weekly wages and who despite all this still managed to save almost three thousand dollars as he reported it on the night his niece stole it in niggard and agonised dimes and quarters and halfdollars which hoard he kept in no bank because to him a banker too was just one more compson but hid in a locked bureau drawer in his bedroom whose bed he made and changed himself since he kept the bedroom door locked all the time save when he was passing through it who following a fumbling abortive attempt by his idiot brother on a passing female child had himself appointed the idiots guardian without letting their mother know and so was able to have the creature castrated before the mother even knew it was out of the house and who following the mothers death in was able to free himself forever not only from the idiot brother and the house but from the negro woman too moving into a pair of offices up a flight of stairs above the supplystore containing his cotton ledgers and samples which he had converted into a bedroom kitchenbath in and out of which on weekends there would be seen a big plain friendly brazenhaired pleasantfaced woman no longer very young in round picture hats and in its season an imitation fur coat the two of them the middleaged cottonbuyer and the woman whom the town called simply his friend from memphis seen at the local picture show on saturday night and on sunday morning mounting the apartment stairs with paper bags from the grocers containing loaves and eggs and oranges and cans of soup domestic uxorious connubial until the late afternoon bus carried her back to memphis he was emancipated now he was free in he would say abe lincoln freed the niggers from the compsons in jason compson freed the compsons from the niggers benjamin born maury after his mothers only brother a handsome flashing swaggering workless bachelor who borrowed money from almost anyone even dilsey although she was a negro explaining to her as he withdrew his hand from his pocket that she was not only in his eyes the same as a member of his sisters family she would be considered a born lady anywhere in any eyes who when at last even his mother realised what he was and insisted weeping that his name must be changed was rechristened benjamin by his brother quentin benjamin our lastborn sold into egypt who loved three things the pasture which was sold to pay for candaces wedding and to send quentin to harvard his sister candace firelight who lost none of them because he could not remember his sister but only the loss of her and firelight was the same bright shape as going to sleep and the pasture was even better sold than before because now he and tp could not only follow timeless along the fence the motions which it did not even matter to him were humanbeings swinging golfsticks tp could lead them to clumps of grass or weeds where there would appear suddenly in tps hand small white spherules which competed with and even conquered what he did not even know was gravity and all the immutable laws when released from the hand toward plank floor or smokehouse wall or concrete sidewalk gelded committed to the state asylum jackson lost nothing then either because as with his sister he remembered not the pasture but only its loss and firelight was still the same bright shape of sleep quentin the last candaces daughter fatherless nine months before her birth nameless at birth and already doomed to be unwed from the instant the dividing egg determined its sex who at seventeen on the one thousand eight hundred ninetyfifth anniversary of the day before the resurrection of our lord swung herself by a rainpipe from the window of the room in which her uncle had locked her at noon to the locked window of his own locked and empty bedroom and broke a pane and entered the window and with the uncles firepoker burst open the locked bureau drawer and took the money it was not either it was almost seven thousand dollars and this was jasons rage the red unbearable fury which on that night and at intervals recurring with little or no diminishment for the next five years made him seriously believe would at some unwarned instant destroy him kill him as instantaneously dead as a bullet or a lightningbolt that although he had been robbed not of a mere petty three thousand dollars but of almost seven thousand he couldnt even tell anybody because he had been robbed of seven thousand dollars instead of just three he could not only never receive justificationhe did not want sympathyfrom other men unlucky enough to have one bitch for a sister and another for a niece he couldnt even go to the police because he had lost four thousand dollars which did not belong to him he couldnt even recover the three thousand which did since those first four thousand dollars were not only the legal property of his niece as a part of the money supplied for her support and maintenance by her mother over the last sixteen years they did not exist at all having been officially recorded as expended and consumed in the annual reports he submitted to the district chancellor as required of him as guardian and trustee by his bondsmen so that he had been robbed not only of his thievings but his savings too and by his own victim he had been robbed not only of the four thousand dollars which he had risked jail to acquire but of the three thousand which he had hoarded at the price of sacrifice and denial almost a nickel and a dime at a time over a period of almost twenty years and this not only by his own victim but by a child who did it at one blow without premeditation or plan not even knowing or even caring how much she would find when she broke the drawer open and now he couldnt even go to the police for help he who had considered the police always never given them any trouble had paid the taxes for years which supported them in parasitic and sadistic idleness not only that he didnt dare pursue the girl himself because he might catch her and she would talk so that his only recourse was a vain dream which kept him tossing and sweating on nights two and three and even four years after the event when he should have forgotten about it of catching her without warning springing on her out of the dark before she had spent all the money and murder her before she had time to open her mouth and climbed down the same rainpipe in the dusk and ran away with the pitchman who was already under sentence for bigamy and so vanished whatever occupation overtook her would have arrived in no chromium mercedes whatever snapshot would have contained no general of staff and that was all these others were not compsons they were black tp who wore on memphiss beale street the fine bright cheap intransigent clothes manufactured specifically for him by the owners of chicago and new york sweatshops frony who married a pullman porter and went to st louis to live and later moved back to memphis to make a home for her mother since dilsey refused to go further than that luster a man aged who was not only capable of the complete care and security of an idiot twice his age and three times his size but could keep him entertained dilsey they endured
