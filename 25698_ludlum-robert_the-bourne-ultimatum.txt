prologue darkness had descended on manassas virginia the countryside alive with nocturnal undercurrents as bourne crept through the woods bordering the estate of general norman swayne startled birds fluttered out of their black recesses crows awoke in the trees and cawed their alarms and then as if calmed by a foraging coconspirator kept silent manassas the key was here the key that would unlock the subterranean door that led to carlos the jackal the assassin who wanted only to destroy david webb and his family webb get away from me david screamed jason bourne in the silence of his mind let me be the killer you cannot be with each scissoring cut into the thick high wire fence he understood the inevitable confirmed by his heavy breathing and the sweat that fell from his hairline no matter how hard he tried to keep his body in reasonable shape he was fifty years of age he could not do with ease what he did thirteen years ago in paris when under orders he had stalked the jackal it was something to think about not dwell upon there were marie and his children nowdavids wife davids childrenand there was nothing he could not do as long as he willed it david webb was disappearing from his psyche only the predator jason bourne would remain he was through he crawled inside and stood up instinctively rapidly checking his equipment with the fingers of both hands weapons an automatic as well as a co dart pistol zeiss ikon binoculars a scabbarded hunting knife they were all the predator needed for he was now behind the lines in enemy territory the enemy that would lead him to carlos medusa the bastard battalion from vietnam the unlogged unsanctioned unacknowledged collection of killers and misfits who roamed the jungles of southeast asia directed by command saigon the original death squads who brought saigon more intelligence input than all the searchanddestroys put together jason bourne had come out of medusa with david webb only a memorya scholar who had another wife other children all slaughtered general norman swayne had been an elite member of command saigon the sole supplier of the old medusa and now there was a new medusa different massive evil incarnate cloaked in contemporary respectability searching out and destroying whole segments of global economies all for the benefit of the few all financed by the profits from a longago bastard battalion unlogged unacknowledgednonhistory this modern medusa was the bridge to carlos the jackal the assassin would find the principals irresistible as clients and both camps would demand the death of jason bourne that had to happen and for it to happen bourne had to learn the secrets concealed within the grounds belonging to general swayne head of all procurements for the pentagon a panicked man with a small tattoo on his inner forearm a medusan without sound or warning a black doberman crashed through the dense foliage its frenzy in full force jason whipped the co pistol from its nylon holster as the salivating attack dog lunged for his stomach its teeth bared he fired into its head the dart took effect in seconds he cradled the animals unconscious body to the ground cut its throat roared jason bourne in silence no countered his other self david webb blame the trainer not the animal get away from me david the cacophony spun out of control as the crowds swelled through the amusement park in the countryside on the outskirts of baltimore the summer night was hot and nearly everywhere faces and necks were drenched with sweat except for those screaming as they plunged over the crests of a roller coaster or shrieking as they plummeted down the narrow twisting gullies of racing water in torpedo sleds the garishly colored manically blinking lights along the midway were joined by the grating sounds of emphatic music metallically erupting out of an excess of loudspeakerscalliopes presto marches prestissimo pitchmen yelled above the din nasally hawking their wares in monotonic harangues while erratic explosions in the sky lit up the darkness sending sprays of myriad fireworks cascading over a small adjacent black lake roman candles bright arcing bursts of fire blinding a row of hitthegong machines drew contorted faces and thick necks bulging with veins as men sought furiously and frequently in frustration to prove their manhood crashing heavy wooden mallets down on the deceitful planks that too often refused to send the little red balls up to the bells across the way others shrieked with menacing enthusiasm as they crashed their dodge em carts into the whirling surrounding vehicles each collision a triumph of superior aggression each combatant a momentary movie star who overcomes all odds against him gunfight at ok corral at in the evening in a conflict that meant nothing farther along was a minor monument to sudden death a shooting gallery that bore little resemblance to the innocent minimumcaliber variety found in state fairs and rural carnivals instead it was a microcosm of the most lethal equipment of modern weaponry there were mockedup versions of mac and uzi machine pistols steelframed missile launchers and antitank bazookas and finally a frightening replica of a flamethrower spewing out harsh straight beams of light through billowing clouds of dark smoke and again there were the perspiring faces continuous beads of sweat rolling over maniacal eyes and down across stretched neckshusbands wives and childrentheir features grotesque twisted out of shape as if each were blasting away at hated enemieswives husbands parents and offspring all were locked in a neverending war without meaningat in the evening in an amusement park whose theme was violence unmitigated and unwarranted man against himself and all his hostilities the worst of course being his fears a slender figure a cane gripped in his right hand limped past a booth where angry excited customers were hurling sharppointed darts into balloons on which were stenciled the faces of public figures as the rubber heads exploded the bursts gave rise to fierce arguments for and against the sagging pinched remnants of political icons and their dartwielding executioners the limping man continued down the midway peering ahead through the maze of strollers as if he were looking for a specific location in a hectic crowded unfamiliar part of town he was dressed casually but neatly in a jacket and sport shirt as though the oppressive heat had no effect on him and the jacket was somehow a requirement his face was the pleasant face of a middleaged man but worn with premature lines and deep shadows under the eyes all of which was the result more of the life he had led than of the accumulated years his name was alexander conklin and he was a retired covert operations officer in the central intelligence agency he was also at this moment apprehensive and consumed with anxiety he did not wish to be in this place at this hour and he could not imagine what catastrophic event had taken place that forced him to be there he approached the pandemonium of the shooting gallery and suddenly gasped stopping all movement his eyes locked on a tall balding man about his own age with a seersucker jacket slung over his shoulder morris panov was walking toward the thunderous counter of the shooting gallery from the opposite direction why what had happened conklin snapped his head around in every direction his eyes darting toward faces and bodies instinctively knowing that he and the psychiatrist were being watched it was too late to stop panov from entering the inner circle of the meeting ground but perhaps not too late to get them both out the retired intelligence officer reached under his jacket for the small beretta automatic that was his constant companion and lurched rapidly forward limping and flailing his cane against the crowd smashing kneecaps and prodding stomachs and breasts and kidneys until the stunned angry strollers erupted in successive cries of shock a near riot in the making he then rushed forward slamming his frail body into the bewildered doctor and shouting into panovs face through the roars of the crowd what the hell are you doing here the same thing i assume you are david or should i say jason thats what the telegram said its a trap there was a piercing scream overriding the surrounding melee both conklin and panov instantly looked over at the shooting gallery only yards away an obese woman with a pinched face had been shot in the throat the crowd went into a frenzy conklin spun around trying to see where the shot came from but the panic was at full pitch he saw nothing but rushing figures he grabbed panov and propelled him through the screaming frantic bodies across the midway and again through the strolling crowds to the base of the massive roller coaster at the end of the park where excited customers were edging toward the booth through the deafening noise my god yelled panov was that meant for one of us maybe maybe not replied the former intelligence officer breathlessly as sirens and whistles were heard in the distance you said it was a trap because we both got a crazy telegram from david using a name he hasnt used in five yearsjason bourne and if im not mistaken your message also said that under no condition should we call his house thats right its a trap you move better than i do mo so move those legs of yours get out of hererun like a son of a bitch and find a telephone a pay phone nothing traceable what call his house tell david to pack up marie and the kids and get out of there what someone found us doctor someone looking for jason bournewhos been looking for him for years and wont stop until hes got him in his gun sight you were in charge of davids messedup head and i pulled every rotten string in washington to get him and marie out of hong kong alive the rules were broken and we were found mo you and me the only officially recorded connections to jason bourne address and occupation unknown do you know what youre saying alex youre goddamned right i do its carlos carlos the jackal get out of here doctor reach your former patient and tell him to disappear then whats he to do i dont have many friends certainly no one i trust but you do give him the name of somebodysay one of your medical buddies who gets urgent calls from his patients the way i used to call you tell david to reach him or her when hes secure give him a code a code jesus mo use your head an alias a jones or a smith theyre rather common names then schicklgruber or moskowitz whatever you like just tell him to let us know where he is i understand now get out of here and dont go home take a room at the brookshire in baltimore under the name ofmorris phillip morris ill meet you there later what are you going to do something i hate without my cane im buying a ticket for this fucking roller coaster nobodyll look for a cripple on one of these things it scares the hell out of me but its a logical exit even if i have to stay on the damn thing all night now get out of here hurry the station wagon raced south down a backcountry road through the hills of new hampshire toward the massachusetts border the driver a longframed man his sharpfeatured face intense the muscles of his jaw pulsating his clear lightblue eyes furious beside him sat his strikingly attractive wife the reddish glow of her auburn hair heightened by the dashboard lights in her arms was an infant a baby girl of eight months in the first backseat was another child a blondhaired boy of five asleep under a blanket a portable guardrail protecting him from sudden stops the father was david webb professor of oriental studies but once part of the notorious unspokenof medusa twice the legend that was jason bourneassassin we knew it had to happen said marie st jacques webb canadian by birth economist by profession savior of david webb by accident it was merely a question of time its crazy david whispered so as not to wake the children his intensity in no way diminished by his whisper everythings buried maximum archive security and all the rest of that crap how did anyone find alex and mo we dont know but alex will start looking theres no one better than alex you said that yourself hes marked nowhes a dead man interrupted webb grimly thats premature david hes the best there ever was those were your words the only time he wasnt was thirteen years ago in paris because you were better no because i didnt know who i was and he was operating on prior data that i didnt know a damn thing about he assumed it was me out there but i didnt know me so i couldnt act according to his script hes still the best he saved both our lives in hong kong then youre saying what im saying arent you were in good hands alexs yes not mos that poor beautiful man is dead theyll take him and break him hed go to his grave before giving anyone information about us he wont have a choice theyll shoot him up to the moon with amytals and his whole life will be on tape then theyll kill him and come after me after us which is why you and the kids are heading south way south the caribbean ill send them darling not me will you stop it we agreed when jamie was born its why we got the place down there why we damn near bought your kid brothers soul to look after it for us also hes done pretty damn well we now own half interest in a flourishing inn down a dirt road on an island nobody ever heard of until that canadian hustler landed therein a seaplane johnny was always the aggressive type dad once said he could sell a brokendown heifer as a prime steer and no one would check the parts the point is he loves you and the kids im also counting on that wild mans never mind i trust johnny while youre trusting so much in my younger brother dont trust your sense of direction you just passed the turn to the cabin goddamn it cried webb braking the car and swerving around tomorrow you and jamie and alison are heading out of logan airport to the island well discuss it david theres nothing to discuss webb breathed deeply steadily imposing a strange control ive been here before he said quietly marie looked at her husband his suddenly passive face outlined in the dim wash of the dashboard lights what she saw frightened her far more than the specter of the jackal she was not looking at david webb the softspoken scholar she was staring at a man they both thought had disappeared from their lives forever alexander conklin gripped his cane as he limped into the conference room at the central intelligence agency in langley virginia he stood facing a long impressive table large enough to seat thirty people but instead there were only three the man at the head the grayhaired dci director of central intelligence neither he nor his two highestranking deputy directors appeared pleased to see conklin the greetings were perfunctory and rather than taking his obviously assigned seat next to the cia official on the dcis left conklin pulled out the chair at the far end of the table sat down and with a sharp noise slapped his cane against the edge now that weve said hello can we cut the crap gentlemen thats hardly a courteous or an amiable way to begin mr conklin observed the director neither courtesy nor amiability is on my mind just now sir i just want to know why airtight four zero regulations were ignored and maximumclassified information was released that endangers a number of lives including mine thats outrageous alex interrupted one of the two associates totally inaccurate added the other it couldnt happen and you know it i dont know it and it did happen and ill tell you whats outrageously accurate said conklin angrily a mans out there with a wife and two children a man this country and a large part of the world owe more to than anyone could ever repay and hes running hiding frightened out of his mind that he and his family are targets we gave that man our word all of us that no part of the official record would ever see the light of day until it was confirmed beyond doubt that rich ramirez sanchez also known as carlos the jackal was dead all right ive heard the same rumors you have probably from the same or much better sources that the jackal was killed here or executed there but no onerepeat no onehas come forward with indisputable proof yet a part of that file was leaked a very vital part and it concerns me deeply because my name is there mine and dr morris panov the chief psychiatrist of record we were the onlyrepeat onlytwo individuals acknowledged to have been close associates of the unknown man who assumed the name of jason bourne considered in more sectors than we can count to be the rival of carlos in the killing game but that information is buried in the vaults here in langley how did it get out according to the rules if anyone wants any part of that recordfrom the white house to the state department to the holy joint chiefshe has to go through the offices of the director and his chief analysts right here at langley they have to be briefed on all the details of the request and even if theyre satisfied as to the legitimacy theres a final step me before a release is signed im to be contacted and in the event im not around any longer dr panov is to be reached either one of us legally empowered to turn the request down flat thats the way it is gentlemen and no one knows the rules better than i do because im the one who wrote themagain right here at langley because this was the place i knew best after twentyeight years in this corkscrew business it was my final contributionwith the full authority of the president of the united states and the consent of congress through the select committees on intelligence in the house and the senate thats heavy artillery mr conklin commented the grayhaired director sitting motionless his voice flat neutral there were heavy reasons for pulling out the cannons so i gather one of the sixteeninchers reached me youre damned right he did now theres the question of accountability i want to know how that information surfaced and most important who got it both deputy directors began talking at once as angrily as alex but they were stopped by the dci who touched their arms a pipe in one hand a lighter in the other slow down and back up mr conklin said the director gently lighting his pipe its obvious that you know my two associates but you and i never met have we no i resigned four and a half years ago and you were appointed a year after that like many othersquite justifiably i thinkdid you consider me a crony appointment you obviously were but i had no trouble with that you seemed qualified as far as i could tell you were an apolitical annapolis admiral who ran naval intelligence and who just happened to work with an fmf marine colonel during the vietnam war who became president others were passed over but that happens no sweat thank you but do you have any sweat with my two deputy directors its history but i cant say either one of them was considered the best friend an agent in the field ever had they were analysts not field men isnt that a natural aversion a conventional hostility of course it is they analyzed situations from thousands of miles away with computers we didnt know who programmed and with data we hadnt passed on youre damned right its a natural aversion we dealt with human quotients they didnt they dealt with little green letters on a computer screen and made decisions they frequently shouldnt have made because people like you had to be controlled interjected the deputy on the directors right how many times even today do men and women like you lack the full picture the total strategy and not just your part of it then we should be given a fuller picture going in or at least an overview so we can try to figure out what makes sense and what doesnt where does an overview stop alex asked the deputy on the dcis left at what point do we say we cant reveal this for everyones benefit i dont know youre the analysts im not on a casebycase basis i suppose but certainly with better communication than i ever got when i was in the field wait a minute im not the issue you are alex stared at the director very smooth sir but im not buying a change of subject im here to find out who got what and how if youd rather ill take my credentials over to the white house or up to the hill and watch a few heads roll i want answers i want to know what to do i wasnt trying to change the subject mr conklin only to divert it momentarily to make a point you obviously objected to the methods and the compromises employed in the past by my colleagues but did either of these men ever mislead you lie to you alex looked briefly at the two deputy directors only when they had to lie to me which had nothing to do with field operations thats a strange comment if they havent told you they should have five years ago i was an alcoholicim still an alcoholic but i dont drink anymore i was riding out the time to my pension so nobody told me anything and they damn well shouldnt have for your enlightenment all my colleagues said to me was that you had been ill that you hadnt been functioning at the level of your past accomplishments until the end of your service again conklin studied both deputies nodding to both as he spoke thanks casset and you too valentino but you didnt have to do that i was a drunk and it shouldnt be a secret whether its me or anybody else thats the dumbest thing you can do around here from what we heard about hong kong you did a hell of a job alex said the man named casset softly we didnt want to detract from that youve been a pain in the ass for longer than i care to remember added valentino but we couldnt let you hang out as an accident of booze forget it lets get back to jason bourne thats why im here why you damn well had to see me thats also why i momentarily sidetracked us mr conklin you have professional differences with my deputies but i gather you dont question their integrity others yes not casset or val as far as i was concerned they did their jobs and i did mine it was the system that was fouled upit was buried in fog but this isnt today isnt the rules are clearcut and absolute and since i wasnt reached they were broken and i was misled in a very real sense lied to i repeat how did it happen and who got the information thats all i wanted to hear said the director picking up the telephone on the table please call mr desole down the hall and ask him to come to the conference room the dci hung up and turned to conklin i assume youre aware of steven desole desole the mute mole alex nodded i beg your pardon its an old joke around here explained casset to the director steve knows where the bodies are buried but when the time comes he wont even tell god unless he shows him a four zero clearance i assume that means the three of you especially mr conklin consider mr desole a thorough professional ill answer that alex said hell tell you anything you have to know but no more than that also he wont lie hell keep his mouth shut or tell you he cant tell you but he wont lie to you thats another thing i wanted to hear there was a brief knock on the door and the dci called out for the visitor to enter a mediumsized slightly overweight man with wide eyes magnified behind steelrimmed glasses walked into the room closing the door behind him his casual second glance at the table revealed alexander conklin to him he was obviously startled by the sight of the retired intelligence officer instantly he changed his reaction to one of pleasant surprise crossing to conklins chair his hand extended good to see you old boy its been two or three years now hasnt it more like four steve replied alex shaking hands hows the analysts analyst and keeper of the keys not much to analyze or to lock up these days the white house is a sieve and the congress isnt much better i should get half pay but dont tell anyone we still keep some things to ourselves dont we interrupted the dci smiling at least from past operations perhaps you earned double your pay then oh i suspect i did desole nodded his head humorously as he released conklins hand however the days of archive custodians and armed transfers to underground warehouses are over today its all computerized photo scans entered by machines from on high i dont get to go on those wonderful trips any longer with military escorts pretending ill be deliciously attacked by mata hari i havent had a briefcase chained to my wrist since i cant remember when a lot safer that way said alex but very little i can tell my grandchildren about old boy what did you do as a big spy grandpa actually in my last years a great many crossword puzzles young man be careful mr desole said the dci chuckling i shouldnt care to put in a recommendation to cut your pay on the other hand i couldnt because i dont believe you for an instant neither do i conklin spoke quietly angrily this is a setup he added staring at the overweight analyst thats quite a statement alex countered desole would you mind explaining it you know why im here dont you i didnt know you were here oh i see it just happened to be convenient for you to be down the hall and ready to come in here my office is down the hall quite far down i might add conklin looked at the dci again very smooth sir bring in three people you figure ive had no major runins with outside of the system itself three men youve determined i basically trust so ill believe whatevers said thats fundamentally accurate mr conklin because what youll hear is the truth sit down mr desole perhaps at this end of the table so that our former colleague can study us as we explain to him i understand its a technique favored by field officers i havent a damn thing to explain said the analyst as he headed for the chair next to casset but in light of our former colleagues somewhat gross remarks id like to study him are you well alex hes well answered the deputy director named valentino hes snarling at the wrong shadows but hes well that information couldnt have surfaced without the consent and cooperation of the people in this room what information asked desole looking at the dci suddenly widening his large eyes behind his glasses oh the maxclassified thing you asked me about this morning the director nodded then looked at conklin lets go back to this morning seven hours ago shortly after nine oclock i received a call from edward mcallister formerly of the state department and currently chairman of the national security agency im told mr mcallister was with you in hong kong mr conklin is that correct mr mcallister was with us agreed alex flatly he flew undercover with jason bourne to macao where he was shot up so badly he damn near died hes an intellectual oddball and one of the bravest men ive ever met he said nothing about the circumstances only that he was there and i was to shred my calendar if need be but to consider our meeting with you as priority red heavy artillery mr conklin to repeat there are heavy reasons for the cannons apparently mr mcallister gave me the precise maximumclassified codes that would clarify the status of the file youre talking aboutthe record of the hong kong operation i in turn gave the information to mr desole so ill let him tell you what he learned it hasnt been touched alex said desole quietly his eyes leveled on conklin as of ninethirty this morning its been in a black hole for four years five months twentyone days eleven hours and fortythree minutes without penetration and theres a very good reason why that status is pure but i have no idea whether youre aware of it or not where that file is concerned im aware of everything perhaps perhaps not said desole gently you were known to have a problem and dr panov is not that experienced where security matters are concerned what the hell are you driving at a third name was added to the clearance procedures for that official record on hong kong edward newington mcallister by his own insistence and with both presidential and congressional authority he made sure of it oh my god said conklin softly hesitantly when i called him last night from baltimore he said it was impossible then he said i had to understand for myself so hed set up the conference jesus what happened id say wed have to look elsewhere said the dci but before we do that mr conklin you have to make a decision you see none of us at this table knows whats in that maximum classified file weve talked of course and as mr casset said we understood that you did a hell of a job in hong kong but we dont know what that job was we heard the rumors out of our far east stations which frankly most of us believed were exaggerated in the spreading and paramount among them was your name and that of the assassin jason bourne the scuttlebutt then was that you were responsible for the capture and execution of the killer we knew as bourne yet a few moments ago in your anger you used the phrase the unknown man who assumed the name of jason bourne stating that he was alive and in hiding in terms of specifics were at a lossat least i am god knows you didnt pull the record out no answered desole that was my decision as you may or may not know every invasion of a maximumclassified file is automatically marked with the date and hour of penetration since the director informed me that there was a large security agency flap over an illegal entry i decided to leave well enough alone not penetrated in nearly five years therefore not read or even known about and consequently not given to the evil people whoever they are you were covering your ass right down to the last square inch of flesh most assuredly alex that data has a white house flag on it things are relatively stable around here now and it serves no one to ruffle feathers in the oval office theres a new man at that desk but the former president is still very much alive and opinionated hed be consulted so why risk trouble conklin studied each face and spoke quietly then you really dont know the story do you its the truth alex said deputy director casset nothing but you pain agreed valentino permitting himself a slight smile my word on it added steven desole his clear wide eyes rigid on conklin and if you want our help we should know something besides contradictory rumors continued the director leaning back in his chair i dont know if we can help but i do know theres little we can do so completely in the dark again alex looked at each man the lines in his pained face more pronounced than ever as if the decision was momentarily too agonizing for him i wont tell you his name because ive given my wordmaybe later not now and it cant be found in the record its not there either its a coveri gave my word on that too the rest ill tell you because i do want your help and i want that record to remain in its black hole where do i begin with this meeting perhaps suggested the director what prompted it all right thatll be quick conklin stared pensively at the surface of the table absently gripping his cane then raised his eyes a woman was killed last night at an amusement park outside baltimore i read about it in the post this morning interrupted desole nodding his full cheeks jiggling good lord were you so did i broke in casset his steady brown eyes on alex it happened in front of a shooting gallery they closed the guns down i saw the article and figured it was some kind of terrible accident valentino shook his head slowly i didnt actually read it i was given my usual thick sheaf of scissored newspaper stories which is enough journalism for anyone in the morning said the director i dont remember any such article were you involved old boy if i wasnt it was a horrible waste of life i should say if we werent involved we casset frowned in alarm morris panov and i received identical telegrams from jason bourne asking us to be at the amusement park at ninethirty last night it was urgent and we were to meet him in front of the shooting gallery but we were not under any condition to call his house or anyone else we both independently assumed that he didnt want to alarm his wife that he had something to tell us individually that he didnt want her to know we arrived at the same time but i saw panov first and figured it was a bad scene from any point of view especially bournes we should have reached each other and talked before going up there instead we had been told not to it smelled so i did my best to get us out of there fast the only way seemed to be a diversion you stampeded then said casset making a statement it was the only thing i could think of and one of the few things this goddamned cane is good for other than keeping me upright i cracked every shin and kneecap i could see and lanced a few stomachs and tits we got out of the circle but that poor woman was killed how did you figure itdo you figure it asked valentino i just dont know val it was a trap no question about that but what kind of trap if what i thought then and what i think now are correct how could a hired marksman miss at that distance the shot came from my upper leftnot that i necessarily heard itbut the position of the woman and the blood all over her throat indicated that she had turned and caught the bullet in her body swing it couldnt have come from the gallery those guns are chained and the massive hemorrhage in her neck was caused by a far larger caliber than any of the toys there if the killer wanted to take out either mo panov or me his telescopic cross hairs wouldnt be that far off the mark not if my thinking is right right mr conklin interjected the dci meaning the assassin carlos the jackal carlos exclaimed desole what in heavens name has the jackal to do with a killing in baltimore jason bourne answered casset yes i gather that but this is all terribly confusing bourne was a scum hit man out of asia who moved to europe to challenge carlos and lost as the director just said he went back to the far east and was killed four or five years ago yet alex talks as if hes still alive that he and someone named panov got telegrams from him what in gods name does a dead scumball and the worlds most elusive assassin have to do with last night you werent here a few minutes ago steve again casset answered quietly apparently they had a lot to do with last night i beg your pardon i think you should start at the beginning mr conklin said the director who is jason bourne as the world knew him a man who never existed replied the former intelligence officer the original jason bourne was garbage a paranoid drifter from tasmania who found his way into the vietnam war as part of an operation no one wants to acknowledge even today it was a collection of killers misfits smugglers and thieves mostly escaped criminals many under death sentences but they knew every inch of southeast asia and operated behind enemy linesfunded by us medusa whispered steven desole its all buried they were animals killing wantonly without reason or authorization and stealing millions savages most not all said conklin but the original bourne fitted every rotten profile you could come up with including the betrayal of his own men the leader of a particularly hazardous missionhazardous hell it was suicidalfound bourne radioing their position to the north vietnamese he executed him on the spot shoving the body into a swamp to rot in the jungles of tam quan jason bourne disappeared from the face of the earth he obviously reappeared mr conklin observed the director leaning forward on the table in another body agreed alex nodding for another purpose the man who executed bourne in tam quan took his name and agreed to be trained for an operation that we called treadstone seventyone after a building on new yorks seventyfirst street where he went through a brutal indoctrination program it was a brilliant strategy on paper but ultimately failed because of something no one could predict even consider after nearly three years of living the role of the worlds second most lethal assassin and moving into europeas steve accurately describedto challenge the jackal in his own territory our man was wounded and lost his memory he was found half dead in the mediterranean and brought by a fisherman to the island of port noir he had no idea who he was or what he wasonly that he was a master of various martial arts spoke a couple of oriental languages and was obviously an extremely welleducated man with the help of a british doctor an alcoholic banished to port noir our man started to piece his lifehis identityback together from fragments both mental and physical it was a hell of a journey and we who had mounted the operation who invented the myth were no help to him not knowing what had happened we thought he had turned had actually become the mythical assassin wed created to trap carlos i myself tried to kill him in paris and when he might have blown my head off he couldnt do it he finally made his way back to us only through the extraordinary talents of a canadian woman he met in zurich and who is now his wife that lady had more guts and brains than any woman ive ever met now she and her husband and their two kids are back in the nightmare running for their lives aristocratic mouth agape his pipe in midair in front of his chest the director spoke do you mean to sit there and tell us that the assassin we knew as jason bourne was an invention that he wasnt the killer we all presumed he was he killed when he had to kill in order to survive but he was no assassin we created the myth as the ultimate challenge to carlos to draw the jackal out good christ exclaimed casset how massive disinformation throughout the far east whenever a killing of consequence took place whether in tokyo or hong kong macao or koreawhereverbourne was flown there and took the credit planting evidence taunting the authorities until he became a legend for three years our man lived in a world of filthdrugs warlords crime tunneling his way in with only one objective get to europe and bait carlos threaten his contracts force the jackal out into the open if only for a moment just long enough to put a bullet in his head the silence around the table was electric desole broke it his voice barely above a whisper what kind of man would accept an assignment like that conklin looked at the analyst and answered in a monotone a man who felt there wasnt much left to live for someone who had a death wish perhaps a decent human being who was driven into an outfit like medusa out of hatred and frustration the former intelligence officer stopped his anguish was apparent come on alex said valentino softly you cant leave us with that no of course not conklin blinked several times adjusting to the present i was thinking how horrible it must be for him nowthe memories what he can remember theres a lousy parallel i hadnt considered the wife the kids whats the parallel asked casset hunched forward staring at alex years ago during vietnam our man was a young foreign service officer stationed in phnom penh a scholar married to a thai woman hed met here in graduate school they had two children and lived on the banks of a river one morning while the wife and kids were swimming a stray jet from hanoi strafed the area killing the three of them our man went crazy he chucked everything and made his way to saigon and into medusa all he wanted to do was kill he became delta oneno names were ever used in medusaand he was considered the most effective guerrilla leader in the war as often as not fighting command saigon over orders as he did the enemy with death squads still he obviously supported the war observed valentino outside of having no use for saigon and the arvn i dont think he gave a damn one way or another he had his own private war and it was way behind enemy lines the nearer hanoi the better i think in his mind he kept looking for the pilot who had killed his family thats the parallel years ago there was a wife and two kids and they were butchered in front of his eyes now theres another wife and two children and the jackal is closing in hunting him down thats got to be driving him close to the edge goddamn it the four men at the opposite end of the table looked briefly at one another and let conklins sudden emotion pass again the director spoke again gently considering the time span he began the operation mounted to trap carlos had to have taken place well over a decade ago yet the events in hong kong were much more recent were they related without giving us a name or names at this juncture what do you feel you can tell us about hong kong alex gripped his cane and held it firmly his knuckles white as he replied hong kong was both the filthiest black operation ever conceived in this town and without question the most extraordinary ive ever heard of and to my profound relief we here at langley had nothing to do with the initial strategy the plaudits can go to hell i came in late and what i found turned my stomach it sickened mcallister too for he was in at the beginning it was why he was willing to risk his life why he damn near ended up a corpse across the chinese border in macao his intellectualized morality couldnt let a decent man be killed for the strategy thats a hell of an indictment offered casset what happened our own people arranged to have bournes wife kidnapped the woman who had led that man without a memory back to us they left a trail that forced him to go after herto hong kong jesus why cried valentino the strategy it was perfect and it was also abominable i told you the assassin called jason bourne had become a legend in asia he disappeared in europe but he was no less a legend for that in the far east then suddenly out of nowhere a new enterprising killer operating out of macao revived that legend he took the name of jason bourne and the killings for hire started all over again a week rarely went by often only days when another hit was made the same evidence planted the same taunting of the police a false bourne was back in business and he had studied every trick of the original so who better to track him down than the one who invented those tricksthe original your original interjected the director and what better way to force the original bourne into the hunt than by taking his wife from him but why why was washington so consumed there were no longer any ties to us there was something much worse among the new jason bournes clients was a madman in beijing a kuomintang traitor in the government who was about to turn the far east into a firestorm he was determined to destroy the sinobritish hong kong accords shutting down the colony leaving the whole territory in chaos war said casset quietly beijing would march into hong kong and take over wed all have to choose sides war in the nuclear age added the director how far had it all progressed mr conklin a vice premier of the peoples republic was killed in a private massacre in kowloon the impostor left his calling card jason bourne good god he had to be stopped exploded the dci gripping his pipe he was said alex releasing his cane by the only man who could hunt him down our jason bourne thats all ill tell you for now except to repeat that that man is back here with his wife and children and carlos is closing in the jackal wont rest until he knows the only person alive who can identify him is dead so call in every debt thats owed to us in paris london rome madrid especially paris someones got to know something where is carlos now who are his points over here hes got eyes here in washington and whoever they are they found panov and me the former field officer again absently gripped his cane staring at the window dont you see he added quietly as if talking to himself we cant let it happen oh my god we cant let it happen once more the emotional moment passed in silence as the men of the central intelligence agency exchanged glances it was as though a consensus had been reached among them without a word being said three pairs of eyes fell on casset he nodded accepting his selection as the one closest to conklin and spoke alex i agree that everything points to carlos but before we start spinning our wheels in europe we have to be sure we cant afford a false alarm because wed be handing the jackal a grail hed have to go after showing him how vulnerable we were where jason bourne is concerned from what youve told us carlos would pick up on a longdormant operation known as treadstone seventyone if only because none of our agents or subagents has been in his personal neighborhood for over a decade the retired conklin studied charles cassets pensive sharpfeatured face what youre saying is that if im wrong and it isnt the jackal were ripping open a thirteenyearold wound and presenting him with an irresistible kill i guess thats what im saying and i guess thats pretty good thinking charlie im operating on externals arent i theyre triggering instincts but theyre still externals id trust those instincts of yours far more than i would any polygraph so would i interrupted valentino you saved our personnel in five or six sector crises when all the indicators said you were wrong however charlies got a legitimate query suppose it isnt carlos we not only send the wrong message to europe but more important weve wasted time so stay out of europe mused alex softly again as if to himself at least for now go after the bastards here draw them out pull them in and break them im the target so let them come after me that would entail far looser protection than i envisage for you and dr panov mr conklin said the director firmly then disenvisage sir alex looked back and forth at casset and valentino suddenly raising his voice we can do it if you two will listen to me and let me mount it were in a gray area stated casset this thing may be foreignoriented but its domestic turf the bureau should be brought in no way exclaimed conklin nobodys brought in outside of this room come on alex said valentino kindly slowly shaking his head youre retired you cant give orders here good fine shouted conklin awkwardly getting out of the chair and supporting himself on his cane next stop the white house to a certain chairman of the nsa named mcallister sit down said the dci firmly im retired you cant give orders to me i wouldnt dream of it im simply concerned for your life as i read the scenario what youre suggesting is based on the questionable supposition that whoever fired at you last night in tended to miss not caring whom he hit only determined to take you alive during the subsequent chaos thats a couple of leaps based on a couple of dozen operations ive been involved with both here and at the department of the navy and in places you couldnt pronounce or know anything about the directors elbows were planted on the arms of his chair his voice suddenly harsh commanding for your information conklin i didnt suddenly bloom as a goldbraided admiral running naval intelligence i was in the seals for a few years and made runs off submarines into kaesong and later into haiphong harbor i knew a number of those medusa pricks and i cant think of one that i didnt want to put a bullet in his head now you tell me there was one and he became your jason bourne and youll break your balls or bust open your heart to see that he stays alive and well and out of the jackals gun sights so lets cut the crap alex do you want to work with me or not conklin slowly sank back in his chair a smile gradually emerging on his lips i told you i had no sweat with your appointment sir it was just intuition but now i know why you were a field man ill work with you good fine said the director well work up a controlled surveillance and hope to christ your theory that they want you alive is correct because theres no way we can cover every window or every rooftop youd better understand the risk i do and since two chunks of bait are better than one in a tank of piranhas i want to talk to mo panov you cant ask him to be a part of this countered casset hes not one of us alex why should he because he is one of us and id better ask him if i didnt hed give me a flu shot filled with strychnine you see he was in hong kong toofor reasons not much different from mine years ago i tried to kill my closest friend in paris because id made a terrible mistake believing my friend had turned when the truth was that he had lost his memory only days later morris panov one of the leading psychiatrists in the country a doctor who cant stand the chickenshit psychobabble so popular these days was presented with a hypothetical psychiatric profile that required his immediate reaction it described a rogue deepcover agent a walking time bomb with a thousand secrets in his head who had gone over the edge on the basis of mos onthespot evaluation of that hypothetical profilewhich he hours later suspected was no more hypothetical than campbells soupan innocent amnesiac was nearly blown away in a government ambush on new yorks seventyfirst street when what was left of that man survived panov demanded to be assigned as his only head doctor hes never forgiven himself if any of you were he what would you do if i didnt talk to you about what were talking about right now tell you its a flu shot and pump you full of strychnine old boy concluded desole nodding where is panov now asked casset at the brookshire hotel in baltimore under the name of morris phillip morris he called off his appointments todayhe has the flu then lets go to work said the dci pulling a yellow legal pad in front of him incidentally alex a competent field man doesnt concern himself with rank and wont trust a man who cant convincingly call him by his first name as you well know my name is holland and my first name is peter from here on were alex and peter got it ive got itpeter you must have been one son of a bitch in the seals insofar as im heregeographically not in this chairit can be assumed i was competent a field man mumbled conklin in approval also since weve dropped the diplomatic drivel expected of someone in this job you should understand that i was a hardnosed son of a bitch i want pro input here alex not emotional output is that clear i dont operate any other way peter a commitment may be based on emotions and theres nothing wrong with that but the execution of a strategy is icecold i was never in the seals you hardnosed son of a bitch but im also geographically here limp and all and that presumes im also competent holland grinned it was a smile of youth belied by streaked gray hair the grin of a professional momentarily freed of executive concerns so as to return to the world he knew best we may even get along said the dci and then as if to drop the last vestige of his directorial image he placed his pipe on the table reached into his pocket for a pack of cigarettes popped one up to his mouth and snapped his lighter as he began to write on the legal pad to hell with the bureau he continued well use only our men and well check every one out under a fast microscope charles casset the lean bright heir apparent of the cias directorship sat back in his chair and sighed why do i have the idea that im going to have to ride herd on both you gentlemen because youre an analyst at heart charlie answered holland the object of controlled surveillance is to expose those who shadow others so as to establish their identities or take them into custody whichever suits the strategy the aim in the present case was to trap the agents of the jackal who had lured conklin and panov to the amusement park in baltimore working through the night and most of the following day the men of the central intelligence agency formed a detail of eight experienced field personnel defined and redefined the specific routes that conklin and panov were to take both individually and together for the next twentyfour hoursthese routes covered by the armed professionals in swift progressive relaysand finally to design an irresistible rendezvous unique in terms of time and location the early morning hours at the smithsonian institution it was the dionaea muscipula the venus flytrap conklin stood in the narrow dimly lit lobby of his apartment house and looked at his watch squinting to read the dial it was precisely in the morning he opened the heavy door and limped out into the dark street which was devoid of any signs of life according to their plan he turned left maintaining the pace agreed upon he was to arrive at the comer as close to as possible suddenly he was alarmed in a shadowed doorway on his right was the figure of a man unobtrusively alex reached under his jacket for his beretta automatic there was nothing in the strategy that called for someone to be in a doorway on this section of the street then as suddenly as he had been alarmed he relaxed feeling equal parts of guilt and relief at what he understood the figure in shadows was an indigent an old man in wornout clothes one of the homeless in a land of so much plenty alex kept going he reached the corner and heard the low single click of two fingers snapped apart he crossed the avenue and proceeded down the pavement passing an alleyway the alleyway another figure another old man in disheveled clothing moving slowly out into the street and then back into the alley another derelict protecting his concrete cave at any other time conklin might have approached the unfortunate and given him a few dollars but not now he had a long way to go and a schedule to keep morris panov approached the intersection still bothered by the curious telephone conversation he had had ten minutes ago still trying to recall each segment of the plan he was to follow afraid to look at his watch to see if he had reached a specific place within a specific time spanhe had been told not to look at his watch in the street and why couldnt they say at approximately such and such rather than the somewhat unnerving term time span as if a military invasion of washington were imminent regardless he kept walking crossing the streets he was told to cross hoping some unseen clock kept him relatively in tune with the goddamned time spans that had been determined by his striding back and forth between two pegs on some lawn behind a garden apartment in vienna virginia he would do anything for david webbgood christ anything but this was insane yet of course it wasnt they would not ask him to do what he was doing if it were what was that a face in shadows peering at him just like the other two this one hunched over on a curb raising winesoaked eyes up at him old menweatherbeaten old old men who could barely movestaring at him now he was allowing his imagination to run away with himthe cities were filled with the homeless with perfectly harmless people whose psychoses or poverty drove them into the streets as much as he would like to help them there was nothing he could do but professionally badger an unresponsive washington there was another in an indented space between two storefronts barricaded by iron gateshe too was watching him stop it youre being irrational or was he of course he was go on keep to the schedule thats what youre supposed to do good god theres another across the street keep going the vast moonlit grounds of the smithsonian dwarfed the two figures as they converged from intersecting paths joining each other and proceeding to a bench conklin lowered himself with the aid of his cane while mo panov looked around nervously listening as if he expected the unexpected it was in the predawn morning the only noises the subdued rattle of crickets and mild summer breezes through the trees guardedly panov sat down anything happen on the way here asked conklin im not sure replied the psychiatrist im as lost as i was in hong kong except that over there we knew where we were going whom we expected to meet you people are crazy youre contradicting yourself mo said alex smiling you told me i was cured oh that that was merely obsessive manicdepression bordering on dementia praecox this is nuts its nearly four oclock in the morning people who arent nuts do not play games at four oclock in the morning alex watched panov in the dim wash of a distant smithsonian floodlight that illuminated the massive stone structure you said you werent sure what does that mean im almost embarrassed to sayive told too many patients that they invent uncomfortable images to rationalize their panic justify their fears what the hell does that mean its a form of transference come on mo interrupted conklin what bothered you what did you see figures some bent over walking slowly awkwardlynot like you alex incapacitated not by injuries but by age worn out and old and staying in the darkness of storefronts and side streets it happened four or five times between my apartment house and here twice i almost stopped and called out for one of your men and then i thought to myself my god doctor youre overreacting mistaking a few pathetic homeless people for what theyre not seeing things that arent there right on conklin whispered emphatically you saw exactly what was there mo because i saw the same the same kind of old people you saw and they were pathetic mostly in beat up clothes and who moved slower than i move what does it mean what do they mean who are they footsteps slow hesitant and through the shadows of the deserted path walked two short menold men at first glance they indeed appeared to be part of the swelling army of indigent homeless yet there was something different about them a sense of purpose perhaps they stopped nearly twenty feet away from the bench their faces in darkness the old man on the left spoke his voice thin his accent strange it is an odd hour and an unusual place for two such welldressed gentlemen to meet is it fair for you to occupy a place of rest that should be for others not so well off as you there are a number of unoccupied benches said alex pleasantly is this one reserved there are no reserved seats here replied the second old man his english clear but not native to him but why are you here whats it to you asked conklin this is a private meeting and none of your business business at this hour and in this place the first aged intruder spoke while looking around i repeat repeated alex its none of your business and i really think you should leave us alone business is business intoned the second old man what in gods name is he talking about whispered the bewildered panov to conklin ground zero said alex under his breath be quiet the retired field agent turned his head up to the two old men okay fellas why dont you go on your way business is business again said the second tattered ancient glancing at his colleague both their faces still in shadows you dont have any business with us you cant be sure of that interrupted the first old man shaking his head back and forth suppose i were to tell you that we bring you a message from macao what exclaimed panov shut up whispered conklin addressing the psychiatrist but his eyes on the messenger what does macao mean to us he asked flatly a great taipan wishes to meet with you the greatest taipan in hong kong why he will pay you great sums for your services ill say it again why we are to tell you that a killer has returned he wants you to find him ive heard that story before it doesnt wash its also repetitious that is between the great taipan and yourselves sir not with us he is waiting for you where is he at a great hotel sir which one we are again to tell you that it has a greatsized lobby with always many people and its name refers to this countrys past theres only one like that the mayflower conklin directed his words toward his left lapel into a microphone sewn into the buttonhole as you wish under what name is he registered registered like in reserved benches only rooms who do we ask for no one sir the taipans secretary will approach you in the lobby did that same secretary approach you also sir who hired you to follow us we are not at liberty to discuss such matters and we will not do so thats it shouted alexander conklin yelling over his shoulder as floodlights suddenly lit up the smithsonian grounds around the deserted path revealing the two startled old men to be orientals nine personnel from the central intelligence agency walked rapidly into the glare of light from all directions their hands under their jackets since there was no apparent need for them their weapons remained hidden suddenly the need was there but the realization came too late two highpowered rifle shots exploded from the outer darkness the bullets ripping open the throats of the two oriental messengers the cia men lunged to the ground rolling for cover as conklin grabbed panov pulling him down to the path in front of the bench for protection the unit from langley lurched to their feet and like the combat veterans they were including the former commando director peter holland they started scrambling zigzagging one after another toward the source of the gunfire weapons extended shadows sought in moments an angry cry split the silence goddamn it shouted holland the beam of his flashlight angled down between tree trunks they made their break how can you tell the grass son the heel imprints those bastards were overqualified they dug in for one shot apiece and got outlook at the slip marks on the lawn those shoes were running forget it no use now if they stopped for a second position theyd blow us into the smithsonian a field man said alex getting up with his cane the frightened bewildered panov beside him then the doctor spun around his eyes wide rushing toward the two fallen orientals oh my god theyre dead he cried kneeling beside the corpses seeing their blownapart throats jesus the amusement park its the same a message agreed conklin nodding wincing put rock salt on the trail he added enigmatically what do you mean asked the psychiatrist snapping his head around at the former intelligence officer we werent careful enough alex roared the grayhaired holland running to the bench i heard you but this neuters the hotel he said breathlessly you cant go there now i wont let you it neutersfucks upmore than the hotel this isnt the jackal its hong kong the externals were right but my instincts were wrong wrong which way do you want to go asked the director softly i dont know answered conklin a plaint in his voice i was wrong reach our man of course as soon as possible i spoke to davidi spoke to him about an hour ago said panov instantly correcting himself you spoke to him cried alex its late and you were at home how you know my answering machine said the doctor if i picked up every crazy call after midnight id never get to the office in the morning so i let it ring and because i was getting ready to go out and meet you i listened all he said was reach me and by the time i got to the phone hed hung up so i called him back you called him back on your phone well yes answered panov hesitantly he was very quick very guarded he just wanted us to know what was happening that mhe called her mwas leaving with the children first thing in the morning that was it he hung up right away theyve got your boys name and address by now said holland probably the message as well a location yes the message maybe broke in conklin speaking quietly rapidly not an address not a name by morning they will have by morning hell be on his way to tierra del fuego if need be christ what have i done exclaimed the psychiatrist nothing anybody else in your place wouldnt have done replied alex you get a message at two oclock in the morning from someone you care about someone in trouble you call back as fast as you can now we have to reach him as fast as we can so its not carlos but somebody with a lot of firepower is still closing in making breakthroughs we thought were impossible use the phone in my car said holland ill put it on override therell be no record no log lets go as quickly as possible conklin limped across the lawn toward the agency vehicle david its alex your timings pretty scary friend were on our way out the door if jamie hadnt had to hit the potty wed be in the car by now at this hour didnt mo tell you there was no answer at your place so i called him mos a little shook up tell me yourself whats happening is this phone secure i wasnt sure his was none more so im packing marie and the kids off southway south shes screaming like hell but i chartered a rockwell jet out of logan airport everything precleared thanks to the arrangements you made four years ago the computers spun and everyone cooperated they take off at six oclock before its lighti want them out and you david what about you frankly i thought id head to washington and stay with you if the jackals coming for me after all these years i want to be in on what were doing about it i might even be able to help ill arrive by noon no david not today and not here go with marie and the children get out of the country stay with your family and johnny st jacques on the island i cant do that alex and if you were me you couldnt either my familys not going to be freereally freeuntil carlos is out of our lives its not carlos said conklin interrupting what yesterday you told me forget what i told you i was wrong this is out of hong kong out of macao that doesnt make sense alex hong kongs finished macaos finished theyre dead and forgotten and theres no one alive with a reason to come after me there is somewhere a great taipan the greatest taipan in hong kong according to the most recent and most recently dead source theyre gone that whole house of kuomintang cards collapsed theres no one left i repeat there is somewhere david webb was briefly silent then jason bourne spoke his voice cold tell me everything youve learned every detail something happened tonight what was it all right every detail said conklin the retired intelligence officer described the controlled surveillance engineered by the central intelligence agency he explained how he and morris panov spotted the old men who followed them picking each up in sequence as they made their separate ways to the smithsonian none showing himself in the light until the confrontation on a deserted path on the smithsonian grounds where the messenger spoke of macao and hong kong and a great taipan finally conklin described the shattering gunfire that silenced the two aged orientals its out of hong kong david the reference to macao confirms it it was your impostors base camp again there was silence on the line only jason bournes steady breathing audible youre wrong alex he said at last his voice pensive floating its the jackalby way of hong kong and macao but its still the jackal david now youre not making sense carlos hasnt anything to do with taipans or hong kong or messages from macao those old men were chinese not french or italian or german or whatever this is out of asia not europe the old men theyre the only ones he trusts continued david webb his voice still low and cold the voice of jason bourne the old men of paris thats what they were called they were his network his couriers throughout europe who suspects decrepit old men whether theyre beggars or whether theyre just holding on to the last remnants of mobility who would think of interrogating them much less putting them on a rack and even then theyd stay silent their deals were madeare madeand they move with impunity for carlos for a moment hearing the strange hollow voice of his friend the frightened conklin stared at the dashboard unsure of what to say david i dont understand you i know youre upsetwere all upsetbut please be clearer what oh im sorry alex i was going back to put it simply carlos scoured paris looking for old men who were either dying or knew they hadnt long to live because of their age all with police records and with little or nothing to show for their lives their crimes most of us forget that these old men have loved ones and children legitimate or not that they care for the jackal would find them and swear to provide for the people his abouttodie couriers left behind if they swore the rest of their lives to him in their places with nothing to leave those who survive us but suspicion and poverty which of us would do otherwise they believed him they had good reason tothey still have scores of bank checks are delivered monthly from multiple unlisted swiss accounts to inheritors from the mediterranean to the baltic theres no way to trace those payments but the people receiving them know who makes them possible and why forget your buried file alex carlos dug around hong kong thats where his penetration was made where he found you and mo then well do some penetrating ourselves well infiltrate every oriental neighborhood every chinese bookie joint and restaurant in every city within a fiftymile radius of dc dont do anything until i get there you dont know what to look for i do its kind of remarkable really the jackal doesnt know that theres still a great deal i cant remember but he just assumed that id forgotten about the old men of paris maybe he didnt david maybe hes counting on the fact that youd remember maybe this whole charade is a prelude to the real trap hes setting for you then he made another mistake oh im better than that jason bournes better than that david webb walked through the national airport terminal and out the automatic doors onto the crowded platform he studied the signs and proceeded across the walkway leading to the shortterm parking area according to plan he was to go to the farthest aisle on the right turn left and continue down the row of parked cars until he saw a metallic gray pontiac lemans with an ornamental crucifix suspended from the rearview mirror a man would be in the drivers seat wearing a white cap the window lowered webb was to approach him and say the flight was very smooth if the man removed his cap and started the engine david was to climb in the backseat nothing more would be said nothing more was said not between webb and the driver however the latter reached under the dashboard removed a microphone and spoke quietly but clearly our cargos on board please commence rotating vehicle cover david thought that the exotic procedures bordered on the laughable but since alex conklin had traced him to the rockwell jets departure area at logan airport and further had reached him on director peter hollands private override telephone he assumed the two of them knew what they were doing it crossed webbs mind that it had something to do with mo panovs call to him nine hours ago it was all but confirmed when holland himself got on the phone insisting that he drive down to hartford and take a commercial flight out of bradley to washington adding enigmatically that he wanted no further telephone communication or private or government aircraft involved this particular governmentoriented car however wasted no time getting out of national airport it seemed as if in only minutes they were rushing through the countryside and only minimally less rapidly through the suburbs of virginia they swung up to the private gate of an expensive garden apartment complex the sign reading vienna villas after the township in which it was located the guard obviously recognized the driver and waved him through as the heavy bar across the entrance was raised it was only then that the driver spoke directly to webb this place has five separate sections over as many acres sir four of them are legitimate condominiums with regular owners but the fifth the one farthest from the gate is an agency proprietary with its own road and security you couldnt be healthier sir i didnt feel particularly sick you wont be youre dci cargo and your health is very important to him thats nice to know but how do you know im part of the team sir in that case whats your name the driver was silent for a moment and when he answered david had the uneasy feeling that he was being propelled back in time to a time he knew he was reentering we dont have names sir you dont and i dont medusa i understand said webb here we are the driver swung the car around a circular drive and stopped in front of a twostory colonial structure that looked as though the fluted white pillars might have been made of carrara marble excuse me sir i just noticed you dont have any luggage no i dont said david opening the door how do you like my temporary digs asked alex waving his hand around the tastefully appointed apartment too neat and too clean for a cantankerous old bachelor replied david and since when did you go in for floral curtains with pink and yellow daisies wait youll see the wallpaper in my bedroom its got baby roses im not sure i care to your room has hyacinths of course i wouldnt know a hyacinth if it jumped up and choked me but thats what the maid said the maid late forties and black and built like a sumo wrestler she also carries two popguns under her skirt and rumor has it several straight razors some maid some highpowered patrol she doesnt let a bar of soap or a roll of toilet paper in here that doesnt come from langley you know shes a paygrade ten and some of these clowns leave her tips do they need any waiters thats good our scholar webb the waiter jason bournes been one conklin paused then spoke seriously lets get to him he said limping to an armchair by the way youve had a rough day and its not even noon so if you want a drink theres a full bar behind those puce shutters next to the window dont look at me like that our black brunhilde said they were puce webb laughed it was a low genuine laugh as he looked at his friend it doesnt bother you a bit does it alex hell no you know that have you ever hid any liquor from me when i visited you and marie there was never any stress stress is irrelevant conklin broke in i made a decision because there was only one other one to make have a drink david we have to talk and i want you calm i look at your eyes and they tell me youre on fire you once told me that its always in the eyes said webb opening the purplish shutters and reaching for a bottle you can still see it cant you i told you it was behind the eyes never accept the first level how are marie and the children i assume they got off all right i went over the flight plan ad nauseam with the pilot and knew they were all right when he finally told me to get off his case or fly the run myself webb poured a drink and walked back to the chair opposite the retired agent where are we alex he asked sitting down right where we were last night nothings moved and nothings changed except that mo refuses to leave his patients he was picked up this morning at his apartment which is now as secure as fort knox and driven to his office under guard hell be brought here later this afternoon with four changes of vehicles all made in underground parking lots then its open protection no ones hiding any longer thatd be pointless we sprung a trap at the smithsonian and our men were very obvious its why it might work isnt it the unexpected backups behind a protection unit told to make mistakes the unexpected works david not the dumb conklin quickly shook his head i take that back bourne could turn the dumbs into smarts but not an officially mounted surveillance detail there are too many complications i dont understand as good as those men are theyre primarily concerned with guarding lives maybe saving them they also have to coordinate with each other and make reports theyre career people not oneshot prepaid lowlife with an assassins knife at their throats if they screw up that sounds so melodramatic said webb softly leaning back in the chair and drinking i guess i did operate like that didnt i it was more image than reality but it was real to the people you used then ill find those people again use them again david shot forward gripping his glass in both hands hes forcing me out alex the jackals calling my cards and i have to show oh shut up said conklin irritably now youre the one whos being melodramatic you sound like a gradez western you show yourself maries a widow and the kids have no father thats reality david youre wrong webb shook his head staring at his glass hes coming after me so i have to go after him hes trying to pull me out so i have to pull him out first its the only way it can happen the only way well get him out of our lives in the final analysis its carlos against bourne were back where we were thirteen years ago alpha bravo cain delta cain is for carlos and delta is for cain that was a crazy paris code thirteen years ago interrupted alex sharply medusas delta and his mighty challenge to the jackal but this isnt paris and its thirteen years later and in five more years itll be eighteen five years after that twentythree what the hell do you want me to do live with the specter of that son of a bitch over my family frightened every time my wife or my children leave the house living in fear for the rest of my life no you shut up field man you know better than that the analysts can come up with a dozen strategies and well use bits and pieces of maybe six and be grateful but when it gets down to the mud its between the jackal and me and ive got the advantage ive got you on my side conklin swallowed while blinking thats very flattering david maybe too flattering im better in my own element a couple of thousand miles away from washington it was always a little stifling for me here it wasnt when you saw me off on that plane to hong kong five years ago youd put together half the equation by then that was easier it was a downanddirty dc operation that had the smell of rotten halibut so rotten it offended my nostrils this is different this is carlos thats my point alex it is carlos not a voice over the telephone neither of us knew were dealing with a known quantity someone predictable predictable broke in conklin frowning thats also crazy in what way hes the hunter hell follow a scent hell examine it first with a very experienced nose then check the spoors under a microscope then well have to be authentic wont we i prefer foolproof what did you have in mind in the gospel according to saint alex its written that in order to bait a trap one has to use a large part of the truth even a dangerous amount that chapter and verse referred to a targets microscope i think i just mentioned it whats the relevance here medusa said webb quietly i want to use medusa now youre out of your mind responded conklin no louder than david that name is as offlimits as you arelets be honest a hell of a lot more so there were rumors alex stories all over southeast asia that floated up the china sea to kowloon and hong kong where most of those bastards ran with their money medusa wasnt exactly the secret evil you seem to think it was rumors yes and stories of course interrupted the retired intelligence officer which of those animals didnt put a gun or a knife to the heads of a dozen or two dozen or two hundred marks during their socalled tours ninety percent were killers and thieves the original death squads peter holland said that when he was a seal in the northern operations he never met a member of that outfit he didnt want to waste and without them instead of fiftyeight thousand casualties there could well have been sixtyplus give the animals their due alex they knew every inch of the territories every square foot of jungle in the triangle theywesent back more functional intelligence than all the units sent out by saigon put together my point david is that there can never be any connection between medusa and the united states government our involvement was never logged much less acknowledged the name itself was concealed as much as possible theres no statute of limitations on war crimes and medusa was officially determined to be a private organization a collection of violent misfits who wanted the corrupt southeast asia back the way they knew it and used it if it was ever established that washington was behind medusa the reputation of some very important people in the white house and the state department would be ruined theyre global power brokers now but twenty years ago they were hotheaded junior staffers in command saigon we can live with questionable tactics in time of war but not with being accomplices in the slaughter of noncombatants and the diversion of funds totaling millions both unknowingly paid for by the taxpayers its like those stillsealed archives that detail how so many of our fatcat financiers bankrolled the nazis some things we never want out of their black holes and medusas one of them webb again leaned back in the chairnow however taut his eyes steady on his old friend who was once briefly his deadly enemy if what memory i have left serves me bourne was identified as having come out of medusa it was an entirely believable explanation and a perfect cover agreed conklin returning davids gaze we went back to tam quan and discovered that bourne was a paranoid tasmanian adventurer who disappeared in the jungles of north vietnam nowhere in that very creative dossier was there the slightest clue of a washington connection but thats all a lie isnt it alex there was and is a washington connection and the jackal knows it now he knew it when he found you and mo panov in hong kongfound your names in the ruins of that sterile house on victoria peak where jason bourne was supposedly blown away he confirmed it last night when his messengers approached you at the smithsonian andyour wordsour men were very obvious he knew finally that everything hes believed for thirteen years is true the member of medusa who was called delta was jason bourne and jason bourne was a creation of american intelligenceand hes still alive alive and in hiding and protected by his government conklin slammed his fist on the arm of his chair how did he find us find me everything everything was under a black drape mcallister and i made sure of it i can think of several ways but thats a question we can postpone we havent time for it now we have to move now on what we know carlos knows medusa alex what move how if bourne was plucked from medusa it has to follow that our covert operations were working with itwith them otherwise how could the bourne switch be created what the jackal doesnt know or hasnt put together yet is how far this governmentespecially certain people in this governmentwill go to keep medusa in its black hole as you pointed out some very important men in the white house and the state department could get burned a lot of nasty labels branded on the foreheads of global power brokers i think you called them and suddenly weve got a few waldheims of our own conklin nodded frowning and looking down his thoughts obviously racing nuy dap ranh said webb barely above a whisper at the sound of the oriental words alexs eyes snapped back up at david thats the key isnt it continued webb nuy dap ranhsnake lady you remembered just this morning replied jason bourne his eyes cold when marie and the kids were airborne the plane disappeared into the mists over boston harbor and suddenly i was there in another plane in another time the words crackling out of a radio through the static snake lady snake lady abort snake lady do you read me abort i responded by turning the damn thing off and looked around at the men in the cabin which seemed ready to break apart in the turbulence i studied each man wondering i guess whether this one or that one would come out alive whether id come out alive and if we didnt how we would die then i saw two of the men rolling up their sleeves comparing those small ugly tattoos on their forearms those lousy little emblems that obsessed them nuy dap ranh said conklin flatly a womans face with snakes for strands of hair snake lady you refused to have one done on you i never considered it a mark of distinction interrupted webbbourne blinking somewhat the reverse in fact initially it was meant for identification not a standard or a banner of any distinction one way or the other an intricate tattoo on the underside of the forearm the design and the colors produced by only one artist in saigon no one else could duplicate it that old man made a lot of money during those years he was special every officer in command headquarters who was connected to medusa had one they were like manic kids whod found secret code rings in cereal boxes they werent kids alex manic you can bet your ass on it but not kids they were infected with a rotten virus called unaccountability and more than a few millionaires were made in the ubiquitous command saigon the real kids were being maimed and killed in the jungles while a lot of pressed khaki in the south had personal couriers routed through switzerland and the banks on zurichs bahnhofstrasse careful david you could be speaking of some very important people in our government who are they asked webb quietly his glass poised in front of him the ones i knew who were up to their necks in garbage i made damn sure faded after saigon fell but i was out of the field a couple of years before then and nobody talks very much about those months and nothing at all about snake lady still youve got to have some ideas sure but nothing concrete nothing even close to proof just possibilities based on lifestyles on real estate they shouldnt have or places they go they shouldnt be able to afford or the positions some hold or held in corporations justifying salaries and stock options when nothing in their backgrounds justified the jobs youre describing a network said david his voice now tight the voice of jason bourne if it is its very tight agreed conklin very exclusive draw up a list alex itd be filled with holes then keep it at first to those important people in our government who were attached to command saigon maybe even further to the ones who have real estate they shouldnt have or who held highpaying jobs in the private sector they shouldnt have gotten i repeat any such list could be worthless not with your instincts david what the hell has any of this to do with carlos part of the truth alex a dangerous part i grant you but foolproof and irresistible to the jackal stunned the former field officer stared at his friend in what way thats where your creative thinking comes in say you come up with fifteen or twenty names youre bound to hit three or four targets we can confirm one way or another once we ascertain who they are we apply pressure squeezing them in different ways delivering the same basic message a former medusan has gone over the edge a man whos been in protective custody for years is about to blow the head off snake lady and hes got the ammunitionnames crimes the locations of secret swiss accounts the whole caesar salad thenand thisll test the talents of the old saint alex we all knew and reveredword is passed on that theres someone who wants this dangerous disgruntled turncoat more than they do ilich ramirez sanchez supplied conklin softly carlos the jackal and what follows is equally impossible somehowonly god knows howword gets out calling for a meeting between the two interested parties that is to say interested in a joint assassination the parties of the first part unable to participate actively due to the sensitive nature of their high official positions is that about it just about except that these same powerful men in washington can gain access to the identity and the whereabouts of this much desired corpsetobe naturally agreed alex nodding in disbelief they simply wave a wand and all the restrictions applicable to maximumclassified files are lifted and theyre given the information exactly said david firmly because whoever meets with carloss emissaries has to be so high up so authentic that the jackal has no choice but to accept him or them he cant have any doubts all thoughts of a trap gone with their coming forward would you also like me to make baby roses bloom during a january blizzard in montana close to it everythings got to happen within the next day or two while carlos is still stinging from what happened at the smithsonian impossible oh hell ill try ill set up shop here and have langley send me what i need four zero security of course i hate like hell to lose whoever it is at the mayflower we may not said webb whoever it is wont fold so fast its not like the jackal to leave an obvious hole like that the jackal you think its carlos himself not him of course but someone on his payroll someone so unlikely he could carry a sign around his neck with the jackals name on it and we wouldnt believe him chinese maybe he might play that out and then he might not hes geometric whatever he does is logical even his logic seems illogical i hear a man from the past a man who never was oh he was alex he was indeed and now hes back conklin looked toward the door of the apartment davids words suddenly provoking another thought wheres your suitcase he asked you brought some clothes didnt you no clothes and these will be dropped in a washington sewer once i have others but first i have to see another old friend of mine another genius who lives in the wrong section of town let me guess said the retired agent an elderly black man with the improbable name of cactus a genius where false papers such as passports and drivers licenses and credit cards are concerned thats about it him the agency could do it all not as well and too bureaucratically i want nothing traceable even with four zero security this is solo okay then what you get to work field man by tomorrow morning i want a lot of people in this town shaken up tomorrow morning that is impossible not for you not for saint alex the prince of dark operations say whatever the hell you like im not even in training it comes back quickly like sex and riding a bicycle what about you what are you going to do after i consult with cactus ill get a room at the mayflower hotel answered jason bourne culver parnell hotel magnate from atlanta whose twentyyear reign in the hostelry business had led to his appointment as chief of protocol for the white house angrily hung up his office phone as he scribbled a sixth obscenity on a legal pad with the election and now the turnover of white house personnel he had replaced the previous administrations wellborn female who knew nothing about the political ramifications of s invitation list then to his profound irritation he found himself at war with his own first assistant another middleaged female also from one of the asselegant eastern colleges and to make it worse a popular washington socialite who contributed her salary to some ladida dance company whose members pranced around in their underwear when they wore any hog damn fumed culver running his hand through his fringed gray hair he picked up the telephone and poked four digits on his console gimme the redhead you sweet thing he intoned exaggerating his already pronounced georgia accent yes sir said the flattered secretary hes on another line but ill interrupt just hold on a sec mr parnell youre the loveliest of the peaches lovely child oh golly thank you now just hold on it never failed mused culver a little soft oil from the magnolia worked a hell of a lot better than the bark of a gnarled oak that bitch of a first assistant of his might take a lesson from her southern superiors she talked like some yankee dentist had bonded her fucking teeth together with permanent cement that you cull came the voice of redhead over the line intruding on parnells thoughts as he wrote a seventh obscenity on the legal pad youre mommaletchin right boy and we got a problem the fricassee bitch is doin it

they got the ears of the whole town here forget it cull broke in the anxious redhead we may have a bigger problem and i dont know what it means whats that when we were back in saigon did you ever hear of something or someone called snake lady i heard a hell of a lot about snake eyes chuckled parnell but no snake lady why the fellow i was just talking tohes going to call back in five minutessounded as though he was threatening me i mean actually threatening me cull he mentioned saigon and implied that something terrible happened back then and repeated the name snake lady several times as if i

fuckin snake lady you give that slug worm my number and tell him i know all about his horseshit will you please tell me cull what the hell you were there redhead so we had a few games going even a few mini casinos and some clowns lost a couple of shirts but there was nothin soldiers havent done since they threw craps for christs clothes we just put it on a higher plane and maybe tossed in a few broads whod have been walkin the streets anyway no redhead that elegantass socalled assistant thinks shes got somethin on methats why shes goin through you cause everybody knows were buddies you tell that slime to call me and ill settle his grits along with that bitchs twat oh boy she made a wrong move my wall streeters are in and her pansies are out okay cull ill simply refer him to you said the redhead otherwise known as the vice president of the united states as he hung up the phone it rang four minutes later and the words were spat out at parnell snake lady culver and were all in trouble no you listen to me divot head and ill tell you whos in trouble shes no lady shes a bitch one of her thirty or forty eunuch husbands may have thrown a few snake eyes in saigon and lost some of her welladvertised comeandtakeme cash but nobody gave a shit then and nobody gives a shit now especially a marine colonel who liked a sharp game of poker every once in a while and that man is sitting in the oval office at this moment and furthermore you ballless scrotum when he learns that shes trying to further defame the brave boys who wanted only a little relaxation while fighting a thankless war in vienna virginia alexander conklin replaced the phone misfire one and misfire two and he had never heard of culver parnell the chairman of the federal trade commission albert armbruster swore out loud as he turned off the shower at the sound of his wifes shrieking voice in the steamfilled bathroom what the hell is it mamie i cant take a shower without you yammering it could be the white house al you know how they talk so low and quiet and always saying its urgent shit yelled the chairman opening the glass door and walking naked to the phone on the wall this is armbruster what is it theres a crisis that requires your immediate attention is this no and we hope it never goes up there then who the hell are you someone as concerned as youre going to be after all these yearsoh christ concerned about what what are you talking about snake lady mr chairman oh my god armbrusters hushed voice was a sudden involuntary cry of panic instantly he controlled himself but it was too late mark one i have no idea what youre talking about whats a snake whateveritis never heard of it well hear it now mr medusa somebodys got it all everything dates diversions of materiel banks in geneva and zuricheven the names of a halfdozen couriers routed out of saigonand worse jesus the worst other namesmias established as never having been in combat eight investigating personnel from the inspector generals office everything youre not making sense youre talking gibberish and youre on the list mr chairman that man must have spent fifteen years putting it together and now he wants payment for all those years of work or he blows it openeverything everyone who who is he for christs sake were centering in all we know is that hes been in the protection program for over a decade and no one gets rich in those circumstances he must have been cut out of the action in saigon and now hes making up for lost time stay tight well be back in touch there was a click and the line went dead despite the steam and the heat of the bathroom the naked albert armbruster chairman of the federal trade commission shivered as the sweat rolled down his face he hung up the phone his eyes straying to the small ugly tattoo on the underside of his forearm over in vienna virginia alex conklin looked at the telephone mark one general norman swayne chief of pentagon procurements stepped back from the tee satisfied with his long straight drive down the fairway the ball would roll to an optimum position for a decent fiveiron approach shot to the seventeenth green that ought to do it he said turning to address his golfing partner certainly ought to norm replied the youngish senior vice president of calco technologies youre taking my butt for a ride this afternoon im going to end up owing you close to three hundred clams at twenty a hole ive only gotten four so far its your hook young fella you ought to work on it thats certainly the truth norm agreed the calco executive in charge of marketing as he approached the tee suddenly there was the high grating sound of a golf carts horn as a threewheeled vehicle appeared over the incline from the sixteenth fairway going as fast as it could go thats your driver general said the armaments marketer immediately wishing he had not used his partners formal title so it is thats odd he never interrupts my golf game swayne walked toward the rapidly approaching cart meeting it thirty feet away from the tee what is it he asked a large middleaged beribboned master sergeant who had been his driver for over fifteen years my guess is that its rotten answered the noncommissioned officer gruffly while he gripped the wheel thats pretty blunt so was the son of a bitch who called i had to take it inside on a pay phone i told him i wouldnt break into your game and he said i goddamned well better if i knew what was good for me naturally i asked him who he was and what rank and all the rest of the bullshit but he cut me off more scared than anything else just tell the general im calling about saigon and some reptiles crawling around the city damn near twenty years ago those were his exact words jesus christ cried swayne interrupting snake he said hed call back in a half hourthats eighteen minutes now get in norman im part of this remember bewildered and frightened the general mumbled i i have to make excuses i cant just walk away drive away make it quick and norman youve got on a shortsleeved shirt you goddamned idiot bend your arm swayne his eyes wide stared at the small tattoo on his flesh instantly crooking his arm to his chest in british brigadier fashion as he walked unsteadily back to the tee summoning a casualness he could not feel damn young fella the army calls well damn also norm but ive got to pay you i insist the general half in a daze accepted the debt from his partner not counting the bills not realizing that it was several hundred dollars more than he was owed proffering confused thanks swayne walked swiftly back to the golf cart and climbed in beside his master sergeant so much for my hook soldier boy said the armaments executive to himself addressing the tee and swinging his club sending the little pocked white ball straight down the fairway far beyond the generals and with a much better lie four hundred millions worth you brassplated bastard mark two what in heavens name are you talking about asked the senator laughing as he spoke into the phone or should i say whats al armbruster trying to pull he doesnt need my sup port on the new bill and he wouldnt get it if he did he was a jackass in saigon and hes a jackass now but hes got the majority vote were not talking about votes senator were talking about snake lady the only snakes i knew in saigon were jerks like alby who crawled around the city pretending to know all the answers when there werent any who the hell are you anyway in vienna virginia alex conklin replaced the telephone misfire three phillip atkinson ambassador to the court of st jamess picked up his phone in london assuming that the unnamed caller code courier dc was bearing an exceptionally confidential instruction from the state department and automatically as was the order atkinson snapped the switch on his rarely used scrambler it would create an eruption of static on british intelligences intercepts and later he would smile benignly at good friends in the connaught bar who asked him if there was anything new out of washington knowing that this one or that one had relatives in mifive yes courier district mr ambassador i assume we cant be picked up said the low strained voice from washington your assumptions correct unless theyve come up with a new type of enigma which is unlikely good i want to take you back to saigon to a certain operation no one talks about who is this broke in atkinson bolting forward in his chair the men in that outfit never used names mr ambassador and we didnt exactly advertise our commitments did we goddamn you who are you i know you no way phil although im surprised you dont recognize my voice atkinsons eyes widened as they roamed rapidly about his office seeing nothing only trying to remember trying desperately to put a voice with a face is that you jackbelieve me were on a scrambler close phil the sixth fleet jack a simple reverse morse then bigger things much bigger its you isnt it lets say its a possible but its also irrelevant the point is were in heavy weather very heavy it is you shut up just listen a bastard frigate got loose from its moorings and is crashing around hitting too many shoals jack i was ground not sea i cant understand you some swab jockey must have been cut out of the action back in saigon and from what ive learned he was put in protection for something or other and now hes got it all put together hes got it all phil everything holy christ hes ready to launch stop him thats the problem were not sure who he is the whole things being kept very close over in langley good god man in your position you can give them the order to back off say its a dod dead file that was never completedthat it was designed to spread disinformation its all false that could be walking into a salvo have you called jimmy t over in brussels interrupted the ambassador hes tight with the top max at langley at the moment i dont want anything to go any further not until i do some missionary work whatever you say jack youre running the show keep your halyards taut phil if that means keep my mouth shut dont you worry about it said atkinson crooking his elbow wondering who in london could remove an ugly tattoo on his forearm across the atlantic in vienna virginia alex conklin hung up the telephone and leaned back in his chair a frightened man he had been following his instincts as he had done in the field for over twenty years words leading to other words phrases to phrases innuendos snatched out of the air to support suppositions even conclusions it was a chess game of instant invention and he knew he was a skilled professionalsometimes too skilled there were things that should remain in their black holes undetected cancers buried in history and what he had just learned might well fit that category marks three four and five phillip atkinson ambassador to great britain james teagarten supreme commander of nato jonathan jack burton former admiral of the sixth fleet currently chairman of the joint chiefs of staff snake lady medusa a network it was as if nothing had changed thought jason bourne knowing that his other self the selfcalled david webb was receding the taxi had brought him out to the once elegant now rundown neighborhood in northeast washington and as happened five years ago the driver refused to wait he walked up the overgrown flagstone path to the old house thinking as he did the first time that it was too old and too fragile and too much in need of repair he rang the bell wondering if cactus was even alive he was the thin old black man with the gentle face and warm eyes stood in the doorframe exactly as he had stood five years before squinting beneath a green eyeshade even cactuss first words were a minor variation of those he had used five years ago you got hubcaps on your car jason no car and no cab it wouldnt stay musta heard all those scurrilous rumors circulated by the fascist press me i got howitzers in the windows just to impress this neighborly turf of my friendly persuasion come on in i think of you a lot why didnt you phone this old boy your numbers not listed cactus musta been an oversight bourne walked into the hallway as the old man closed the door you got a few streaks of gray in your hair brer rabbit added cactus studying his friend other than that you aint changed much maybe a line or six in your face but it adds character ive also got a wife and two kids uncle remus a boy and a girl i know that mo panov keeps me up on things even though he cant tell me where you arewhich i dont care to know jason bourne blinked while slowly shaking his head i still forget things cactus im sorry i forgot you and mo are friends oh the good doctor calls me at least once a month and says cactus you rascal put on your pierre cardin suit and your gucci shoes and lets have lunch so i say to him wheres this old nigger gonna get such threads and he says to me you probably own a shopping center in the best part of town now thats an exaggeration s help me i do have bits and pieces of decent white real estate but i never go near them as both men laughed jason stared at the dark face and warm black eyes in front of him something else i just remembered thirteen years ago in that hospital in virginia you came to see me outside of marie and those government bastards you were the only one panov understood brer rabbit when in my very unofficial status i worked on you for europe i told morris that you dont study a mans face in a lens without learning things about that face that man i wanted you to talk about the things i found missing in that lens and morris thought it might not be a bad idea and now that confessional hour is over i gotta say that its really good to see you jason but to tell you the truth im not happy to see you if you catch my meaning i need your help cactus thats the root of my unhappiness youve been through enough and you wouldnt be here unless you were itching for more and in my professional lenspeering opinion that aint healthy for the face im lookin at youve got to help me then youd better have a damn good reason that passes muster for the good doctor cause i aint gonna mess around with anything that could mess you up further i met your lovely lady with the dark red hair a few times in the hospitalshes somethin special brer and your kids have got to be outstanding so you see i cant mess around with anything that might hurt them forgive me but youre all like kinfolk from a distance from a time we dont talk about but its on my mind theyre why i need your help be clearer jason the jackals closing in he found us in hong kong and hes zeroing in on me and my family on my wife and my children please help me the old mans eyes grew wide under the green shade a moral fury in his expanded pupils does the good doctor know about this hes part of it he may not approve of what im doing but if hes honest with himself he knows that the bottom line is the jackal and me help me cactus the aged black studied his pleading client in the hallway in the afternoon shadows you in good shape brer rabbit he asked you still got juices i run six miles every morning and i press weights at least twice a week in the university gym i didnt hear that i dont want to know anything about colleges or universities then you didnt hear it course i didnt you look in pretty fair condition ill say that its deliberate cactus said jason quietly sometimes its just a telephone suddenly ringing or maries late or out with the kids and i cant reach her or someone i dont know stops me in the street to ask directions and it comes backhe comes back the jackal as long as theres a possibility that hes alive i have to be ready for him because he wont stop looking for me the awful irony is that his hunt is based on a supposition that may not be true he thinks i can identify him but im not sure i could nothings really in focus yet have you considered sending that message to him with his assets maybe ill take an ad out in the wall street journal dear old buddy carlos boy have i got news for you dont chortle jason its not inconceivable your friend alex could find a way his gimp doesnt affect that head of his i believe the fancy word is serpentine which is why if he hasnt tried it theres a reason i guess i cant argue with that so lets go to work brer rabbit what did you have in mind cactus led the way through a wide archway toward a door at the rear of a worn out living room replete with ancient furniture and yellowed antimacassars my studio isnt as elegant as it was but all the equipments there you see im sort of semiretired my financial planners worked out a hell of a retirement program with great tax advantages so the pressures not so great youre only incredible said bourne i imagine some people might say that the ones not doin time what did you have in mind pretty much myself not europe or hong kong of course just papers actually so the chameleon retreats to another disguise himself jason stopped as they approached the door that was something else i forgot they used to call me that didnt they chameleon they sure did and not without cause as they say six people could come facetoface with our boy bourne and thered be six different descriptions without a jar of makeup incidentally its all coming back cactus i wish to almighty god that it didnt have to but if it does you make damn sure its all back come on into the magic room three hours and twenty minutes later the magic was completed david webb oriental scholar and for three years jason bourne assassin had two additional aliases with passports drivers licenses and voter registration cards to confirm the identities and since no cabs would travel out to cactuss turf an unemployed neighbor wearing several heavy gold chains around his neck and wrists drove cactuss client into the heart of washington in his new cadillac allante jason found a pay phone in garfinkels department store and called alex in virginia giving him both aliases and selecting one for the mayflower hotel conklin would officially secure a room through the management in the event that summer reservations were tight further langley would activate a four zero imperative and do its best to furnish bourne with the material he needed delivering it to his room as soon as possible the estimate was a minimum of an additional three hours no guarantees as to the time or authenticity regardless thought jason as alex reconfirmed the information on a second direct line to the cia he needed at least two of those three hours before going to the hotel he had a small wardrobe to put together the chameleon was reverting to type steve desole tells me hell start spinning the disks crosschecking ours with the army data banks and naval intelligence said conklin returning to the line peter holland can make it happen hes the presidents crony crony thats an odd word coming from you like in crony appointment oh thanks alex how about you any progress conklin paused and when he answered his quiet voice conveyed his fear it was controlled but the fear was there lets put it this way im not equipped for what ive learned ive been away too long im afraid jasonsorry david youre right the first time have you discussed nothing by name broke in the retired intelligence officer quickly firmly i see you couldnt contradicted alex i couldnt ill be in touch with these cryptic words conklin abruptly hung up slowly bourne did the same frowning in concern alex was the one now sounding melodramatic and it was not like him to think that way or act that way control was his byword understatement his persona whatever he had learned profoundly disturbed him so much so as to make it seem to bourne that he no longer trusted the procedures he himself had set up or even the people he was working with otherwise he would have been clearer more forthcoming instead for reasons jason could not fathom alexander conklin did not want to talk about medusa or whatever he had learned in peeling away twenty years of deceit was it possible no time no use not now considered bourne looking around the huge department store alex was not only as good as his word he lived by it as long as one was not an enemy ruefully suppressing a short throated laugh jason remembered paris thirteen years ago he knew that side of alex too but for the cover of gravestones in a cemetery on the outskirts of rambouillet his closest friend would have killed him that was then not now conklin said hed be in touch he would until then the chameleon had to build several covers from the inside to the outside from underwear to outerwear and everything in between no chance of a laundry or a cleaning mark coming to light no microscopic chemical evidence of a regionally distributed detergent or fluidnothing he had given too much if he had to kill for davids family oh my god for my family he refused to live with the consequences of that killing or those killings where he was going there were no rules the innocent might well die in the cross fire so be it david webb would violently object but jason bourne didnt give a goddamn hed been there before he knew the statistics webb knew nothing marie ill stop him i promise you ill rip him out of your lives ill take the jackal and leave a dead man hell never be able to touch you againyoull be free oh christ who am i mo help me no mo dont i am what i have to be i am cold and im getting colder soon ill be ice clear transparent ice ice so cold and pure it can move anywhere without being seen cant you understand moyou too mariei have to david has to go i cant have him around any longer forgive me marie and you forgive me doctor but im thinking the truth a truth that has to be faced right now im not a fool nor do i fool myself you both want me to let jason bourne get out of my life release him to some infinity but the reverse is what i have to do now david has to leave at least for a while dont bother me with such considerations i have work to do where the hell is the mens department when he was finished making his purchases all paid for in cash with as many different clerks as possible he would find a mens room where he would replace every stitch of clothing on his body after that he would walk the streets of washington until he found a hidden sewer grate the chameleon too was back it was in the evening when bourne put down the singleedged razor blade he had removed all the labels from the assortment of new clothes hanging up each item in the closet when he had finished except for the shirts these he steamed in the bathroom to remove the odor of newness he crossed to the table where room service had placed a bottle of scotch whisky club soda and a bucket of ice as he passed the desk with the telephone he stopped he wanted so terribly to call marie on the island but knew he could not not from the hotel room that she and the children had arrived safely was all that mattered and they had he had reached john st jacques from another pay phone in garfinkels hey davey theyre bushed they had to hang around the big island for damn near four hours until the weather cleared ill wake sis if you want me to but after she fed alison she just crashed never mind ill call later tell her im fine and take care of them johnny will do fella now you tell me are you okay i said im fine sure you can say it and she can say it but maries not just my only sister shes my favorite sister and i know when that ladys shook up thats why youre going to take care of her im also going to have a talk with her go easy johnny for a few moments he had been david webb again mused jason pouring himself a drink he did not like it it felt wrong an hour later however jason bourne was back he had spoken to the clerk at the mayflower about his reservation the night manager had been summoned ah yes mr simon the man had greeted him enthusiastically we understand youre here to argue against those terrible tax restrictions on business travel and entertainment godspeed as they say these politicians will ruin us all there were no double rooms so we took the liberty of providing you with a suite no additional charge of course all that had taken place over two hours ago and since then he had removed the labels steamed the shirts and scuffed the rubbersoled shoes on the hotels window ledge drink in hand bourne sat in a chair staring blankly at the wall there was nothing to do but wait and think a quiet tapping at the door ended the waiting in a matter of minutes jason walked rapidly across the room opened the door and admitted the driver who had met him at the airport the cia man carried an attaché case he handed it to bourne everythings there including a weapon and a box of shells thanks do you want to check it out ill be doing that all night its almost eight oclock said the agent your control will reach you around eleven thatll give you time to get started my control thats who he is isnt he yes of course replied jason softly id forgotten thanks again the man left and bourne hurried to the desk with the attaché case he opened it removing first the automatic and the box of ammunition then picking up what had to be several hundred computer printouts secured in file folders somewhere in those myriad pages was a name that linked a man or a woman to carlos the jackal for these were the informational printouts of every guest currently at the hotel including those who had checked out within the past twentyfour hours each printout was supplemented by whatever additional information was found in the data banks of the cia army g and naval intelligence there could be a score of reasons why it might all be useless but it was a place to start the hunt had begun five hundred miles north in another hotel suite this on the third floor of bostons ritzcarlton there was another tapping on another hotel door inside an immensely tall man whose welltailored pinstriped suit made him appear even larger than his nearly six feet five inches of height came rushing out of the bedroom his bald head fringed by perfectly groomed gray hair above his temples was like the skull of an anointed éminence grise of some royal court where kings princes and pretenders deferred to his wisdom delivered no doubt with the eyes of an eagle and the soaring voice of a prophet although his rushing figure revealed a vulnerable anxiety even that did not diminish his image of dominance he was important and powerful and he knew it all this was in contrast to the older man he admitted through the door there was little that was distinguished about this short gaunt elderly visitor instead he conveyed the look of defeat come in quickly did you bring the information oh yes yes indeed answered the grayfaced man whose rumpled suit and illfitting collar had both seen better days perhaps a decade ago how grand you look randolph he continued in a thin voice while studying his host and glancing around at the opulent suite and how grand a place this is so proper for such a distinguished professor the information please insisted dr randolph gates of harvard expert in antitrust law and highly paid consultant to numerous industries oh give me a moment my old friend its been a long time since ive been near a hotel suite much less stayed in one oh how things have changed for us over the years i read about you frequently and ive watched you on television youre soerudite randolph thats the word but its not enough its what i said beforegrand thats what you are grand and erudite so tall and imperious you might have been in the same position you know broke in the impatient gates unfortunately you looked for shortcuts where there werent any oh there were lots of them i just chose the wrong ones i gather things havent gone well for you you dont gather randy you know if your spies didnt inform you certainly you can tell i was simply trying to find you yes thats what you said on the phone what a number of people said to me in the streetpeople who had been asked a number of questions having nothing to do with my residence such as it is i had to know if you were capable you cant fault me for that good heavens no not considering what you had me do what i think you had me do merely act as a confidential messenger thats all you certainly cant object to the money object said the visitor with a highpitched and tremulous laugh let me tell you something randy you can be disbarred at thirty or thirtyfive and still get by but when youre disbarred at fifty and your trial is given national press along with a jail sentence youd be shocked at how your options disappeareven for a learned man you become an untouchable and i was never much good at selling anything but my wits i proved that too over the last twentyodd years incidentally alger hiss did better with greeting cards i havent time to reminisce the information please oh yes of course well first the money was delivered to me on the corner of commonwealth and dartmouth and naturally i wrote down the names and the specifics you gave me over the phone wrote down asked gates sharply burned as soon as id committed them to memoryi did learn a few things from my difficulties i reached the engineer at the telephone company who was overjoyed with yourexcuse memy largess and took his information to that repulsive private detective a sleaze if i ever saw one randy and considering his methods someone who could really use my talents please interrupted the renowned legal scholar the facts not your appraisals appraisals often contain germane facts professor surely you understand that if i want to build a case ill ask for opinions not now what did the man find out based on what you told me a lone woman with childrenhow many being undeterminedand on the data provided by an underpaid telephone company mechanic namely a narroweddown location based on the area code and the first three digits of a number the unethical sleaze went to work at an outrageous hourly rate to my astonishment he was productive as a matter of fact with whats left of my legal mind we may form a quiet unwritten partnership damn you what did he learn well as i say his hourly rate was beyond belief i mean it really invaded the corpus of my own welldeserved retainer so i think we should discuss an adjustment dont you who the hell do you think you are i sent you three thousand dollars five hundred for the telephone man and fifteen hundred for that miserable keyhole slime who calls himself a private detective only because hes no longer on the public payroll of the police department randolph like me he fell from grace but he obviously does very good work do we negotiate or do i leave in fury the balding imperious professor of law stared at the grayfaced old disbarred and dishonored attorney in front of him how dare you dear me randy you really do believe your press dont you very well ill tell why i dare my arrogant old friend ive read you seen you expounding on your esoteric interpretations of complex legal matters assaulting every decent thing the courts of this country have decreed in the last thirty years when you havent the vaguest idea what it is to be poor or hungry or have an unwanted mass in your belly you neither anticipated nor can provide a life for youre the darling of the royalists my unprofound fellow and youd force the average citizen to live in a nation where privacy is obsolete free thought suspended by censorship the rich get richer and for the poorest among us the beginnings of potential life itself may well have to be abandoned in order to survive and you expound on these unoriginal medieval concepts only to promote yourself as a brilliant maverickof disaster do you want me to go on doctor gates frankly i think you chose the wrong loser to contact for your dirty work how dare you repeated the perplexed professor sputtering as he regally strode to the window i dont have to listen to this no you certainly dont randy but when i was an associate at the law school and you were one of my kidsone of the best but not the brightestyou damn well had to listen so i suggest you listen now what the hell do you want roared gates turning away from the window its what you want isnt it the information you underpaid me for its that important to you isnt it i must have it you were always filled with anxiety before an exam stop it i paid i demand the information then i must demand more money whoevers paying you can afford it not a dollar then im leaving stop five hundred more thats it five thousand or i go ridiculous see you in another twenty years all right all right five thousand oh randy youre so obvious its why youre not really one of the brightest just someone who can use language to make yourself appear bright and i think weve seen and heard enough of that these days ten thousand dr gates or i go to the raucous bar of my choice you cant do this certainly i can im now a confidential legal consultant ten thousand dollars how do you want to pay it i cant imagine you have it with you so how will you honor the debtfor the information my word forget it randy all right ill have it sent to the boston five in the morning in your name a bank check thats very endearing of you but in case it occurs to your superiors to stop me from collecting please advise them that an unknown person an old friend of mine in the streets has a letter detailing everything thats gone on between us it is to be mailed to the massachusetts attorney general return receipt requested in the event i have an accident thats absurd the information please yes well you should know that youve involved yourself in what appears to be an extremely sensitive government operation thats the bottom line on the assumption that anyone in an emergency leaving one place for another would do so with the fastest transportation possible our rumbottom detective went to logan airport under what guise i dont know nevertheless he succeeded in obtaining the manifests of every plane leaving boston yesterday morning from the first flight at sixthirty to ten oclock as you recall that corresponds with the parameters of your statement to meleaving first thing in the morning and patience randolph you told me not to write anything down so i must take this step by step where was i the manifests oh yes well according to detective sleaze there were eleven unaccompanied children booked on various flights and eight women two of them nuns who had reservations with minors of these eight including the nuns who were taking nine orphans to california the remaining six were identified as follows the old man reached into his pocket and shakily took out a typewritten sheet of paper obviously i did not write this i dont own a typewriter because i cant type it comes from führer sleaze let me have it ordered gates rushing forward his hand outstretched surely said the seventyyearold disbarred attorney giving the page to his former student it wont do you much good however he added our sleaze checked them out more to inflate his hours than for anything else not only are they all squeaky clean but he performed that unnecessary service after the real information was uncovered what asked gates his attention diverted from the page what information information that neither sleaze nor i would write down anywhere the first hint of it came from the morning setup clerk for pan american airlines he mentioned to our lowbrow detective that among his problems yesterday was a hotshot politician or someone equally offensive who needed diapers several minutes after our clerk went on duty at fivefortyfive did you know that diapers come in sizes and are locked away in an airlines contingency supplies what are you trying to tell me all the stores in the airport were closed they open at seven oclock so so someone in a hurry forgot something a lone woman with a fiveyearold child and an infant were leaving boston on a private jet taking off on the runway nearest the pan am shuttle counters the clerk responded to the request and was personally thanked by the mother you see hes a young father and understood about diaper sizes he brought three different packages for gods sake will you get to the point judge judge the grayfaced old mans eyes widened thank you randy except for my friends in various gin mills i havent been called that in years it must be the aura i exude it was a throwback to that same boring circumlocution you used both on the bench and in the classroom impatience was always your weak suit i ascribed it to your annoyance with other peoples points of view that interfered with your conclusions regardless our major sleaze knew a rotten apple when the worm emerged and spat in his face so he hide himself off to logans control tower where he found a bribable off duty traffic controller who checked yesterday mornings schedules the jet in question had a computer readout of four zero which to our captain sleazes astonishment he was told meant it was governmentcleared and maximumclassified no manifest no names of anyone on board only a routing to evade commercial aircraft and a destination which was blackburne montserrat what the hell is that the blackburne airport on the caribbean island of montserrat thats where they went thats it not necessarily according to corporal sleaze who i must say does his followups there are small flight connections to a dozen or so minor offshore islands thats it thats it professor and considering the fact that the aircraft in question had a four zero government classification which incidentally in my letter to the attorney general i so specified i think ive earned my ten thousand dollars you drunken scum again youre wrong randy interrupted the judge alcoholic certainly drunk hardly ever i stay on the edge of sobriety its my one reason for living you see in my cognizance im always amusedby men like you actually get out of here said the professor ominously youre not even going to offer me a drink to help support this dreadful habit of mine good heavens there must be half a dozen unopened bottles over there take one and leave thank you i believe i will the old judge walked to a cherrywood table against the wall where two silver trays held various whiskies and a brandy lets see he continued picking up several white cloth napkins and wrapping them around two bottles then a third if i hold these tightly under my arm they could be a pile of laundry im taking put for quick service will you hurry will you please open the door for me id hate like hell dropping one of these while manipulating the knob if it smashed it wouldnt do much for your image either youve never been known to have a drink i believe get out insisted gates opening the door for the old man thank you randy said the judge walking out into the hallway and turning dont forget the bank check at the boston five in the morning fifteen thousand fifteen my word can you imagine what the attorney general would say just knowing that youd even consorted with me goodbye counselor randolph gates slammed the door and ran into the bedroom to the bedside telephone the smaller enclosure was reassuring as it removed him from the exposure to scrutiny inherent in larger areasthe room was more private more personal less open to invasion the call he had to make so unnerved him he could not understand the pullout flap of instructions for overseas connections instead in his anxiety he dialed the operator i want to place a call to paris he said bournes eyes were tired the strain painful as he studied the results of the computer printouts spread across the coffee table in front of the couch sitting forward he had analyzed them for nearly four hours forgetting time forgetting that his control was to have reached him by then concerned only with a link to the jackal at the mayflower hotel the first group which he temporarily put aside was the foreign nationals a mix of british italian swedish west german japanese and taiwanese each of them had been extensively examined with respect to authentic credentials and fully substantiated business or personal reasons for entering the country the state department and the central intelligence agency had done their homework each person was professionally and personally vouched for by a minimum of five reputable individuals or companies all had longstanding communications with such people and firms in the washington area none had a false or questionable statement on record if the jackals man was among themand he might well beit would take far more information than was to be found in the printouts before jason could refine the list it might be necessary to go back to this group but for the moment he had to keep reading there was so little time of the remaining five hundred or so american guests at the hotel two hundred and twelve had entries in one or more of the intelligence data banks the majority because they had business with the government however seventyeight had rawfile negative evaluations thirtyone were internal revenue service matters which meant they were suspected of destroying or falsifying financial records andor had tax havens in swiss or cayman island accounts they were zero nothing merely rich and not very bright thieves and further the sort of messengers carlos would avoid like lepers that left fortyseven possibles men and womenin eleven cases ostensibly husbands and wiveswith extensive connections in europe in the main with technological firms and related nuclear and aerospace industries all under intelligence microscopes for possibly selling classified information to brokers of the eastern bloc and therefore to moscow of these fortyseven possibles including two of the eleven couples an even dozen had made recent trips to the soviet unionscratch all of them the komitet gosudarstvennoi bezopasnosti otherwise known as the kgb had less use for the jackal than the pope ilich ramirez sanchez later carlos the assassin had been trained in the american compound of novgorod where the streets were lined with american gas stations and grocery stores boutiques and burger kings and everyone spoke american english with diverse dialectsno russian was allowedand only those who passed the course were permitted to proceed to the next level of infiltrators the jackal had indeed passed but when the komitet discovered that the young venezuelan revolutionarys solution for all things disagreeable was to eliminate them violently it was too much for even the inheritors of the brutal ogpu sanchez was expelled and carlos the jackal was born forget about the twelve people who had traveled to the soviet union the assassin would not touch them for there was a standing order in all branches of russian intelligence that if carlos was tracked he was to be shot novgorod was to be protected at all cost the possibles were thus narrowed to thirtyfive the hotels register listing them as nine couples four single women and thirteen single men the rawfile printouts from the data banks de scribed in detail the facts and speculations that resulted in the negative evaluation of each individual in truth the speculations far outnumbered the facts and were too often based on hostile appraisals given by enemies or competitors but each had to be studied many with distaste for among the information might be a word or phrase a location or an act that was the link to carlos the telephone rang breaking jasons concentration he blinked at the harsh intrusive sound as if trying to locate the source then he sprang from the couch and rushed to the desk reaching the phone on the third ring yes its alex im calling from down the street are you coming up not through that lobby im not ive made arrangements for the service entrance with a temporary guard hired this afternoon youre covering all the bases arent you nowhere near as many as id like to replied conklin this isnt your normal ball game see you in a few minutes ill knock once bourne hung up the phone and returned to the couch and the printouts separating three that had caught his attention not that any of them contained anything that evoked the jackal in stead it was seemingly offhand data that might conceivably link the three to each other when no apparent connection existed between them according to their passports these three americans had flown in to philadelphias international airport within six days of one another eight months ago two women and a man the women from marrakesh and lisbon the man from west berlin the first woman was an interior decorator on a collecting trip to the old moroccan city the second an executive for the chase bank foreign department the man was an aerospace engineer on loan to the air force from mcdonnelldouglas why would three such obviously different people with such dissimilar professions converge on the same city within a week of one another coincidence entirely possible but considering the number of international airports in the country including the most frequentednew york chicago los angeles miami the coincidence of philadelphia seemed unlikely stranger still and even more unlikely was the fact that these same three people were staying at the same hotel at the same time in washington eight months later jason wondered what alex conklin would say when he told him im getting the book on each of them said alex sinking into an armchair across from the couch and the printouts you knew it wasnt hard to put together of course it was a hell of a lot easier with a computer doing the scanning you might have included a note ive been poring over these things since eight oclock i didnt find itthemuntil after nine and i didnt want to call you from virginia thats another story isnt it said bourne sitting down on the couch once again leaning forward anxiously yes it is and its godawful medusa its worse than i thought and worse than that i didnt think it could be thats a mouthful its a bowelful countered the retired intelligence officer where do i start pentagon procurements the federal trade commission our ambassador in london or would you like the supreme commander of nato my god oh i can go one better for size try on the chairman of the joint chiefs christ what is it some kind of cabal thats so academic dr scholar now try collusion down deep and elusive and after all these years still breathing still alive theyre in contact with each other in high places why whats the purpose the objective i just said that asked that really there has to be a reason try motive i just said that too and it may be as simple as hiding past sins isnt that what we were looking for a collection of former medusans whod run to the hills at the thought of the past coming to light then thats it no its not and this is saint alexs instincts searching for words their reactions were too immediate too visceral too loaded with today not twenty years ago youve lost me ive lost myself somethings different from what we expected and im goddamned sick of making mistakes but this isnt a mistake you said this morning that it could be a net work and i thought you were way the hell off base i thought that maybe wed find a few high profiles who didnt want to be publicly drawn and quartered for things they did twenty years ago or who legitimately didnt want to embarrass the government and we could use them force them in their collective fear to do things and say things we told them to do but this is different its today and i cant figure it out its more than fear its panic theyre frightened out of their minds weve bumbled and stumbled onto something mr bourne and in your rich friend cactuss oldtime minstrelshow language in the focus it could be bigger than bofus in my considered opinion theres nothing bigger than the jackal not for me the rest can go to hell im on your side and ill go to the wall shouting it i just wanted you to know my thoughts except for a brief and pretty rotten interlude we never kept anything from each other david i prefer jason these days yes i know interrupted conklin i hate it but i understand do you yes said alex softly nodding as he closed his eyes id do anything to change it but i cant then listen to me in that serpentine mind of yourscactuss description incidentallyconjure up the worst scenario you can think of and shove those bastards against another wall one they cant get away from unscathed unless they follow your instructions down to the letter those orders will be to stay quiet and wait for you to call and tell them who to reach and what to say conklin looked over at his damaged friend with guilt and concern there may be a scenario in place that i cant match said alex quietly i wont make another mistake not in that area i need more than what ive got bourne clasped his hands flesh angrily grinding flesh in frustration he stared at the scattered printouts in front of him frowning wincing his jaw pulsating in seconds a sudden passivity came over him he sat back on the couch and spoke as quietly as conklin all right youll get it quickly how me ill get it for you ill need names residences schedules and methods of security favorite restaurants and bad habits if any are known tell your boys to go to work tonight all night if necessary what the hell do you think youre going to do shouted conklin his frail body lurching forward in the armchair storm their houses stick needles in their asses between the appetizer and the entrée i hadnt thought of the last option replied jason smiling grimly youve really got a terrific imagination and youre a madman im sorry i didnt mean that why not broke in bourne gently im not lecturing on the rise of the manchu and the ching dynasty considering the accepted state of my mind and memory the allusion to mental health isnt inappropriate jason paused then spoke as he leaned slowly forward but let me tell you something alex the memories may not all be there but the part of my mind that you and treadstone formed is all there i proved it in hong kong in beijing and macao and ill prove it again i have to theres nothing left for me if i dont now get me the information you mentioned several people who have to be here in washington pentagon supplies or provisions procurements corrected conklin its a lot more expansive and expensive hes a general named swayne then theres armbruster hes head of the federal trade commission and burton over at chairman of the joint chiefs completed bourne admiral joltin jack burton commander of the sixth fleet one and the same formerly the scourge of the south china sea now the largest of the large brass i repeat said jason tell your boys to go to work peter holland will get you all the help you need find me everything there is on each of them i cant what i can get us the books on our three philadelphians because theyre part of the immediate mayflower projectthats the jackal i cant touch our fiveso far fiveinheritors of medusa for christs sake why not you have to we cant waste time time wouldnt mean much if both of us were dead it wouldnt help marie or the children either what the hell are you talking about why im late why i didnt want to call you from virginia why i reached charlie casset to pick me up at that real estate proprietary in vienna and why until he got there i wasnt sure id ever get here alive spell it out field man all right i will ive said nothing to anyone about going after former medusa personnelthat was between you and me nobody else i wondered when i spoke to you this afternoon you were playing it close too close i thought considering where you were and the equipment you were using the rooms and the equipment proved secure casset told me later that the agency doesnt want any traceable records of anything that takes place over there and thats the best guarantee you can ask for no bugs no phone intercepts nothing believe me i breathed a lot easier when i heard that then whats the problem why are you stopping because i have to figure out another admiral before i move any further into medusa territory atkinson our impeccable wasp ambassador to the court of st jamess in london was very clear in his panic he pulled the masks off burton and teagarten in brussels so he said teagarten could handle the agency if anything about the old saigon surfacedbecause he was very tight with the top max at langley and top max is the washington euphemism for maximumclassified security and where langley is concerned thats the director of central intelligence thats also peter holland you told me this morning hed have no problem wasting any member of medusa anyone can say anything but would he across the atlantic in the old paris suburb of neuillysurseine an old man in a dark threadbare suit trudged up the concrete path toward the entrance of the sixteenthcentury cathedral known as the church of the blessed sacrament the bells in the tower above tolled the first angelus and the man stopped in the morning sunlight blessing himself and whispering to the sky angelus domini nuntiavit mariae with his right hand he blew a kiss to the basrelief crucifix atop the stone archway and proceeded up the steps and through the huge doors of the cathedral aware that two robed priests eyed him with distaste i apologize for defiling your rich parish you tightassed snobs he thought as he lit a candle and placed it in the prayer rack but christ made it clear that he preferred me to you the meek shall inherit the earthwhat you havent stolen of it the old man moved cautiously down the center aisle his right hand gripping the backs of successive pews for balance his left fingering the rim of his outsized collar and slipping down to his tie so as to make sure the knot had not somehow come apart his woman was so weak now that she could barely fold the damn thing together but as in the old days she insisted on putting the finishing touches on his appearance before he went to work she was still a good woman they had both laughed remembering the time she swore at his cuff links over forty years ago because she had put too much starch in his shirt that night so long ago she had wanted him to look the proper bureaucrat when he went to the whoremongering oberführers headquarters on the rue st lazare carrying a briefcasea briefcase that left behind had blown up half the block and twenty years later one winter afternoon shed had trouble making his stolen expensive overcoat hang properly on his shoulders before he set off to rob the grande banque louis ix on the madeleine run by an educated but unappreciative former member of the résistance who refused him a loan those were the good times followed by bad times and bad health which led to worse timesin truth destitute times until a man came along a strange man with an odd calling and an even odder unwritten contract after that respect returned in the form of sufficient money for decent food and acceptable wine for clothes that fit making his woman look pretty again and most important for the doctors who made his woman feel better the suit and shirt he wore today had been dug out of a closet in many ways he and his woman were like the actors in a provincial touring company they had costumes for their various roles it was their business today was business this morning with the bells of the angelus was business the old man awkwardly only partially genuflected in front of the holy cross and knelt down in the first seat of the sixth row from the altar his eyes on his watch two and a half minutes later he raised his head and as unobtrusively as possible glanced around his weakened sight had adjusted to the dim light of the cathedral he could see not well but clearly enough there were no more than twenty worshipers scattered about most in prayer the others staring in meditation at the enormous gold crucifix on the altar yet these were not what he was looking for and then he saw what he was seeking and knew that everything was on schedule a priest in a priestly black suit walked down the far left aisle and disappeared beyond the dark red drapes of the apse the old man again looked at his watch for everything now was timing that was the way of the monseigneurthat was the way of the jackal again two minutes passed and the aged courier got unsteadily up from his pew sidestepped into the aisle genuflected as best his body would permit and made his way step by imperfect step to the second confessional booth on the left he pulled back the curtain and went inside angelus domini he whispered kneeling and repeating the words he had spoken several hundred times over the past fifteen years angelus domini child of god replied the unseen figure behind the black latticework the blessing was accompanied by a low rattling cough are your days comfortable made more so by an unknown friend my friend what does the doctor say about your woman he says to me what he does not say to her thanks be for the mercy of christ it appears that against the odds i will outlive her the wasting sickness is spreading my sympathies how long does she have a month no more than two soon she will be confined to her bed soon the contract between us will be void why is that you will have no further obligations to me and i accept that youve been good to us and ive saved a little and my wants are few frankly knowing whats facing me im feeling terribly tired you insufferable ingrate whispered the voice behind the confessional screen after all ive done all ive promised you i beg your pardon would you die for me of course thats our contract then conversely you will live for me if thats what you want naturally i will i simply wanted you to know that soon i would no longer be a burden to you i am easily replaced do not presume never with me the anger erupted in a hollow cough a cough that seemed to confirm the rumor that had spread through the dark streets of paris the jackal himself was ill perhaps deathly ill you are our life our respect why should i do that you just did nevertheless i have an assignment for you that will ease your womans departure for both of you you will have a holiday in a lovely part of the world the two of you together you will pick up the papers and the money at the usual place where are we going if i may ask to the caribbean island of montserrat your instructions will be delivered to you there at the blackburne airport follow them precisely of course again if i may ask what is my objective to find and befriend a mother and two children then what kill them brendan prefontaine former federal judge of the first circuit court of massachusetts walked out of the boston five bank on school street with fifteen thousand dollars in his pocket it was a heady experience for a man who had lived an impecunious existence for the past thirty years since his release from prison he rarely had more than fifty dollars on his person this was a very special day yet it was more than very special it was also very disturbing because he had never thought for an instant that randolph gates would pay him a sum anywhere near the amount he had demanded gates had made an enormous error because by acceding to the demand he had revealed the gravity of his endeavors he had crossed over from ruthless albeit nonfatal greed into something potentially quite lethal prefontaine had no idea who the woman and the children were or what their relationship was to lord randolph of gates but whoever they were and whatever it was dandy randy meant them no good an irreproachable zeuslike figure in the legal world did not pay a disbarred discredited deniable alcoholic scum like one brendan patrick pierre prefontaine an outrageous sum of money because his soul was with the archangels of heaven rather that soul was with the disciples of lucifer and since this was obviously the case it might be profitable for the scum to pursue a little knowledge for as the bromide declared a little knowledge is a dangerous thingfrequently more so in the eyes of the beholder than in the one possessing scant tidbits of information so slanted as to appear many times more fifteen thousand today might well become fifty thousand tomorrow ifif a scum flew to the island of montserrat and began asking questions besides thought the judge the irish in him chuckling the french sector in minor rebellion he had not had a vacation in years good christ it was enough keeping body and soul together who thought of an unenforced suspension of the hustle so brendan patrick pierre prefontaine hailed a taxi which he had not done sober for at least ten years and directed the skeptical driver to take him to louiss mens store at faneuil hall you got the scratch old man more than enough to get you a haircut and cure the acne on your pubescent face young fellow drive on ben hur im in a hurry the clothes were off the racks but they were expensive racks and after he had shown a roll of hundreddollar bills the purplelipped clerk was extremely cooperative a midsized suit case of burnished leather soon held casual apparel and prefontaine discarded his wornout suit shirt and shoes for a new outfit within the hour he looked not unlike a man he had known years ago the honorable brendan p prefontaine he had always dropped the second p for pierre for obvious reasons another taxi took him to his rooming house in jamaica plains where he picked up a few essentials including his passport which he always kept active for rapid exitspreferable to prison wallsand then delivered him to logan airport this driver having no concern regarding his ability to pay the fare clothes of course never made the man thought brendan but they certainly helped to convince dubious underlings at logans information desk he was told that three airlines out of boston serviced the island of montserrat he asked which counter was the nearest and then bought a ticket for the next available flight brendan patrick pierre prefontaine naturally flew first class the air france steward rolled the wheelchair slowly gently through the ramp and onto the jet in pariss orly airport the frail woman in the chair was elderly and overly madeup with an imbalance of rouge she wore an outsized feather hat made of australian cockatoo she might have been i a caricature except for the large eyes beneath the bangs of gray hair imperfectly dyed redeyes alive and knowing and filled with humor it was as if she were saying to all who observed her forget it mes amis he likes me this way and thats all i care about i dont give a pile of merde about you or your opinions the he referred to the old man walking cautiously beside her every now and then touching her shoulder lovingly as well as perhaps for balance but in the touch there was a volume of poetry that was theirs alone closer inspection revealed a sporadic welling of tears in his eyes that he promptly wiped away so she could not see them il est ici mon capitaine announced the steward to the senior pilot who greeted his two preboarding passengers at the aircrafts entrance the captain reached for the womans left hand and touched his lips to it then stood erect and solemnly saluted the balding grayhaired old man with the small legion dhonneur medal in his lapel it is an honor monsieur said the captain this aircraft is my command but you are my commander they shook hands and the pilot continued if theres anything the crew and i can do to make the flight most comfortable for you dont hesitate to ask monsieur youre very kind we are all beholdenall of us all of france it was nothing really to be singled out by le grand charles himself as a true hero of the résistance is hardly nothing age cannot dull such glory the captain snapped his fingers addressing three stew ardesses in the stillempty firstclass cabin quickly mesdemoiselles make everything perfect for a brave warrior of france and his lady so the killer with many aliases was escorted to the wide bulkhead on the left where his woman was gently transferred from the wheelchair to the seat on the aisle his was next to the window their trays were set up and a chilled bottle of cristal was brought in their honor and for their enjoyment the captain raised the first glass and toasted the couple he returned to the flight deck as the old woman winked at her man the wink wicked and filled with laughter in moments the passengers began boarding the plane a number of whom glancing appreciatively at the elderly man and wife in the front row for the rumors had spread in the air france lounge a great hero le grand charles himself in the alps he held off six hundred bocheor was it a thousand as the enormous jet raced down the runway and with a thump lumbered off the ground into the air the old hero of francewhose only heroics he could recall from the résistance were based on theft survival insults to his woman and staying out of whatever army or labor force that might draft himreached into his pocket for his papers the passport had his picture duly inserted but that was the only item he recognized the restname date and place of birth occupationall were unfamiliar and the attached list of honors well they were formidable totally out of character but in case anyone should ever refer to them he had better restudy the facts so he could at least nod in selfeffacing modesty he had been assured that the individual originally possessing the name and the achievements had no living relatives and few friends and had disappeared from his apartment in marseilles supposedly on a world trip from which he presumably would not return the jackals courier looked at the namehe must remember it and respond whenever it was spoken it should not be difficult for it was such a common name and so he repeated it silently to himself over and over again jean pierre fontaine jean pierre fontaine jean pierre a sound sharp abrasive it was wrong not normal not part of a hotels routine noise of hollow drumming at night bourne grabbed the weapon by his pillow and rolled out of bed in his shorts steadying himself by the wall it came again a single loud knock on the bedroom door of the suite he shook his head trying to remember alex ill knock once jason lurched half in sleep to the door his ear against the wood yes open this damn thing before somebody sees me came conklins muffled voice from the corridor bourne did so and the retired field officer limped quickly into the room treating his cane as if he loathed it boy are you out of training he exclaimed as he sat on the foot of the bed ive been standing there tapping for at least a couple of minutes i didnt hear you delta would have jason bourne would have david webb didnt give me another day and you wont find david webb talk i want you better than talk then stop talking and tell me why youre hereat whatever time it is when last i looked i met casset on the road at threetwenty i had to gimp through a bunch of woods and climb over a goddamned fence what you heard me a fence try it with your foot in cement you know i once won the fiftyyard dash when i was in high school cut the digression what happened oh i hear webb again what happened and while youre at it who the hell is this casset you keep talking about the only man i trust in virginia he and valentino who theyre analysts but theyre straight what never mind jesus there are times when i wish i could get pissed alex why are you here conklin looked up from the bed as he angrily gripped his cane ive got the books on our philadelphians thats why who are they no thats not why i mean its interesting but its not why im here then why asked jason crossing to a chair next to a window and sitting down frowning perplexed my erudite friend from cambodia and beyond doesnt climb over fences with his foot in cement at three oclock in the morning unless he thinks he has to i had to which tells me nothing please tell its desole whats the soul not the desole youve lost me hes the keeper of the keys at langley nothing happens that he doesnt know about and nothing gets done in the area of research that he doesnt pass on im still lost were in deep shit that doesnt help me at all webb again would you rather i took a nerve out of your neck all right all right let me get my breath conklin dropped his cane on the rug i didnt even trust the freight elevator i stopped two floors below and walked up because were in deep shit yes why because of this desole correct mr bourne steven desole the man who has his finger on every computer at langley the one person who can spin the disks and put your old virginal aunt grace in jail as a hooker if he wants her there whats your point hes the connection to brussels to teagarten at nato casset learned down in the cellars that hes the only connectionthey even have an access code bypassing everyone else what does it mean casset doesnt know but hes goddamned angry how much did you tell him the minimum that i was working on some possibles and teagartens name came up in an odd waymost likely a diversion or used by someone trying to impress someone elsebut i wanted to know who he talked to at the agency frankly figuring it was peter holland i asked charlie to play it out in the dark which i assume means confidentially ten times that casset is the sharpest knife in langley i didnt have to say any more than i did he got the message now hes also got a problem he didnt have yesterday whats he going to do i asked him not to do anything for a couple of days and thats what he gave me fortyeight hours to be precise and then hes going to confront desole he cant do that said bourne firmly whatever these people are hiding we can use it to pull out the jackal use them to pull him out as others like them used me thirteen years ago conklin stared first down at the floor then up at jason bourne it comes down to the almighty ego doesnt it he said the bigger the ego the bigger the fear the bigger the bait the bigger the fish completed jason interrupting a long time back you told me that carloss spine was as big as his head which had to be swollen all out of proportion for him to be in the business hes in that was true then and its true now if we can get any one of these high government profiles to send a message to himnamely to come after me kill mehell jump at it do you know why i just told you ego sure thats part of it but theres something else its the respect thats eluded carlos for more than twenty years starting with moscow cutting him loose and telling him to get lost hes made millions but his clients have mainly been the crud of the earth for all the fear hes engendered he still remains a punk psychopath no legends have been built around him only contempt and at this stage its got to be driving him close to the edge the fact that hes coming after me to settle a thirteenyearold score supports what im saying im vital to himhis killing me is vitalbecause i was the product of our covert operations thats who he wants to show up show that hes better than all of us put together it could also be because he still thinks you can identify him i thought that at first too but after thirteen years and nothing from mewell i had to think again so you moved into mo panovs territory and came up with a psychiatric profile its a free country compared with most yes but wheres all this leading us because i know im right thats hardly an answer nothing can be false or faked insisted bourne leaning forward in the armchair his elbows on his bare knees his hands clasped carlos would find the contrivance its the first thing hell look for our medusans have to be genuine and genuinely panicked theyre both i told you that to the point where theyd actually consider making contact with someone like the jackal that i dont know that well never know broke in jason until we learn what theyre hiding but if we start the disks spinning at langley desole will find out and if hes part of whatever the hell it is hell alert the others then therell be no research at langley ive got enough to go on anyway just get me addresses and private telephone numbers you can do that cant you certainly thats lowlevel what are you going to do bourne smiled and spoke quietly even gently how about storming their houses or sticking needles in their asses between the appetizers and the entrées now i hear jason bourne so be it marie st jacques webb greeted the caribbean morning by stretching in bed andlooking over at the crib several feet away alison was deep in sleep which she had not been four or five hours ago the little dear had been a basket case then so much so that maries brother johnny had knocked on the door walked cowardly inside and asked if he could do anything which he profoundly trusted he could not how are you at changing a nasty diaper i dont even want to think about it said st jacques fleeing now however she heard his voice through the shutters outside she also knew that she was meant to hear it he was enticing her son jamie into a race in the pool and speaking so loudly he could be heard on the big island of montserrat marie literally crawled out of bed headed for the bathroom and four minutes later ablutions completed her auburn hair brushed and wearing a bathrobe walked out through the shuttered door to the patio overlooking the pool well hi there mare shouted her tanned darkhaired handsome younger brother beside her son in the water i hope we didnt wake you up we just wanted to take a swim so you decided to let the british coastal patrols in plymouth know about it hey come on its almost nine oclock thats late in the islands hello mommy uncle johns been showing me how to scare off sharks with a stick your uncle is full of terribly important information that i hope to god youll never use theres a pot of coffee on the table mare and mrs cooper will make you whatever you like for breakfast coffees fine johnny the telephone rang last nightwas it david himself replied the brother and you and i are going to talk come on jamie up we go grip the ladder what about the sharks you got em all buddy go get yourself a drink johnny orange juice theres a pitcher in the kitchen john st jacques walked around the rim of the pool and up the steps to the bedroom patio as his nephew raced into the house marie watched her brother approach noting the similarities between him and her husband both were tall and muscular both had in their strides an absence of compromise but where david usually won johnny more often than not lost and she did not know why or why david had such trust in his younger brotherinlaw when the two older st jacques sons would appear to be more responsible davidor was it jason bourne never discussed the question in depth he simply laughed it off and said johnny had a streak in him that appealed to davidor was it bourne lets level said the youngest st jacques sitting down the water dripping off his body onto the patio what kind of trouble is david in he couldnt talk on the phone and you were in no shape last night for an extended chat whats happened the jackal the jackals whats happened christ exploded the brother after all these years after all these years repeated marie her voice drifting off how far has that bastard gotten davids in washington trying to find out all we know for certain is that he dug up alex conklin and mo panov from the horrors of hong kong and kowloon she told him about the false telegrams and the trap at the amusement park in baltimore i presume alex has them all under protection or whatever they call it around the clock im sure outside of ourselves and mcallister alex and mo are the only two people still alive who know that david wasoh jesus i cant even say the name marie slammed the coffee mug down on the patio table easy sis st jacques reached for her hand placing his on top of hers conklin knows what hes doing david told me that alex was the bestfield man he called himthat ever worked for the americans you dont understand johnny cried marie trying to control her voice and emotions her wide eyes denying the attempt david never said that david webb never knew that jason bourne said it and hes back that icecold calculating monster they created is back in davids head you dont know what its like with a look in those unfocused eyes that see things i cant seeor with a tone of voice a quiet freezing voice i dont knowand im suddenly with a stranger st jacques held up his free hand telling her to stop come on he said softly the children jamie she looked frantically around no you what do you expect david to do crawl inside a wing or ming dynasty vase and pretend his wife and children arent in dangerthat only he is whether you ladies like it or not we boys still think its up to us to keep the big cats from the cave we honestly believe were more equipped we revert to those strengths the ugliest of them of course because we have to thats what davids doing when did little brother get so philosophical asked marie studying john st jacquess face that aint philosophy girl i just know it most men doapologies to the feminist crowd dont apologize most of us wouldnt have it any other way would you believe that your big scholarly sister who called a lot of economic shots in ottawa still yells like hell when she sees a mouse in our country kitchen and goes into panic if its a rat certain bright women are more honest than others ill accept what you say johnny but youre missing my point davids been doing so well these last five years every month just a little bit better than the last hell never be totally cured we all know thathe was damaged too severelybut the furies his own personal furies have almost disappeared the solitary walks in the woods when hed come back with hands bruised from attacking tree trunks the quiet stifled tears in his study late at night when he couldnt remember what he was or what hed done thinking the worst of himselfthey were gone johnny there was real sunlight do you know what i mean yes i do said the brother solemnly whats happening now could bring them all back thats whats frightening me so then lets hope its over quickly marie stopped once again studying her brother hold it little bro i know you too well youre pulling back not a bit yes you are you and davidi never understood our two older brothers so solid so on top of everything perhaps not intellectually but certainly pragmatically yet he turned to you why johnny lets not go into it said st jacques curtly removing his hand from his sisters but i have to this is my life hes my life there cant be any more secrets where hes concernedi cant stand any more why you st jacques leaned back in the patio chair his stretched fingers now covering his forehead he raised his eyes an unspoken plea in them all right i know where youre coming from do you remember six or seven years ago i left our ranch saying i wanted to try things on my own certainly i think you broke both moms and dads hearts lets face it you were always kind of the favorite i was always the kid interrupted the youngest st jacques playing out some moronic bonanza where my thirtyyearold brothers were blindly taking orders from a pontificating bigoted french canadian father whose only smarts came with his money and his land there was more to him than that but i wont arguefrom a kids viewpoint you couldnt mare you did the same thing and sometimes you didnt come home for over a year i was busy so was i what did you do i killed two men two animals whod killed a friend of mineraped her and killed her what keep your voice down my god what happened i didnt want to call home so i reached your husband my friend david who didnt treat me like a braindamaged kid at the time it seemed like a logical thing to do and it was the best decision i could have made he was owed favors by his government and a quiet team of bright people from washington and ottawa flew up to james bay and i was acquitted selfdefense and it was just that he never said a word to me i begged him not to so thats why but i still dont understand its not difficult mare a part of him knows i can kill will kill if i think its necessary a telephone rang inside the house as marie stared at her younger brother before she could get her voice back an elderly black woman emerged from the door to the kitchen its for you mr john its that pilot over on the big island he says its real important mon thanks mrs cooper said st jacques getting out of the chair and walking rapidly down to an extension phone by the pool he spoke for several moments looked up at marie slammed down the telephone and rushed back up to his sister pack up youre getting out of here why was that the man who flew us hes back from martinique and just learned that someone was asking questions at the airport last night about a woman and two small children none of the crews said anything but that may not last quickly my god where will we go over to the inn until we think of something else theres only one road and my own tonton macoute patrols it no one gets in or out mrs cooper will help you with alison hurry the telephone started ringing again as marie dashed through the bedroom door st jacques raced down the steps to the pool extension reaching it as mrs cooper once more stepped out of the kitchen its government house over in serrat mr john what the hell do they want shall i ask them never mind ill get it help my sister with the kids and pack everything they brought with them into the rover theyre leaving right away oh a bad time pity mon i was just getting to know the little babies bad time pity is right mumbled st jacques picking up the telephone yes hello john said the chief aide to the crown governor a man who had befriended the canadian developer and helped him through the maze of the colonys territorial regulations can i call you back henry im kind of harried at the moment im afraid theres no time chap this is straight from the foreign office they want our immediate cooperation and it wont do you any harm either oh it seems theres an old fellow and his wife arriving on air frances connecting flight from antigua at tenthirty and whitehall wants the redcarpet treatment apparently the old boy had a splendid war with a slew of decorations and worked with a lot of our chaps across the channel henry im really in a hurry whats any of this got to do with me well i rather assumed you might have more of an idea about that than we do probably one of your rich canadian guests perhaps a frenchie from montreal who came out of the résistance and who thought of you insults will only get you a bottle of superior french canadian wine what do you want put up our hero and his lady in the finest accommodations youve got with a room for the frenchspeaking nurse weve assigned to them on an hours notice well chap our buns could be in a collective sling if you know what i meanand your so vital but erratic telephone service does depend on a degree of crown intervention if you also know what i mean henry youre a terrific negotiator you so politely kick a person so accurately where it hurts whats our heros name quickly please our names are jean pierre and regine fontaine monsieur le directeur and here are our passports said the softspoken old man inside the immigration officers glassenclosed office the chief aide of the crown governor at his side my wife can be seen over there he added pointing through the window she is talking with the mademoiselle in the white uniform please monsieur fontaine protested the stocky black immigration official in a pronounced british accent this is merely an informal formality a stamping procedure if you like also to remove you from the inconvenience of so many admirers rumors have gone throughout the airport that a great man has arrived really fontaine smiled it was a pleasant smile oh but not to be concerned sir the press has been barred we know you want complete privacy and you shall have it really the old mans smile faded i was to meet someone here an associate you might say i must consult with confidentially i hope your most considerate arrangements do not prevent him from reaching me a small select group with proper standing and credentials will greet you in blackburnes honoredguest corridor monsieur fontaine said the crown governors chief aide may we proceed the reception line will be swift i assure you really that swift it was less than five minutes actually but five seconds would have been enough the first person the jackals courierkiller met was the beribboned crown governor himself as the queens royal representative embraced the hero in gallic style he whispered into jean pierre fontaines ear weve learned where the woman and her children were taken we are sending you there the nurse has your instructions the rest was somewhat anticlimactic for the old man especially the absence of the press he had never had his picture in the newspapers except as a felon morris panov md was a very angry man and he always tried to control his very angry moments because they never helped him or his patients at the moment however sitting at his office desk he was having difficulty curbing his emotions he had not heard from david webb he had to hear from him he had to talk to him what was happening could negate thirteen years of therapy couldnt they understand that no of course they couldnt it was not what interested them they had other priorities and did not care to be burdened by problems beyond their purview but he had to care the damaged mind was so fragile so given to setbacks the horrors of the past were so capable of taking over the present it could not happen with david he was so close to being as normal as he would ever be and who the hell was normal in this fuckedup world he could function wonderfully as a teacher he had neartotal recall where his scholarly expertise was called upon and he was remembering more and more as each year progressed but it could all blow apart with a single act of violence for violence was the way of life for jason bourne damn it was crippling enough that they even permitted david to stay around he had tried to explain the potential damage to alex but conklin had an irrefutable reply we cant stop him at least this way we can watch him protect him perhaps so they did not stint where protection was involvedthe guards down the hall from his office and on the roof of the building to say nothing of a temporary receptionist bearing arms as well as a strange computer attested to their concern still it would be so much better for david if he was simply sedated and flown down to his island retreat leaving the hunt for the jackal to the professionals panov suddenly caught himself as the realization swept over him there was no one more professional than jason bourne the doctors thoughts were interrupted by the telephone the telephone he could not pick up until all the security procedures were activated a trace was placed on the incoming call a scanner determined whether there were intercepts on the line and finally the identity of the caller was approved by panov himself his intercom buzzed he flipped the switch on his console yes all systems are cleared sir announced the temporary receptionist who was the only one in the office who would know the man on the line said his name was treadstone mr d treadstone ill take it said mo panov firmly and you can remove whatever other systems youve got on that machine out there this is doctorpatient confidentiality yes sir monitor is terminated its what never mind the psychiatrist picked up the phone and was barely able to keep from shouting why didnt you call me before this you son of a bitch i didnt want to give you cardiac arrest is that sufficient where are you and what are you doing at the moment thatll suffice lets see i rented a car and right now im a half a block from a town house in georgetown owned by the chairman of the federal trade commission talking to you on a pay phone for christs sake why alex will fill you in but what i want you to do is call marie on the island ive tried a couple of times since leaving the hotel but i cant get through tell her im fine that im perfectly fine and not to worry have you got that ive got it but i dont buy it you dont even sound like yourself you cant tell her that doctor if youre my friend you cant tell her anything like that stop it david this jekyllandhyde crap doesnt wash anymore dont tell her that not if youre my friend youre spiraling david dont let it happen come to me talk to me no time mo the fat cats limousine is parking in front of his house ive got to go to work jason the line went dead brendan patrick pierre prefontaine walked down the jets metal steps into the hot caribbean sun of montserrats blackburne airport it was shortly past three oclock in the afternoon and were it not for the many thousands of dollars on his person he might have felt lost it was remarkable how a supply of hundreddollar bills in various pockets made one feel so secure in truth he had to keep reminding himself that his loose changefifties twenties and tenswere in his right front trousers pocket so as not to make a mistake and either appear ostentatious or be a mark for some unprincipled hustler above all it was vital for him to keep a low profile to the point of insignificance he had to insignificantly ask significant questions around the airport regarding a woman and two small children who had arrived on a private aircraft the previous afternoon which was why to his astonishment and alarm he heard the absolutely adorable black female immigration clerk say to him after hanging up a telephone would you be so kind sir as to come with me please her lovely face lilting voice and perfect smile did nothing to allay the former judges fears far too many extremely guilty criminals had such assets is there something wrong with my passport young lady not that i can see sir then why the delay why not simply stamp it and allow me to proceed oh it is stamped and entry is permitted sir there is no problem then why please come with me sir they approached a large glassenclosed cubicle with a sign on the left window the gold letters announcing the occupant deputy director of immigration services the attractive clerk opened the door and again smiling gestured for the elderly visitor to go inside prefontaine did so suddenly terrified that he would be searched the money found and all manner of charges leveled against him he did not know which islands were involved in narcotics but if this was one of them the thousands of dollars in his pockets would be instantly suspect explanations raced through his mind as the clerk crossed to the desk handing his passport to the short heavyset deputy of immigration the woman gave brendan a last bright smile and went out the door closing it behind her mr brendan patrick pierre prefontaine intoned the immigration official reading the passport not that it matters said brendan kindly but with summoned authority however the mister is usually replaced with judgeas i say i dont believe its relevant under the circumstances or perhaps it is i really dont know did one of my law clerks make an error if so ill fly the whole group down to apologize oh not at all sirjudge replied the uniformed widegirthed black man with a distinct british accent as he rose from the chair and extended his hand over the desk actually it is i who may have made the error come now colonel we all do occasionally brendan gripped the officials hand then perhaps i may be on my way theres someone here i must meet thats what he said brendan released the hand i beg your pardon i may have to beg yours the confidentiality of course the what could we get to the point please i realize that privacy continued the official pronouncing the word as privvissy is of utmost importancethats been explained to usbut whenever we can be of assistance we try to oblige the crown extremely commendable brigadier but im afraid i dont understand the official needlessly lowered his voice a great man arrived here this morning are you aware of that im sure many men of stature come to your beautiful island it was highly recommended to me in fact ah yes the privvissy yes of course the privvissy agreed the exconvict judge wondering if the official had both his oars in the water could you be clearer well he said he was to meet someone an associate he had to consult with but after the very private reception lineno press of coursehe was taken directly to the charter that flew him to the out island and obviously never met the person he was to confidentially meet now am i clearer like boston harbor in a squall general very good i understand privvissy so all our personnel are alerted to the fact that the great mans friend might be seeking him here at the airportconfidentially of course of course not even a paddle thought brendan then i considered another possibility said the official in minor triumph suppose the great mans friend was also flying to our island for a rendezvous with the great man brilliant not without logic then it struck me to obtain the passenger manifests of all the incoming flights concentrating of course on those in first class which would be proper for the great mans associate clairvoyance mumbled the once and former judge and you selected me the name my good man pierre prefontaine my pious departed mother would no doubt take offense at your omitting the brendan patrick like the french the irish are quite sensitive in such matters but it was the family i understood that immediately you did pierre prefontaine jean pierre fontaine i am an expert on immigration procedures having studied the methods in many countries your own name is a fascinating example most honored judge wave after wave of immigrants flocked to the united states the melting pot of nations races and languages in the process names were altered combined or simply misunderstood by armies of confused overworked clerks but roots frequently survived and thus it was for you the family fontaine became prefontaine in america and the great mans associate was in reality an esteemed member of the american branch positively awesome muttered brendan eyeing the official as if he expected several male nurses to barge into the room with restraining equipment but isnt it possible that this is merely coincidence fontaine is a common name throughout france but as i understand it the prefontaines were distinctly centered around alsacelorraine yes of course said the deputy again lowering his voice rather than conceivably winking yet without any prior word whatsoever the quai dorsay in paris calls then the uks foreign office follows with instructionsa great man is soon to drop out of the sky acknowledge him honor him spirit him off to a remote resort known for its confidentialityfor that too is paramount the great one is to have total privvissy yet that same great warrior is anxious he is to confidentially meet with an associate he does not find perhaps the great man has secretsall great men do you know suddenly the thousands of dollars in prefontaines pockets felt very heavy washingtons four zero clearance in boston the quai dorsay in paris the foreign office in londonrandolph gates needlessly parting with an extraordinary amount of money out of sheer panic there was a pattern of strange convergence the strangest being the inclusion of a frightened unscrupulous attorney named gates was he an inclusion or an aberration what did it all mean you are an extraordinary man said brendan quickly covering his thoughts with rapid words your perceptions are nothing short of brilliant but you do understand that confidentiality is paramount i will hear no more honored judge exclaimed the deputy except to add that your appraisal of my abilities might not be lost on my superiors they will be made clear i assure you precisely where did my not too distant and distinguished cousin go a small out island where the seaplanes must land on the water its name is tranquility isle and the resort is called tranquility inn you will be personally thanked by those above you be assured of that and i shall personally clear you through customs brendan patrick pierre prefontaine carrying his suitcase of burnished leather walked out into the terminal of blackburne airport a bewildered man bewildered hell he was stunned he could not decide whether to take the next flight back to boston or to his feet were apparently deciding for him he found himself walking toward a counter beneath a large seablue sign with white lettering interisland airways it couldnt do any harm to inquire he mused then he would buy a ticket on the next plane to boston on the wall beyond the counter a list of nearby out isles was next to a larger column of the wellknown leeward and windward islands from st kitts and nevis south to the grenadines tranquility was sandwiched between canada cay and turtle rock two clerks both young one black and one white the former a young woman the latter a blondhaired man in his early twenties were talking quietly the girl approached may i help you sir im not really sure replied brendan hesitantly my schedules so unsettled but it seems i have a friend on tranquility isle at the inn sir yes apparently so does it take long to fly over there if the weathers clear no more than fifteen minutes but that would be an amphibious charter im not sure ones available until tomorrow morning sure there is babe interrupted the young man with small gold wings pinned crookedly on his white shirt im running over some supplies to johnny st jay pretty soon he added stepping forward hes not scheduled for today as of an hour ago he is pronto at that instant and with those words prefontaines eyes fell in astonishment on two stacks of cartons moving slowly down interislands luggage carousel toward the exterior loading area even if he had the time to debate with himself he knew his decision was made id like to purchase a ticket on that flight if i may he said watching the boxes of gerbers assorted baby foods and pampers medium diapers disappear into the hold he had found the unknown woman with the small male child and the infant routine secondhand inquiries at the federal trade commission confirmed the fact that its chairman albert armbruster did indeed have ulcers as well as high blood pressure and under doctors orders left the office and returned home whenever discomfort struck him which was why alex conklin telephoned him after a generally overindulgent lunchalso establishedwith an update of the snake lady crisis as with alexs initial call catching armbruster in the shower he anonymously told the shaken chairman that someone would be in touch with him later in the dayeither at the office or at home the contact would identify himself simply as cobra use all the banal trigger words you can come up with was the gospel according to st conklin in the meantime armbruster was instructed to talk to no one those are orders from the sixth fleet oh christ thus albert armbruster called for his chariot and was driven home in discomfort further nausea was in store for the chairman however as jason bourne was waiting for him good afternoon mr armbruster said the stranger pleasantly as the chairman struggled out of the limousine the door held open by the chauffeur yes what armbrusters response was immediate unsure i merely said good afternoon my names simon we met at the white house reception for the joint chiefs several years ago i wasnt there broke in the chairman emphatically oh the stranger arched his brows his voice still pleasant but obviously questioning mr armbruster the chauffeur had closed the door and now turned courteously to the chairman will you be needing no no said armbruster again interrupting youre relievedi wont need you anymore today tonight same time tomorrow morning sir yes tomorrowunless youre told otherwise im not a well man check with the office yes sir the chauffeur tipped his visored cap and climbed back into the front seat im sorry to hear that said the stranger holding his place as the limousines engine was started and the automobile rolled away what oh you i was never at the white house for that damned reception perhaps i was mistaken yes well nice to see you again said armbruster anxiously impatiently hurrying to the steps that led up to his georgetown house then again im quite sure admiral burton introduced us what the chairman spun around what did you just say this is a waste of time continued jason bourne the pleasantness gone from his voice and his face im cobra oh jesus im not a well man armbruster repeated the statement in a hoarse whisper snapping his head up to look at the front of his house to the windows and the door youll be far worse unless we talk added jason following the chairmans eyes shall it be up there in your house no cried armbruster she yaps all the time and wants to know everything about everybody then blabs all over town exaggerating everything i assume youre talking about your wife all of em they dont know when to keep their traps shut it sounds like theyre starved for conversation what never mind ive got a car down the block are you up to a drive i damn well better be well stop at the drugstore down the street theyve got my prescription on file who the hell are you i told you answered bourne cobra its a snake oh jesus whispered albert armbruster the pharmacist complied rapidly and jason quickly drove to a neighborhood bar he had chosen an hour before should one be necessary it was dark and full of shadows the booths deep the banquettes high isolating those meeting one another from curious glances the ambience was important for it was vital that he stare into the eyes of the chairman when he asked questions his own eyes icecold demanding threatening delta was back cain had returned jason bourne was in full command david webb forgotten we have to cover ourselves said the cobra quietly after their drinks arrived in terms of damage control that means we have to know how much harm each of us could do under the amytals what the hell does that mean asked armbruster swallowing most of his gin and tonic while wincing and holding his stomach drugs chemicals truth serums what this isnt your normal ball game said bourne remembering conklins words weve got to cover all of the bases because there arent any constitutional rights in this series so who are you the chairman of the federal trade commission belched and brought his glass briefly to his lips his hand trembling some kind of oneman hit team john doe knows something so hes shot in an alley dont be ridiculous anything like that would be totally counterproductive it would only fuel those trying to find us leave a trail then what are you talking about saving our lives which includes our reputations and our lifestyles youre one cold prick how do we do that lets take your case shall we youre not a well man by your own admission you could resign under doctors orders and we take care of youmedusa takes care of you jasons imagination floated making quick sharp forays into reality and fantasy swiftly searching for the words that might be found in the gospel according to st alex youre known to be a wealthy man so a villa might be purchased in your name or perhaps a caribbean island where youd be completely secure no one can reach you no one can talk to you unless you agree which would mean predetermined interviews harmless and even favorable results guaranteed such things are not impossible pretty sterile existence in my opinion said armbruster me and the yapper all by ourselves id kill her not at all went on the cobra thered be constant distractions guests of your choosing could be flown to wherever you are other women also either of your choice or selected by those who respect your tastes life goes on much as before some inconveniences some pleasant surprises the point is that youd be protected inaccessible and therefore were also protected the rest of us but as i say that option is merely hypothetical at this juncture in my case frankly its a necessity because theres little i dont know i leave in a matter of days until then im determining who goes and who stays how much do you know mr armbruster im not involved with the daytoday operations naturally i deal with the big picture like the others i get a monthly coded telex from the banks in zurich listing the deposits and the companies were gaining control ofthats about it so far you dont get a villa ill be damned if i want one and if i do ill buy it myself ive got close to a hundred million american in zurich bourne controlled his astonishment and simply stared at the chairman i wouldnt repeat that he said who am i going to tell the yapper how many of the others do you know personally asked the cobra practically none of the staff but then they dont know me either hell they dont know anybody and while were on the subject take you for instance ive never heard of you i figure you work for the board and i was told to expect you but i dont know you i was hired on a very special basis my backgrounds deepcover security like i said i figured what about the sixth fleet interrupted bourne moving away from the subject of himself i see him now and then but i dont think weve exchanged a dozen words hes military im civilianvery civilian you werent once where it all began the hell i wasnt no uniform ever made a soldier and it sure didnt with me what about a couple of generals one in brussels the other at the pentagon they were career men they stayed in i wasnt and i didnt we have to expect leaks rumors said bourne almost aimlessly his eyes now wandering but we cant permit the slightest hint of military orientation you mean like in junta style never replied bourne once more staring at armbruster that kind of thing creates whirlwinds forget it whispered the chairman of the federal trade commission angrily interrupting the sixth fleet as you call him calls the shots only here and only because its convenient hes a bloodandguts admiral with a whizbang record and a lot of clout where we want it but thats in washington not anywhere else i know that and you know it said jason emphatically the emphasis covering his bewilderment but someone whos been in a protection program for over fifteen years is putting together his own scenario and that comes out of saigoncommand saigon it may have come out of saigon but it sure as hell didnt stay there the soldier boys couldnt run with it we all know that but i see what you mean you tie in pentagon brass with anything like us the freaks are in the streets and the bleedingheart fairies in congress have a field day suddenly a dozen subcommittees are in session which we cant tolerate added bourne agreed said armbruster are we any closer to learning the name of the bastard whos putting this scenario together closer not close hes been in contact with langley but on what level we dont know langley for christs sake weve got someone over there he can squelch it and find out who the son of a bitch is desole offered the cobra simply thats right armbruster leaned forward there is very little you dont know that connections very quiet what does desole say nothing we cant touch him replied jason suddenly frantically reaching for a credible answer he had been david webb too long conklin was right he wasnt thinking fast enough then the words came part of the truth a dangerous part but credible and he could not lose credibility he thinks hes being watched and were to stay away from him no contact whatsoever until he says otherwise what happened the chairman gripped his glass his eyes rigid bulging someone in the cellars learned that teagarten in brussels has an access fax code directly to desole bypassing routine confidential traffic stupid goddamned soldier boys spat out armbruster give em gold braid and they prance around like debutantes and want every new toy in town faxes access codes jesus he probably punched the wrong numbers and got the naacp desole says hes building a cover and can handle it but its no time for him to go around asking questions especially in this area hell check quietly on everything he can and if he learns something hell reach us but were not to reach him wouldnt you know itd be a lousy soldier boy who puts us out on a limb if it wasnt for that jackass with his access code we wouldnt have a problem everything would be taken care of but he does exist and the problemthe crisiswont go away said bourne flatly i repeat we have to cover ourselves some of us will have to leavedisappear at least for a while for the good of all of us the chairman of the federal trade commission leaned back in the booth his expression pensively disagreeable yeah well let me tell you something simon or whatever your name is youre checking out the wrong people were businessmen some of us rich enough or egotistical enough or for other reasons willing to work for government pay but first were businessmen with investments all over the place were also appointed not elected and that means nobody expects full financial disclosures do you see what im driving at im not sure said jason instantly concerned that he was losing control losing the threat ive been away too long and albert armbruster was not a fool he was given to firstlevel panic but the second level was colder far more analytical what are you driving at get rid of our soldier boys buy them villas or a couple of caribbean islands and put them out of reach give em their own little courts and let em play kings thats what theyre all about anyway operate without them asked bourne trying to conceal his astonishment you said it and i agree any hint of big brass and were in big trouble it goes under the heading of military industrial complex which freely translated means militaryindustrial collusion again armbruster leaned forward over the table we dont need them anymore get rid of them there could be very loud objections no way weve got em by their brass balls ill have to think about it theres nothing to think about in six months well have the controls we need in europe jason bourne stared at the chairman of the federal trade commission what controls he thought to himself for what reason why ill drive you home he said i talked to marie said conklin from the agency garden apartment in virginia shes at the inn not at your house how come asked jason at a gasstation pay phone on the outskirts of manassas she wasnt too clear i think it was lunchtime or nap timeone of those times when mothers are never clear i could hear your kids in the background they were loud pal what did she say alex it seems your brotherinlaw wanted it that way she didnt elaborate and other than sounding like one harried mommy she was the perfectly normal marie i know and lovewhich means she only wanted to hear about you which means you told her i was perfectly fine didnt you hell yes i said you were holed up under guard going over a lot of computer printouts sort of a variation on the truth johnny must have had his talk with her she told him whats happened so he moved them all to his exclusive bunker his what you never saw tranquility inn or did you frankly i cant remember whether you did or not panov and i saw only the plans and the site that was four years ago we havent been back since at least i havent nobodys asked me ill let that pass because youve had a standing invitation since we got the place anyway you know its on the beach and the only way to get there except by water is up a dirt road so filled with rocks no normal car could make it twice everything is flown in by plane or brought over by boat almost nothing from the town and the beach is patrolled interrupted conklin johnny isnt taking any chances its why i sent them down there ill call her later what about now said alex what about armbruster lets put it this way replied bourne his eyes drifting up to the white plastic shell of the pay phone what does it mean when a man who has a hundred million dollars in zurich tells me that medusapoint of origin command saigon emphasis on command which is hardly civilianshould get rid of the military because snake lady doesnt need them any longer i dont believe it said the retired intelligence officer in a quiet doubting voice he didnt oh yes he did he even called them soldier boys and he wasnt memorializing them in song he verbally dismissed the admirals and the generals as goldbraided debutantes who wanted every new toy in town certain senators on the armed services committee would agree with that assessment concurred alex theres more when i reminded him that snake lady came out of saigoncommand saigonhe was very clear he said it may have but it sure as hell didnt stay there because and this is a direct quotethe soldier boys couldnt run with it thats a provocative statement did he tell you why they couldnt run with it no and i didnt ask i was supposed to know the answer i wish you did i like less and less the sound of what im hearing its big and its ugly how did the hundred million come up i told him medusa might get him a villa someplace out of the country where he couldnt be reached if we thought it was necessary he wasnt too interested and said if he wanted one hed buy it himself he had a hundred million american in zuricha fact i think i was also expected to know that was all just a simple little one hundred million not entirely he told me that like everybody else he gets a monthly telexin codefrom the banks in zurich listing his deposits obviously theyve been growing big ugly and growing added conklin anything else not that i particularly want to hear it im frightened enough two more items and youd better have some fear in reserve armbruster said that along with the deposit telexes he gets a listing of the companies theyre gaining control of what companies what was he talking about good god if i had asked my wife and children might have to attend a private memorial service no casket in evidence because i wouldnt be there youve got more to tell me tell me our illustrious chairman of the federal trade commission said that the ubiquitous we could get rid of the military because in six months we would have all the controls we needed in europe alex what controls what are we dealing with there was silence on the unbroken line and jason bourne did not interrupt david webb wanted to shout in defiance and confusion but there was no point he was a nonperson finally conklin spoke i think were dealing with something we cant handle he said softly his words barely audible over the phone this has to go upstairs david we cant keep it to ourselves goddamn you youre not talking to david bourne did not raise his voice in anger he did not have to its tone was enough this isnt going anywhere unless or until i say it does and i may not ever say it understand me field man i dont owe anyone anything especially not the movers and the shakers in this city they moved and shook my wife and me too much for any concessions where our lives or the lives of our children are concerned i intend to use everything i can learn for one purpose and one purpose only thats to draw out the jackal and kill him so we can climb out of our personal hell and go on living i know now that this is the way to do it armbruster talked tough and he probably is tough but underneath hes frightened theyre all frightenedpanicked as you put itand you were right present them with the jackal and hes a solution they cant refuse present carlos with a client as rich and as powerful as our current medusa and its irresistible to himhes got the respect of the international big boys not just the crud of the world the fanatics of the left and right dont stand in my way dont for gods sake thats a threat isnt it stop it alex i dont want to talk like that but you just did its the reverse of paris thirteen years ago isnt it only now youll kill me because im the one who hasnt a memory the memory of what we did to you and marie thats my family out there cried david webb his voice tight sweat forming on his hairline as his eyes filled with tears theyre a thousand miles away from me and in hiding it cant be any other way because i wont risk letting them be harmed killed alex because thats what the jackal will do if he finds them its an island this week where is it next how many thousands of miles more and after that where will they gowhere will we go knowing what we know now we cant stophes after me that goddamned filthy psychopath is after me and everything weve learned about him tells us he wants a maximum kill his ego demands it and that kill includes my family no field man dont burden me with things i dont care aboutnot where they interfere with marie and the kidsim owed that much i hear you said conklin i dont know whether im hearing david or jason bourne but i hear you all right no reverse paris but we have to move fast and im talking to bourne now whats next where are you i judge about six or seven miles from general swaynes house replied jason breathing deeply the momentary anguish suppressed the coldness returning did you make the call two hours ago am i still cobra why not its a snake thats what i told armbruster he wasnt happy swayne will be less so but i sense something and i cant really explain it what do you mean im not sure but i have an idea that hes answerable to someone in the pentagon burton i suppose so i just dont know in his partial paralysis he reacted almost as if he was an onlooker someone involved but not in the middle of the game he slipped a couple of times and said things like well have to think about this and well have to confer confer with whom it was a oneonone conversation with my usual warning that he wasnt to talk to anyone his response was a lame editorial we meaning that the illustrious general was conferring with himself i dont buy it neither do i agreed jason im going to change clothes theyre in the car what bourne turned partially in the plastic shell of the pay phone and glanced around the gas station he saw what he hoped for a mens room in the side of the building you said that swayne lives on a large farm west of manassas correction interrupted alex he calls it a farm his neighbors and the tax rolls call it a twentyeightacre estate not bad for a career soldier from a lowermiddleclass family in nebraska who married a hairdresser in hawaii thirty years ago and supposedly bought his manse ten years ago on the strength of a very sizable inheritance from an untraceable benefactor an obscure wealthy uncle i couldnt find thats what made me curious swayne headed up the quartermaster corps in saigon and supplied medusa whats his place got to do with your changing clothes i want to look around ill get there while its light to see what its like from the road then when its dark ill pay him a surprise visit thatll be effective but why the looking around i like farms theyre so spread out and extended and i cant imagine why a professional soldier who knows that he can be transferred anywhere in the world at a moments notice would saddle himself with such a large investment the same as my reasoning except i was concerned about the how not the why your approach may be more interesting well see be careful he may have alarms and dogs things like that im prepared said jason bourne i did some shopping after i left georgetown the summer sun was low in the western sky as he slowed down the rental car and lowered the visor to keep from being blinded by the yellow globe of fire soon it would drop behind the shenandoah mountains twilight descending prelude to darkness and it was the darkness that jason bourne craved it was his friend and ally the blackness in which he moved swiftly with sure feet and alert hands and arms that served as sensors against all the impediments of nature the jungles had welcomed him in the past knowing that although he was an intruder he respected them and used them as a part of him he did not fear the jungles he embraced them for they protected him and allowed him passage to accomplish whatever his objective was he was at one with the junglesas he would have to be with the dense woods that flanked the estate of general norman swayne the main house was set back no less than the distance of two football fields from the country road a stockade fence separated the entrance on the right from the exit on the left both with iron gates fronting a deep drive that was basically an elongated uturn immediately bordering each opening was a profusion of tall trees and shrubbery that was in itself a natural extension of the stockade fence both left and right all that was missing were guardhouses at each point of entry and exit his mind floated back to china to beijing and the wild bird sanctuary where he had trapped a killer posing as jason bourne there had been a guardhouse then and a series of armed patrols in the dense forest and a madman a butcher who controlled an army of killers foremost among them the false jason bourne he had penetrated that deadly sanctuary crippled a small fleet of trucks and automobiles by plunging the blade of his knife into every tire then proceeded to take out each patrol in the jing shan forest until he found the torchlit clearing that held a swaggering maniac and his brigade of fanatics could he do it all today wondered bourne as he drove slowly past swaynes property for the third time his eyes absorbing everything he could see five years later thirteen years after paris he tried to evaluate the reality he was not the younger man that he had been in paris nor the more mature man in hong kong macao and beijing he was now fifty and he felt it every year of it he would not dwell on it there was too much else to think about and the twentyeight acres of general norman swaynes property were not the forest primeval of the jing shan sanctuary however as he had done on the primitive outskirts of beijing he drove the car off the country road deep into a mass of tall grass and foliage he climbed out and proceeded to cover the vehicle with bent and broken branches the rapidly descending darkness would complete the camouflage and with the darkness he would go to work he had changed his clothes in the mens room at the gas station black trousers below a black longsleeved skintight pullover and black thicksoled sneakers with heavy tread these were his working apparel the items he spread on the ground were his equipment the shopping he had done after leaving georgetown they included a longbladed hunting knife whose scabbard he threaded into his belt a dualchambered co pistol encased in a nylon shoulder holster that silently shot immobilizing darts into attacking animals such as pit bulls two flares designed to assist stranded drivers in brokendown cars to attract or deter other motorists a pair of small zeiss ikon x binoculars attached to his trousers by a velcro strip a penlight rawhide laces and finally pocketsized wire cutters in case there was a metal fence along with the automatic supplied by the central intelligence agency the gear was either lashed to his belt or concealed in his clothing the darkness came and jason bourne walked into the woods the white sheet of ocean spray burst up from the coral reef and appeared suspended the dark blue waters of the caribbean serving as a backdrop it was that hour of early evening a long sundown imminent when tranquility isle was bathed in alternating hot tropical colors pockets of shadows constantly changing with each imperceptible descent of the orange sun the resort complex of tranquility inn had seemingly been cut out of three adjacent rockstrewn hills above an elongated beach sandwiched between huge natural jetties of coral two rows of balconied pink villas with bright red roofs of terracotta extended from each side of the resorts central hub a large circular building of heavy stone and thick glass all the structures overlooking the water the villas connected by a white concrete path bordered by lowcut shrubbery and lined with ground lamps waiters in yellow guayabera jackets wheeled roomservice tables along the path delivering bottles and ice and canapés to tranquilitys guests the majority of whom sat on their individual balconies savoring the end of the caribbean day and as the shadows became more prominent other people unobtrusively appeared along the beach and on the long dock that extended out over the water these were neither guests nor service employees they were armed guards each dressed in a dark brown tropical uniform andagain unobtrusivelywith a mac machine pistol strapped to his belted waist on the opposite side of each jacket and hooked to the cloth was a pair of zeiss ikon x binoculars continuously used to scan the darkness the owner of tranquility inn was determined that it live up to its name on the large circular balcony of the villa nearest the main building and the attached glassenclosed dining room an elderly infirm woman sat in a wheelchair sipping a glass of château carbonnieux while drinking in the splendors of sundown she absently touched the bangs of her imperfectly dyed red hair as she listened she heard the voice of her man talking with the nurse inside then the sound of his less than emphatic footsteps as he walked out to join her my god she said in french im going to get pissed why not asked the jackals courier this is the place for it i see everything through a haze of disbelief myself you still will not tell me why the monseigneur sent you hereus here i told you im merely a messenger and i dont believe you believe its important for him but of no consequence for us enjoy my lovely you always call me that when you wont explain then you should learn from experience not to inquire is it not so it is not so my dear im dying well hear no more of that its true nevertheless you cannot keep it from me i dont worry for myself the pain will end you see but i worry about you you forever better than your circumstances michel no no you are jean pierre i must not forget that still i must concern myself this place these extraordinary lodgings this attention i think you will pay a terrible price my dear why do you say that its all so grand too grand somethings wrong you concern yourself too deeply no you deceive yourself too easily my brother claude has always said you take too much from the monseigneur one day the bill will be presented to you your brother claude is a sweet old man with feathers in his head its why the monseigneur gives him only the most insignificant assignments you send him out for a paper in montparnasse he ends up in marseilles not knowing how he got there the telephone inside the villa rang interrupting the jackals man he turned our new friend will get it he said shes a strange one added the old woman i dont trust her she works for the monseigneur really i havent had time to tell you she will relay his instructions the uniformed nurse her light brown hair pulled severely back into a bun appeared in the doorway monsieur it is paris she said her wide gray eyes conveying an urgency missing in her low understated voice thank you the jackals courier walked inside following the nurse to the telephone she picked it up and handed it to him this is jean pierre fontaine blessings upon you child of god said the voice several thousand miles away is everything suitable beyond description answered the old man it is so grand so much more than we deserve you will earn it however i may serve you youll serve me by following the orders given to you by the woman follow them precisely with no deviation whatsoever is that understood certainly blessings upon you there was a click and the voice was no more fontaine turned to address the nurse but she was not at his side instead she was across the room unlocking the drawer of a table he walked over to her his eyes drawn to the contents of the drawer side by side were a pair of surgical gloves a pistol with a cylindrical silencer attached to the barrel and a straight razor the blade recessed these are your tools said the woman handing him the key her flat expressionless gray eyes boring into his own and the targets are in the last villa on this row you are to familiarize yourself with the area by taking extended walks on the path as old men do for circulatory purposes and you are to kill them you are to do this wearing the gloves and firing the gun into each skull it must be the head then each throat must be slit mother of god the childrens those are the orders theyre barbaric do you wish me to convey that judgment fontaine looked over at the balcony door at his woman in the wheelchair no no of course not i thought not there is a final instruction with whosesoever blood is most convenient you are to write on the wall the following jason bourne brother of the jackal oh my god ill be caught of course thats up to you coordinate the executions with me and ill swear a great warrior of france was in this villa at the time time what is the time when is this to be done within the next thirtysix hours then what you may stay here until your woman dies brendan patrick pierre prefontaine was again astonished though he had no reservation the front desk of tranquility inn treated him like a visiting celebrity then only moments after he had secured a villa told him that he already had a villa and asked how was the flight from paris confusion descended for several minutes as the owner of tranquility inn could not be reached for consultation he was not at his residence and if he was on the premises he could not be found ultimately hands were thrown up in frustration and the former judge from boston was taken to his lodgings a lovely miniature house overlooking the caribbean by accident hardly by design he had reached into the wrong pocket and given the manager behind the desk a fiftydollar american bill for his courtesy prefontaine instantly became a man to be reckoned with fingers snapped and palms hit bells rapidly nothing was too splendid for the bewildering stranger who had suddenly flown in on the seaplane from montserrat it was the name that had thrown everyone behind tranquilitys front desk into confusion could such a coincidence be possible still the crown governor err on the safe side get the man a villa once settled his casual clothes distributed in the closet and the bureau the craziness continued a chilled bottle of château carbonnieux accompanied freshcut flowers and a box of belgian chocolates arrived only to have a confused roomservice waiter return to remove them apologizing for the fact that they were for another villa down the lineor up the linehe thought mon the judge changed into bermuda shorts wincing at the sight of his spindly legs and put on a subdued paisley sport shirt white loafers and a white cloth cap completed his tropical outfit it would be dark soon and he wanted a stroll for several reasons i know who jean pierre fontaine is said john st jacques reading the register behind the front desk hes the one the cgs office called me about but who the hell is b p prefontaine an illustrious judge from the united states declared the tall black assistant manager in a distinct british accent my uncle the deputy director of immigration phoned me from the airport roughly two hours ago unfortunately i was upstairs when the confusion arose but our people did the right thing a judge asked the owner of tranquility inn as the assistant manager touched st jacquess elbow gesturing for him to move away from the desk and the clerks both men did so what did your uncle say there must be total privvissy where our two distinguished guests are concerned why wouldnt there be what does that mean my uncle was very discreet but he did allow that he watched the honored judge go to the interisland counter and purchase a ticket he further permitted himself to say that he knew he had been right the judge and the french war hero are related and wish to meet confidentially on matters of great import if that was the case why didnt the honored judge have a reservation there appear to be two possible explanations sir according to my uncle they were originally to meet at the airport but the crown governors reception line precluded it whats the second possibility an error may have been made in the judges own offices in boston massachusetts according to my uncle there was a brief discussion regarding the judges law clerks how they are prone to errors and if one had been made with his passport hed fly them all down to apologize then judges are paid a lot more in the states than they are in canada hes damned lucky we had space its the summer season sir we usually have available space during these months dont remind me all right so weve got two illustrious relatives who want to meet privately but go about it in a very complicated way maybe you should call the judge and tell him what villa fontaine is in or prefontainewhichever the hell it is i suggested that courtesy to my uncle sir and he was most adamant he said we should do and say absolutely nothing according to my uncle all great men have secrets and he would not care to have his own brilliant deduction revealed except by the parties themselves beg your pardon if such a call were made to the judge he would know the information could only come from my uncle the deputy director of montserrats immigration christ do whatever you want ive got other things on my mind incidentally ive doubled the patrols on the road and the beach well be stretched thin sir ive shifted a number off the paths i know whos here but i dont know who may want to get in here do we expect trouble sir john st jacques looked at the assistant manager not now he said ive been out checking every inch of the grounds and the beach by the way ill be staying with my sister and her children in villa twenty the hero of world war iis resistance known as jean pierre fontaine walked slowly up the concrete path toward the last villa overlooking the sea it was similar to the others with walls of pink stucco and a red tiled roof but the surrounding lawn was larger the bordering shrubbery taller and denser it was a place for prime ministers and presidents foreign secretaries and secretaries of state men and women of international stature seeking the peace of pampered isolation fontaine reached the end of the path where there was a fourfoothigh white stuccoed wall and beyond it the impenetrable overgrown slope of the hill leading down to the shoreline the wall itself extended in both directions curving around the hill below the villas balconies at once demarcation and protection the entrance to villa twenty was a pink wroughtiron gate bolted into the wall beyond the gate the old man could see a small child running about the lawn in a bathing suit in moments a woman appeared in the frame of the open front door come on jamie she called out time for dinner has alison eaten mommy fed and asleep darling she wont yell at her brother i like our house better why cant we go back to our house mommy because uncle john wants us to stay here the boats are here jamie he can take you fishing and sailing just like he did last april during the spring vacation we stayed at our house then yes well daddy was with us and we had lots of fun driving over in the truck dinner jamie come along now mother and child went into the house and fontaine winced thinking about his orders from the jackal the bloody executions he was sworn to carry out and then the childs words came back to him why cant we go back to our house mommy we stayed at our house then and the mothers answers because uncle john wants us to stay here yes well daddy was with us then there might be any number of explanations for the brief exchange he had overheard but fontaine could sense warnings quicker than most men for his life had been filled with them he sensed one now and for that reason an old man would take a number of walks late at night for circulatory purposes he turned from the wall and started down the concrete path so absorbed in thought that he nearly collided with a guest at least his own age wearing a foolishlooking little white cap and white shoes excuse me said the stranger sidestepping out of fontaines way pardon monsieur exclaimed the embarrassed hero of france unconsciously slipping into his native tongue je regrettethat is to say it is i who must be excused oh at his words the strangers eyes briefly widened almost as if there had been recognition that was quickly hidden not at all pardon we have met monsieur i dont believe so replied the old man in the silly white cap but weve all heard the rumors a great french hero is among the guests foolishness the accidents of war when we were all much younger my name is fontaine jean pierre fontaine mines patrick brendan patrick a pleasure to make your acquaintance monsieur both men shook hands this is a lovely place is it not simply beautiful again the stranger seemed to be studying him thought fontaine yet oddly enough avoiding any prolonged eye contact well i must be on my way added the elderly guest in the brandnew white shoes doctors orders moi aussi said jean pierre purposely speaking french which evidently had an effect on the stranger toujours le médecin à notre âge nestce pas all too true replied the old man with the bony legs nodding and making the gesture of a wave as he turned and walked rapidly up the path fontaine stood motionless watching the receding figure waiting knowing it would happen and then it did the old man stopped and slowly turned around from a distance their eyes locked it was enough jean pierre smiled then proceeded down the concrete path toward his villa it was another warning he mused and a far more deadly one for three things were apparent first the elderly guest in the foolish white cap spoke french second he knew that jean pierre fontaine was in reality someone elsesent to montserrat by someone else third he had the mark of the jackal in his eyes mon dieu how like the monseigneur engineer the kill make sure it is done then remove all physical traces that could lead back to his methods of operation in particular his private army of old men no wonder the nurse had said that after his orders were carried out they could remain here in this paradise until his woman died a date that was imprecise at best the jackals generosity was not so grand as it appeared his womans death as well as his own had been scheduled john st jacques picked up the phone in his office yes they have met sir said the excited assistant manager at the front desk who have met the great man and his illustrious relative from boston massachusetts i would have called you at once but there was a mixup concerning a box of belgian chocolates what are you talking about several minutes ago sir i saw them through the windows they were conferring on the path my esteemed uncle the deputy director was right in all things thats nice the crown governors office will be most pleased and im certain we shall be commended as will of course my brilliant uncle good for all of us said st jacques wearily now we dont have to concern ourselves about them any longer do we offhand i would say not sir except that as we speak the honored judge is walking down the path in haste i believe hes coming inside i dont think hell bite you he probably wants to thank you do whatever he says theres a storm coming up from basseterre and well need the cgs input if the phones go out i myself shall perform whatever service he requires sir well there are limits dont brush his teeth brendan prefontaine hurried through the door of the circular glasswalled lobby he had waited until the old frenchman had turned into the first villa before reversing direction and heading straight for the main complex as he had done so many times over the past thirty years he was forced to think quickly on his feetusually running feetbuilding plausible explanations that would support a number of obvious possibilities as well as others not so obvious he had just committed an unavoidable yet stupid error unavoidable because he was not prepared to give tranquility inns desk a false name in case identification was required and stupid because he had given a false name to the hero of france well not stupid the similarity of their surnames might have led to unwanted complications where the purpose of his trip to montserrat was concerned which was quite simply extortionto learn what so frightened randolph gates that he would part with fifteen thousand dollars and having learned it perhaps collect a great deal more no the stupidity was in not taking the precautionary step he was about to take he approached the front desk and the tall slender clerk behind it good evening sir fairly yelled the inns employee causing the judge to look around grateful that there were very few guests in the lobby however i may assist you be assured of my perfection id rather be assured of your keeping your voice down young man i shall whisper said the clerk inaudibly what did you say how may i help you intoned the man now sotto voce lets just talk quietly all right certainly i am so very privileged you are of course very well said prefontaine i have a favor to ask of you anything shhh naturally like many men of advanced age i frequently forget things you can understand that cant you a man of your wisdom i doubt forgets anything what never mind im traveling incognito you do know what i mean most assuredly sir i registered under my name prefontaine you certainly did interrupted the clerk i know it was a mistake my office and those ive told to reach me expect to ask for a mr patrick my middle name its harmless subterfuge to allow me some much needed rest i understand said the clerk confidentially leaning over the counter you do of course if such an eminent person as yourself were known to be a guest here you might find little rest as another you must have complete privvissy be assured i understand privvissy oh good lord i shall myself alter the directory judge judge i said nothing about being a judge consternation was apparent on the mans embarrassed face a slip born of wishing to serve you sir and of something elsesomeone else on my word no one here other than the owner of tranquility inn is aware of the confidential nature of your visit sir whispered the clerk again leaning over the counter all is total privvissy holy mary that asshole at the airport my astute uncle continued the clerk overriding and not hearing prefontaines soft monotone made it completely clear that we were privileged to be dealing with illustrious men who required total confidentiality you see he called me in that spirit all right all right young man i understand now and appreciate everything youre doing just make sure that the name is changed to patrick and should anyone here inquire about me he or she is to be given that name do we understand each other with clairvoyance honored judge i hope not four minutes later the harried assistant manager picked up the ringing telephone front desk he intoned as if giving a benediction this is monsieur fontaine in villa number eleven yes sir the honor is mine ours everyones merci i wondered if you might help me i met a charming american on the path perhaps a quarter of an hour ago a man about my own age wearing a white walking cap i thought i might ask him for an aperitif one day but im not sure i heard his name correctly he was being tested thought the assistant manager great men not only had secrets but concerned themselves with those guarding them i would have to say from your description sir that you met the very charming mr patrick ah yes i believe that was the name an irish name indeed but hes american is he not a very learned american sir from boston massachusetts hes in villa fourteen the third west of yours simply dial sevenonefour yes well thank you so much if you see monsieur patrick id prefer you say nothing as you know my wife is not well and i must extend the invitation when it is comfortable for her i would never say anything great sir unless told to do so where you and the learned mr patrick are concerned we follow the crown governors confidential instructions to the letter you do thats most commendable adieu he had done it thought the assistant manager hanging up the phone great men understood subtleties and he had been subtle in ways his brilliant uncle would appreciate not only with the instant offering of the patrick name but more important by using the word learned which conveyed that of a scholaror a judge and finally by stating that he would not say anything without the crown governors instructions by the use of subtlety he had insinuated himself into the confidentiality of great men it was a breathtaking experience and he must call his uncle and share their combined triumph fontaine sat on the edge of the bed the telephone in its cradle yet still in his hand staring at his woman out on the balcony she sat in her wheelchair her profile to him the glass of wine on the small table beside the chair her head bent down in pain pain the whole terrible world was filled with pain and he had done his share inflicting it he understood that and expected no quarter but not for his woman that was never part of the contract his life yes of course but not hers not while she had breath in her frail body non monseigneur je refuse ce nest pas le contrat so the jackals army of very old men now extended to americait was to be expected and an old irish american in a foolish white cap a learned man who for one reason or another had embraced the cult of the terrorist was to be their executioner a man who had studied him and pretended to speak no french who had the sign of the jackal in his eyes where you and the learned mr patrick are concerned we follow the instructions of the crown governor the crown governor who took his instructions from a master of death in paris a decade ago after five productive years with the monseigneur he had been given a telephone number in argenteuil six miles north of paris that he was never to use except in the most extreme emergency he had used it only once before but he would use it now he studied the international codes picked up the phone and dialed after the better part of two minutes a voice answered le coeur du soldat said a flat male voice martial music in the background i must reach a blackbird said fontaine in french my identity is paris five if such a request is possible where can such a bird reach you in the caribbean fontaine gave the area code the telephone number and the extension to villa eleven he hung up the phone and sat despondent on the edge of the bed in his soul he knew that this might be his and his womans last few hours on earth if so he and his woman could face their god and speak the truth he had killed no question about that but he had never harmed or taken the life of a person who had not committed greater crimes against otherswith a few minor exceptions that might be called innocent bystanders caught in the heat of fire or in an explosion all life was pain did not the scriptures tell us that on the other hand what kind of god allowed such brutalities merde do not think about such things they are beyond your understanding the telephone rang and fontaine grabbed it pulling it to his ear this is paris five he said child of god what can be so extreme that you would use a number you have called only once before in our relationship your generosity has been absolute monseigneur but i feel we must redefine our contract in what way my life is yours to do with as you will as mercifully as you will but it does not include my woman what a man is here a learned man from the city of boston who studies me with curious eyes eyes that tell me he has other purposes in mind that arrogant fool flew down to montserrat himself he knows nothing obviously he does and i beg you i shall do as you order me to do but let us go back to paris i beg of you let her die in peace i will ask no more of you you ask of me ive given you my word then why is this learned man from america here following me with a blank face and inquisitive eyes monseigneur the deep hollow roll of a throated cough filled the silence and then the jackal spoke the great professor of law has transgressed inserted himself where he should not be hes a dead man edith gates wife of the celebrated attorney and professor of law silently opened the door of the private study in their elegant town house on louisburg square her husband sat motion less in his heavy leather armchair staring at the crackling fire a fire he insisted upon despite the warm boston night outside and the central air conditioning inside as she watched him mrs gates was once again struck by the painful realization that there were things about her husband she would never understand gaps in his life she could never fill leaps in his thinking she could not comprehend she only knew that there were times when he felt a terrible pain and would not share it when by sharing it he would lessen the burden on himself thirtythree years ago a passably attractive young woman of average wealth had married an extremely tall gangling brilliant but impoverished law school graduate whose anxiety and eagerness to please had turned off the major firms in those days of the cool restrained late fifties the veneer of sophistication and the pursuit of security were valued over a smoldering wandering firstrate mind of unsure direction especially a mind inside a head of unkempt hair and a body dressed in clothes that were cheap imitations of j press and brooks brothers which appeared even worse because his bank account precluded any additional expenses for alterations and few discount stores carried his size the new mrs gates however had several ideas that would improve the prospects of their life together among them was to lay aside an immediate law careerbetter none than with an inferior firm or god forbid a private practice with the sort of clients he was bound to attract namely those who could not afford established attorneys better to use his natural endowments which were his impressive height and a quick spongelike intelligence that combined with his drive disposed of heavy academic workloads with ease using her modest trust fund edith shaped the externals of her man buying the correct clothes and hiring a theatrical voice coach who instructed his student in the ways of dramatic delivery and effective stage presence the gangling graduate soon took on a lincolnesque quality with subtle flashes of john brown too he was on his way to becoming a legal expert remaining in the milieu of the university piling one degree upon another while teaching at the graduate level until the sheer depth of his expertise in specific areas was incontestable and he found himself sought after by the prominent firms that had rejected him earlier the strategy took nearly ten years before concrete results appeared and while the early returns were not earthshaking still they represented progress law reviews first minor and then major began publishing his semicontroversial articles as much for their style as for their content for the young associate professor had a seductive way with the written word at once riveting and arcane by turns flowery and incisive but it was his opinions latently emerging that made segments of the financial community take notice the mood of the nation was changing the crust of the benevolent great society beginning to crack the lesions initiated with code words coined by the nixon boys such as the silent majority and bumsonwelfare and the pejorative them a meanness was rising out of the ground and spreading and it was more than the perceptive decent ford could stop weakened as he was by the wounds of watergate and too much as well for the brilliant carter too consumed by minutiae to exercise compassionate leadership the phrase what you can do for your country was out of fashion replaced by what i can do for me dr randolph gates found a relentless wave on which to ride a mellifluous voice with which to speak and a growing acerbic vocabulary to match the dawning new era in his now refined scholarly opinionlegally economically and sociallybigger was better and more far preferable to less the laws that supported competition in the marketplace he attacked as stifling to the larger agenda of industrial growth from which would flow all manner of benefits for everyonewell practically everyone it was after all a darwinian world and like it or not the fittest would always survive the drums went bang and the cymbals clanged and the financial manipulators found a champion a legal scholar who lent respectability to their righteous dreams of merger and consolidation buy out take over and sell off all for the good of the many of course randolph gates was summoned and he ran into their arms with alacrity stunning one courtroom after another with his elocutionary gymnastics he had made it but edith gates was not sure what it all meant she had envisioned a comfortable living naturally but not millions not the private jets flying all over the world from palm springs to the south of france nor was she comfortable when her husbands articles and lectures were used to support causes that struck her as unrelated or patently unfair he waved her arguments aside stating that the cases in point were legitimate intellectual parallels above everything she had not shared a bed or a bedroom with her husband in over six years she walked into the study abruptly stopping as he gasped swerving his head around his eyes glazed and filled with alarm im sorry i didnt mean to startle you you always knock why didnt you knock you know how it is when im concentrating i said im sorry somethings on my mind and i wasnt thinking thats a contradiction thinking about knocking i mean whats on your mind asked the celebrated attorney as if he doubted his wife had one please dont be clever with me what is it edith where were you last night gates arched his brows in mock surprise my god are you suspicious i told you where i was at the ritz in conference with someone i knew years ago someone i did not care to have at my house if at your age you want confirmation call the ritz edith gates was silent for a moment she simply looked at her husband my dear she said i dont give a damn if you had an assignation with the most voluptuous whore in the combat zone somebody would probably have to give her a few drinks to restore her confidence not bad bitch in that department youre not exactly a stud bastard is there a point to this colloquy i think so about an hour ago just before you came home from your office a man was at the door denise was doing the silver so i answered it i must say he looked impressive his clothes were terribly expensive and his car was a black porsche and broke in gates lurching forward in the chair his eyes suddenly wide rigid he said to tell you that le grand professeur owed him twenty thousand dollars and he wasnt where he was supposed to be last night which i assumed was the ritz it wasnt something came up oh christ he doesnt understand what did you say i didnt like his language or his attitude i told him i hadnt the vaguest idea where you were he knew i was lying but there wasnt anything he could do good lyings something he knows about i cant imagine that twenty thousand is such a problem for you its not the money its the method of payment for what nothing i believe thats what you call a contradiction randy shut up the telephone rang gates lunged up from the chair and stared at it he made no move to go to the desk instead he spoke in a guttural voice to his wife whoever it is you tell him im not here im away out of townyou dont know when ill be back edith walked over to the phone its your very private line she said as she picked it up on the third ring the gates residence began edith a ploy she had used for years her friends knew who it was others did not matter to her any longer yes yes im sorry hes away and we dont know when hell return gatess wife looked briefly at the phone then hung up she turned to her husband that was the operator in paris its strange someone was calling you but when i said you werent here she didnt even ask where you could be reached she simply got off the linevery abruptly oh my god cried gates visibly shaken something happened somethings gone wrong someone lied with those enigmatic words the attorney whipped around and raced across the room fumbling in his trousers pocket he reached a section of the floortoceiling bookshelves where the center of the chesthigh shelf had been converted into a safelike cupboard a carved wooden door superimposed on the brown steel in panic as an afterthought stunned him further he spun around and screamed at his wife get out of here get out get out get out edith gates walked slowly to the study door where she turned to her husband and spoke quietly it all goes back to paris doesnt it randy seven years ago in paris thats where something happened isnt it you came back a frightened man a man with a pain you wont share get out of here shrieked the vaunted professor of law his eyes wild edith went out the door closing it behind her but not releasing the knob her hand twisted so the latch would not close moments later she opened it barely a few inches and watched her husband the shock was beyond anything she could imagine the man she had lived with for thirtythree years the legal giant who neither smoked nor drank a drop of alcohol was plunging a hypodermic needle into his forearm darkness had descended on manassas the countryside alive with nocturnal undercurrents as bourne crept through the woods bordering the farm of general norman swayne startled birds fluttered out of their black recesses crows awoke in the trees and cawed their alarms then as if calmed by a foraging coconspirator kept silent he reached it wondering if indeed it would be there a fencehigh with thick crisscrossing links embedded in green plastic a coiledbarbedwire addition above slanting outward entry prohibited beijing the jing shan sanctuary there had been things to conceal within that oriental wildlife preserve so it was protected by an all but impassable government barrier but why would a deskbound general on military pay erect such a barricade around a farm in manassas virginia an obstruction costing thousands of dollars it was not designed to fence in livestock it was instead built to keep out human life as with the sanctuary in china there would be no electric alarms threaded through the links for the animals and the birds of the forest would set them off repeatedly nor would there be the unseen beams of trip lights for the same reason instead they would be on the flat ground nearer the house and waisthigh if they existed bourne pulled the small wire cutters out of his rear pocket and started with the links at earth level with each scissoring cut he again understood the obvious the inevitable confirmed by his heavy breathing and the sweat that had formed on his hairline no matter how hard he triednot fanatically but at least assiduouslyto keep himself in reasonably good shape he was now fifty and his body knew it again it was something to think about not dwell upon and with every inch of progress not think about at all there were marie and the children his family there was nothing he could not do as long as he willed it david webb was gone from his psyche only the predator jason bourne remained he was through the parallel vertical links were cut the ground wires as well he gripped the fence and pulled the opening toward him making each half foot of space an ordeal he crawled inside this strangely fortified acreage and stood up listening his eyes darting in every direction scanning the darknesswhich was not complete darkness he sawfiltered through the thick branches of the tall overlapping pines bordering the tamed groundsflickerings of light coming from the large house slowly he made his way toward what he knew was the circular drive he reached the outer border of the asphalt and lay prone beneath a spreading pine gathering his thoughts and his breath as he studied the scene in front of him suddenly there was a flash of light on his far right deep inside the grounds at the end of a straight graveled road that branched off from the circular drive a door had been opened it belonged to what appeared to be a small house or a large cabin and it remained open two men and a woman came out and were talking no they were not just talking they were arguing heatedly bourne ripped the short powerful binoculars out of their velcro recess and put them up to his eyes quickly he focused on the trio whose voices grew in volume the words indistinguishable but the anger apparent as the blurred image sharpened he studied the three people knowing instantly that the mediumsized mediumbuilt ramrodstraight protesting man on the left was the pentagons general swayne and the largebreasted woman with streaked dark hair his wife but what struck himand fascinated himwas the hulking overweight figure nearest the open door he knew him jason could not remember from where or when which was certainly not unusual but his visceral reaction to the sight of the man was not usual it was one of instant loathing and he did not know why since no connection with anything in the past came to him only feelings of disgust and revulsion where were the images the brief flashes of time or circumstance that so often illuminated his inner screen they did not come he only knew that the man he focused on in the binoculars was his enemy then that huge man did an extraordinary thing he reached for swaynes wife throwing his large left arm protectively around her shoulders his right hand accusingly jabbing the space between him and the general whatever he saidor yelledcaused swayne to react with what seemed to be stoic resolve mixed with feigned indifference he turned around and in military fashion strode back across the lawn toward a rear entrance to the house bourne lost him in the darkness and swung back to the couple in the light of the door the large obese man released the generals wife and spoke to her she nodded brushed her lips against his and ran after her husband the obvious consort walked back into the small house and slammed the door shut removing the light jason reattached the binoculars to his trousers and tried to understand what he had observed it had been like watching a silent movie minus the subtitles the gestures far more real and without exaggerated theatricality that there was in the confines of this fenced acreage a ménage à trois was obvious but this could hardly explain the fence there was another reason a reason he had to learn further instinct told him that whatever it was was linked to the huge overweight man who had walked angrily back into the small house he had to reach that house he had to reach that man who had been a part of his forgotten past he slowly got to his feet and ducking from one pine to the next he made his way to the end of the circular drive and then continued down the treelined border of the narrow graveled road he stopped lurching to the ground at a sudden sound that was no part of the murmuring woods somewhere wheels were spinning crushing stone and displacing it he rolled over and over into the dark recesses of the lowhanging widespreading branches of a pine tree swinging his body around to locate the disturbance within seconds he saw something racing out of the shadows of the circular drive rushing over the gravel of the extended road it was a small oddshaped vehicle half threewheeled motorbike half miniature golf cart the tires large and deeply treaded capable of both high speed and balance it was also in its way ominous for in addition to a high flexible antenna thick curved plexiglas shields shot up from all sides bulletproof windows that protected the driver from gunfire while alerting by radio anyone inside the residences of an assault general norman swaynes farm took on an even stranger ambience then abruptly it was macabre a second threewheeled cart swung out from the shadows behind the cabinand it was a cabin with split logs on the exteriorand came to a stop only feet from the first vehicle on the graveled road both drivers heads swung militarily toward the small house as if they were robots in a public gallery and then the words shot out from an unseen speaker secure the gates said the amplified voice a voice in command release the dogs and resume your rounds as if choreographed the vehicles swung in unison each in the opposite direction the drivers gunning their engines as one the strangelooking carts racing forward into the shadows at the mention of dogs bourne had automatically reached into his back pocket and removed the co gun he then crawled laterally rapidly through the underbrush to within feet of the extended fence if the dogs were in a pack he would have no choice but to scramble up the links and spring over the coiled barbed wire to the other side his dualchambered dart pistol could eliminate two animals not more there would be no time to reload he crouched waiting ready to leap up on the fence the sightlines beneath the lower branches relatively clear suddenly a black doberman raced by on the graveled road no hesitation in his pace no scent picked up the animals only objective apparently to reach a given place then another dog appeared this a longhaired shepherd it slowed down awkwardly yet instinctively as if programmed to halt at a specific area it stopped an obscure moving silhouette up the road standing motionless bourne understood these were trained male attack dogs each with its own territory which was constantly urinated upon forever its own turf it was a behavioral discipline favored by oriental peasants and small landowners who knew too well the price of feeding the animals who guarded their minuscule fiefdoms of survival train a few as few as possible to protect their separated areas from thieves and if alarms were raised the others would converge oriental vietnam medusa it was coming back to him vague obscure outlinesimages a young powerful man in uniform driving a jeep stepping out andthrough the mists of jasons inner screenyelling at what was left of an assault team that had returned from interdicting an ordnance route paralleling the ho chi minh trail that same man older larger had been in his binoculars only moments ago and years ago that same man had promised supplies ammunition mortars grenades radios he had brought nothing only complaints from command saigon that you fucking illegals fed us crap but they hadnt saigon had acted too late reacted too late and twentysix men had been killed or captured for nothing as if it were an hour ago a minute ago bourne remembered he had yanked his out of his holster and without warning jabbed the barrel into the approaching noncoms forehead one more word and youre dead sergeant the man had been a sergeant you bring us our requisitions by ofivehundred tomorrow morning or ill get to saigon and personally blow you into the wall of whatever whorehouse youre frequenting do i make myself clear or do you care to save me a trip to publicity city frankly in light of our losses id rather waste you now youll get what you need très bien had yelled the oldest french member of medusa who years later would save his life in a wildlife sanctuary in beijing tu es formidable mon fils how right he was and how dead he was danjou a man legends were written about jasons thoughts were abruptly shattered the longhaired attack dog was suddenly circling in the road its snarls growing louder its nostrils picking up the human scent within seconds as the animal found its directional bearings a frenzy developed the dog lunged through the foliage its teeth bared the snarls now the throated growls of a kill bourne sprang back into the fence pulling the co pistol out of its nylon shoulder holster with his right hand his left arm crooked extended prepared for a vital counterassault that if not executed properly would cost him the night the crazed animal leaped a hurling mass of rage jason fired first one cartridge and then the second and as the darts were embedded he whipped his left arm around the attack dogs head yanking the skull counterclockwise slamming his right knee up into the animals body to ward off the lashing sharpnailed paws it was over in momentsmoments of raging panicked finally disintegrating furywithout the howling sounds that might have carried across the lawn of the generals estate the longhaired dog its narcotized eyes wide fell limp in bournes arms he lowered it to the ground and once again waited afraid to move until he knew that no converging inhuman alarms had been sent to the other animals there were none there was only the constant murmuring of the forest beyond the prohibiting fence jason replaced the co pistol in his holster and crept forward back to the graveled road beads of sweat rolling down his face and into his eyes he had been away too long years ago such a feat as silencing an attack dog would have rolled off himun exercise ordinaire as the legend danjou would have saidbut it was no longer ordinary what permeated his being was fear pure unadulterated fear where was the man that was still marie and the children were out there that man had to be summoned summon him bourne stripped out the binoculars and raised them to his eyes again the moonlight was sporadic lowflying clouds intercepting the rays but the yellow wash was sufficient he focused on the shrubbery that fronted the stockade fence that bordered the road outside pacing back and forth on a bisecting dirt path like an angry impatient panther was the black doberman stopping now and then to urinate and poke its long snout into the bushes as he had been programmed to do the animal roamed between the opposing closed iron gates of the enormous circular drive at each halting checkpoint it snarled spinning around several times as if both expecting and loathing the sharp electrical shock it would receive through its collar if it transgressed without cause again the method of training went back to vietnam soldiers disciplined the attack dogs around ammunition and materiel depots with such remotesignaling devices jason focused the binoculars on the far side of the expansive front lawn he zeroed in on a third animal this a huge weimaraner gentle in appearance but lethal in attack the hyperactive dog raced back and forth aroused perhaps by squirrels or rabbits in the brush but not by human scent it did not raise a throated growl the signal of assault jason tried to analyze what he observed for that analysis would determine his moves he had to assume that there was a fourth or a fifth or even a sixth animal patrolling the perimeters of swaynes grounds but why this way why not a pack roaming at will and in unison a far more frightening and inhibiting sight the expense that concerned the oriental farmer was no object then the explanation struck him it was so basic it was obvious he shifted the binoculars back and forth between the weimaraner and the doberman the picture of the longhaired german shepherd still all too clear in his mind beyond the fact that these were trained attack dogs they were also something else they were the top of their breeds groomed to a faretheewellvicious animals posing as champion show dogs by day violent predators at night of course general norman swaynes farm was not unrecorded property not concealed real estate but very much out in the open and undoubtedly jealously perhaps visited by friends neighbors and colleagues during the daylight hours guests could admire these docile champions in their wellappointed kennels without realizing what they really were norman swayne pentagon procurements and alumnus of medusa was merely a dog aficionado attested to by the quality of his animals bloodlines he might very well charge stud fees but there was nothing in the canon of military ethics that precluded the practice a sham if one such aspect of the generals farm was a sham it had to follow that the estate itself was a sham as false as the inheritance that made its purchase possible medusa one of the two strange threewheeled carts appeared far across the lawn out of the shadows of the house and down the exit road of the circular drive bourne focused on it not surprised to see the weimaraner romp over and playfully race beside the vehicle yapping and seeking approval from the driver the driver the drivers were the handlers the familiar scent of their bodies was calming to the dogs reassuring them the observation formed the analysis and the analysis determined his next tactic he had to move at least more freely than he was moving now about the generals grounds to do so he had to be in the company of a handler he had to take one of the roving patrols he raced back in the cover of the pine trees to his point of penetration the mechanized bulletproof vehicle stopped on the narrow path at midpoint between the two front gates nearly obscured by the shrubbery jason adjusted his binoculars the black doberman was apparently a favored dog the driver opened the right panel as the animal sprang up placing his huge paws on the seat the man chucked biscuits or pieces of meat into the wide anticipating jaws then reached over and massaged the dogs throat bourne knew instantly that he had only moments to put his uncertain strategy together he had to stop the cart and force the driver outside but without alarming the man without giving him any reason whatsoever to use his radio and call for help the dog lying in the road no the driver might assume it had been shot from the other side of the fence and alert the house what could he do he looked around in the neartotal darkness feeling the panic of indecision his anxiety growing as his eyes swept the area then again the obvious struck him the large expanse of closecropped manicured lawn the precisely cut shrubbery the swept circular driveneatness was the order of the generals turf jason could almost hear swayne commanding his groundskeepers to police the area bourne glanced over at the cart by the doberman the driver was playfully pushing the dog away about to close the shielded panel only seconds now what how he saw the outlines of a tree limb on the ground a rotted branch had fallen from the pine above him he crossed quickly to it and crouched yanking it out of the dirt and debris and dragged it toward the paved asphalt to lay it across the drive might appear too obvious a trap but partially on the roadan intrusion on the pervasive neatnesswould be offensive to the eye the task of removing it better done now than later in the event the general drove out and saw it upon his return the men in swaynes compound were either soldiers or exsoldiers still under military authority they would try to avoid reprimands especially over the inconsequential the odds were on jasons side he gripped the base of the limb swung it around and pushed it roughly five feet into the drive he heard the panel of the cart slam shut the vehicle rolled forward gathering speed as bourne raced back into the darkness of the pine tree the driver steered the vehicle around the dirt curve into the drive as rapidly as he had accelerated he slowed down his single headlight beam picking up the new obstruction protruding on the road he approached it cautiously at minimum speed as if he were unsure of what it was then he realized what it was and rushed forward without hesitation he opened his side door the tall plexiglas shield swinging forward as he stepped out on the drive and walked around the front of the cart big rex youre one bad dog buddy said the driver in a halfloud very southern voice whatd you drag out of there you dumb bastard the brassplated asshole would shave your coat for messing up his eestate rex rex you come here you fuckin hound the man grabbed the limb and pulled it off the road under the pine tree into the shadows rex you hear me you humpin knotholes you horny stud stay completely still and put your arms out in front of you said jason bourne walking into view holy shit who are you someone who doesnt give a damn whether you live or die replied the intruder calmly you got a gun i can see it so do you yours is in your holster mines in my hand and its pointed at your head the dog where the hells the dawg indisposed what he looks like a good dog he could be anything a trainer wanted him to be you dont blame the animal you blame the human who taught it what are you talkin about

out here man you figured there was a meetin tonight didnt you a meeting them fancy limousines with the chauffeurs and the big shots right well you picked the wrong night the dogs are out and theyre never let out when theres a meetin bourne paused then spoke as he approached the guard well continue this in the cart he said with authority ill crouch down and youll do exactly what i tell you to do you promised me i could get out of here you can you will both you and the other fellow making the rounds the gates over there are they on an alarm not when the dogs are loose if those hounds see

gates are closed you can turn it on come on lets go where are we goin i want to see every dog on the premises twentyone minutes later the remaining five attack dogs drugged and carried to their kennels bourne unlatched the entrance gate and let the two guards outside he had given each three hundred dollars this will make up for any pay you lose he said hey what about my car asked the second guard it aint much but it gets me around me and willie come out here in it do you have the keys yeah in my pocket its parked in the back by the kennels get it tomorrow why dont i get it now youd make

jimbob lets get outta here what the hell are we supposed to say tell anyone who asks you the truth describe what happened tonight also you can add that the code name is cobra my gawd yelled willie as both men fled into the road bourne secured the gate and walked back to the patrol cart certain in the knowledge that whatever happened during the next hours an appendage of medusa had been thrown into a state of further anxiety questions would be asked feverishlyquestions for which there were no answers nothing enigma he climbed into the cart shifted gears and started for the cabin at the end of the graveled road that branched off from the immaculate circular drive he stood by the window peering inside his face at the edge of the glass the huge overweight master sergeant was sitting in a large leather armchair his feet on an ottoman watching television from the sounds penetrating the window specifically the rapid highpitched speech of an announcer the generals aide was engrossed in a baseball game jason scanned the room as best he could it was typically rustic a profusion of browns and reds from dark furniture to checkered curtains comfortable and masculine a mans cabin in the country however there were no weapons in sight not even the accepted antique rifle over the fireplace and no generalissue automatic either on the sergeants person or on the table beside the chair the aide had no concerns for his immediate safety and why should he the estate of general norman swayne was totally securefence gates patrols and disciplined roving attack dogs at all points of entry bourne stared through the glass at the strong jowled face of the master sergeant what secrets did that large head hold he would find out medusas delta one would find out if he had to carve that skull apart jason pushed himself away from the window and walked around the cabin to the front door he knocked twice with the knuckles of his left hand in his right was the untraceable automatic supplied by alexander conklin the crown prince of dark operations its open rachel yelled the rasping voice from within bourne twisted the knob and shoved the door back it swung slowly on its hinges and made contact with the wall he walked inside jesus christ roared the master sergeant his heavy legs plunging off the ottoman as he wriggled his massive body out of the chair you youre a goddamned ghost youre dead try again said delta of medusa the names flannagan isnt it thats what comes to mind youre dead repeated the generals aide screaming his eyes bulging in panic you bought it in hong kong you were killed in hong kong four five years ago you kept tabs we know i know youve got connections in the right places then youre bourne obviously born again you might say i dont believe this believe flannagan its the we were going to talk about snake lady to be precise youre the onethe one swayne called cobra its a snake i dont get it its confusing youre one of us i was i was also cut out i snaked back in as it were the sergeant frantically looked at the door then the windows howd you get in here where are the guards the dogs jesus where are they the dogs are asleep in the kennels so i gave the guards the night off you gave the dogs are on the grounds not any longer they were persuaded to rest the guardsthe goddamned guards they were persuaded to leave what they think is happening

man backed awkwardly away from the chair youre the maniac they called delta before you turned and went in business for yourself he cried in a guttural whisper there was a picture a photographyou were laid out on a slab bloodstains all over the sheet from the bullet wounds your face was uncovered your eyes wide open holes still bleeding on your forehead and your throat they asked me who you were and i said hes delta delta one from the illegals and they said no hes not hes jason bourne the killer the assassin so i said then theyre one and the same because that man is deltai knew him they thanked me and told me to go back and join the others who were they some people over at langley the one who did all the talking had a limp he carried a cane and the othersthey told you to go back and join about twentyfive or thirty of the old saigon crowd command saigon yeah men who worked with our crowd the illegals mostly yeah when was this for christs sake i told you roared the panicked aide four or five years ago i saw the photographyou were dead only a single photograph interrupted bourne quietly staring at the master sergeant you have a very good memory you held a gun to my head thirtythree years two wars and twelve combat tours nobody ever did that to menobody but you yeah i gotta good memory i think i understand i dont i dont understand a goddamned thing you were dead youve said that but im not am i or maybe i am maybe this is the nightmare thats been visited upon you after twenty years of deceit what kind of crap is that what the hell dont move im not suddenly in the distance there was a loud report a gunshot jason spun around then instinct commanded him to keep turning all around the massive generals aide was lunging at him his huge hands like battering rams grazing off bournes shoulders as delta one viciously lashed up his right foot catching the sergeants kidney embedding his shoe deep into the flesh while crashing the barrel of his automatic into the base of the mans neck flannagan lurched downward splayed on the floor jason hammered his left foot into the sergeants head stunning him into silence a silence that was broken by the continuous hysterical screams of a woman racing outside toward the open door of the cabin within seconds general norman swaynes wife burst into the room recoiling at the sight in front of her gripping the back of the nearest chair unable to contain her panic hes dead she shrieked collapsing swerving the chair to her side as she fell to the floor reaching for her lover he shot himself eddie oh my god he killed himself jason bourne rose from his crouched position and walked to the door of the strange cabin that held so many secrets calmly watching his two prisoners he closed it the woman wept gasping trembling but they were tears not of sorrow but of fear the sergeant blinked his eyes and raised his huge head if any emotion could be defined in his expression it was an admixture of fury and bewilderment dont touch anything ordered bourne as flannagan and rachel swayne haltingly preceded him into the generals photographlined study at the sight of the old soldiers corpse arched back in the chair behind the desk the ugly gun still in his outstretched hand and the horror beyond left by the blowing away of the back of his skull the wife convulsed falling to her knees as if she might vomit the master sergeant grabbed her arm holding her off the floor his eyes dazed fixed on the mutilated remains of general norman swayne crazy son of a bitch whispered flannagan his voice strained and barely audible then standing motionless the muscles of his jaw pulsating he roared you insane fuckin son of a bitch what did you do it forwhy what do we do now you call the police sergeant answered jason what yelled the aide spinning around no screamed mrs swayne lurching to her feet we cant do that i dont think youve got a choice you didnt kill him you may have driven him to kill himself but you didnt kill him what the hell are you talking about asked flannagan gruffly better a simple if messy domestic tragedy than a far wider investigation wouldnt you say i gather its no secret that you two have an arrangement thatswell no secret he didnt give a shit about our arrangement and that was no secret either he encouraged us at every opportunity added rachel swayne hesitantly smoothing her skirt oddly swiftly regaining her composure she spoke to bourne but her eyes strayed to her lover he consistently threw us together often for days at a time do we have to stay in here my god i was married to that man for twentysix years im sure you can understand this is horrible for me we have things to discuss said bourne not in here if you please the living room its across the hall well talk there mrs swayne suddenly under control walked out of the study the generals aide glanced over at the blooddrenched corpse grimaced and followed her jason watched them stay in the hallway where i can see you and dont move he shouted crossing to the desk his eyes darting from one object to another taking in the last items norman swayne saw before placing the automatic in his mouth something was wrong on the right side of the wide green blotter was a pentagon memorandum pad swaynes rank and name printed below the insignia of the united states army next to the pad to the left of the blotters leather border was a gold ballpoint pen its sharp silver point protruding as if recently used the writer forgetting to twist it back into its recess bourne leaned over the desk within inches of the dead body the acrid smell of the exploded shell and burnt flesh still pungent and studied the memo pad it was blank but jason carefully tore off the top pages folded them and put them into his trousers pocket he stepped back still bothered what was it he looked around the room and as his eyes roamed over the furniture master sergeant flannagan appeared in the doorway what are you doing flannagan asked suspiciously were waiting for you your friend may find it too difficult to stay in here but i dont i cant afford to theres too much to learn i thought you said we shouldnt touch anything looking isnt touching sergeant unless you remove something then no one knows its been touched because it isnt here bourne suddenly walked over to an ornate brasstopped coffee table the sort so common in the bazaars of india and the middle east it was between two armchairs in front of the studys small fireplace off center was a fluted glass ashtray partially filled with the remains of halfsmoked cigarettes jason reached down and picked it up he held it in his hand and turned to flannagan for instance sergeant this ashtray ive touched it my fingerprints are on it but no one will know that because im taking it away what for because i smelled somethingi mean i really smelled it with my nose nothing to do with instincts what the hell are you talking about cigarette smoke thats what im talking about it hangs around a lot longer than you might think ask someone whos given them up more times than he can remember so what so lets have a talk with the generals wife lets all have a talk come on flannagan well play show and tell that weapon in your pocket makes you pretty fuckin brave doesnt it move sergeant rachel swayne swung her head to her left throwing back her long dark streaked hair over her shoulder as she stiffened her posture in the chair thats offensive in the extreme she pronounced with wide accusatory eyes staring at bourne it certainly is agreed jason nodding it also happens to be true there are five cigarette butts in this ashtray and each has lipstick on it bourne sat down across from her putting the ashtray on the small table next to the chair you were there when he did it when he put his gun into his mouth and pulled the trigger perhaps you didnt think hed go through with it maybe you thought it was just another one of his hysterical threatswhatever you didnt raise a word to stop him why should you have for you and eddie it was a logical and reasonable solution preposterous you know mrs swayne to put it bluntly thats not a word you should use you cant carry it off any more than youre convincing when you say somethings offensive in the extreme neither expression is you rachel youre imitating other peopleprobably rich vacuous customers a young hairdresser heard repeating such phrases years ago in honolulu how dare you oh come on thats ridiculous rachel dont even try the how dare you bit it doesnt work at all are you in your nasal twang going to have my head chopped off by royal decree lay off her shouted flannagan standing beside mrs swayne you got the iron but you dont have to do this shes a good woman a damn good woman and she was shit on by all the crap artists in this town how could she be she was the generals wife the mistress of the manor wasnt she isnt she she was used i was laughed at always laughed at mr delta cried rachel swayne gripping the arms of her chair when they werent leering or drooling howd you like to be the special piece of meat passed out like a special dessert to very special people when the dinner and the drinks are over i dont think id like it at all i might even refuse i couldnt he made me do it nobody can make anybody do anything like that sure they can mr delta said the generals wife leaning forward her large breasts pressing the sheer fabric of her blouse her long hair partially obscuring her aging but still sensual softfeatured face try an uneducated grammar school dropout from the coal basins in west virginia when the companies shut down the mines and nobody had no foodexcuse me any food you take what you got and you run with it and thats what i did i got laid from aliquippa to hawaii but i got there and i learned a trade thats where i met the big boy and i married him but i didnt have no illusions from day one specially when he got back from nam yknow what i mean im not sure i do rachel you dont have to explain nothin kiddo roared flannagan no i wanna eddie im sick of the whole shit okay you watch your tongue the point is i dont know nothin mr delta but i can figure things yknow what i mean stop it rachel cried the dead generals aide fuck off eddie youre not too bright either this mr delta could be our way out back to the islands right absolutely right mrs swayne you know what this place is shut up yelled flannagan awkwardly plodding forward stopped by the sudden earshattering explosion of bournes gun the bullet searing into the floor between the sergeants legs the woman screamed when she stopped jason continued what is this place mrs swayne hold it the master sergeant again interrupted but his objection was not shouted now instead it was a plea a strong mans plea he looked at the generals wife and then back at jason listen bourne or delta or whoever you are rachels right you could be our way outtheres nothing left for us over hereso what have you got to offer for what say we tell you what we know about this place and i tell you where you can start looking for a lot more how can you help us how can we get out of here and back to the pac islands without being hassled our names and faces all over the papers thats a tall order sergeant goddamn it she didnt kill himwe didnt kill him you said so yourself agreed and i couldnt care less whether you did or not whether you were responsible or not ive got other priorities like getting caught up with some old comrades or whatever the hell it was thats right im owed i still cant figure you you dont have to you were dead broke in the perplexed flannagan the words rushing out delta one from the illegals was bourne and bourne was dead and langley proved it to us but youre not dead i was taken sergeant thats all you have to knowthat and the fact that im working alone ive got a few debts i can call in but im strictly solo i need information and i need it quickly flannagan shook his head in bewilderment well maybe i can help you there he said quietly tentatively better than anyone else would i was given a special assignment so i had to learn things things someone like me wouldnt normally be told that sounds like the opening notes of a con song sergeant what was your special assignment nursemaid two years ago norman began to fall apart i controlled him and if i couldnt i was given a number to call in new york said number being part of the help you can give me that and a few licenseplate ids i wrote down just in case in case completed bourne someone decided your nursemaids services were no longer required something like that those pricks never liked usnorman didnt see it but i did us you and rachel and swayne the uniform they look down their rich civilian noses at us like were necessary garbage and theyre right about the necessary they needed norman with their eyes they spat on him but they needed him the soldier boys couldnt run with it albert armbruster chairman of the federal trade commission medusathe civilian inheritors when you say you wrote down the licenseplate numbers i assume that means you werent part of the meetings that took placetake placehere on a fairly regular basis that is you didnt mingle with the guests you werent one of them are you crazy screeched rachel swayne in her own succinct way answering jasons question whenever there was a real meeting and not a lousy drunken dinner party norm told me to stay upstairs or if i wanted to go over to eddies and watch television eddie couldnt leave the cabin we werent good enough for his big fancy asshole friends its been that way for years like i said he threw us together im beginning to understandat least i think i am but you got the license numbers sergeant how did you do that i gather you were confined to quarters i didnt get em my guards did i called it a confidential security procedure no one argued i see you said swayne began to fall apart a couple of years ago how in what way like tonight whenever something out of the ordinary happened hed freeze he didnt want to make decisions if it even smacked of snake lady he wanted to bury his head in the sand until it went away what about tonight i saw you two arguing it seemed to me the sergeant was giving the general his marching orders youre damn right i was norman was in a panicover you over the man they called cobra who was bringing out this heavy business about saigon twenty years ago he wanted me to be with him when you got here and i told him no way i said i wasnt nuts and id have to be nuts to do that why why would it be nuts for an aide to be with his superior officer for the same reason noncoms arent called into situation rooms where the stars and the stripers are figuring out strategy were on different levels it isnt done which is another way of saying there are limits to what you should know you got it but you were part of that saigon twenty years ago part of snake ladyhell sergeant you were medusa you are medusa nickels and dimes worth delta i sweep up and they take care of me but im only a sweeper in a uniform when my time comes to turn in that uniform i go quietly into a nice distant retirement with my mouth shut or i go out in a body bag its all very clear im expendable bourne watched the master sergeant closely as he spoke noting flannagans brief glances at the generals wife as if he expected to be applauded or conversely to be told with a look to shut up either the huge military aide was telling the truth or he was a very convincing actor then it strikes me said jason finally that this is a logical time to move up your retirement i can do that sergeant you can fade quietly with your mouth shut and with whatever rewards youre given for sweeping up a devoted generals aide with over thirty years service opts for retirement when his friend and superior tragically takes his own life no one will question you thats my offer flannagan again looked at rachel swayne she nodded sharply once then stared at bourne whats the guarantee that we can pack up our stuff and get out asked the woman isnt there a little matter of sergeant flannagans discharge and his army pension i made norman sign those papers eighteen months ago broke in the aide i was posted permanently to his office at the pentagon and billeted to his residence i just have to fill in the date sign my own name and list a general delivery address which rachel and i already figured out thats all whats left is maybe three or four phone calls normans lawyer wholl wrap up everything here the kennels for the dogs the pentagon assignedvehicle dispatcherand a last call to new york then its dulles airport you must have thought about this for a long time for years nothing but mr delta confirmed the generals wife interrupting like they say we paid our dues but before i can sign those papers or make those calls added flannagan i have to know we can break cleannow meaning no police no newspapers no involvement with tonightyou simply werent here you said its a tall order how tall are the debts you can call in you simply werent here repeated bourne softly slowly looking at the fluted glass ashtray with the lipstickstained cigarette butts on the table beside him he pulled his eyes back to the generals aide you didnt touch anything in there theres nothing to physically tie you in with his suicide are you really prepared to leavesay in a couple of hours try thirty minutes mr delta replied rachel my god you had a life here both of you we dont want anything from this life outside of what weve got said flannagan firmly the estate here is yours mrs swayne like hell it is its being turned over to some foundation ask the lawyer whatever i get if i get hell send on to me i just want outwe want out jason looked back and forth at the strange and strangely drawntogether couple then theres nothing to stop you how do we know that pressed flannagan stepping forward itll take a measure of trust on your part but believe me i can do it on the other hand look at the alternative say you stay here no matter what you do with him he wont show up in arlington tomorrow or the next day or the day after that sooner or later someones going to come looking for him therell be questions searches an investigation and as sure as god made little bobby woodwards the media will descend with its bellyful of speculations in short order your arrangement will be picked uphell even the guards talked about itand the newspapers the magazines and television will have a collective field day do you want that or would it all lead to that body bag you mentioned the master sergeant and his lady stared at each other hes right eddie said the latter with him we got a chance the other way we dont it sounds too easy said flannagan his breath coming shorter as he glanced toward the door how are you going to handle everything thats my business answered bourne give me the telephone numbers all of them and then the only call youll have to make is the one to new york and if i were you id make it from whatever pac island youre on youre nuts the minute the news breaks im on medusas rugsos rachel theyre going to want to know what happened tell them the truth at least a variation of it and i think you may even get a bonus youre a goddamned flake i wasnt a flake in nam sergeant nor was i in hong kong and im certainly not now you and rachel came home saw what had happened packed up and leftbecause you didnt want any questions and the dead cant talk and trap themselves predate your papers by a day mail them and leave the rest to me i dunno you dont have a choice sergeant shot back jason rising from the chair and i dont care to waste any more time you want me to go ill gofigure it all out for yourselves bourne angrily started for the door no eddie stop him we gotta do it his way we gotta take the chance the other way were dead and you know it all right all right cool it delta well do what you say jason stopped and turned everything i say sergeant down to the letter you got it first you and i will go over to your place while rachel goes upstairs and packs youll give me everything youve gottelephone and license numbers every name you can remember anything you can give me that i ask for agreed yeah lets go and mrs swayne i know that there are probably a lot of little things youd like to take along but forget it mr delta mementos i dont have whatever i really wanted was long since shipped out of this hell hole its all in storage ten thousand miles away my you really were prepared werent you tell me something i dont know you see the time had to come one way or the other yknow what i mean rachel walked rapidly past the two men and into the hall she stopped and came back to master sergeant flannagan a smile on her lips a glow in her eyes as she placed her hand on his face hey eddie she said quietly its really gonna happen were gonna live eddie yknow what i mean yeah babe i know as they walked out into the darkness toward the cabin bourne spoke i meant what i said about not wasting time sergeant start talking what were you going to tell me about swaynes place here are you ready what does that mean of course im ready but he wasnt he stopped suddenly on the grass at flannagans words for openers its a cemetery alex conklin sat back in the desk chair the phone in his hand stunned frowning unable to summon a rational response to jasons astonishing information all he could say was i dont believe it which part i dont know everything i guess the cemetery on down but i have to believe it dont i you didnt want to believe london or brussels either or a commander of the sixth fleet or the keeper of the covert keys in langley im just adding to the list the point is once you find out who they all are we can move youll have to start from the beginning again my heads shredded the telephone number in new york the license plates the body alex flannagan and the generals wife theyre on their way that was the deal and youve got to cover it just like that swayne kills himself and the two people on the premises who can answer questions we say ciao to them and let them get away thats only slightly more lunatic than what youve told me we dont have time for negotiating gamesand besides he cant answer any more questions they were on different levels oh boy thats really clear do it let them go we may need them both later conklin sighed his indecision apparent are you sure its very complicated do it for christs sake alex i dont give a goddamn about complications or violations or all the manipulations you can dream up i want carlos were building a net and we can pull him ini can pull him in all right all right theres a doctor in falls church that weve used before in special operations ill get hold of him hell know what to do good said bourne his mind racing now put me on tape ill give you everything flannagan gave me hurry up ive got a lot to do youre on tape delta one reading from the list he had written down in flannagans cabin jason spoke rapidly enunciating clearly so that there would be no confusion on the tape there were the names of seven frequent and acknowledged guests at the generals dinner parties none guaranteed as to accuracy or spelling but with broadbrush descriptions then came the license plates all from the far more serious twicemonthly meetings next to last were the telephone numbers of swaynes lawyer all of the estates guards the dog kennels and the pentagon extension for assigned vehicles finally there was the unlisted telephone in new york no name here only a machine that took messages thats got to be a priority one alex well break it said conklin inserting himself on the tape ill call the kennels and talk pentagonesethe generals being flown to a hushfactor post and we pay double for getting the animals out first thing in the morning open the gates incidentally the licenses are no problem and ill have casset run the names through the computers behind desoles back what about swayne weve got to keep the suicide quiet for a while how long how the hell do i know replied jason exasperated until we find out who they all are and i can reach themor you can reach themand together we can start the wave of panic rolling thats when we plant the carlos solution words said conklin his tone not flattering you could be talking about days maybe a week or even longer then thats what im talking about then wed better damn well bring in peter holland no not yet we dont know what hed do and im not giving him the chance to get in my way youve got to trust someone besides me jason i can fool the doctor perhaps for twentyfour or fortyeight hoursperhapsbut i doubt much longer than that hell want higher authorization and dont forget ive got casset breathing down my neck over desole give me two days get me two days while tracking down all this information and stalling charlie and lying through my teeth to peter telling them that were making progress running down the jackals possible couriers at the mayflower hotelwe think of course were doing nothing of the sort because were up to our credentials in some offthewall twentyyearold saigon conspiracy involving who knows what damned if we know except that the who is terribly impressive without going into statusesor is it stataewere now told they have their own private cemetery on the grounds of the general officer in charge of pentagon procurements who just happened to blow his head off a minor incident were sitting on jesus delta back up the missiles are colliding though he was standing in front of swaynes desk the generals corpse in the chair beside him bourne managed a tentative slow smile thats what were counting on isnt it its a scenario that could have been written by our beloved saint alex himself im only along for the ride im not steering what about the doctor interrupted jason youve been out of operation for almost five years how do you know hes still in business i run into him now and then were both museum mavens a couple of months ago at the corcoran gallery he complained that he wasnt given much to do these days change that tonight ill try what are you going to do delicately pull apart everything in this room gloves surgical of course dont touch the body only the pocketsvery delicately swaynes wife is coming down the stairs ill call you back when theyre gone get hold of that doctor ivan jax md by way of yale medical school surgical training and residency at massachusetts general college of surgeons by appointment jamaican by birth and erstwhile consultant to the central intelligence agency courtesy of a fellow black man with the improbable name of cactus drove through the gates of general swaynes estate in manassas virginia there were times thought ivan when he wished he had never met old cactus and this was one of them but tonight notwithstanding he never regretted that cactus had come into his life thanks to the old mans magic papers jax had gotten his brother and sister out of jamaica during the repressive manley years when established professionals were all but prohibited from emigrating and certainly not with personal funds cactus however using complex mockups of government permits had sprung both young adults out of the country along with bank transfers honored in lisbon all the aged forger re quested were stolen blank copies of various official documents including importexport bills of lading the two peoples passports separate photographs and copies of several signatures belonging to certain men in positions of authorityeasily obtainable through the hundreds of bureaucratic edicts published in the governmentcontrolled press ivans brother was currently a wealthy barrister in london and his sister a research fellow at cambridge yes he owed cactus thought dr jax as he swung his station wagon around the curve to the front of the house and when the old man had asked him to consult with a few friends over in langley seven years ago he had obliged some consultation still there were further perks forthcoming in ivans silent association with the intelligence agency when his island home threw out manley and seaga came to power among the first of the appropriated properties to be returned to their rightful owners were the jax familys holdings in montego bay and port antonio that had been alex conklins doing but without cactus there would have been no conklin not in ivans circle of friends but why did alex have to call tonight tonight was his twelfth wedding anniversary and he had sent the kids on an overnight with the neighbors children so that he and his wife could be alone alone with grilled jamaic ribs on the patioprepared by the only one who knew how namely chef ivana lot of good dark overton rum and some highly erotic skinnydipping in the pool damn alex double damn the sonofabitch bachelor who could only respond to the event of a wedding anniversary by saying what the hell you made the year so whats a day count get your jollies tomorrow i need you tonight so he had lied to his wife the former head nurse at mass general he told her that a patients life was in the balanceit was but it had already tipped the wrong way she had replied that perhaps her next husband would be more considerate of her life but her sad smile and her understanding eyes denied her words she knew death hurry my darling jax turned off the engine grabbed his medical bag and got out of the car he walked around the hood as the front door opened and a tall man in what appeared to be dark skintight clothing stood silhouetted in the frame im your doctor said ivan walking up the steps our mutual friend didnt give me your name but i guess im not supposed to have it i guess not agreed bourne extending a hand in a surgical glove as jax approached and i guess were both right said jax shaking hands with the stranger the mitt youre wearing is pretty familiar to me our mutual friend didnt tell me you were black is that a problem for you good christ no i like our friend even more it probably never occurred to him to say anything i think well get along lets go noname bourne stood ten feet to the right of the desk as jax swiftly expertly tended to the corpse mercifully wrapping the head in gauze without explaining he had cut away sections of the generals clothing examining those parts of the body beneath the fabric finally he carefully rolled the hooded body off the chair and onto the floor are you finished in here he asked looking over at jason ive swept it clean doctor if thats what you mean it usually is i want this room sealed no ones to enter it after we leave until our mutual friend gives the word i certainly cant guarantee that said bourne then hell have to why your general didnt commit suicide noname he was murdered the woman said alex conklin over the line from everything you told me it had to be swaynes wife jesus it doesnt change anything but it looks that way agreed bourne halfheartedly she had reason enough to do it god knowsstill if she did she didnt tell flannagan and that doesnt make sense no it doesnt conklin paused then spoke quickly let me talk to ivan ivan your doctor his name is ivan so nothing hes outside packing the merchandise was the way he put it in his wagon thats right we carried the body what makes him so sure it wasnt suicide broke in alex swayne was drugged he said hed call you later and explain he wants to get out of here and no ones to come into this room after we leaveafter i leaveuntil you give the word for the police hell tell you that too christ it must be a mess in there its not pretty what do you want me to do pull the curtains if there are any check the windows and if possible lock the door if theres no way to lock it look around for i found a set of keys in swaynes pocket interrupted jason i checked one of them fits good when you leave wipe the door down clean find some furniture polish or a dusting spray thats not going to keep out anyone who wants to get in no but if someone does we might pick up a print youre reaching i certainly am concurred the former intelligence officer ive also got to figure out a way to seal up the whole place without using anybody from langley and not incidentally keep the pentagon at bay just in case someone among those twentyodd thousand people wants to reach swayne and that includes his office and probably a couple of hundred buyers and sellers a day in procurements christ its impossible its perfect contradicted bourne as dr ivan jax suddenly appeared in the doorway our little game of destabilization will start right here on the farm do you have cactuss number not with me i think its probably in a shoebox at home call mo panov hes got it then reach cactus and tell him to get to a pay phone and call me here what the hell have you got in mind i hear that old mans name i get nervous you told me i had to find someone else to trust besides you i just did reach him alex jason hung up the telephone im sorry doctor or maybe under the circumstances i can use your name hello ivan hello noname which is the way id like to keep it on my end especially when i just heard you say another name alex no of course it wasnt alex not our mutual friend bourne laughed quietly knowingly as he walked away from the desk it was cactus wasnt it i just came in to ask you if you wanted me to close the gates said jax bypassing the question would you be offended if i told you that i didnt think of him until i saw you just now certain associations are fairly obvious the gates please do you owe cactus as much as i do doctor jason held his place looking at the jamaican i owe him so much that i could never think of compromising him in a situation like tonight for gods sake hes an old man and no matter what deviant conclusions langley wants to come up with tonight was murder a particularly brutal killing no i wouldnt involve him youre not me you see i have to hed never forgive me if i didnt you dont think much of yourself do you please close the gates doctor theres an alarm panel in the hallway i can activate when theyre shut jax hesitated as if unsure of what he wanted to say listen he began haltingly most sane people have reasons for saying thingsdoing things my guess is youre sane call alex if you need meif old cactus needs me the doctor left rushing out the door bourne turned and glanced around the room since flannagan and rachel swayne had left nearly three hours ago he had searched every foot of the generals study as well as the dead soldiers separate bedroom on the second floor he had placed the items he intended to take on the brass coffee table he studied them now there were three brown leatherbound covers each equal in size each holding inserted spiralbound pages they were a desk set the first was an appointments calendar the second a personal telephone book in which the names and numbers were entered in ink the last was an expense diary barely touched along with these were eleven office messages of the telephone notepad variety which jason found in swaynes pockets a golfclub scorecard and several memoranda written at the pentagon finally there was the generals wallet containing a profusion of impressive credentials and very little money bourne would turn everything over to alex and hope further leads would be found but as far as he could determine he had turned up nothing startling nothing dramatically relevant to the modern medusa and that bothered him there had to be something this was the old soldiers home his sanctum sanctorum inside that homesomething he knew it he felt it but he could not find it so he started again not foot by foot now instead inch by inch fourteen minutes later as he was removing and turning over the photographs on the wall behind the desk the wall to the right of the cushioned bay window that overlooked the lawn outside he recalled conklins words about checking the windows and the curtains so that no one could enter or observe the scene inside christ it must be a mess in there its not very pleasant it wasnt the panes of the central bay window frame were splattered with blood and membrane and the the small brass latch not only was it free from its catch the window itself was openbarely open but nevertheless it was open bourne knelt on the cushioned seat and looked closely at the shiny brass fixture and the surrounding panes of glass there were smudges among the rivulets of dried blood and tissue coarse pressings on the stains that appeared to widen and thin them out into irregular shapes then below the sill he saw what kept the window from closing the end of the left drape had been drawn out a small piece of its tasseled fabric wedged beneath the lower window frame jason stepped back bewildered but not really surprised this was what he had been looking for the missing piece in the complex puzzle that was the death of norman swayne someone had climbed out that window after the shot that blew the generals skull apart someone who could not risk being seen going through the front hall or out the front door someone who knew the house and the grounds and the dogs a brutal killer from medusa goddamn it who who had been here flannagan swaynes wife they would know they had to know bourne lurched for the telephone on the desk it began ringing before his hand touched it alex no brer rabbit its just an old friend and i didnt realize we were so free with names were not we shouldnt be said jason rapidly imposing a control on himself he could barely exercise something happened a moment agoi found something calm down boy what can i do for you i need youout here where i am are you free well lets see cactus chuckled as he spoke there are several board meetings i should rightfully attend and the white house wants me for a power breakfast when and where brer rabbit not alone old friend i want three or four others with you is that possible i dont know what did you have in mind that fellow who drove me into town after i saw you are there any other likeminded citizens in the neighborhood most are doin time frankly but i suppose i could dig around the refuse and pull up a few what for guard duty its pretty simple really youll be on the phone and theyll be behind locked gates telling people that its private property that visitors arent welcome especially a few honkies probably in limousines now that might appeal to the brothers call me back and ill give you directions bourne disconnected the line and immediately released the bar for a dial tone he touched the numbers for conklins phone in vienna yes answered alex the doctor was right and i let our snake lady executioner get away swaynes wife you mean no but she and her fasttalking sergeant know who it wasthey had to know who was here pick them up and hold them they lied to me so the deals off whoever staged this gruesome suicide had orders from high up in medusa i want him hes our shortcut hes also beyond our reach what the hell are you talking about because the sergeant and his paramour are beyond our reach theyve disappeared thats crazy if i know saint alex and i do youve had them covered since they left here electronically not physically remember you insisted we keep langley and peter holland away from medusa what did you do i sent out a fulltoned alert to the central reservations computers of all international airline carriers as of eighttwenty this evening our subjects had seats on pan ams ten oclock flight to london london broke in jason they were heading the other way to the pacific to hawaii thats probably where theyre going because they never showed up at pan am who knows damn it you should how two united states citizens flying to hawaii dont have to present passports to enter our fiftieth state a drivers license or a voters registration card will do you told me that theyve been considering this move for quite a while how difficult would it be for a master sergeant with over thirty years service to get a couple of drivers licenses using different names but why to throw off people looking for themlike us or maybe a few medusans very high up shit would you care to talk less in the vulgate professor it was the vulgate wasnt it shut up ive got to think then think about the fact that were up to our asses in the arctic without a heater its time for peter holland we need him we need langley no not yet youre forgetting something holland took an oath and everything we know about him says he took it seriously he may bend a rule now and then but if hes faced with a medusa with hundreds of millions out of geneva buying up whatever theyre buying up in europe he may say halt thats enough thats a risk we have to take we need him david not david goddamn you im bourne jason bourne your creation and im owed my family is owed i wont have it any other way and youll kill me if i go against you silence neither spoke until delta one of saigons medusa broke the pause yes alex ill kill you not because you tried to kill me in paris but for the same blind assumptions you made back then that led to your decision to come after me can you understand that yes replied conklin his voice so low it was barely audible the arrogance of ignorance its your favorite washington theme you always make it sound so oriental but somewhere along the line youre going to have to be a little less arrogant yourself theres only so much we can do alone on the other hand theres so much that can be loused up if were not alone look at the progress weve made from zero to double digits in how longfortyeight seventytwo hours give me the two days alex please were closing in on what this whole things about what medusas all about one breakthrough and we present them with the perfect solution to get rid of me the jackal ill do the best i can did cactus reach you yes hell call me back and then come out here ill explain later i should tell you he and our doctor are friends i know ivan told me alex i want to get some things over to youswaynes telephone book his wallet appointments schedule stuff like that ill wrap it all up and have one of cactuss boys deliver the package to your place to the security gate put everything into your high tech and see what you can find cactuss boys what are you doing taking an item off your agenda im sealing this place up nobodyll be able to get in but well see who tries that could be interesting the kennel people are coming for the dogs around seven in the morning incidentally so dont make the seals too tight which reminds me interrupted jason be official again and call the guards on the other shifts their services are no longer required but each will receive a months pay by mail in lieu of notice who the hells going to pay it theres no langley remember no peter holland and im not independently wealthy i am ill phone my bank in maine and have them fed ex you a cashiers check ask your friend casset to pick it up at your apartment in the morning its funny isnt it said conklin slowly pensively i forgot about your money i never think about it actually i guess ive blocked it out of my mind thats possible added bourne a trace of lightness in his voice the official part of you may have visions of some bureaucrat coming up to marie and saying by the way mrs webb or bourne or whoever you are while you were in the employ of the canadian government you made off with over five million dollars belonging to mine she was only brilliant davidjason you were owed every dollar dont press the point alex she claimed at least twice the amount she was right its why everyone shut up what are you going to do now wait for cactuss call then make one of my own oh to my wife marie sat on the balcony of her villa at tranquility inn staring out at the moonlit caribbean trying with every controlling instinct in her not to go mad with fear strangely perhaps stupidly or even dangerously it was not the fear of physical harm that consumed her she had lived in both europe and the far east with the killing machine that was jason bourne she knew what that stranger was capable of and it was brutally efficient no it wasnt bourne it was davidwhat jason bourne was doing to david webb she had to stop it they could go away far away to some remote safe haven and start a new life with new names create a world for themselves that carlos could never penetrate they had all the money they would ever need they could do it it was done all the timehundreds thousands of men and women and children whose lives were threatened were shielded by their governments and if ever a government anywhere had reason to protect a man that man was david webb thoughts conceived in frenzy reflected marie getting up from her chair and walking to the balconys railing it would never happen because david could never accept the solution where the jackal was concerned david webb was ruled by jason bourne and bourne was capable of destroying his host body oh god whats happening to us the telephone rang marie stiffened then rushed into the bedroom and picked it up yes hello sis its johnny oh which means you havent heard from david no and im going a little crazy bro hell call when he can you know that but youre not calling to tell me that no im just checking in im stuck over here on the big island and it looks like ill be here for a while im at government house with henry waiting for the cg to personally thank me for accommodating the foreign office i dont understand a word youre saying oh sorry henry sykes is the crown governors aide who asked me to take care of that old french war hero down the path from you when the cg wants to thank you you wait until youre thankedwhen the phones go out cowboys like me need government house youve totally lost me johnny a storm out of basseterre will hit in a few hours out of whom its a what but i should be back before then have the maid make up the couch for me john its not necessary for you to stay here good heavens there are men with guns outside the hedge and down on the beach and god knows where else thats where theyre going to stay see you later and hug the kids for me theyre asleep said marie as her younger brother hung up she looked at the phone as she replaced it unconsciously saying out loud how little i know about you little bro our favorite incorrigible bro and how much more does my husband know damn the both of you the telephone instantly rang again stunning her she grabbed it hello its me thank god hes out of town but everythings fine im fine and were making headway you dont have to do this we dont have to yes we do said jason bourneno evidence of david webb just know i love you he loves you stop it its happening im sorry i apologizeforgive me youre david of course im david i was just joking no you werent i was talking to alex thats all we argued thats all no it isnt i want you back i want you here then i cant talk any longer i love you the line went dead and marie st jacques webb fell on the bed her cries of futility muffled by the blankets alexander conklin his eyes red with strain kept touching the letters and the numbers of his computer his head turned to the open pages of the ledgers sent over by bourne from general norman swaynes estate two shrill beeps suddenly intruded on the silence of the room it was the inanimate machines robotic signal that another dual reference had been calculated he checked the entry rg what did it mean he backtaped and found nothing he pressed forward typing like a mindless automaton three beeps he kept punching the irritatingly beige buttons faster and faster four beeps five six back spacestopforward rg rg rg rg what the hell was rg he crosschecked the data with the entries from the three different leatherbound notebooks a common numeral sprang out in green letters on the screen a telephone number conklin picked up the langley phone dialed the night watch and told the cia operator to trace it its unlisted sir its one of three numbers for the same residence in boston massachusetts the name please gates randolph the residence is never mind operator interrupted alex knowing that he had been given the essential information randolph gates scholar attorney for the privileged advocate of the bigger the better the biggest the best how right that gates should be involved with amassing hundreds of millions in europe controlled by american interests no wait a moment it wasnt right at all it was wrong it was completely illogical for the scholarly attorney to have any connection whatsoever to a highly questionable indeed illegal operation like medusa it did not make sense one did not have to admire the celebrated legal giant to grant him just about the cleanest record for propriety in the bar association he was a notorious stickler for the most minute points of law often using those minutiae of his craft to obtain favorable decisions but no one ever dared question his integrity so unpopular were his legal and philosophical opinions to the brightest lawyers in the liberal establishment that he would have been gleefully discredited years ago at the slightest hint of impropriety yet here was his name appearing six times in the appointments calendar of a medusan responsible for untold millions in the nations defense expenditures an unstable medusan whose apparent suicide was in fact murder conklin looked at the screen at the date of swaynes last entry referring to rg it was on august second barely a week ago he picked up the leatherbound diary and turned to the day he had been concentrating on names not comments unless the information struck him as relevantto what he was not sure but he was trusting to instinct if he had known up front who rg was the abbreviated handwritten notation beside the last entry would have caught his eye rg will nt cnsider appt fr maj crft need crft on hs stff unlock paris yrs ago two file out and burd the paris should have alerted him thought alex but swaynes notes throughout were filled with foreign or exotic names and places as if the general had been trying to impress whoever might read his personal observations also conklin regretfully considered he was terribly tired were it not for his computer he probably would not have centered in on dr randolph gates legal olympian paris yrs ago two file out and burd the first part was obvious the second obscure but hardly concealed the two referred to the armys intelligence arm g and the file was just that an event or a revelation uncovered by intelligence personnel in paris yrs ago and removed from the data banks it was an amateurs attempt to use intelligence gibberish by misusing it unlock meant keyjesus swayne was an idiot using his notepad alex wrote out the notation as he knew it to be randolph gates will not consider the appointment for a major craft or croft or even christopher for the f could be an s but we need crft on his staff the key is to use the information in our g file about gates in paris seven years ago said file removed and in our possession if that was not the exact translation of swaynes insertion it was certainly close enough in substance to act upon mused conklin turning his wrist and glancing at his watch it was twenty past three in the morning a time when even the most disciplined person would be shaken by the shrill bell of a telephone why not davidjasonwas right every hour counted now alex picked up the phone and touched the numbers for boston massachusetts the telephone kept ringing and the bitch would not pick it up in her room then gates looked at the lighted square and the blood drained from his head it was his unlisted number a number that was restricted to a very few he thrashed wildly in the bed his eyes wide the strange call from paris unnerved him the more he thought about it it concerned montserrat he knew it the information he had relayed was wrong prefontaine had lied to him and now paris wanted an accounting my god theyd come after him expose him no there was a way a perfectly acceptable explanation the truth he would deliver the liars to paris to pariss man here in boston he would trap the drunken prefontaine and the sleazeball detective and force them to tell their lies to the one person who could absolve him the phone he had to answer it he could not appear as if he had anything to hide he reached out and grabbed the incessantly ringing instrument pulling it to his ear yes seven years ago counselor began the quiet voice on the line do i have to remind you that weve got the entire file the deuxième bureau was extremely cooperative far more than you have been for gods sake i was lied to cried gates swinging his legs onto the floor in panic his voice hoarse you cant believe id forward erroneous information id have to be insane we know you can be obstinate we made a simple request i complied i swear i did good christ i paid fifteen thousand dollars to make certain everything was silent absolutely untraceablenot that the money matters of course you paid interrupted the quiet voice i can show you the bank withdrawals for what the information naturally i hired a former judge who has contacts for information about craft what croft christopher who our major counselor the major if thats her code name then yes yes i did a code name the woman the two children they flew to the island of montserrat i swear thats what i was told there was a sudden click and the line went dead his hand still on the telephone conklin broke out in a sweat he released the phone and got up from his chair limping away from the computer looking back at it down at it as if it were some monstrous thing that had taken him into a forbidden land where nothing was as it appeared to be or should be what had happened how did randolph gates know anything about montserrat about marie and the children why alex lowered himself into the armchair his pulse racing his thoughts clashing no judgments emerging only chaos he gripped his right wrist with his left hand his nails digging into his flesh he had to get hold of himself he had to thinkhe had to act for davids wife and children associations what were the conceivable associations it was difficult enough to consider gates as even unwittingly a part of medusa but impossible to think he was also connected to carlos the jackal impossible yet both appeared to be the connections existed was carlos himself part of swaynes medusa everything they knew about the jackal would deny it emphatically the assassins strength was in his total disassociation with any structured entity jason bourne had proved that thirteen years ago in paris no group of people could ever reach him they could only send out a message and he would reach them the single organization the international killer for hire permitted was his army of old men from the mediterranean to the baltic lost misfits criminals whose impoverished last days were made better by the assassins largess fealty unto death demanded and received where didcoulda man like randolph gates fit in he didnt concluded alex as the outer limits of his imagination explored an old territorybe skeptical of the apparent the celebrated attorney was no more part of carlos than he was of medusa he was the aberration the flaw in the lens an otherwise honorable man with a single weakness that had been uncovered by two disparate parties both with extraordinary resources it was common knowledge that the jackal could reach into the sûreté and interpol and it took no clairvoyance to assume that medusa could penetrate the armys g it was the only possible explanation for gates had been too controversial too powerful for too long to function as spectacularly as he did in the courts if his vulnerability was easily uncovered no it would take predators like the jackal and the men of medusa to bore deep enough to dredge up a secret so devastating as to turn randolph gates into a valuable pawn clearly carlos had gotten to him first conklin reflected on a truth that was forever reconfirmed the world of global corrupters was in reality a small multilayered neighborhood geometric in design the irregular avenues of corruption leading into one another how could it be otherwise the residents of those lethal streets had services to offer their clients were a specific breedthe desperate dregs of humanity extort compromise kill the jackal and the men of medusa belonged to the same fraternal order the brotherhood of i must have mine breakthrough but it was a breakthrough jason bourne could handlenot david webband webb was still too much a part of bourne especially since both parts of the same man were over a thousand miles away from montserrat the coordinates of death determined by carlos montserrat johnny st jacques the little brother who had proved himself in a backwater town in the northern regions of canada proved himself beyond the knowledge and the understanding of his family especially his beloved sister a man who could kill in angerwho had killed in furyand who would kill again if the sister he adored and her children were under the jackals gun david believed in himjason bourne believed in him which was far more to the point alex looked over at the telephone console then quickly got out of the chair he rushed to the desk sat down and touched the buttons that rewound the current tape adjusting it to the spot where he wanted to pick it up he went forward and back until he heard gatess panicked voice good christ i paid fifteen thousand no not there thought conklin later i can show you the bank withdrawals later i hired a former judge who has contacts thats it a judge they flew to the island of montserrat alex opened the drawer where he kept a sheet of paper with each number he had called during the past two days on the assumption that he might need specific ones quickly he saw the number in the caribbean for tranquility inn picked up the phone and dialed after more rings than seemed necessary a voice thick with sleep answered tranquility this is an emergency broke in conklin its urgent that i speak with john st jacques quickly please im sorry sir mr st jacques isnt here ive got to find him i repeat its urgent where is he on the big island montserrat yes where my names conklin he wants to talk to mehe has to talk to me please a big wind came up from basseterre and all flights are canceled until morning a what a tropical depression oh a storm we prefer a td sir mr st jacques left a telephone number in plymouth whats your name interrupted alex suddenly the clerk replied pritchard and conklin continued im going to ask you a very delicate question mr pritchard its important that you have the right answer but if its the wrong one you must do as i tell you mr st jacques will confirm everything i say when i reach him however i cant waste time now do you understand me what is your question asked the clerk with dignity im not a child mon im sorry i didnt mean to the question mr conklin youre in a hurry yes of course mr st jacquess sister and her children are they in a safe place did mr st jacques take certain precautions such as armed guards about the villa and our usual men down on the beach said the clerk the answer is yes its the right answer alex took a deep breath his breathing still erratic now whats the number where i can reach mr st jacques the clerk gave it to conklin then added many phones are out sir it might be well if you left a number here the wind is still strong but mr saint jay will no doubt come over with the first light if he can certainly alex rattled off the number of the sterile telephone in the vienna apartment and had the man in montserrat repeat it thats it said conklin ill try plymouth now the spelling of your name please it is conch conk broke in alex snapping off the line and instantly dialing the number in the town of plymouth the capital of montserrat once again a startled drowsy voice answered it was a barely coherent greeting whos this asked conklin impatiently who the hell is thisare you replied an angry english man im trying to reach john st jacques its an emergency and i was given this number by the desk at tranquility inn good lord their phones are intact obviously please is john there yes yes of course hes across the hall ill fetch him who shall i say alex is good enough just alex hurry please twenty seconds later the voice of john st jacques filled the line conklin is that you listen to me they know marie and the children flew into montserrat we heard that someone was asking questions over at the airport about a woman and two kids then thats why you moved them from the house to the inn thats right who was asking questions we dont know it was done by telephone i didnt want to leave them even for a few hours but i had a command appearance at government house and by the time that sonofabitch crown governor showed up the storm hit i know i talked to the desk and got this number thats one consolation the phones are still working in weather like this they usually dont which is why we suck up to the crown i understand youve got guards youre goddamned right cried st jacques the trouble is i dont know what to look for except strangers in boats or on the beach and if they dont stop and identify themselves satisfactorily my orders are to shoot i may be able to help go ahead we got a breakdont ask how its from outer space but that doesnt matter its real the man who traced marie to montserrat used a judge who had contacts presumably in the islands a judge exploded the owner of tranquility inn my god hes there christ hes there ill kill that scum bastard stop it johnny get hold of yourselfwhos there a judge and he insisted on using a different name i didnt think anything about ita couple of whackadoo old men with similar names old men slow down johnny this is important what two old men the one youre talking about is from boston yes confirmed alex emphatically the other flew in from paris paris jesus christ the old men of paris what the jackal carlos has his old men in place now you slow down alex said st jacques his breathing audible now you be clearer theres no time johnny carlos has an armyhis armyof old men wholl die for him kill for him there wont be any strangers on the beach theyre already there can you get back to the island somehow yes ill call my people over there both those pieces of garbage will be thrown into the cisterns hurry john st jacques pressed down the small bar of the old telephone released it and heard the foreverpulsating dial tone he spun the numbers for the inn on tranquility isle we are sorry said the recorded voice due to weather conditions the lines are down to the area you are calling government is working very hard to restore communications please try your call later have a good day john st jacques slammed the phone down with such force that he broke it in two a boat he screamed get me a drug boat youre crazy objected the aide to the crown governor across the room in these swells a sea streak henry said the devoted brother reaching into his belt and slowly pulling out an automatic or ill be forced to do something i dont even want to think about but ill get a boat i simply cant believe this chap neither can i henry i mean it though jean pierre fontaines nurse sat at her dressing table in front of the mirror and adjusted her tightly knotted blond hair under the black rain hat she looked at her watch recalling every word of the most unusual telephone call she had received several hours ago from argenteuil in france from the great man who made all things possible there is an american attorney who calls himself a judge staying near you i know of no such person monseigneur he is there nevertheless our hero rightfully complains of his presence and a call to his home in the city of boston confirms that it is he his presence here is not desirable then his presence there is abominable to me he pretends to be in my debtan enormous debt an event that could destroy himyet his actions tell me that hes ungrateful that he intends to cancel his debt by betraying me and by betraying me he betrays you hes dead exactly in the past hes been valuable to me but the past is over find him kill him make his death appear to be a tragic accident finally since we will not speak until you are back on martinique are preparations complete for your last act on my behalf they are monseigneur the two syringes were prepared by the surgeon at the hospital in fortdefrance he sends you his devotion he should hes alive as opposed to several dozen of his patients they know nothing of his other life in martinique im aware of that administer the doses in fortyeight hours when the chaos has begun to subside knowing that the hero was my inventionwhich ill make sure they knowwill put a chameleon to shame all will be done youll be here soon in time for the shock waves im leaving within the hour and will reach antigua before its noon in montserrat tomorrow all things being on schedule ill arrive in time to observe the exquisite anguish of jason bourne before i leave my signature a bullet in his throat the americans will then know who has won adieu the nurse like an ecstatic suppliant arched her neck in front of the mirror remembering the mystical words of her omniscient lord it was nearly time she thought opening the dresser drawer and picking out a diamondclustered wire garrote from among her necklaces a gift from her mentor it would be so simple she had easily learned who the judge was and where he was stayingthe old painfully thin man three villas away everything now was precision the tragic accident merely a prelude to the horror that would take place at villa twenty in less than an hour for all of tranquilitys villas had kerosene lamps in the event of electricity loss and generator malfunction a panicked old man with loose bowels or in plain fear living through such a storm as they were experiencing might well attempt to light a lamp for additional comfort how tragic that his upper body would fall into the flowing spilled kerosene his neck scorched into black tissue the neck that had been garroted do it insisted the echoing voices of her imagination you must obey without carlos you would have been a headless corpse in algeria she would do itshe would do it now the harsh downpour of the rain on the roof and the windows and the whistling roaring wind outside were interrupted by a blinding streak of lightning followed by a deafening crack of thunder jean pierre fontaine wept silently as he knelt beside the bed his face inches from his womans his tears falling on the cold flesh of her arm she was dead and the note by her white rigid hand said it all maintenant nous deux sommes libres mon amour they were both free she from the terrible pain he from the price demanded by the monseigneur a price he had not described to her but one she knew was too horrible to pay he had known for months that his woman had ready access to pills that would end her life quickly if her living became unendurable he had frequently at times frantically searched for them but he had never found them now he knew why as he stared at the small tin of her favorite pastilles the harmless droplets of licorice she had popped laughingly into her mouth for years be thankful mon cher they might be caviar or those expensive drugs the rich indulge in they were not caviar but they were drugs lethal drugs footsteps the nurse she had come out of her room but she could not see his woman fontaine pushed himself up from the bed wiped his eyes as best he could and hurried to the door he opened it stunned by the sight of the woman she stood directly in front of him her arm raised the knuckles of her hand arcing forward to knock monsieur you startled me i believe we startled each other jean pierre slipped out rapidly closing the door behind him regine is finally asleep he whispered bringing his forefinger to his lips this terrible storm has kept her up most of the night but it is sent from heaven for usfor youisnt it there are times when i think the monseigneur can order such things then i doubt they come from heaven its not the source of his influence to business interrupted the nurse not amused and walking away from the door are you prepared i will be in a matter of minutes replied fontaine heading for the table where his killing equipment lay in the locked drawer he reached into his pocket and took out the key do you want to go over the procedure he asked turning for my benefit of course at this age details are often blurred yes i do because there is a slight change oh the old frenchman arched his brows also at my age sudden changes are not welcome its only a question of timing no more than a quarter of an hour perhaps much less an eternity in this business said fontaine as yet another streak of lightning separated only milliseconds from its crash of thunder interrupted the pounding rain on the windows and the roof its dangerous enough to be outside that bolt was too near for safety if you believe that think how the guards feel the slight change please also an explanation ill give you no explanation except to say that it is an order from argenteuil and you were responsible the judge draw your own conclusions then he was not sent to ill say no more the change is as follows rather than running up the path from here to the guards at villa twenty and demanding emergency assistance for your ill wife i will say i was returning from the front desk where i was complaining about the telephone and saw a fire in villa fourteen three away from ours therell no doubt be a great deal of confusion what with the storm and everyone yelling and calling for help that will be your signal use the confusion get through and take out whoever remains at the womans villamake sure your silencer is secure then go inside and do the work you have sworn to do so i wait for the fire for the guards and for you to return to number eleven exactly stay on the porch with the door closed of course of course it may take me five minutes or perhaps even twenty but stay there naturally may i ask madameor perhaps mademoiselle although i see no evidence what is it it will take you five or twenty minutes to do what youre a fool old man what must be done of course the nurse pulled her raincoat around her looped the belt and walked to the front door of the villa get your equipment together and be out here in three minutes she commanded of course the door swung back with the wind as the woman opened it she went outside into the torrential rain pulling it shut behind her astonished and confused the old frenchman stood motionless trying to make sense out of the inexplicable things were happening too fast for him blurred in the agony of his womans death there was no time to mourn no time to feel only think and think quickly revelation came hard upon revelation leaving unanswered questions that had to be answered so the whole could be understoodso that montserrat itself made sense the nurse was more than a conduit for instructions from argenteuil the angel of mercy was herself an angel of death a killer in her own right so why was he sent thousands of miles to do the work another could do just as well and without the elaborate charade of his auspicious arrival an old hero of france indeed it was all so unnecessary and speaking of age there was anotheranother old man who was no killer at all perhaps thought the false jean pierre fontaine he had made a terrible mistake perhaps instead of coming to kill him the other old man had come to warn him mon dieu whispered the frenchman the old men of paris the jackals army too many questions fontaine walked rapidly to the nurses bedroom door and opened it with the swiftness developed over a lifetime of practice impaired only slightly by his years he began methodically to tear apart the womans roomsuitcase closet clothes pillows mattress bureau dressing table writing desk the desk a locked drawer in the deska locked drawer in the outer room the equipment nothing mattered now his woman was gone and there were too many questions a heavy lamp on the desk with a thick brass basehe picked it up pulling out the cord and smashed it into the drawer again and again and again until the wood splintered shattering the recess that held the tiny vertical latch he yanked the drawer open and stared in equal parts of horror and comprehension at what he saw next to each other in a cushioned plastic case were two hypodermic needles their vials filled with an identical yellowish serum he did not have to know the chemical compounds there were too many beyond his knowledge that would be effective liquid death in the veins nor did he have to be told for whom they were intended côte à côte dans le lit two bodies beside each other in bed he and his woman in a pact of final deliverance how thoroughly had the monseigneur thought everything out himself dead one dead old man from the jackals army of old men had outwitted all the security procedures killing and mutilating those dearest to carloss ultimate enemy jason bourne and naturally behind that brilliant manipulation was the jackal himself ce nest pas le contrat myself yes but not my woman you promised me the nurse the angel not of mercy but of death the man known on tranquility isle as jean pierre fontaine walked as fast as he could into the other room to his equipment the huge silver racing craft with its two enormous engines crashed through the swells as often above the waves as in them on the short low bridge john st jacques maneuvered the drug boat through the dangerous reefs he knew by summoned memory aided by the powerful searchlight that lit up the turbulent waters now twenty now two hundred feet in front of the bow he kept screaming into his radio the microphone weaving in front of his drenched face hoping against all logic to raise someone on tranquility he was within three miles of the island a shrubbed volcanic intrusion on the water his landmark tranquility isle was in kilometers much nearer plymouth than to blackburne airport and if one knew the shoals not much longer to reach in a drug boat than in a seaplane which had to bank east out of blackburne to catch the prevailing west winds in order to land on the sea johnny was not sure why these calculations kept interfering with his concentration except that somehow they made him feel better that he was doing the best he could damn it why was it always the best he could do rather than simply the best he couldnt louse up anymore not now not tonight christ he owed everything to mare and david maybe even more to the crazy bastard who was his brotherinlaw than to his own sister david wildnuts david a man he sometimes wondered if marie ever knew existed you back off little bro ill take care of this you cant david i did it i killed them i said back off i asked for your help not for you to be me but you see i am you i would have done the same thing and that makes me you in my eyes thats crazy its part of it someday i may teach you how to kill cleanly in the dark in the meantime listen to the lawyers suppose they lose ill get you out ill get you away how ill kill again i cant believe you a teacher a scholari dont believe you i dont want to believe youyoure my sisters husband then dont believe me johnny and forget everything ive said and never tell your sister i said it its that other person inside of you isnt it youre very dear to marie thats no answer here now youre bourne arent you jason bourne well never ever discuss this conversation johnny do you understand me no he had never understood thought st jacques as the swirling winds and the cracks of lightning seemed to envelop the boat even when marie and david appealed to his rapidly disintegrating ego by suggesting he could build a new life for himself in the islands seed money they had said build us a house and then see where you want to go from there within limits well back you why would they do that why did they it was not they it was he jason bourne johnny st jacques understood the other morning when he picked up the phone by the pool and was told by an island pilot that someone had been asking questions at the airport about a woman and two children someday i may teach you how to kill cleanly in the dark jason bourne lights he saw the beach lights of tranquility he was less than a mile from the shore the rain pounded down against the old frenchman the blasts of wind throwing him off balance as he made his way up the path toward villa fourteen he angled his head against the elements squinting wiping his face with his left hand his right gripping the weapon a gun lengthened by the extension of the pocked cylinder that was its silencer he held the pistol behind him as he had done years ago racing along railroad tracks sticks of dynamite in one hand a german luger in the other prepared to drop both at the appearance of nazi patrols whoever they were on the path above they were no less than the boche in his mind all were boche he had been subservient to others long enough his woman was gone he would be his own man now for there was nothing left but his own decisions his own feelings his own very private sense of what was right and what was wrong and the jackal was wrong the apostle of carlos could accept the killing of the woman it was a debt he could rationalize but not the children and certainly not the mutilations those acts were against god and he and his woman were about to face him there had to be certain ameliorating circumstances stop the angel of death what could she be doing what did the fire she talked about mean then he saw ita huge burst of flame through the hedges of villa fourteen in a window the same window that had to be the bedroom of the luxurious pink cottage fontaine reached the flagstone walk that led to the front door as a bolt of lightning shook the ground under him he fell to the earth then struggled to his knees crawling to the pink porch its fluttering overhead light outlining the door no amount of twisting or pulling or shoving could release the latch so he angled his pistol up squeezed the trigger twice and blew the lock apart he pushed himself to his feet and went inside inside the screams came from beyond the door of the master bedroom the old frenchman lurched toward it his legs unsteady his weapon wavering in his right hand with what strength he had left he kicked the door open and observed a scene that he knew had to come from hell the nurse with the old mans head in a metal leash was forcing her victim down into a raging kerosene fire on the floor arêtes screamed the man called jean pierre fontaine assez maintenant through the rising spreading flames shots rang out and bodies fell the lights of tranquilitys beach drew nearer as john st jacques kept yelling into the microphone its me its saint jay coming in dont shoot but the sleek silver drug boat was greeted by the staccato gunfire of automatic weapons st jacques dived to the deck and kept shouting im coming inim beaching hold your goddamned fire is that you mon came a panicked voice over the radio you want to get paid next week oh yes mr saint jay the loudspeakers on the beach erratically interrupted the winds and the thunder out of basseterre everyone down on the beach stop shooting your guns the boatt is okay mon it is our boss mon mr saint jay the drug boat shot out of the water and onto the dark sand its engines screaming the blades instantly embedded the pointed hull cracking under the impact st jacques leaped up from his defensive fetal position and vaulted over the gunwale villa twenty he roared racing through the downpour across the beach to the stone steps that led to the path all you men get there as he ran up the hard rainsplattered staircase he suddenly gasped his personal galaxy exploding into a thousand blinding stars of fire gunshots one after another on the east wing of the path his legs cycled faster and faster leaping over two and three steps at a time he reached the path and like a man possessed raced up the path toward villa twenty snapping his head to the right in furious confusion that only added to his panic peoplemen and woman from his staffwere clustered around the doorway of villa fourteen who was there my god the judge his lungs bursting every muscle and tendon in his legs stretched to the breaking point st jacques reached his sisters house he crashed through the gate and ran to the door hurling his body against it and bursting through to the room inside eyes bulging first in horror then in unmeasurable pain he fell to his knees screaming on the white wall with terrible clarity were the words scrawled in dark red jason bourne brother of the jackal johnny johnny stop it his sisters voice crashed into his ear as she cradled his head in one arm the other extended above him her free hand gripping his hair nearly pulling it out of his skull can you hear me were all right bro the children are in another villawere fine the faces above him and around him came slowly into focus among them were the two old men one from boston the other from paris there they are screamed st jacques lurching up but stopped by marie who fell across him ill kill the bastards no roared his sister holding him helped by a guard whose strong black hands gripped her brothers shoulders at this moment theyre two of the best friends we have you dont know who they are cried st jacques trying to free himself yes we do broke in marie lowering her voice her lips next to his ear enough to know they can lead us to the jackal they work for the jackal one did said the sister the other never heard of carlos you dont understand whispered st jacques theyre old menthe old men of paris the jackals army conklin reached me in plymouth and explained theyre killers again one was but hes not anymore he has nothing to kill for now the other well the others a mistake a stupid outrageous mistake but thats all he is and thank god for itfor him its all crazy its crazy agreed marie nodding to the guard to help her brother up come on johnny we have things to talk about the storm had blown away like a violent unwanted intruder racing off into the night leaving behind the carnage of its rage the early morning light broke over the eastern horizon slowly revealing through the mists the bluegreen out islands of montserrat the first boats cautiously dolefully lumbered out to the favored fishing grounds for the catch of the day meant one more days survival marie her brother and the two old men were around a table on the balcony of an unoccupied villa over coffee they had been talking for the better part of an hour treating each point of horror coldly dissecting facts without feeling the aged false hero of france had been assured that all proper arrangements would be made for his woman once phone service had been restored to the big island if it was possible he wanted her to be buried in the islands she would understand there was nothing left for her in france but the ignominy of a tawdry grave if it was possible its possible said st jacques because of you my sisters alive because of me young man she might have died would you have killed me asked marie studying the old frenchman certainly not after i saw what carlos had planned for me and my woman he had broken the contract not i before then when i had not yet seen the needles understood what was all too obvious yes thats difficult to answer a contracts a contract still my woman was dead and a part of her dying was because she sensed that a terrible thing had been demanded of me to go through with that demand would deny that aspect of her death dont you see yet again even in her death the monseigneur could not be totally deniedhe had made possible years of relative happiness that would have been impossible without him i simply dont know i might have reasoned that i owed him your lifeyour deathbut certainly not the childrens and most certainly not the rest of it rest of what asked st jacques its best not to inquire i think you would have killed me said marie i tell you i simply dont know there was nothing personal you were not a person to me you were simply an event that was part of a business arrangement still as i say my woman was gone and im an old man with limited time before me perhaps a look in your eyes or a plea for your childrenwho knows i might have turned the pistol on myself then again i might not have jesus you are a killer said the brother quietly i am many things monsieur i dont ask forgiveness in this world the others another question there were always circumstances gallic logic remarked brendan patrick pierre prefontaine former judge of the first circuit court in boston as he absently touched the raw tender skin of his neck below his singed white hair thank heavens i never had to argue before les tribunals neither side is ever actually wrong the disbarred attorney chuckled you see before you a felon justly tried and justly convicted the only exculpatory aspect of my crimes is that i was caught and so many others were not and are not perhaps we are related after all monsieur le juge by comparison sir my life is far closer to that of st thomas aquinas blackmail interrupted marie no actually the charge was malfeasance accepting remunerations for favorable decisions that sort of thing my god were houndstooth boston in new york city its standard procedure leave your money with the bailiff enough for everyone im not referring to boston im talking about why youre here its blackmail thats an oversimplification but essentially correct as i told you the man who paid me to find out where youd gone also paid me an additional large sum of money to keep the information to myself under the circumstances and because i have no pressing schedule of appointments i thought it logical to pursue the inquiry after all if the little i knew brought so much how much more might come to me if i learned a little more you talk of gallic logic monsieur inserted the frenchman its simple interrogatory progression replied the former judge briefly glancing at jean pierre before turning back to marie however my dear i may have glossed over an item that was extremely helpful in negotiations with my client to put it plainly your identity was being withheld and protected by the government it was a strong point that frightened a very strong and influential man i want his name said marie then i must have protection too rejoined prefontaine youll have it and perhaps something more continued the old disbarred attorney my client has no idea i came here no knowledge of whats happened all of which might fuel the fires of his largess if i described what ive experienced and observed hed be frightened out of his mind even to be associated with such events also considering the fact that i was nearly killed by that teutonic amazon i really deserve more am i then to be rewarded for saving your life monsieur if i had anything of valueother than my legal expertise which is yoursid happily share it if im given anything that still holds cousin merci bien cousin daccord mon ami but never let the irish nuns hear us you dont look like a poor man judge said john st jacques then appearances are as deceiving as a longforgotten title you so generously use i should add that my wants are not extravagant for theres no one but myself and my creature comforts do not require luxury youve lost your woman too then not that its any of your damn business but my wife left me twentynine years ago and my thirtyeightyearold son now a successful attorney on wall street uses her name and when questioned by curious people tells them he never knew me i havent seen him since he was ten it was not in his interest you understand quelle tristesse quel bullshit cousin that boy got his brains from me not from the airhead who bore him however we stray my french pureblood here has his own reasonsobviously based on betrayalfor cooperating with you i have equally strong reasons for wanting to help you too but i must also consider myself my aged new friend can go back and live whats left of his life in paris whereas i have no place to go but boston and the few opportunities ive developed over the years to eke out a living therefore my deepseated motives for wanting to help must themselves take a backseat with what i know now i wouldnt last five minutes in the streets of boston breakthrough said john st jacques staring at prefontaine im sorry judge we dont need you what marie sat forward in her chair please bro we need all the help we can get not in this case we know who hired him we do conklin knows he called it a breakthrough he told me that the man who traced you and the children here used a judge to find you the brother nodded across the table at the bostonian him its why i smashed up a hundredthousanddollar boat to get back over here conklin knows who his client is prefontaine again glanced at the old frenchman now is the time for quelle tristesse sir hero im left with nothing my persistence brought me only a sore throat and a burned scalp not necessarily interrupted marie youre the attorney so i shouldnt have to tell you corroboration is cooperation we may want you to tell everything you know to certain people in washington corroboration can be obtained with a subpoena my dear under oath in a courtroom take my personal as well as my professional word for it we wont be going to court ever oh i see you couldnt possibly judge not at this juncture however if you agree to help us youll be well paid a moment ago you said that you had strong reasons for wanting to help reasons that had to be secondary to your own wellbeing are you by any chance a lawyer my dear no an economist holy mary thats worse about my reasons do they concern your client the man who hired you to trace us they do his august personaas in caesar augustusshould be trashed slippery intellectuality aside hes a whore he had promise once more than i let him know but he let it all go by the boards in a flamboyant quest for his own personal grail what the hells he talking about mare a man with a great deal of influence or power neither of which he should have i think our convicted felon here has come to grips with personal morality is that an economist speaking asked prefontaine once more absently touching the blistered flesh of his neck an economist reflecting on her last inaccurate projection that caused in appropriate buying or selling on the stock exchanges resulting in losses many could afford and many more could not my voice was never that important but ill grant you its the reflection of a great many others whose projections were because they never risked they only theorized its a safe position yours isnt judge you may need the protection we can provide whats your answer jesus mary and joseph youre a cold one i have to be said marie her eyes leveled on the man from boston i want you with us but i wont beg ill simply leave you with nothing and you can go back to the streets in boston are you sure youre not a lawyeror perhaps a lord high executioner take your choice just give me your answer will somebody tell me what the hell is going on here yelled john st jacques your sister answered prefontaine his gentle gaze on marie has enlisted a recruit shes made the options clear which every attorney understands and the inevitability of her logic in addition to her lovely face crowned by that dark red hair makes my decision also inevitable what hes opted for our side johnny forget it what do we need him for without a courtroom a dozen different reasons young man answered the judge in certain situations volunteerism is not the best road to take unless one is thoroughly protected beyond the courts is that right sis its not wrong bro but its up to jasondamn itdavid no mare said john st jacques his eyes boring into his sisters its up to jason are these names i should be aware of asked prefontaine the name jason bourne was sprayed on the wall of your villa my instructions cousin said the false yet not so false hero of france it was necessary i dont understand any more than i understood the other name the jackal or carlos which you both rather brutally questioned me about when i wasnt sure whether i was dead or alive i thought the jackal was fiction the old man called jean pierre fontaine looked at marie she nodded carlos the jackal is a legend but he is not fiction hes a professional killer now in his sixties rumored to be ill but still possessed with a terrible hatred hes a man of many faces many sides some loved by those who have reasons to love him others detested by those who consider him the essence of eviland depending on the view all have their reasons for being correct i am an example of one who has experienced both viewpoints but then my world is hardly yours as you rightly suggested st thomas of aquinas merci bien but the hatred that obsesses carlos grows like a cancer in his aging brain one man drew him out one man tricked him usurped his kills taking credit for the jackals work kill after kill driving carlos mad when he was trying to correct the record trying to maintain his supremacy as the ultimate assassin that same man was responsible for the death of his loverbut one far more than a lover the woman who was his keel his beloved since childhood in venezuela his colleague in all things that single man one of hundreds perhaps thousands sent out by governments everywhere was the only one who ever saw his faceas the jackal the man who did all this was a product of american intelligence a strange man who lived a deadly lie every day of his life for three years and carlos will not rest until that man is punished and killed the man is jason bourne squinting stunned by the frenchmans story prefontaine leaned forward over the table who is jason bourne he asked my husband david webb replied marie oh my god whispered the judge may i have a drink please john st jacques called out ronald yes bossmon cried from within the guard whose strong hands had held his employers shoulders an hour ago in villa twenty bring us some whisky and brandy please the bar should be stocked comin sir the orange sun in the east suddenly took fire its rays penetrating what was left of the sea mists of dawn the silence around the table was broken by the soft heavily accented words of the old frenchman i am not used to such service he said looking aimlessly beyond the railing of the balcony at the progressively bright waters of the caribbean when something is asked for i always think the task should be mine not anymore said marie quietly then after a beat adding jean pierre i suppose one could live with that name why not here questce que vous dites madame think about it paris might not be any less dangerous for you than the streets of boston for our judge the judge in question was lost in his own aimless reverie as several bottles glasses and a bucket of ice were brought to the table with no hesitation prefontaine reached out and poured himself an extravagant drink from the bottle nearest him i must ask a question or two he said emphatically is that proper go ahead replied marie im not sure i can or will answer you but try me the gunshots the spray paint on the wallmy cousin here says the red paint and the words were by his instructions they were mon ami the loud firing of the guns as well why everything must be as it is expected to be the gunshots were an additional element to draw attention to the event that was to take place why a lesson we learned in the notnot that i was ever a jean pierre fontaine but i did my small part it was called an accentuation a positive statement making clear that the underground was responsible for the action everyone in the vicinity knew it why here the jackals nurse is dead there is no one to tell him that his instructions have been carried out gallic logic incomprehensible french common sense incontestable why carlos will be here by noon tomorrow oh dear god the telephone rang inside the villa john st jacques lurched out of his chair only to be blocked by his sister who threw her arm in front of his face and then raced through the doors into the living room she picked up the phone david its alex said the breathless voice on the line christ ive had this goddamned thing on redial for three hours are you all right were alive but we werent supposed to be the old men the old men of paris did johnny johnny did but theyre on our side who the old men youre not making one damn bit of sense yes i am were in control here what about david i dont know the telephone lines were cut everythings a mess ive got the police heading out there screw the police alex screamed marie get the army the marines the lousy cia were owed jason wont allow that i cant turn on him now well try this for size the jackal will be here tomorrow oh jesus i have to get him a jet somewhere you have to do something you dont understand marie the old medusa surfaced you tell that husband of mine that medusas history the jackal isnt and hes flying in here tomorrow davidll be there you know that yes i do because hes jason bourne now brer rabbit this aint thirteen years ago and you just happen to be thirteen years older youre not only gonna be useless youre gonna be a positive liability unless you get some rest preferably sleep turn off the lights and grab some sack time in that big fancy couch in the living room ill man the phones which aint gonna ring cause nobodys callin at four oclock in the morning cactuss voice had faded as jason wandered into the dark living room his legs heavy his lids falling over his eyes like lead weights he dropped to the couch swinging his legs slowly with effort one at a time up on the cushions he stared at the ceiling rest is a weapon battles won and lost philippe danjou medusa his inner screen went black and sleep came a screaming pulsating siren erupted deafening incessant echoing throughout the cavernous house like a sonic tornado bourne spastically whipped his body around and sprang off the couch at first disoriented unsure of where he was and for a terrible moment of who he was cactus he roared racing out of the ornate living room into the hallway cactus he shouted again hearing his voice lost in the rapid rhythmic crescendos of the sirenalarm where are you nothing he ran to the door of the study gripping the knob it was locked he stepped back and crashed his shoulder against it once twice a third time with all the speed and strength he could summon the door splintered then gave way and jason hammered his foot against the central panel until it collapsed he went inside and what he found caused the killing machine that was the product of medusa and beyond to stare in icecold fury cactus was sprawled over the desk under the light of the single lamp in the same chair that had held the murdered general his blood forming a pool of red on the blottera corpse no not a corpse the right hand moved cactus was alive bourne ran to the desk and gently raised the old mans head the shrill deafening allencompassing alarm making communicationif communication were possibleimpossible cactus opened his dark eyes his trembling right hand moving down the blotter his forefinger curved and tapping the top of the desk what is it yelled jason the hand kept moving back toward the edge of the blotter the tapping more rapid below underneath with minusculenearly imperceptiblemotions of his head cactus nodded in the affirmative under the desk shouted bourne beginning to understand he knelt down to the right of cactus and felt under the thin top drawer then to the side he found it a button again gently he moved the heavy rolling chair inches to the left and centered his eyes on the button beneath it in tiny white letters on a black plastic strip was the answer aux alarm jason pressed the button instantly the shrieking pandemonium was cut off the ensuing silence was nearly as deafening the adjustment to it nearly as terrifying how were you hit asked bourne how long ago if you can talk just whisper no energy at all do you understand oh brer youre too much whispered cactus in pain i was a black cabdriver in washington man ive been here before it aint fatal boy i gotta slug in the upper chest ill get a doctor right awayour friend ivan incidentallybut if you can tell me what happened while i move you to the floor and look at the damage jason slowly carefully lowered the old man off the chair and onto the throw rug beneath the bay window he tore off cactuss shirt the bullet had gone through the flesh of the left shoulder with short swift movements bourne ripped the shirt into strips and tightly wrapped a primitive bandage around his friends chest and between the underarm and the shoulder its not much said jason but itll hold you for a while go on hes out there brer cactus coughed weakly lying back on the floor hes got a big mother fiftyseven magnum with a silencer he pinned me through the window then smashed it and climbed inside hehe easy dont talk never mind i gotta the brothers out there they aint got no hardware hell pick em off i played deep dead and he was in a hurryoh was he in a hurry look over there will ya jason swung his head in the direction of cactuss gesture a dozen or so books had been yanked out of a shelf on the side wall and strewn on the floor the old man continued his voice growing weaker he went over to the bookcase like in a panic until he found what he wanted then to the door that fiftyseven ready for bear if you follow me i figured it was you he was after that hed seen you through the window go out to the other room and i tell ya i was workin my right knee like a runnin muskrat cause i found that alarm button an hour ago and knew i had to stop him easy i gotta tell you i couldnt move my hands cause hed see me but my knee hit that sucker and the siren damn near blew me out of the chair the honky bastard fell apart he slammed the door locked it and beat his way out of here back through the window cactuss neck arched back the pain and the exhaustion overtaking him hes out there brer rabbit thats enough ordered bourne as he cautiously reached up snapping off the desk lamp leaving the dim light from the hallway through the shattered door as the only illumination im calling alex he can send the doctor suddenly from somewhere outside there was a highpitched scream a roar of shock and anguish jason knew only too well so did cactus who whispered his eyes shut tight he got one that fucker got one of the brothers im reaching conklin said jason pulling the phone off of the desk then ill go out and get him oh christ the lines outits been cut that honky knows his way around here so do i cactus stay as quiet as you can ill be back for you there was another scream this lower more abrupt an expulsion of breath more than a roar may sweet jesus forgive me muttered the old black man painfully meaning the words theres only one brother left if anyone should ask forgiveness its me cried bourne his voice guttural half choking goddamn it i swear to you cactus i never thought never even considered that anything like this would happen course you didnt i know you from back to the old days brer and i never heard of you asking anyone to risk anything for you its always been the other way around im going to pull you over interrupted jason tugging on the rug maneuvering cactus to the right side of the desk the old mans left hand close enough to reach the auxiliary alarm if you hear anything or see anything or feel anything turn on the siren where are you going i mean how another room another window bourne crept across the floor to the mutilated door lurched through it and ran into the living room at the far end was a pair of french doors that led to an outside patio he recalled seeing white wroughtiron lawn furniture on the south end of the house when he was with the guards he twisted the knob and slipped outside pulling the automatic from his belt shutting the right door and crouching making his way to the shrubbery at the edge of the grass he had to move quickly not only was there a third life in the balance a third unrelated unwarranted death but a killer who could be his shortcut to the crimes of the new medusa and those crimes were his bait for the jackal a diversion a magnet a trap the flarespart of the equipment he had brought with him to manassas the two emergency candles were in his left rear pocket each six inches long and bright enough to be seen for miles ignited together yet spaced apart they would light up swaynes property like two searchlights one in the south drive the other by the kennels possibly waking the drugged dogs bewildering them infuriating themdo it hurry jason scrambled across the lawn his eyes darting everywhere wondering where the stalking killer was and how the innocent quarry that cactus had enlisted was evading him one was experienced the other not and bourne could not permit the latters life to be wasted it happened he had been spotted two cracks on either side of him bullets from a silenced pistol slicing the air he reached the south leg of the paved drive and racing across it dived into the foliage ripping a flare from his pocket he put down the weapon snapped up the flame of his lighter ignited the fuse and threw the sizzling candle to his right it landed on the road in seconds it would spew out the blinding fire he ran to his left beneath the pine trees toward the rear of the estate his lighter and the second flare in one hand the automatic in the other he was parallel to the kennels the flare in the road exploded into bluishwhite flames he ignited the second and threw it end over end arcing it forty yards away to the front of the kennels he waited the second flare burst into sputtering fire two balls of blinding white light eerily illuminating the house and grounds of the estates south side three of the dogs began to wail then made feeble attempts to howl soon their confused anger would be heard a shadow against the west wall of the white houseit moved caught in the light between the flare by the kennels and the house the figure darted for the protection of the shrubbery it crouched an immobile but intrusive part of the silhouetted foliage was it the killer or the killers target the last brother recruited by cactus there was one way to find out and if it was the former and he was a decent marksman it was not the best tactic but still it was the quickest bourne leaped up from the underbrush yelling in full view as he lunged to his right at the last half second plunging his foot into the soft dirt and pivoting lowering his body and diving to his left head for the cabin he roared and he got his answer two more spits two more cracks in the air the bullets digging up the earth to his right the killer was good perhaps not an expert but good enough a held six shells five had been fired but there had been sufficient time to reload the emptied cylinder another strategyquickly suddenly another figure appeared a man running up the road toward the rear of flannagans cabin he was in the openhe could be killed over here you bastard screamed jason jumping up and firing his automatic blindly into the shrubbery by the house and then he got another answer a welcome one there was a single spit a single crack in the air and then no more the killer had not reloaded perhaps he had no more shellswhatever the primary target was now on the high ground bourne raced out of the bushes and across the lawn through the opposing light of the flares the dogs were now really aroused the yelps and throated growls of attack becoming louder the killer ran out of the shrubbery and into the road racing through shadows toward the front gates jason had the bastard he knew it the gates were closed the medusan was cornered bourne roared theres no way out snake lady make it easy on yourself a spit a crack the man had reloaded while running jason fired the man fell in the road and as he did so the intermittent silence of the night was ripped open by the sound of a powerful racing engine the vehicle in question speeding up the outside road its flashing red and blue lights signifying the police the police the alarm must have been wired into the manassas headquarters a fact that had never occurred to bourne he had assumed that such a measure was impossible where medusa was concerned it wasnt logical the security was internal no external force could be permitted for snake lady there was too much to learn too much that had to be kept secreta cemetery the killer writhed in the road rolling over and over toward the bordering pine trees there was something clutched in his hand jason approached him as two police officers got out of the patrol car beyond the gate he lashed his foot out kicking the mans body releasing whatever it was in his grip and reaching down to pick it up it was a leatherbound book one of a set like a volume of dickens or thackeray the embossed letters in gold more for display than for reading it was crazy then he flipped open a page and understood it was not crazy at all there was no print inside only the scrawl of handwritten notes on blank pages it was a diary a ledger there could be no police especially not now he could not allow them to be aware of his and conklins penetration into medusa the leatherbound book in his hand could not see the official light of day the jackal was everything he had to get rid of them we got a call mister intoned a middleaged patrolman walking toward the grilled gate a younger associate joining him hq said he was uptight as hell were responding but like i told dispatch thereve been some pretty wild parties out here no criticism intended sir we all like a good time now and then right absolutely right officer replied jason trying his utmost to control the painful heaving in his chest his eyes straying to the wounded killerhe had disappeared there was a momentary shortage in electricity that somehow interfered with the telephone lines happens a lot confirmed the younger patrolman sudden showers and summer heat lightnin someday theyll put all them cables underground my folks got a place the point is interrupted bourne everythings getting back to normal as you can see some of the lights in the house are back on i cant see nothin through them flares said the young police officer the general always takes the ultimate precautions explained jason i guess he feels he has to added bourne somewhat lamely regardless everythingsas i saidgetting back to normal okay okay by me answered the older patrolman but i got a message for someone named webb he in there im webb said jason bourne alarmed that makes things easier youre supposed to call a mister conk right away its urgent urgent an emergency we were told it was just radioed to us jason could hear the rattling of the fence on the perimeter of swaynes property the killer was getting away well officer the phones are still out here do you have one in your car not for personal use sir sorry but you just said it was an emergency well i suppose since youre a guest of the generals i could permit it if its long distance though youd better have a credit card number oh my god bourne unlocked the gate and rushed to the patrol car as the sirenalarm was activated back at the houseactivated and then instantly shut off the remaining brother had apparently found cactus what the hell was that yelled the young policeman forget it screamed jason jumping into the car and yanking an all too familiar patrol phone out of its cradle he gave alexs number in virginia to the police switchboard and kept repeating the phrase its an emergency its an emergency yes answered conklin acknowledging the police operator its me what happened too involved to go into whats the emergency ive got you a private jet out of the reston airport reston thats north of here the field in manassas doesnt have the equipment im sending a car for you why tranquility marie and the kids are okay theyre okay shes in charge what the hell does

place alex tell me what happened on tranquility the old men your old men of paris thats what happened theyre dead said jason bourne quietly simply dont be hasty theyve turnedat least i gather the real one turned and the others a godgiven mistake theyre on our side now theyre never on anyones side but the jackals you dont know them neither do you listen to your wife but now you go back to the house and write out everything i should know and jason i must tell you something i hope to christ you can find your solutionour solutionon tranquility because all things considered including my life i cant keep this medusa on our level much longer i think you know that you promised thirtysix hours delta in the woods beyond the fence a wounded man crouched his frightened face against the green links in the bright wash of the headlights he observed the tall man who had gone into the patrol car and now came out awkwardly nervously thanking the policemen he did not however permit them inside webb the killer had heard the name webb it was all they had to know all snake lady had to know god i love you said david webb leaning into the pay phone in the preboarding room at the private airfield in reston virginia the waiting was the worst part waiting to talk to you to hear from you that you were all all right how do you think i felt darling alex said the telephone lines had been cut and he was sending the police when i wanted him to send the whole damned army we cant even allow the police nothing official anywhere at the moment conklins promised me at least another thirtysix hours we may not need that now not with the jackal in montserrat david what happened alex mentioned medusa its a mess and hes right he has to go higher up with it him not us we stay out far away out what happened repeated marie whats the old medusa got to do with anything theres a new medusaan extension of the old one actuallyand its big and ugly and it kills they kill i saw that tonight one of their guns tried to kill me after thinking hed killed cactus and murdering two innocent men good god alex told me about cactus when he called me back but nothing else how is your uncle remus hell make it the agency doctor came out and took him and the last brother away brother ill tell you when i see you conklins out there now hell take care of everything and have the telephone fixed ill call him from tranquility youre exhausted im tired but im not sure why cactus insisted i get some sleep and i must have had all of twelve minutes my poor darling i like the tone of your voice said david the words even better except im not poor you took care of that in paris thirteen years ago suddenly his wife was silent and webb was alarmed what is it are you all right im not sure answered marie softly but with a strength that was the result of thought not feeling you say this new medusa is big and ugly and it tried to kill youthey tried to kill you they didnt yet they or it wanted you dead why because i was there you dont kill a man because he was at someones house a lot happened at that house tonight alex and i penetrated its circle of secrets and i was seen the idea was to bait the jackal with a few rich and all too famous bandits from the old saigon who would hire him to come after me it was a hell of a strategy but it spiraled out of control my god david dont you understand youre marked theyll come after you themselves how can they the hit man from medusa who was there never saw my face except while i was running in shadows and they have no idea who i am im a nonperson wholl simply disappear no marie if carlos shows up and if i can do what i know i can do in montserrat well be free to borrow a phrase free at last your voice changes doesnt it my what does which it really does i can tell i dont know what youre talking about said jason bourne im being signaled the planes here tell johnny to keep those two old men under guard the whispers spread through montserrat like rolling pockets of mist something terrible had happened on the out island of tranquility bad times mon the evil obeah come across the antilles from jamaic and there was death and madness and blood on the walls of death mon a curse put on the family of an animal sshh there was a cat mother and two cat children and there were other voices dear god keep it quiet it could ruin what tourism weve built never anything like this beforean isolated incident obviously drug related brought over from another island all too true mon i hear it was a madman his body filled with dope im told a fast boat running like the wind of a hurricane took him out to sea hes gone keep it quiet i say remember the virgins the fountainhead massacre it took them years to recover quiet and a single voice its a trap sir and if successful as we believe it will be well be the talk of the west indies the heroes of the caribbean itll be positively marvelous for our image law and order and all that thank heavens was anyone actually killed one person and she was in the act of taking anothers life she good god i dont want to hear another word until its all over its better that you not be available for comment damned good idea ill go out on the boat the fish are running well after the storm excellent sir and ill stay in radio contact with developments perhaps you shouldnt anything can be picked up out there i only meant so as to advise you when to returnat the appropriate moment to make a most advantageous appearance ill fill you in of course yes of course youre a good man henry thank you crown governor it was ten oclock in the morning and they held each other fiercely but there was no time for talk only the brief comfort of being together safe together secure in the knowledge that they knew things the jackal did not know and that knowledge gave them an enormous advantage still it was only an advantage not a guarantee not where carlos was concerned and both jason and john st jacques were adamant marie and the children were being flown south to guadeloupes basseterre island they would stay there with the webbs regal maid mrs cooper all under guard until they were called back to montserrat marie objected but her objections were met with silence her husbands orders were delivered abruptly icily youre leaving because i have work to do we wont discuss it any further its switzerland again zurich again isnt it jason its whatever you like replied bourne now preoccupied as the three of them stood at the base of the dock two seaplanes bobbing in the water only yards apart at the far end one had brought jason directly to tranquility from antigua the other was fueled for the flight to guadeloupe with mrs cooper and the children already inside hurry up marie added bourne i want to go over things with johnny and then grill those two old scumballs theyre not scumballs david because of them were alive why because they blew it and had to turn to save their asses thats not fair its fair until i say otherwise and theyre scum until they convince me theyre not you dont know the jackals old men i do theyll say anything do anything lie and snivel to hell and back and if you turn the other way theyll shove a knife in your spine he owns thembody mind and whats left of their souls now get to the plane its waiting dont you want to see the children tell jamie that no there isnt time take her out there johnny i want to check the beach theres nothing i havent checked david said st jacques his voice on the edge of defiance ill tell you whether you have or not shot back bourne his eyes angry as he started across the sand adding in a loud voice without looking around im going to have a dozen questions for you and i hope to christ you can answer them st jacques tensed taking a step forward but stopped by his sister leave it alone bro said marie her hand on his arm hes frightened hes what hes one nasty son of a bitch is what he is yes i know the brother looked at his sister that stranger you were talking about yesterday at the house yes only now its worse thats why hes frightened i dont understand hes older johnny hes fifty now and he wonders if he can still do the things he did before years agoin the war in paris in hong kong its all gnawing at him eating into him because he knows hes got to be better than he ever was i think he can be i know he will be for he has an extraordinary reason going for him a wife and two children were taken from him once before he barely remembers them but theyre at the core of his torment mo panov believes that and i do too now years later another wife and two children are threatened every nerve in him has to be on fire suddenly from three hundred feet away on the beach bournes voice erupted splitting through the breezes from the sea goddamn it i told you to hurry and you mr expert theres a reef out here with the color of a sandbar beyond it have you considered that dont answer johnny well go out to the plane a sandbar what the hells he talking about oh my god i do see i dont said marie as they walked rapidly up the pier there are reefs around eighty percent of the island ninetyfive percent where this beach is concerned they brake the waves its why its called tranquility theres no surf at all so what so someone using a tank under water wouldnt risk crashing into a reef but he would into a sandbar in front of a reef he could watch the beach and the guards and crawl up when his landing was clear lying in the water only feet from shore until he could take the guard i never thought about that he did bro bourne sat on the corner of the desk the two old men on a couch in front of him his brotherinlaw standing by a window fronting the beach in the unoccupied villa why would iwhy would welie to you monsieur asked the hero of france because it all sounds like a classic french farce similar but different names one door opening as another closes lookalikes disappearing and entering on cue it smells gentlemen perhaps you are a student of molière or racine im a student of uncanny coincidence especially where the jackal is concerned i dont think theres the slightest similarity in our appearances offered the judge from boston except perhaps our ages the telephone rang jason quickly reached down and picked it up yes everything checks out in boston said conklin his names prefontaine brendan prefontaine he was a federal judge of the first circuit caught in a government scam and convicted of felonious misconduct on the benchread that as being very large in the bribery business he was sentenced to twentyone years and did ten which was enough to blow him away in every department hes what they call a functioning alcoholic something of a character in bean towns shadier districts but harmlessactually kind of liked in a warped sort of way hes also considered very bright when hes clearheaded and im told a lot of crumbs wouldnt have gone courtfree and others would be doing longer jail terms if he hadnt given shrewd advice to their attorneys of record you might say hes a behindthescenes storefront lawyer the stores in his case being saloons pool halls and probably warehouses since ive been where hes at in the booze terrain he sounds straight arrow to me hes handling it better than i ever did you quit if i could have managed better in that twilight zone i might not have theres something to be said for the grape on many occasions what about his client awesome and our once and former judge was an adjunct professor at harvard law where gates was a student in two of his classes no question about it prefontaine knows the man trust him jason theres no reason for him to lie he was simply after a score youre following up on the client with all the quiet ammunition i can pull out of my personal woodwork hes our link to carlos the medusa connection was a false lead a stupid attempt by a stupid general in the pentagon to put someone inside gatess inner legal circle youre sure of that i am now gates is a highly paid consultant to a law firm representing a megadefense contractor under antitrust scrutiny he wouldnt even return swaynes calls which if he did would make him more stupid than swayne which he isnt thats your problem friend not mine if everything goes the way i intend it to go here i dont even want to hear about snake lady in fact i cant remember ever having heard of it thanks for dumping it in my lapand in a way i guess i mean that incidentally the grammarschool notebook you grabbed from the gunslinger in manassas has some interesting things in it oh do you remember those three frequent fliers from the mayflowers registry who flew into philadelphia eight months ago and just happened to be at the hotel at the same time eight months later certainly their names are in swaynes mickey mouse looseleaf they had nothing to do with carlos theyre part of medusa its a mother lode of disconnected information im not interested use it in good health we will and very quietly that notebookll be on the most wanted list in a matter of days im happy for you but ive got work to do and you refuse any help absolutely this is what ive been waiting thirteen years for its what i said at the beginning its one on one high noon you goddamn fool no the logical extension of a very intellectual chess game the player with the better trap wins and ive got that trap because im using his hed smell out any deviation we trained you too well scholar thank you for that good hunting delta goodbye bourne hung up the phone and looked over at the two pathetically curious old men on the couch you passed a sleazefactored muster judge he said to prefontaine and you jean pierre what can i say my own wife who admits to me that you might very well have killed her without the slightest compunction tells me that i have to trust you nothing makes a hell of a lot of sense does it i am what i am and i did what i did said the disgraced attorney with dignity but my client has gone too far his magisterial persona must come to an end in ashes my words are not so well phrased as those of my learned newfound relative added the aged hero of france but i know the killing must stop its what my woman tried to tell me i am a hypocrite of course for i am no stranger to killing so i shall only say that this kind of killing must stop there is no business arrangement here no profit in the kill only a sick madmans vengeance that demands the unnecessary death of a mother and her children where is the profit there no the jackal has gone too far he too must now be stopped thats the most coldblooded fucking reasoning ive ever heard cried john st jacques by the window i thought your words were very well chosen said the former judge to the felon from paris très bien daccord and i think im out of my mind to have anything to do with either of you broke in jason bourne but right now i dont have a choice its eleventhirtyfive gentlemen the clock is running the what asked prefontaine whatevers going to happen will happen during the next two five ten or twentyfour hours im flying back to blackburne airport where ill create a scene the bereaved husband and father whos gone crazy over the killing of his wife and children it wont be difficult for me i assure you ill make a hell of a ruckus ill demand an immediate flight to tranquility and when i get here therell be three pine coffins on the pier supposedly containing my wife and children everything as it should be interrupted the frenchman bien very bien agreed bourne ill insist that one be opened and then ill scream or collapse or both whatever comes to mind so that whoevers watching wont forget what theyve seen st jacques here will have to control mebe rough johnny be convincingand finally ill be taken up to another villa the one nearest the steps to the beach on the east path then the waiting begins for this jackal asked the bostonian hell know where you are of course he will a lot of people including the staff will have seen where i was taken hell find out thats childs play for him so you wait for him monsieur you think the monseigneur will walk into such a trap ridicule not at all monsieur replied jason calmly to begin with i wont be there and by the time he finds that out ill have found him for christs sake how half shouted st jacques because im better than he is answered jason bourne i always was the scenario went as planned the personnel at montserrats blackburne airport still smoldering from the abuse hurled at them by the tall hysterical american who accused them all of murder of allowing his wife and children to be killed by terroristsof being willing nigger accomplices of filthy killers not only were the people of the island quietly furious but they were also hurt quiet because they understood his anguish hurt because they could not understand how he could blame them and use such vicious words words he had never used before was this good mon this wealthy brother of the gregarious johnny saint jay this richrich friend who had put so much money into tranquility isle not a friend at all but instead white garbage who blamed them for terrible things they had nothing to do with because their skins were dark it was an evil puzzle mon it was part of the madness the obeah that had crossed the waters from the mountains of jamaic and put a curse on their islands watch him brothers watch his every move perhaps he is another sort of storm one not born in the south or the east but whose winds are more destructive watch him mon his anger is dangerous so he was watched by manythe uninformed civilians and authorities alikeas a nervous henry sykes at government house kept his word the official investigation was solely under his command it was quiet thoroughand nonexistent bourne behaved far worse on the pier of tranquility inn striking his own brother the amiable saint jay until the younger man subdued him and had him carried up the steps to the nearest villa servants came and went bringing trays of food and drink to the porch selected visitors were permitted to pay their condolences including the chief aide to the crown governor who wore his full military regalia a symbol of the crowns concern and an old man who knew death from the brutalities of war and who insisted on seeing the bereaved husband and fatherhe was accompanied by a woman in a nurses uniform properly topped by a hat and a dark mourning veil and two canadian guests of the hotel close friends of the owner both of whom had met the disconsolate man when tranquility inn opened with great fireworks several years agothey asked to pay their respects and offer whatever support or comfort they could john st jacques agreed suggesting that their visit be brief and to understand that his brotherinlaw remained in a corner of the darkened living room the drapes having been drawn its all so horrible so meaningless said the visitor from toronto softly to the shadowed figure in a chair across the room i hope youre a religious man david i am faith helps in such times as these your loved ones are in the arms of christ now thank you a momentary breeze off the water rustled the drapes permitting a narrow shaft of sunlight to flash across the room it was enough wait a minute said the second canadian youre notgood lord youre not dave webb dave has be quiet ordered st jacques standing at the door behind the two visitors johnny i spent seven hours in a fishing boat with dave and i damn well know him when i see him shut up said the owner of tranquility inn oh dear god cried the aide to the crown governor of montserrat in a clipped british accent listen to me both of you said st jacques rushing forward between the two canadians and turning to stand in front of the armchair i wish id never let you in here but theres nothing we can do about that now i thought youd add weight two more observers if anyone asked you questions which they will and thats exactly what youre going to do youve been talking to david webb consoling david webb do you understand that i dont understand a damn thing objected the bewildered visitor who had spoken of the comfort of faith who the hell is he hes the senior aide to the crown governor answered st jacques im telling you this so you will understand you mean the army brass who showed up in full uniform with a squad of black soldiers asked the guest who had fished with david webb among his duties is chief military aidedecamp hes a brigadier we saw the bastard leave protested the fisherman from the dining room we all saw him leave he was with the old frenchman and the nurse you saw someone else leave wearing sunglasses webb gentlemen the governors aide rose from the chair wearing the illfitting jacket worn by jason bourne when he had flown back to tranquility from blackburne airport you are welcome guests on our island but as guests you will abide by the crowns decisions in emergencies you will either abide by them or as we would do in extreme weather we will be forced to place you in custody hey come on henry theyre friends friends do not call brigadiers bastards you might if you were once a busted corporal general inserted the man of faith my companion here didnt mean anything long before the whole damned canadian army needed his companys engineers he was a screwedup infantry grunt his company incidentally he wasnt too bright in korea lets cut the crap said webbs fishing companion so weve been in here talking to dave right right and thats all i can tell you its enough johnny daves in trouble so what can we do nothingabsolutely nothing but whats on the inns agenda you all got a copy delivered to your villas an hour ago youd better explain said the religious canadian i never read those goddamn happyhour schedules the inns having a special buffet everything on the house and a meteorologist from the leeward islands weather control will speak for a few minutes on what happened last night the storm asked the fisherman the former busted corporal and current owner of canadas largest industrial engineering company a storms a storm in these islands whats to explain oh things like why they happen and why theyre over so quickly how to behavethe elimination of fear basically you want us all up there is that what you mean yes i do thatll help dave yes it will then the whole placell be up there i guarantee it i appreciate that but how can you ill circulate another happyhour notice that angus macpherson mcleod chairman of all canada engineering will award ten thousand dollars to whoever asks the most intelligent question how about that johnny the rich always want more for nothing thats our profound weakness ill take your word for it mumbled st jacques cmon said mcleod to his religious friend from toronto well circulate with tears in our eyes and spread the word then you idiot colonelthats what you were y bastardin an hour or so well shift gears and only talk of ten thousand dollars and a freeforall dinner with the beach and the sun peoples attention spans are roughly two and a half minutes in cold weather no more than four believe me ive had it calculated by computer research youll have a full party tonight johnny mcleod turned and walked toward the door scotty cried the man of faith following the fisherman youre going off halfcocked again attention spans two minutes four minutes computer researchi dont believe a word of it really said angus his hand on the knob you believe in ten thousand dollars dont you i certainly do you watch thats my market research thats also why i own the company and now i intend to summon those tears to my eyes its another reason i own the company in a dark storage room on the third floor of tranquility inns main complex bourne who had shed the military tunic and the old frenchman sat on two stools in front of a window overlooking the east and west paths of the shoreline resort the villas below extended out on both sides of the stone steps leading down to the beach and the dock each man held a pair of powerful binoculars to his eyes scanning the people walking back and forth on the paths and up and down the rock staircase a handheld radio with the hotels private frequency was on the sill in front of jason hes near us said fontaine softly what shot out bourne yanking the glasses from his face and turning to the old man where tell me where hes not in our vision monsieur but he is near us what do you mean i can feel it like an animal that senses the approach of distant thunder its inside of you its the fear thats not very clear it is to me perhaps you wouldnt understand the jackals challenger the man of many appearances the chameleonthe killer known as jason bournewas not given to fear we are told only a great bravado that came from his strength jason smiled grimly in contradiction then you were told a lie he said softly a part of that man lives with a kind of raw fear few people have ever experienced i find that hard to believe monsieur believe im he are you mr webb its not difficult to piece things together do you force yourself to assume your other self because of this fear david webb stared at the old man for gods sake what choice do i have you could disappear for a time you and your family you could live peacefully in complete security your government would see to it hed come after meafter uswherever we were for how long a year eighteen months certainly less than two years hes a sick man all parismy parisknows it considering the enormous expense and complexity of the current situationthese events designed to trap youi would suggest that its carloss last attempt leave monsieur join your wife in basseterre and then fly thousands of miles away while you can let him go back to paris and die in frustration is it not enough no hed come after me after us its got to be settled here now i will soon join my woman if such is to be so i can disagree with certain people men like you for instance monsieur le chameleon whom i would have automatically agreed with before i do so now i think you can go far away i think you know that you can put the jackal in a side pocket and get on with your life altered only slightly for a while but you wont do it something inside stops you you cannot permit yourself a strategic retreat no less honorable for its avoidance of violence your family is safe but others may die but even that doesnt stop you you have to win i think thats enough psychobabble interrupted bourne bringing the binoculars again to his eyes concentrating on the scene below beyond the windows thats it isnt it said the frenchman studying le chameleon his binoculars still at his side they trained you too well instilled in you too completely the person you had to become jason bourne against carlos the jackal and bourne must win its imperative that he win two aging lions each pitted against the other years ago both with a burning hatred created by faroff strategists who had no idea what the consequences would be how many have lost their lives because they crossed your converging paths how many unknowing men and women have been killed shut up cried jason as flashing images of paris even peripherally of hong kong macao and beijingand most recently last night in manassas virginiaassaulted his fragmented inner screen so much death suddenly abruptly the door of the dark storage room opened and judge brendan prefontaine walked rapidly breathlessly inside hes here said the bostonian one of st jacquess patrols a threeman unit a mile down the east shoreline couldnt be reached by radio st jacques sent a guard to find them and he just returnedthen ran away himself all three were killed each man with a bullet in his throat the jackal exclaimed the frenchman it is his carte de visitehis calling card he announces his arrival the midafternoon sun was suspended immobile burning the sky and the land a ringed globe of fire intent only on scorching everything beneath it and the alleged computerized research offered by the canadian industrialist angus mcleod appeared to be confirmed although a number of seaplanes flew in to take frightened couples away the collective attention span of average people after a disturbing event if certainly longer than two and a half to four minutes was certainly not more than a few hours a horrible thing had happened during the predawn storm an act of terrible vengeance as they understood it it involved a single man with a vendetta against old enemies a killer who had long since fled from the island with the removal of the ugly coffins as well as the beached damaged speedboat and the soothing words over the government radio along with the intermittent unobtrusive appearances of the armed guards a sense of normalcy returnednot total of course for there was a mourning figure among them but he was out of sight and they were told would soon leave and despite the depth of the horrors as the rumors had themnaturally exaggerated out of all proportion by the hypersuperstitious island nativesthe horrors were not theirs it was an act of violence completely unrelated to them and after all life had to go on seven couples remained at the inn christ were paying six hundred dollars a day no ones after us shit man next week its back to the commodities grind so were going to enjoy no sweat shirley theyre not giving out names they promised me with the burning immobile afternoon sun a small soiled plot of the vast caribbean playground came back to its own particular ambience death receding with each application of bain de soleil and another rum punch nothing was quite as it had been but the bluegreen waters lapped on the beach enticing the few bathers to walk into them immersing their bodies in the cool liquid rhythm of wet constancy a progressively less tentative peace returned to tranquility isle there cried the hero of france where shouted bourne the four priests walking down the path in a line theyre black color means nothing he was a priest when i saw him in paris at neuillysurseine fontaine lowered the binoculars and looked at jason the church of the blessed sacrament he asked quietly i cant remember which one is he you saw him in his priests habit and that son of a bitch saw me he knew i knew it was him which one hes not there monsieur said jean pierre slowly bringing the binoculars back to his eyes it is another carte de visite carlos anticipates he is a master of geometry there is no straight line for him only many sides many levels that sounds damned oriental then you understand it has crossed his mind that you may not be in that villa and if you are not he wants you to know that he knows it neuillysurseine no not actually he cant be sure at the moment he was sure at the church of the blessed sacrament how should i play it how does the chameleon think he should play it the obvious would be to do nothing answered bourne his eyes on the scene below and he wouldnt accept that because his uncertainty is too strong hed say to himself hes better than that i could blow him away with a rocket so hes somewhere else i think youre correct jason reached down and picked up the handheld radio from the sill he pressed the button and spoke johnny yes those four black priests on the path do you see them yes have a guard stop them and bring them into the lobby tell him to say the owner wants to see them hey theyre not going into the villa theyre just passing by offering prayers to the bereaved inside the vicar from town called and i gave him permission theyre okay david the hell they are said jason bourne do as i say the chameleon spun around on the stool looking at the objects in the storage room he slid off his perch and walked to a bureau with a mirror attached to its top he yanked the automatic from his belt smashed the glass picked up a fragment and brought it to fontaine five minutes after i leave flash this every now and then in the window i shall do so from the side of the window monsieur good thinking jason relented to the point of a brief slight smile it struck me that i didnt really have to suggest that and what will you do what hes doing now become a tourist in montserrat a roving guest at tranquility inn bourne again reached down for the radio he picked it up pressed the button and gave his orders go to the mens shop in the lobby and get me three different guayabera jackets a pair of sandals two or three widebrimmed straw hats and gray or tan walking shorts then send someone to the tackle shop and bring me a reel of line hundredpound test a scaling knifeand two distress flares ill meet you on the steps up here hurry you will not heed my words then said fontaine lowering the binoculars and looking at jason monsieur le chameleon goes to work he goes to work replied bourne replacing the radio on the sill if you or the jackal or both of you are killed others may die innocent people slaughtered not because of me does it matter does it matter to the victims or their families who is responsible i didnt choose the circumstances old man they were chosen for me you can change them alter them so can he he has no conscience youre one hell of an authority on that score i accept the rebuke but i have lost something of great value to me perhaps its why i discern a conscience in youa part of you beware the sanctimonious reformer jason started for the door and the beribboned military tunic that hung on an old coatrack alongside the visored officers hat among other things hes a bore shouldnt you be watching the path below while the priests are detained it will take some time for st jacques to get the items you asked for bourne stopped and turned his eyes cold on the verbose old frenchman he wanted to leave to get away from this old old man who talked too muchsaid too much but fontaine was right it would be stupid not to watch what happened below an awkward unusual reaction on the part of someone an abrupt startled glance by someone in an unexpected directionit was the little things the sudden involuntary precisely imprecise small motions that so often pointed to the concealed string that was the fuse leading to the explosive trap in silence jason walked back to the window picked up the binoculars and put them to his face a police officer in the tanandscarlet uniform of montserrat approached the procession of four priests on the path he was obviously as bewildered as he was deferential nodding courteously as the four gathered together to listen gesturing politely toward the glass doors of the lobby bournes eyes shifted within the frame of vision studying the black features of each cleric one after another in rapid succession he spoke quietly to the frenchman do you see what i see the fourth one the priest who was last replied fontaine hes alarmed but the others are not hes afraid he was bought thirty pieces of silver agreed the frenchman youll go down and take him of course of course not corrected jason hes right where i want him to be bourne grabbed the radio off the sill johnny yes im in the shop ill be up in a few minutes those priests do you know them only the one who calls himself the vicar he comes around for contributions and theyre not really priests david theyre more like ministers in a religious order very religious and very local is the vicar there yes hes always first in line good slight change of plans bring the clothes to your office then go and see the priests tell them an official of the government wants to meet them and make a contribution in return for their prayers what ill explain later now hurry up ill see you in the lobby you mean my office dont you ive got the clothes remember theyll come laterroughly a minute later after i get out of this uniform do you have a camera in your office three or four of them guests are always leaving them behind put all of them with the clothes interrupted jason get going bourne shoved the radio into his belt then changed his mind he pulled it out and handed it to fontaine here you take this ill get another and stay in contact whats happening down there our alarmed priest looks around as they go to the lobby doors hes truly frightened now wheres he looking asked bourne grabbing the binoculars thats of no help in every direction damn theyre at the doors now ill get ready ill help you the old frenchman got off the stool and went to the coatrack he removed the tunic and the hat if you are about to do what i think you intend doing try to stay by a wall and dont turn around the governors aide is somewhat stouter than you and we must bunch the jacket in the back youre pretty good at this arent you said jason holding out his arms so as to be helped into the tunic the german soldiers were always much fatter than we were especially the corporals and the sergeantsall that sausage you know we had our tricks suddenly as if he had been shot or seized by a convulsion fontaine gasped then lurched in front of bourne mon dieu cest terrible the governor what the crown governor what about him at the airport it was so quick so rapid cried the old frenchman and everything that has happened my woman the killing still it is unforgivable of me what are you talking about that man in the villa the military officer whose uniform you wear hes his aide we know that what you do not know monsieur is that my very first instructions came from the crown governor instructions from the jackal he is the contact oh my god whispered bourne rushing to the stool where fontaine had put the radio he took a deep breath as he picked it up his thoughts racing control imperative johnny for christs sake my arms are full and im on my way to the office and those goddamned monks are in the lobby waiting for me what the hell do you want now take it easy and listen very carefully how well do you know henry sykes the cgs man yes ive met him a few times but i dont know him johnny i know him very well you wouldnt have a house and i wouldnt have tranquility inn if it wasnt for him is he in touch with the governor i mean right now is he keeping the cg posted about whats going on here think johnny its important theres a phone in that villa he could be in contact with government house is he you mean with the cg himself with anyone over there believe me hes not everythings so quiet not even the police know whats going on and as far as the cg is concerned hes only been given the vaguest scenario no names nothing only a trap hes also out on his boat and doesnt want to know a damn thing until its all over those were his orders ill bet they were why do you ask ill explain later hurry up will you stop saying that jason put down the radio and turned to fontaine were clear the governor isnt one of the jackals army of old men hes a different kind of recruit probably like that lawyer gates in bostonjust bought or frightened no soul involved youre certain your brotherinlaw is certain the mans out on his boat he was given a barebones outline but thats all and his orders were that hes not to be told anything else until its all over the frenchman sighed its a pity my mind is so old and so filled with salt if i had remembered we could have used him come the jacket how could we have used him asked bourne again holding out his arms he removed himself to the gradinshow is it said the bleachers hes out of the game only an observer ive known many like him they want carlos to lose he wants carlos to lose its his only way out but hes too terrified to raise a hand against the jackal then how could we turn him jason buttoned the tunic as fontaine manipulated the belt and the cloth behind him le chameleon asks such a question ive been out of practice ah yes said the frenchman yanking the belt firmly that man ive appealed to just shut up how très simple monsieur we tell him the jackal already knows hes turnedi tell him who better than the monseigneurs emissary you are good bourne held in his stomach as fontaine turned him around pressing the lapels and the ribbons of the jacket im a survivor neither better nor worse than othersexcept with my woman then i was better than most you loved her very much didnt you love oh i imagine thats taken for granted although rarely expressed perhaps its the comfort of being familiar although again hardly with grand passion one does not have to finish a sentence to be understood and a look in the eyes will bring on laughter without a word being said it comes with the years i suppose jason stood motionless for a moment staring strangely at the frenchman i want the years you had old man i want them very very much the years ive had with my woman are filled with scars that wont heal cant heal until something inside is changed or cleansed or goes away thats the way it is then you are too strong or too stubborn or too stupid dont look at me that way i told you im not afraid of you im not afraid of anyone any longer but if what you say is true that this is the way things really are with you then i suggest you leave aside all thoughts of love and concentrate on hatred since i cannot reason with david webb i must prod jason bourne a jackal filled with hate must die and only bourne can kill him here are your hat and sunglasses stay against a wall or youll look like a military peacock your khaki tail raised for the purpose of passing merde without speaking bourne adjusted the visored hat and sunglasses walked to the door and let himself out he crossed to the solid wood staircase and started rapidly down nearly colliding with a white jacketed black steward carrying a tray out of the secondfloor exit he nodded to the young man who backed away allowing him to proceed when a quiet ziplike noise along with a sudden movement caught in the corner of his eyes caused him to turn the waiter was pulling an electronic beeper out of his pocket jason spun around lurching up the steps his hands lunging into the youngsters body ripping the device out of his grip as the tray crashed to the floor of the landing straddling the youth with one hand on the beeper and the other grasping the stewards throat he spoke breathlessly quietly who had you do this tell me hey mon i fight you cried the youngster writhing freeing his right hand and smashing a fist into bournes left cheek we dont want no bad mon here our bossmon the best you dont scare me the steward crashed his knee into jasons groin you young son of a bitch cried le chameleon slapping the youngsters face back and forth while grabbing his aching testicles with his left hand im his friend his brother will you cut it out johnny saint jays my brother inlaw if it makes any goddamned difference oh said the large youthful obviously athletic steward a touch of resentment in his wide embarrassed brown eyes you are the mon with boss saint jays sister im her husband who the fuck are you i am first head steward of the second floor sir soon i will be on the first floor because i am very good i am also a very fine fightermy father taught me although he is old now like you do you wish to fight more i think i can beat you you have gray in your hair shut up whats the beeper all about asked jason holding up the small brown plastic instrument as he crawled off the young waiter i dont know monsir bad things have happened we are told that if we see men running on the staircases we should press the buttons why the lifts sir our very fast elevators why would guests use the stairs whats your name asked bourne replacing his hat and sunglasses ishmael sir like in moby dick i do not know such a person sir maybe you will why im not sure youre a very good fighter i see no connection monsir neither do i jason got to his feet i want you to help me ishmael will you only if your brother permits it he will he is my brother i must hear it from him sir very good you doubt me yes i do sir said ishmael getting to his knees and reassembling the tray separating the broken dishes from the whole ones would you take the word of a strong man with gray in his hair who runs down the stairs and attacks you and says things anyone could say if you wish to fight the loser must speak the truth do you wish to fight no i do not wish to fight and dont you press it im not that old and youre not that good young man leave the tray and come with me ill explain to mr st jacques who i remind you is my brothermy wifes brother to hell with it come on what do you want me to do sir asked the steward getting to his feet and following jason listen to me said bourne stopping and turning on the steps above the firstfloor landing go ahead of me into the lobby and walk to the front door empty ashtrays or something and look busy but keep glancing around ill come out in a few moments and youll see me go over and talk to saint jay and four priests wholl be with him priests interrupted the astonished ishmael men of the cloth sir four of them what they doing here mon more bad things happen the obeah they came here to pray so the bad things will stopno more obeah but whats important to me is that i must speak to one of them alone when they leave the lobby this priest i have to see may break away from the others to be by himself or possibly to meet someone else do you think you could follow him without his seeing you would mr saint jay tell me to do that suppose i have him look over at you and nod his head then i can do it i am faster than the mongoose and like the mongoose i know every foot trail on tranquility he goes one way i know where hes going and will be there first but how will i know which priest more than one may go off by himself ill talk to all four separately hell be the last one then i will know thats pretty fast thinking said bourne youre right they could separate i think good mon i am fifth in my class at serrats technical academy the four ahead of me are all girls so they dont have to work thats an interesting observation in five or six years ill have the money to attend the university in barbados maybe sooner go on now walk into the lobby and head for the door later after the priests leave ill come out looking for you but i wont be in this uniform from any distance you wont know me if i dont find you meet me in an hour where wheres a quiet place tranquility chapel sir the path in the woods above the east beach no one ever goes there even on the sabbath i remember it good idea there is a remaining subject sir fifty dollars american thank you sir jason waited by the door for ninety seconds then opened it barely an inch ishmael was in place by the entrance and he could see john st jacques talking with the four priests several feet to the right of the front desk bourne tugged at his jacket squared his shoulders in military fashion and walked out into the lobby toward the priests and the owner of tranquility inn its an honor and a privilege fathers he said to the four black clerics as a surprised and curious st jacques watched him im new here in the islands and i must say im very impressed the government is particularly pleased that you saw fit to help calm our troubled waters continued jason his hands clasped firmly behind his back for your efforts the crown governor has authorized mr st jacques here to issue you a check in the amount of one hundred pounds for your churchto be reimbursed by the treasury of course it is such a magnificent gesture i hardly know what to say intoned the vicar his high lilting voice sincere you could tell me whose idea it was said the chameleon most touching most touching indeed oh i cannot take the credit sir replied the vicar looking as the two others did at the fourth man it was samuels such a good and decent leader of our flock good show samuel bourne stared briefly his eyes penetrating at the fourth man but i should like to thank each of you personally and know your names jason went down the line shaking the three hands and quietly exchanging pleasantries he came to the last priest whose eyes kept straying away from his of course i know your name samuel he said his voice even lower barely audible and i should like to know whose idea it was before you took the credit i dont understand you whispered samuel certainly you dosuch a good and decent manyou must have received another very generous contribution you mistake me for someone else sir mumbled the fourth priest his dark eyes for an instant betraying deep fear i dont make mistakes your friend knows that ill find you samuel maybe not today but surely tomorrow or the day after that bourne raised his voice as he released the clerics hand again the governments profound thanks fathers the crown is most grateful and now i must be on my way a dozen telephone calls should be answered your office st jacques yes of course general inside the office jason took out his automatic and tore off the uniform as he separated the pile of clothing maries brother had brought for him he slipped on a pair of kneelength gray bermuda walking shorts chose a redandwhitestriped guayabera jacket and the widestbrimmed straw hat he removed his socks and shoes put on the sandals stood up and swore goddamn it he kicked off the sandals and shoved his bare feet back into his heavy rubbersoled shoes he studied the various cameras and their accessories choosing the lightest but most complicated and crossed the straps over his chest john st jacques walked into the room carrying a small handheld radio where the hell did you come from miami beach actually a little northsay pompano im not that gaudy i wont stand out actually youre right ive got people out there whod swear you were oldtime key west conservative heres the radio thanks jason put the compact instrument into his breast pocket where to now after ishmael the kid i had you nod at ishmael i didnt nod at ishmael you simply said i should nod my head at the entrance same thing bourne squeezed the automatic under his belt beneath the guayabera and looked at the equipment brought from the tackle shop he picked up the reel of onehundredtest line and the scaling knife placing both in his pockets then opened an empty camera case and put the two distress flares inside it was not everything he wanted but it was enough he was not who he was thirteen years ago and he was not so young even then his mind had to work better and faster than his body a fact he reluctantly accepted damn that ishmaels a good boy said maries brother hes pretty smart and strong as a prize saskatchewan steer im thinking of making him a guard in a year or so the pays better try harvard or princeton if he does his job this afternoon wow thats a wrinkle did you know his father was the champion wrestler of the islands of course hes sort of getting on now get the hell out of my way ordered jason heading for the door youre not exactly eighteen either he added turning briefly before he let himself out never said i was whats your problem maybe its the sandbar you never saw mr security bourne slammed the door as he ran out into the hallway touchy touchy st jacques slowly shook his head as he unclenched his thirtyfouryearold fist nearly two hours had passed and ishmael was nowhere to be found his leg locked in place as if crippled jason limped convincingly from one end of tranquility inns property to the other his eye focused through the mirrored lens of the camera seeing everything but no sign of young ishmael twice he had gone up the path into the woods to the isolated square structure of logs thatched roof and stained glass that was the multidenominational chapel of the resort a sanctuary for meditation built more for its quaint appearance than for utility as the young black steward had observed it was rarely visited but had its place in vacation brochures the caribbean sun was growing more orange inching its way down toward the waters horizon soon the shadows of sundown would crawl across montserrat and the out islands soon thereafter darkness would come and the jackal approved of darkness but then so did the chameleon storage room anything said bourne into his radio rien monsieur johnny im up on the roof with six scouts at all points nothing what about the dinner the party tonight our meteorologist arrived ten minutes ago by boat from plymouth hes afraid to fly and angus tacked a check for ten thousand on the bulletin board signature and payee to be entered scotty was right all seven couples will be there were a society of whogivesashit after an appropriate few minutes of silence tell me something i dont know bro out im heading back to the chapel glad to hear somebody goes there a travel bastard in new york said itd be a nice touch but i havent heard from him since stay in touch david i will johnny replied jason bourne the path to the chapel was growing dark the tall palms and dense foliage above the beach hastening natures process by blocking the rays of the setting sun jason was about to turn around and head for the tackle shop and a flashlight when suddenly as if on photoelectric cue blue and red floods came alive shooting their wide circles of light up from the ground into the palms above for a moment bourne felt that he had abruptly too abruptly entered a lush technicolor tunnel cut out of tropical forest it was disorienting then disturbing he was a moving illuminated target in a garishly colored gallery he quickly walked into the underbrush beyond the border of floodlights the nettles of the wild shrubbery stinging his bare legs he went deeper into the enveloping foliage and continued in the now semidarkness toward the chapel his pace slow difficult the moist branches and vines tangling about his hands and feet instinct stay out of the light the gaudy bombastic lights that belonged more properly to an island carnivale a blunt sound a thud that was no part of the shoreline woods then the start of a moan growing into a convulsionstopped thwarted suppressed jason crouched and foot by foot broke through the inhibiting succeeding walls of bush until he could see the thick cathedral door of the chapel it was partially open the soft pulsating glow of the electric candles penetrating the wash of the red and blue floods on the outside path think memory remember he had been to the chapel only once before humorously berating his brotherinlaw for spending good money on a useless addition to tranquility inn at least its quaint st jacques had said it aint bro marie had replied it doesnt belong this isnt a retreat suppose someone gets bad news you know really bad get him a drink david webb had said come on inside ive got symbols of five different religions in stained glass including shinto dont show your sister the bills on this one webb had whispered inside was there a door inside another exit no there was not only five or six rows of pews then a railing of some sort in front of a raised lectern beneath primitive stainedglass windows done by native artisans inside someone was inside ishmael a distraught guest of tranquility a honeymooner who had sudden deep reservations embarrassingly too late he again reached into his breast pocket for the miniaturized radio he brought it to his lips and spoke softly johnny right here on the roof im at the chapel im going inside is ishmael there i dont know someone is whats wrong dave you sound nothings wrong interrupted bourne im just checking in whats behind the building east of it more woods any paths there was one several years ago its overgrown by now the construction crews used it to go down to the water im sending over a couple of guards no if i need you ill call out jason replaced the radio and still crouching stared at the chapel door silence now no sound at all from inside no human movement nothing but the flickering candlelight bourne crept to the border of the path removed the camera equipment and the straw hat and opened the case holding the flares he removed one inserted it under his belt and took out the automatic beside it he reached into the left pocket of his guayabera jacket for his lighter gripping it in his hand as he got to his feet and walked quietly rapidly to the corner of the small buildingthis unlikely sanctuary in the tropical woods above a tropical beach flares and the means to light them went back long before manassas virginia he considered as he inched his way around the corner toward the chapels entrance they went back to paristhirteen years ago to paris and a cemetery in rambouillet and carlos he reached the frame of the partially opened door and slowly cautiously moved his face to the edge and looked inside he gasped his breath suspended the horror filling him as disbelief and fury spread within him on the raised platform in front of the rows of glistening wood was the young ishmael his body bent forward over the lectern his arms hanging down his dark face bruised and lacerated blood trickling out of his mouth onto the floor the guilt overwhelmed jason it was sudden and complete and devastating the words of the old frenchman screaming in his ears others may die innocent people slaughtered slaughtered a child had been slaughtered promises were implied but death had been delivered oh christ what have i done what can i do sweat pouring down his face his eyes barely focusing bourne ripped the distress flare out of his pocket snapped the lighter and trembling held it to the red tip ignition was instant the white fire spewed out in white heat hissing like a hundred angry snakes jason threw it into the chapel toward the far end leaped through the frame pivoted and slammed the heavy door shut behind him he lunged to the floor below the last row pulled the radio from his pocket and pushed the send button johnny the chapel surround it he did not wait for st jacquess reply that there was a voice was enough the automatic in his hand the hissing flare continuously erupting as shafts of color shot down from the stainedglass windows bourne crept to the far aisle his eyes moving constantly seeking out everything he no longer remembered about tranquility inns chapel the one place where he could not look again was the lectern that held the body of the child he had killed on both sides of the raised platform were narrow draped archways like scenic doors on a stage leading to minimum wing space entrances both left and right despite the anguish he felt there welled up in jason bourne a deep sense of satisfaction even of morbid elation the lethal game was his for the winning carlos had mounted an elaborate trap and the chameleon had reversed it medusas delta had turned it around behind one of those two draped archways was the assassin from paris bourne got to his feet his back pressed against the right wall and raised his gun he fired twice into the left archway the drapes fluttering with each shot as he sprang behind the last row scrambling to the far side getting to his knees and firing twice more into the archway on the right a figure lunged in panic through the drapes clutching the cloth as it fell forward the dark red fabric ripped from the hooks bunched around the targets shoulders as he fell to the floor bourne rushed forward screaming carloss name firing again and again until the automatics magazine was empty suddenly from above there was an explosion blowing out a whole section of stained glass high on the left wall as the colored fragments shot through the air and down onto the floor a man on a ledge outside moved into the center of the open space above the hissing blinding flare youre out of bullets said carlos to the stunned jason bourne below thirteen years delta thirteen loathsome years but now theyll know who won the jackal raised his gun and fired the searing icecold heat ripped through his neck as bourne lunged over the pews crashing down between the second and third rows smashing his head and his hips on the glistening brown wood as he clawed at the floor his vision spun out of control as a cloud of darkness enveloped him in the distance far far away he heard the sound of voices shouting hysterically then the darkness was complete david there was no shouting now the single voice was low and urgent and used a name he did not care to acknowledge david can you hear me bourne opened his eyes instantly aware of two facts there was a wide bandage around his throat and he was lying fully clothed on a bed to his right the anxious face of john st jacques came into focus on his left was a man he did not know a middleaged man with a level steady gaze carlos jason managed to say finding his voice it was the jackal then hes still on the islandthis island st jacques was emphatic its been barely an hour and henrys got tranquility ringed patrols are hovering offshore roving back and forth all in visual and radio contact hes calling it a drug exercise very quiet and very official a few boats come in but none go out and none will go out whos he asked bourne looking at the man on his left a doctor answered maries brother hes staying at the inn and hes a friend of mine i was a patient of his in i think we should be circumspect here interrupted the canadian doctor firmly you asked for my help and my confidence john and i give both gladly but considering the nature of the events and the fact that your brotherinlaw wont be under my professional care lets dispense with my name i couldnt agree with you more doctor added jason wincing then suddenly snapping his head up his eyes wide in an admixture of pleading and panic ishmael hes deadi killed him he isnt and you didnt said st jacques calmly hes a goddamned mess but hes not dead hes one tough kid like his father and hell make it were flying him to the hospital in martinique christ he was a corpse he was savagely beaten explained the doctor both arms were broken along with multiple lacerations contusions i suspect internal injuries and a severe concussion however as john accurately described the young man hes one tough kid i want the best for him those were my orders good bourne moved his eyes to the doctor how damaged am i without x rays or seeing how you movesymptomatically as it werei can only give you a cursory judgment do that outside of the wound id say primarily traumatic shock forget it thats not allowed who says said the doctor smiling kindly i do and im not trying to be funny the body not the head ill be the judge of the head is he a native asked the doctor looking at the owner of tranquility inn a white but older ishmael ill tell you hes not a physician answer him please all right the bullet passed through the left side of your neck missing by millimeters several vital spots that would certainly have rendered you voiceless and probably dead ive bathed the wound and sutured it youll have difficulty moving your head for a while but thats only a superficial opinion of the damage in short words ive got a very stiff neck but if i can walk well i can walk in shorter words thats about it it was the flare that did it after all said jason softly carefully moving his neck back over the pillow it blinded him just enough what st jacques leaned over the bed never mind lets see how well i walksymptomatically that is bourne slid off the bed swinging his legs cautiously to the floor shaking his head at his brotherinlaw who started to help him no thanks bro this has got to be me on me he stood up the inhibiting bandage around his throat progressively becoming more uncomfortable he stepped forward pained by the bruises on his thighs but they were bruisesthey were minor a hot bath would reduce the pain and medication extrastrength aspirin and liniment would permit more normal mobility it was the goddamned dressing around his neck it not only choked him but forced him to move his shoulders in order to look in any direction still he considered he was far less incapacitated than he might have beenfor a man of his age damn can we loosen this necklace doctor its strangling me a bit not much you dont want to risk rupturing those sutures what about an ace bandage it gives too much for a neck wound youd forget about it i promise not to youre very amusing i dont feel remotely amusing its your neck it certainly is can you get one johnny doctor st jacques looked at the physician i dont think we can stop him ill send someone to the pro shop excuse me doctor said bourne as maries brother went to the telephone i want to ask johnny a few questions and im not sure you want to hear them ive heard more than i care to already ill wait in the other room the doctor crossed to the door and let himself out while st jacques talked on the phone jason moved about the room raising and lowering his arms and shaking his hands to check the functioning of his motor controls he crouched then rose to his feet four times in succession each movement faster than the previous one he had to be readyhe had to be itll only be a few minutes said the brotherinlaw hanging up the phone pritchard will have to go down and open the shop hell bring different sizes of tape thanks bourne stopped moving and stood in place who was the man i shot johnny he fell through the curtains in that archway but i couldnt see his face no one i know and i thought i knew every white man in these islands who could afford an expensive suit he must have been a tourista tourist on assignment for the jackal naturally there wasnt any identification henrys shipped him off to serrat how many here know whats going on outside of the staff there are only fourteen guests and no ones got a clue ive sealed off the chapelthe word is storm damage and even those who have to know somethinglike the doctor and the two guys from torontothey dont know the whole story just pieces and theyre friends i trust them the others are heavy into island rum what about the gunshots at the chapel what about the loudest and lousiest steel band in the islands also you were a thousand feet away in the woods look david most everyones left but some diehards who wouldnt stay here if they werent old canadian buddies showing me loyalty and a few casuals whod probably take a vacation in teheran what can i tell you except that the bar is doing a hell of a business its like a mystifying charade murmured bourne again carefully arching his neck and staring at the ceiling figures in silhouette playing out disconnected violent events behind white screens nothing really making sense everythings whatever you want it to be thats a little much for me professor whats your point terrorists arent born johnny theyre made schooled in a curriculum you wont find in any academic catalog leaving aside the reasons why they are what they arewhich can range from a justifiable cause to the psychopathic megalomania of a jackalyou keep the charades going because theyre playing out their own so st jacques frowned in bewilderment so you control your players telling them what to act out but not why thats what were doing here and thats what henrys doing out on the water all around tranquility is he are we hell yes i thought i was too but i was wrong i overestimated a big clever kid doing a simple harmless job and underestimated a humble frightened priest who took thirty pieces of silver what are you talking about ishmael and brother samuel samuel must have witnessed the torture of a child through the eyes of torquemada turkey who the point is we dont really know the players the guards for instance the ones you brought to the chapel im not a fool david protested st jacques interrupting when you called for us to surround the place i took a small liberty and chose two men the only two i would choose figuring a pair of uzis made up for the absence of one man and the four points of the compass theyre my head boys and former royal commandos theyre in charge of all the security here and like henry i trust them henry hes a good man isnt he hes a pain in the ass sometimes but hes the best in the islands and the crown governor hes just an ass does henry know that sure he does he didnt get to be a brigadier on his looks potbelly and all hes not only a good soldier hes a good administrator he covers for a lot around here and youre certain he hasnt been in touch with the cg he told me hed let me know before he reached the pompous idiot and i believe him i sincerely hope youre rightbecause that pompous idiot is the jackals contact in montserrat what i dont believe it believe its confirmed its incredible no its not its the way of the jackal he finds vulnerability and he recruits it buys it there are very few in the gray areas beyond his ability to purchase them stunned st jacques wandered aimlessly to the balcony doors coming to terms with the unbelievable i suppose it answers a question a lot of us have asked ourselves the governors oldline landed gentry with a brother high up in the foreign office whos close to the prime minister why at his age was he sent out here or maybe more to the point why did he accept it youd think hed settle for nothing less than bermuda or the british virgins plymouth can be a steppingstone not a final post he was banished johnny carlos probably found out why a long time ago and has him on a list hes been doing it for years most people read newspapers and books and magazines for diversion the jackal pores over volumes of indepth intelligence reports from every conceivable source he can unearth and hes unearthed more than the cia the kgb mifive and six interpol and a dozen other services even want to think about those seaplanes flew in four or five times after i got back here from blackburne who was on them pilots answered st jacques turning around they were taking people out not bringing anyone in i told you that yes you told me were you watching watching who each plane when it came in hey come on you had me doing a dozen different things what about the two black commandos the ones you trust so much they were checking and positioning the other guards for christs sake then we dont really know who may have come in on those planes do we maybe slipping into the water over the pontoons as they taxied through the reefsperhaps before the sandbar for gods sake david ive known those charter jocks for years they wouldnt let anything like that happen no way you mean its kind of unbelievable you bet your ass like the jackals contact in montserrat the crown governor the owner of tranquility inn stared at his brotherinlaw what kind of world do you live in one im sorry you ever became a part of but you are now and youll play by its rules my rules a fleck a flash an infinitesimal streak of deep red light from the darkness outside infrared arms extended bourne lunged at st jacques propelling him off his feet away from the balcony doors get out of there jason roared in midair as both crashed to the floor three successive snaps crackling the space above them as bullets thumped with finality into the walls of the villa what the hell hes out there and he wants me to know it said bourne shoving his brotherinlaw into the lower molding crawling beside him and reaching into the pocket of his guayabera he knows who you are so youre the first corpse the one he realizes will drive me to the edge because youre maries brotheryoure family and thats what hes holding over my head my family jesus christ what do we do i do replied jason pulling the second flare out of his pocket i send him a message the message that tells him why im alive and why i will be when hes dead stay where you are bourne pulled his lighter out of his right pocket and ignited the flare scrambling he raced across the balcony doors hurling the hissing blinding missile out into the darkness two snaps followed the bullets ricocheting off the tiled ceiling and shattering the mirror of a dressing table hes got a macten with a silencer said medusas delta rolling into the wall grabbing his inflamed neck as he did so i have to get out of here david youre hurt thats nice jason bourne got to his feet and raced to the door slamming it back he rushed into the villas living room only to face a frowning canadian physician i heard some noise in there said the doctor is everything all right i have to leave get to the floor now see here theres blood on your bandage the sutures get your ass on the floor youre not twentyone mr webb get out of my life shouted bourne running to the entrance letting himself outside and rushing up the lighted path toward the main complex suddenly aware of the deafening steel band its sound amplified throughout the grounds by a score of speakers nailed to the trees the undulating cacophony was overwhelming and that was not to his disadvantage thought jason angus mcleod had been true to his word the huge glassenclosed circular dining room held the few remaining guests and the fewer staff and that meant the chameleon had to change colors he knew the mind of the jackal as well as he knew his own and that meant that the assassin would do exactly what he himself would do under the circumstances the hungry salivating wolf went into the cave of its confused rabid quarry and pulled out the prized piece of meat so would he shedding the skin of the mythical chameleon revealing a much larger beast of preysay a bengal tigerwhich could rip a jackal apart in his jaws why were the images important why he knew why and it filled him with a feeling of emptiness a longing for something that had passedhe was no longer delta the feared guerrilla of medusa nor was he the jason bourne of paris and the far east the older much older david webb kept intruding invading trying to find reason within insanity and violence no get away from me you are nothing and i am everything go away david for christs sake go away bourne spun off the path and ran across the harsh sharp tropical grass toward the side entrance of the inn instantly breathlessly he cut his pace to a walk at the sight of a figure coming through the door then upon recognizing the man he resumed running it was one of the few members of tranquilitys staff he remembered and one of the few he wished he could forget the insufferable snob of an assistant manager named pritchard a loquacious bore albeit hardworking who never let anyone forget his familys importance in montserratespecially an uncle who was deputy director of immigration a not so incidental plus for tranquility inn david webb suspected pritchard shouted bourne approaching the man have you got the bandages why sir cried the assistant manager genuinely flustered youre here we were told you left this afternoon oh shit sir such condolences of sorrow so pain my lips just keep them shut pritchard do you understand me of course i was not here this morning to greet you or this afternoon to bid you farewell and express my deepest feelings for mr saint jay asked me to work this evening through the night actually pritchard im in a hurry give me the bandages and dont tell anyoneanyonethat you saw me i want that very clear oh it is clear sir said pritchard handing over the three different rolls of elasticized tape such privileged information is safe with me as safe as the knowledge that your wife and children were staying hereoh god forgive me forgive me sir i will and he will if you keep your mouth shut sealed it is sealed i am so privileged youll be shot if you abuse the privilege is that clear sir dont faint pritchard go down to the villa and tell mr saint jay that ill be in touch with him and hes to stay there have you got that hes to stay there you too for that matter perhaps i could forget it get out of here the talkative assistant manager ran across the lawn toward the path to the east villas as bourne raced to the door and went inside jason climbed the steps two at a timeonly years before it would have been three at a timeand again out of breath reached st jacquess office he entered closed the door and quickly went to the closet where he knew his brotherinlaw kept several changes of clothing both men were approximately the same sizeoutsized as marie claimedand johnny had frequently borrowed jackets and shirts from david webb when visiting jason selected the most subdued combination in the closet lightweight gray slacks and an allcotton dark blue blazer the only shirt in evidence again tropical cotton was thankfully shortsleeved and brown nothing would pick up or reflect light he started to undress when he felt a sharp hot jolt on the left side of his neck he looked in the closet mirror alarmed then furious at what he saw the constricting bandage around his throat was deep red with spreading blood he tore open the box of the widest tape it was too late to change the dressing he could only reinforce it and hope to stem the bleeding he unraveled the elasticized tape around his neck tearing it after several revolutions and applied the tiny clamps to hold it in place it was more inhibiting than ever it was also an impediment he would put out of his mind he changed clothes pulling the collar of the brown shirt high over his throat and putting the automatic in his belt the reel of fishing line in the blazers pocket footsteps the door opened as he pressed his back against the wall his hand on the weapon old fontaine walked in he stood for a moment looking at bourne then closed the door ive been trying to find you frankly not knowing if you were still alive said the frenchman were not using the radios unless we have to jason walked away from the wall i thought you got the message i did and it was right carlos may have his own radio by now hes not alone you know its why ive been wandering around looking for you then it occurred to me that you and your brotherinlaw might be up here in his office a headquarters as it were its not very smart for you to be walking around out in the open im not an idiot monsieur i would have perished long before now if i were wherever i walked i did so with great caution in truth its why i made up my mind to find you assuming you were not dead im not and you found me what is it you and the judge are supposed to be in an empty villa somewhere not wandering around we are we were you see i have a plan a stratageme i believe would interest you i discussed it with brendan brendan his name monsieur he thinks my plan has merit and hes a brilliant man very sagace shrewd yes im sure he is but hes not in our business hes a survivor in that sense we are all in the same business he thinks there is a degree of risk but what plan under these circumstances is without risk whats your plan it is a means to trap the jackal with minimum danger to the other people here that really worries you doesnt it i told you why so theres no reason to repeat it there are men and women together out there go on broke in bourne irritated whats this strategy of yours and youd better understand that i intend to take out the jackal if i have to hold this whole goddamned island hostage im not in a giving mood ive given too much so you and carlos stalk each other in the night two crazed middleaged hunters obsessed with killing each other not caring who else is killed or wounded or maimed for life in the bargain you want compassion go to a church and appeal to that god of yours who pisses on this planet hes either got one hell of a warped sense of humor or hes a sadist now either talk sense or im getting out of here ive thought this out talk i know the monseigneur know the way he thinks he planned the death of my woman and me but not to coincide with yours not in a way that would detract from the high drama of his immediate victory over you it would come later the revelation that i the socalled hero of france was in reality the jackals instrument his creation would be the final proof of his triumph dont you see briefly silent jason studied the old man yes i do he replied quietly not that i ever figured on someone like you but that approach is the basis of everything i believe hes a megalomaniac in his head hes the king of hell and wants the world to recognize him and his throne by his lights his genius has been overlooked relegated to the level of punk killers and mafia hit men he wants trumpets and drums when all he hears are tired sirens and weary questions in police lineups cest vrai he once complained to me that almost no one in america knew who he was they dont they think hes a character out of novels or films if they think about him at all he tried to make up for that thirteen years ago when he flew over from paris to new york to kill me correction monsieur you forced him to go after you its history whats all this got to do with now tonight your plan it provides us with a way to force the jackal to come out after me to meet with me now tonight how by my wandering around the grounds very much in the open where he or one of his scouts will see me and hear me why would that force him to come out after you because i will not be with the nurse he had assigned to me i will be with someone else unknown to him someone who would have no reason at all to kill me again bourne looked at the old frenchman in silence bait he said finally a lure so provocative it will drive him into a frenzy until he has it in his possessionhas me in his grip so he can question me you see im vital to himmore specifically my death is vitaland everything is timing to him precision is his his diction how is it said his byword his method of operation i suppose it is how he has survived how he has made the most of each kill each over the years adding to his reputation as the assassin supreme until a man named jason bourne came out of the far east he has never been the same since but you know all that i dont care about all that interrupted jason the timing go on after im gone he can reveal who jean pierre fontaine the hero of france really was an impostor his impostor his creation the instrument of death who was the snare for jason bourne what a triumph for him but he cannot do that until im dead quite simply it would be too inconvenient i know too much too many of my colleagues in the gutters of paris no i must be dead before he has his triumph then hell kill you when he sees you not until he has his answers monsieur where is his killer nurse what has happened to her did le chameleon find her turn her do away with her have the british authorities got her is she on her way to london and misix with all their chemicals to be turned over at last to interpol so many questions no he will not kill me until he learns what he must learn it may take only minutes to satisfy him but long before then i trust that you will be at my side insuring my survival if not his the nurse whoever it is shell be shot no not at all ill order her away in anger out of my sight at the first sign of contact as i walk with her i shall lament the absence of my new dear friend the angel of mercy who takes such good care of my wife wondering out loud what has happened to her where has she gone why havent i seen her all day naturally i will conceal on my person the radio activated of course wherever i am takenfor surely one of carloss men will make contact firsti will ask an enfeebled old mans questions why am i going here why are we there you will followin full force i sincerely hope if you do so youll have the jackal holding his head straight his neck rigid bourne walked to st jacquess desk and sat on the edge your friend judge brendan whatshisname is right prefontaine although fontaine is not my true name weve decided its all the same family when the earliest members left alsacelorraine for america in the eighteenth century with lafayette they added the pre to distinguish them from the fontaines who spread out all over france he told you that hes a brilliant man once an honored judge lafayette came from alsacelorraine i dont know monsieur ive never been there hes a brilliant man more to the point hes right your plan has a lot of merit but theres also considerable risk and ill be honest with you fontaine i dont give a damn about the risk youre taking or about the nurse whoever it is i want the jackal and if it costs your life or the life of a woman i dont know it doesnt matter to me i want you to understand that the old frenchman stared at jason with amused rheumy eyes and laughed softly you are such a transparent contradiction jason bourne would never have said what you just did he would have remained silent accepting my proposition without comment but knowing the advantage mrs webbs husband however must have a voice he objects and must be heard fontaine suddenly spoke sharply get rid of him monsieur bourne he is not my protection not the death of the jackal send him away hes gone i promise you hes gone the chameleon sprang up from the desk his neck frozen in pain lets get started the steel band continued its deafening assault but now restricted to the confines of the glassenclosed lobby and adjacent dining room the speakers on the grounds were switched off on st jacquess orders the owner of tranquility inn having been escorted up from the unoccupied villa by the two uzibearing former commandos along with the canadian doctor and the incessantly chattering mr pritchard the assistant manager was instructed to return to the front desk and say nothing to anyone about the things he had witnessed during the past hour absolutely nothing sir if i am asked i was on the telephone with the authorities over in serrat about what objected st jacques well i thought dont think you were checking the maid service on the west path thats all yes sir the deflated pritchard headed for the office door which had been opened moments before by the nameless canadian doctor i doubt it would make much difference what he said offered the physician as the assistant manager left thats a small zoo down there the combination of last nights events too much sun today and excessive amounts of alcohol this evening will augur a great deal of guilt in the morning my wife doesnt think your meteorologist will have much to say john oh hes having a few himself and even if hes halfway lucid there arent five sober enough to listen to him id better get down there we may as well turn it into a minor carnivale itll save scotty ten thousand dollars and the more distraction we have the better ill speak to the band and the bar and be right back we may not be here said bourne as his brotherinlaw left and a strapping young black woman in a complete nurses uniform walked out of st jacquess private bathroom into the office at the sight of her old fontaine approached very good my child you look splendid said the frenchman remember now ill be holding your arm as we walk and talk but when i squeeze you and raise my voice telling you to leave me alone youll do as i say correct yes sir i am to hurry away quite angry with you for being so unnice thats it theres nothing to be afraid of its just a game we want to talk with someone whos very shy hows the neck asked the doctor looking at jason unable to see the bandage beneath the brown shirt its all right answered bourne lets take a look at it said the canadian stepping forward thanks but not now doctor i suggest you go downstairs and rejoin your wife yes i thought youd say that but may i say something very quickly very quickly im a doctor and ive had to do a great many things i didnt like doing and im sure this is in that category but when i think of that young man and what was done to him please broke in jason yes yes i understand nevertheless im here if you need me i just wanted you to know that im not terribly proud of my previous statements i saw what i saw and i do have a name and im perfectly willing to testify in a court of law in other words i withdraw my reluctance therell be no courts doctor no testimony really but these are serious crimes we know what they are interrupted bourne your help is greatly appreciated but nothing else concerns you i see said the doctor staring curiously at jason ill go then the canadian went to the door and turned youd better let me check that neck later if youve got a neck the doctor left and bourne turned to fontaine are we ready were ready replied the frenchman smiling pleasantly at the large imposing thoroughly mystified young black woman what are you going to do with all the money youre earning tonight my dear the girl giggled shyly her broad smile alive with bright white teeth i have a good boyfriend im going to buy him a fine present thats lovely whats your boyfriends name ishmael sir lets go said jason firmly the plan was simple to mount and like most good strategies however complex simple to execute old fontaines walk through the grounds of tranquility inn had been precisely mapped out the trek began with fontaine and the young woman returning to his villa presumably to look in on his ill wife before his established medically required evening stroll they stayed on the lighted main path straying now and then across the floodlit lawns but always visible a crotchety old man supposedly walking wherever his whims led him to the annoyance of his companion it was a familiar sight the world over an enfeebled irascible septuagenarian taunting his keeper the two former royal commandos one rather short the other fairly tall had selected a series of stations between the points where the frenchman and his nurse would turn and head in different directions as the old man and the girl proceeded into the next planned leg the second commando bypassed his colleague in darkness to the next location using unseen routes only they knew or could negotiate such as that beyond the coastline wall above the tangled tropical brush that led to the beach below the villas the black guards climbed like two enormous spiders in a jungle crawling swiftly effortlessly from branch and rock to limb and vine keeping pace with their two charges bourne followed the second man his radio on receive the angry words of fontaine pulsating through the static where is that other nurse that lovely girl who takes care of my woman where is she i havent seen her all day the emphatic phrases were repeated over and over again with growing hostility jason slipped he was caught he was behind the coastal wall his left foot entangled in thick vines he could not pull his leg loosethe strength was not there he moved his headhis shouldersand the hot flashes of pain broke out on his neck it is nothing pull yank rip his lungs bursting the blood now drenching his shirt he worked his way free and crawled on suddenly there were lights colored lights spilling over the wall they had reached the path to the chapel the red and blue floodlights that lit up the entrance to tranquility inns sealed off sanctuary it was the last destination before the return route back to fontaines villa and one they all agreed was designed more to permit the old frenchman time to catch his breath than for any other purpose st jacques had stationed a guard there to prevent entrance into the demolished chapel there would be no contact here then bourne heard the words over the radiothe words that would send the false nurse racing away from her false charge get away from me yelled fontaine i dont like you where is our regular nurse what have you done with her up ahead the two commandos were side by side crouching below the wall they turned and looked at jason their expressions in the eerie wash of colored lights telling him what he knew only too well from that moment on all decisions were his they had led him escorted him to his enemy the rest was up to him the unexpected rarely disturbed bourne it did now had fontaine made a mistake had the old man forgotten about the inns guard and erroneously presumed he was the jackals contact in his aged eyes had an understandably surprised reaction on the guards part been misinterpreted as an approach anything was possible but considering the frenchmans backgroundthe life of a survivorand the state of his alert mind such a mistake was not realistic then the possibility of another reality came into focus and it was sickening had the guard been killed or bribed replaced by another carlos was a master of the turnaround it was said he had fulfilled a contract on the assassination of anwar sadat without firing a weapon by merely replacing the egyptian presidents security detail with inexperienced recruitsmoney dispersed in cairo returned a hundredfold by the antiisrael brotherhoods in the middle east if it were true the exercise on tranquility isle was childs play jason rose to his feet gripped the top of the coastal wall and slowly painfully his neck causing agony pulled himself up over the ledge again slowly inch by inch sending one arm after the other across the surface to grab the opposing edge for support what he saw stunned him fontaine was immobile his mouth gaped in shock his wide eyes disbelieving as another old man in a tan gabardine suit approached him and threw his arms around the aged hero of france fontaine pushed the man away in panic and bewilderment the words erupted out of the radio in bournes pocket claude quelle secousse vous etes ici the ancient friend replied in a tremulous voice speaking french it is a privilege our monseigneur permitted me to see for a final time my sister and to give comfort to my friend her husband i am here and i am with you with me he brought you here but of course he did i am to take you to him the great man wishes to speak with you do you know what youre doingwhat youve done i am with you with her what else matters shes dead she took her own life last night he intended to kill us both shut off your radio screamed bourne in the silence of his thoughts kill the radio it was too late the left door of the chapel opened and the silhouetted figure of a man walked out into the floodlit corridor of colored lights he was young muscular and blond with blunt features and rigid posture was the jackal training someone else to take his place come with me please said the blond man his french gentle but icily commanding you he added addressing the old man in the tan gabardine suit stay where you are at the slightest sound fire your gun take it out hold it in your hand oui monsieur jason watched helplessly as fontaine was escorted through the door of the chapel from the pocket of his jacket there was an eruption of static followed by a snap the frenchmans radio had been found and destroyed yet something was wrong off center out of balanceor perhaps too symmetrical it made no sense for carlos to use the location of a failed trap a second time no sense at all the appearance of the brother of fontaines wife was an exceptional move worthy of the jackal a truly unexpected move within the swirling winds of confusion but not this not again tranquility inns superfluous chapel it was too orderly too repetitive too obvious wrong and therefore right considered bourne was it the illogical logic of the assassin who had eluded a hundred special branches of the international intelligence community for nearly thirty years he wouldnt do thatits crazy oh yes he might because he knows we think its crazy was the jackal in the chapel or wasnt he if not where was he where had he set his trap the lethal chess game was not only supremely intricate it was sublimely intimate others might die but only one of them would live it was the only way it could end death to the seller of death or death to the challenger one seeking the preservation of a legend the other seeking the preservation of his family and himself carlos had the advantage ultimately he would risk everything for as fontaine revealed he was a dying man and he did not care bourne had everything to live for a middleaged hunter whose life was indelibly marked split in two by the death of a vaguely remembered wife and children long ago in faroff cambodia it could not would not happen again jason slid down off the coastal wall to the slanting precipice at its base he crawled forward to the two former commandos and whispered theyve taken fontaine inside where is the guard asked the man nearest bourne confusion and anger in his whisper i myself placed him here with specific instructions no one was permitted inside he was to be on the radio the instant he saw anyone then im afraid he didnt see him who a blond man who speaks french both commandos whipped their heads toward each other exchanging glances as the second guard instantly looked at jason and spoke quietly describe him please he said medium height large chest and shoulders enough interrupted the first guard our man saw him sir he is third provost of the government police an officer who speaks several languages and is chief of drug investigations but why is he here mon the second commando asked his colleague mr saint jay said the crown police are not told everything they are not part of us sir henry mon he has crown boats six or seven running back and forth with orders to stop anyone leaving tranquility they are drug boats mon sir henry calls it a patrol exercise so naturally the chief of investigations must be the lilting whisper of the west indian trailed off in midsentence as he looked at his companion then why isnt he out on the water mon on the lead boat mon do you like him asked bourne instinctively surprising himself by his own question i mean do you respect him i could be wrong but i seem to sense something you are not wrong sir answered the first guard interrupting the provost is a cruel man and he doesnt like the punjabis as he calls us hes very quick to accuse us and many have lost work because of his rash accusations why dont you complain get rid of him the british will listen to you the crown governor will not sir explained the second guard hes very partial to his strict chief of narcotics they are good friends and often go out after the big fish together i see jason did see and was suddenly alarmed very alarmed saint jay told me there used to be a path behind the chapel he said it might be overgrown but he thought it was still there it is confirmed the first commando the help still use it to go down to the water on their off times how long is it thirtyfive forty meters it leads to an incline where steps have been cut out of the rocks that take one down to the beach which of you is faster asked bourne reaching into his pocket and taking out the reel of fishing line i am i am i choose you said jason nodding his head at the shorter first guard handing him the reel go down on the border of that path and wherever you can string this line across it tying it to limbs or trunks or the strongest branches you can find you mustnt be seen so be alert see in the dark is no problem mon have you got a knife do i have eyes good give me your uzi hurry the guard scrambled away along the vinetangled precipice and disappeared into the dense foliage beyond the second royal commando spoke in truth sir i am much faster for my legs are much longer which is why i chose him and i suspect you know it long legs are no advantage here only an impediment which i happen to know also hes much shorter and less likely to be spotted the smaller ones always get the better assignments they parade us up front and put us in boxing rings with rules we dont understand but the small soldiers get the plumbies plumbies the better jobs yes sir the most dangerous jobs yes mon live with it big fella what do we do now sir bourne looked above at the wall and the soft wash of colored lights its called the waiting gameno love songs implied only the hatred that comes from wanting to live when others want to kill you theres nothing quite like it because you cant do anything all you can do is think about what the enemy may or may not be doing and whether hes thought of something you havent considered as somebody once said id rather be in philadelphia where mon nothing it isnt true suddenly filling the air above in chilling horror came a prolonged excruciating scream followed by words shrieked in pain non non vous etes monstrueux arêtes arêtes je vous supplie now cried jason slinging the strap of his uzi over his shoulder as he leaped onto the wall gripping the edge pulling himself up as the blood poured out of his neck he could not get up he could not get over then strong hands pulled him and he fell over the top of the wall the lights he shouted shoot them out the tall commandos uzi blazing the lines of floodlights exploded in the ground on both sides of the chapels path again strong black hands pulled him to his feet in the new darkness and then a single shaft of yellow appeared roving swiftly in all directions it was a powerful halogen flashlight in the commandos left hand the figure of a blooddrenched old man in a tan gabardine suit lay curled up in the path his throat slit stop in the name of almighty god stop where you are came fontaines voice from inside the chapel the open half door revealing the flickering light of the electric candles they approached the entrance automatic weapons leveled prepared for continuous fire but not prepared for what they saw bourne closed his eyes the sight was too painful old fontaine like young ishmael was sprawled over the lectern on the raised platform beneath the blownout stainedglass windows of the left wall his face running with blood where he had been slashed and attached to his body were thin cables that led to various black boxes on both sides of the chapel go back screamed fontaine run you fools im wired oh christ mourn not for me monsieur le chameleon i gladly join my woman this world is too ugly even for me it is no longer amusing run the charge will go offthey are watching you mon now roared the second commando grabbing jasons jacket and racing him to the wall holding bourne in his arms as they plummeted over the stone surface into the thick foliage the explosion was massive blinding and deafening it was as if this small corner of the small island had been taken out by a heatseeking nuclear missile flames erupted into the night sky but the burning mass was quickly diffused in the still wind to fiery rubble the path shouted jason in a hoarse whisper as he crawled to his feet in the sloping brush get to the path youre in bad condition mon ill take care of me you take care of you i believe ive taken care of both of us so youve got a fucking medal and ill add a lot of money to it now get us up to the path pulling pushing and finally with bournes feet grinding like a machine out of control the two men reached the border of the path thirty feet behind the smoldering ruins of the chapel they crept into the weeds and within seconds the first commando found them theyre in the south palms he said breathlessly they wait until the smoke has cleared to see if anyone is alive but they cannot stay long you were there asked jason with them no problem mon i told you sir whats happening how many are there there were four sir i killed the man whose place i assumed he was black so it made no matter in appearance with the darkness it was quick and silent the throat whos left serrats chief of narcotics of course and two others describe them i could not see clearly but one i think was another black man tall and without much hair the third i could not see at all for heor shewas wearing strange clothes with cloth over the head like a womans sun hat or insect veil a woman it is possible sir a woman theyve got to get out of therehes got to get out of there very soon they will run to this path and race down to the beach where they will hide in the woods of the cove until a boat comes for them they have no choice they cannot go back to the inn for strangers are seen instantly and even though we are far away and the steel band is loud the explosion was certainly heard by the guards posted outside they will report it listen to me said bourne his voice hoarse tense one of those three people is the man i want and i want him for myself so hold your fire because ill know him when i see him i dont give a damn about the others they can be flushed out of that cove later there was a sudden burst of gunfire from the tropical forest accompanied by screams from the once floodlit corridor beyond the ruins of the chapel then one after another the figures raced out of the tangled brush into the path the first to be caught was the blondhaired police officer from montserrat the waisthigh invisible fishing line tripping him as he fell into the dirt breaking the thin taut string the second man slender tall darkfeatured with only a fringe of hair on his bald head was hard upon the first pulling him to his feet sight or instinct making the second killer wield his automatic weapon in slashing arcs cutting the impeding lines across the path to the ledge that led down to the beach the third figure appeared it was not a woman it was a man in the robes of a monk a priest it was he the jackal bourne rose to his feet and stumbled out of the brush into the path the uzi in his hands the victory was his his freedom his his family his as the robed figure reached the top of the primitive rockhewn staircase jason pressed his trigger finger holding it in place the fusillade of bullets exploding out of the automatic weapon the monk arched in silhouette then fell his body tumbling rolling sprawling down the steps carved out of volcanic rock finally lurching over the edge and plummeting to the sand below bourne raced down the awkward irregular stone staircase the two commandos behind him he reached the beach raced over to the corpse and pulled the drenched hood away from the face in horror he looked at the black features of samuel the brother priest of tranquility isle the judas who had sold his soul to the jackal for thirty pieces of silver suddenly in the distance there was the roar of powerful dual engines as a huge speedboat lurched out of a shadowed section of the cove and sped for a break in the reefs the beam of a searchlight shot out firing the barriers of rock protruding above the choppy black water its wash illuminating the fluttering ensign of the governments drug fleet carlos the jackal was no chameleon but he had changed he had aged grown thinner and baldhe was not the sharp broad fullheaded muscular image of jasons memory only the indistinct dark latin features remained the face and the unfamiliar expanse of bare skin above burned by the sun he was gone the boats motors screamed in unison as the craft breached a precarious opening in the reef and burst out into open water then the words in heavily accented english metallically spewing from the distant loudspeaker echoed within the tropical cove paris jason bourne paris if you dare or shall it be a certain minor university in maine dr webb bourne his neck wound ripped open collapsed in the lapping waves his blood trickling into the sea steven desole keeper of the deepest secrets for the central intelligence agency forced his overweight frame out of the drivers seat he stood in the deserted parking lot of the small shopping center in annapolis maryland where the only source of light was the storefront neons of a closed gas station with a large german shepherd sleeping in the window desole adjusted his steelrimmed glasses and squinted at his watch barely able to see the radium hands as near as he could determine it was between and in the morning which meant he was early and that was good he had to adjust his thoughts he was unable to do so while driving as his severe night blindness necessitated complete concentration on the road and hiring a taxi or a driver was out of the question the information was at first well merely a name a rather common name his name is webb the caller had said thank you he had replied a sketchy description was given one fitting several million men so he had thanked the informer again and hung up the phone but then in the recesses of his analysts mind by profession and training a warehouse for both essential and incidental data an alarm went off webb webb amnesia a clinic in virginia years ago a man more dead than alive had been flown down from a hospital in new york the medical file so maximum classified it could not even be shown to the oval office yet interrogation specialists talk in dark corners as often to relieve frustration as to impress a listener and he had heard about a recalcitrant unmanageable patient an amnesiac they called davey and sometimes just a short sharp hostile webb formerly a member of saigons infamous medusa and a man they suspected of feigning his loss of memory loss of memory alex conklin had told them that the medusan they had trained to go out in deep cover for carlos the jackal an agent provocateur they called jason bourne had lost his memory lost his memory and nearly lost his life because his controls disbelieved the story of amnesia that was the man they called davey david david webb was conklins jason bourne how could it be otherwise david webb and he had been at norman swaynes house the night the agency was told that poor cuckolded swayne had taken his own life a suicide that had not been reported in the papers for reasons desole could not possibly understand david webb the old medusa jason bourne conklin why the headlights of an approaching limousine shot through the darkness at the far end of the parking lot swerving in a semicircle toward the cia analyst causing him to shut his eyesthe refracted light through his thick lenses was painful he had to make the sequence of his revelations clear to these men they were his means to a life he and his wife had dreamed ofmoney not bureaucratic lessthanmoney but real money education at the best universities for their grandchildren not the state colleges and the beggedfor scholarships that came with the government salary of a bureaucrata bureaucrat so much better than those around him it was pitiful desole the mute mole they called him but would not pay him for his expertise the very expertise that prohibited him from going into the private sector surrounding him with so many legal restrictions that it was pointless to apply someday washington would learn that day would not come in his lifetime so six grandchildren had made the decision for him the empathetic new medusa had beckoned with generosity and in his bitterness he had come running he rationalized that it was no more an unethical decision on his part than those made every year by scores of pentagon personnel who walked out of arlington and into the corporate arms of their old friends the defense contractors as an army colonel once said to him its work now and get paid later and god knew that one steven desole worked like hell for his country but his country hardly reciprocated in kind he hated the name medusa though and rarely if ever used it because it was a symbol from another time ominous and misleading the great oil companies and railroads sprang from the chicanery and the venality of the robber barons but they were not now what they were then medusa may have been born in the corruption of a warravaged saigon its early funding may have been a result of it but that medusa no longer existed it had been replaced by a dozen different names and companies were not pure mr desole no americancontrolled international conglomerate is said his recruiter and its true that we seek what some might call unfair economic advantage based on privileged information secrets if you like you see we have to because our competitors throughout europe and the far east consistently have it the difference between them and us is that their governments support their effortsours doesnt trade mr desole trade and profits theyre the healthiest pursuits on earth chrysler may not like toyota but the astute mr iacocca does not call for an air strike against tokyo at least not yet he finds ways to join forces with the japanese yes mused desole as the limousine came to a stop ten feet away from him what he did for the corporation which he preferred to call it as opposed to what he did for the company might even be considered benevolent profits after all were more desirable than bombs and his grandchildren would go to the finest schools and universities in the country two men got out of the limousine and approached him whats this webb look like asked albert armbruster chairman of the federal trade commission as they walked along the edge of the parking lot i only have a description from the gardener who was hiding behind a fence thirty feet away what did he tell you the unidentified associate of the chairman a short stocky man with penetrating dark eyes and dark eyebrows beneath dark hair looked at desole be precise he added now just a minute protested the analyst defensively but firmly im precise in everything i say and frankly whoever you are i dont like the tone of your voice one bit hes upset said armbruster as if his associate was dismissible hes a spaghetti head from new york and doesnt trust anybody whos to trust in new york asked the short dark man laughing and poking his elbow into the wide girth of albert armbruster you wasps are the worst you got the banks amico lets keep it that way and out of the courts the description please the chairman looked at desole its incomplete but there is a longago tiein with medusa that ill describeprecisely go ahead pal said the man from new york hes rather largetall that isand in his late forties or early fifties and has he got some gray around his temples asked armbruster interrupting well yes i think the gardener said something to that effectgraying or gray in his hair or something like that its obviously why he judged him to be in his forties or fifties its simon said armbruster looking at the new yorker who desole stopped as the other two stopped and looked at him he called himself simon and he knew all about you mr cia said the chairman about you and brussels and our whole thing what are you talking about for starters your goddamn fax machine exclusively between you and that fruitcake in brussels its a buried dedicated line its locked up someone found the key mr precision said the new yorker not smiling oh my god thats terrible what should i do make up a story between you and teagarten but do it from public phones continued the mafioso one of you will come up with something you know about brussels theres very little i dont know that son of a bitch conned me into thinking he was one of us and he had me by the balls said armbruster angrily continuing to walk along the edge of the parking lot the other two joining him desole hesitantly apprehensively he seemed to know everything but when i think back he only brought up bits and piecesdamned big bits and pieces like burton and you and brusselsand i like a fucking idiot filled in a hell of a lot more shit now just wait a minute cried the cia analyst once again forcing the others to stop i dont understandim a strategist and i dont understand what was david webb jason bourne if he is jason bournedoing at swaynes place the other night who the hell is jason bourne roared the chairman of the federal trade commission hes the tiein with saigons medusa that i just mentioned thirteen years ago the agency gave him the name jason bourne the original bourne a dead man by then and sent him out in deep cover on a four zero assignmenta termination with extreme prejudice if you like a hit if you want to speak english paisan yes yes thats what it was but things went wrong he had a loss of memory and the operation collapsed it collapsed but he survived holy christ what a bunch of zucchinis what can you tell us about this webb or bournethis simon or the cobra jesus hes a walking vaudeville act apparently thats what he did before he assumed different names different appearances different personalities he was trained to do that when he was sent out to challenge the assassin called the jackalto draw him out and kill him the jackal asked the astonished capo supremo of the cosa nostra like in the movie no not the movie or the book you idiot hey easy amico oh shut up ilich ramirez sanchez otherwise known as carlos the jackal is a living person a professional killer the international authorities have been hunting for over a quarter of a century outside of scores of confirmed hits many think he was the puff of smoke on the grassy knoll in dallas the true killer of john kennedy youre shittin me i can assure you i am not shitting you the word we got at the agency at the highest secure levels was that after all these years carlos had tracked down the only man alive who could identify him jason bourneor as im firmly convinced david webb that word had to come from somebody exploded albert armbruster who was it oh yes everythings so sudden so bewildering hes a retired field agent with a crippled leg a man named conklin alexander conklin he and a psychiatristpanov morris panovare close friends of webb or jason bourne where are they asked the capo supremo grimly oh you couldnt reach either one talk to either of them theyre both under maximum security i didnt ask for the rules of engagement paisan i asked where they were well conklins at a condominium in vienna a proprietary of ours no one could penetrate and panovs apartment and office are both under roundtheclock surveillance youll give me the addresses wont you certainly but i guarantee they wont talk to you oh that would be a pity were just looking for a guy with a dozen names asking questions offering assistance they wont buy it maybe i can sell it goddamn it why spouted armbruster then immediately lowered his voice why was this webb or bourne or whoever the hell he is at swaynes its a gap i cant fill said desole a what thats an agency term for no answer no wonder the countrys up shits creek thats not true now you shut up ordered the man from new york reaching into his pocket and pulling out a small notepad and a ballpoint pen write out the addresses of this retired spook and the yid shrink now its difficult to see said desole writing angling the small pad of paper toward the neon lights of the closed gas station there the apartment number may be wrong but its close and panovs name will be on the mailbox but i tell you again he wont talk to you then well just have to apologize for interrupting him yes you probably will i gather hes very dedicated where his patients are concerned oh like that telephone line into your fax machine no no thats a technical term number three wire to be precise and youre always precise arent you paisan and youre very irritating weve got to go broke in armbruster watching the new yorker take back the pad and the ballpoint pen stay calm steven he added obviously suppressing his anger and heading back to the limousine remember theres nothing we cant handle when you talk to jimmy t in brussels see if you two can come up with a reasonable explanation okay if not dont worry well figure it out upstairs of course mr armbruster but if i may ask is my account in bern ready for immediate releasein case well you understand in case of course it is steven all you have to do is fly over and write out the numbers of your account in your own handwriting thats your signature the one on file remember yes yes i do it must be over two million by now thank you thank you sir youve earned it steven good night the two men settled back in the rear seat of the limousine but there was no lack of tension armbruster glanced at the mafioso as the chauffeur beyond the glass partition turned on the ignition wheres the other car the italian switched on the reading light and looked at his watch by now hes parked less than a mile down the road from the gas station hell pick up desole on his way back and stay with him until the circumstances are right your man knows exactly what to do come on a virgin hes not hes got a searchlight mounted on that car so powerful it can be seen in miami he comes alongside switches it on high and wiggles the handle your two milliondollar flunky is blinded and out of business and were only charging a quarter of that amount for the job its your day alby the chairman of the federal trade commission sat back in the shadows of the left rear seat and stared out the window at the dark rushing images beyond the smoked glass you know he said quietly if anyone had ever told me twenty years ago that id be sitting in this car with someone like you saying what im saying i wouldve told him it was impossible oh thats what we like about you classact characters you look down your noses and drip your snot on us until you need us then all of a sudden were associates live and be well alby were eliminating another problem for you go back to your big federal commission and decide which companies are clean and which arentdecisions not necessarily based on soap right shut up roared armbruster pounding his hand on the armrest this simonthis webb wheres he coming from whats he on our case for whats he want something to do with that jackal character maybe that doesnt make sense we dont have anything to do with the jackal why should you asked the mafioso grinning you got us right its a very loose association and dont you forget it webbsimon goddamn it whoever he is weve got to find him with what he already knew plus what i told him hes a fucking menace hes a real major item isnt he a major item agreed the chairman again staring out the window his right fist clenched the fingers of his left hand drumming furiously on the armrest you want to negotiate what snapped armbruster turning and looking at the calm sicilian face of his companion you heard me only i used the wrong word and i apologize for that ill give you a nonnegotiable figure and you can either accept it or reject it a contract on simonwebb no replied the mafioso slowly shaking his head on a character named jason bourne its cleaner to kill someone whos already dead isnt it since we just saved you one and a half mill the price of the contract is five five million the cost of eliminating problems in the category of major items is high menaces are even higher five million alby half on acceptance within the usual twentyfour hours thats outrageous then turn me down you come back its sevenfifty and if you come back again its double that fifteen million what guarantee do we have that you can even find him you heard desole hes four zero which means hes out of reach buried oh well dig him up just so we can replant him how two and a half million is a lot to pay on your word how again smiling the mafia supremo reached into his pocket and pulled out the small notebook steven desole had returned to him close friends are the best sources alby ask the sleazes who write all those gossip books i got two addresses you wont get near them hey come on you think youre dealing with old chicago and the animals with mad dog capone and nitti the nervous finger we got sophisticated people on the payroll these days geniuses scientists electronics whiz kidsdoctors by the time we get finished with the spook and the yid they wont know what happened but well have jason bourne the character who doesnt exist because hes already dead albert armbruster nodded once and turned to the window in silence ill close up for six months change the name then start a promotional campaign in the magazines before reopening said john st jacques standing by the window as the doctor worked on his brotherinlaw theres no one left asked bourne wincing as he sat in a chair dressed in a bathrobe the last suture on his neck being pincered sure there is seven crazy canadian couples including my old buddy whos needlepointing your throat at the moment would you believe they wanted to start up a brigade renfrews of the mounties after the evil people that was scottys idea interrupted the doctor softly concentrating on the wound count me out im too old sos he but he doesnt know it then he wanted to advertise a reward to the tune of a hundred thousand for information leading to the et cetera i finally convinced him that the less said the better nothing said is the best added jason thats the way its got to be thats a little tough david said st jacques misunderstanding the sharp glance bourne leveled at him im sorry but it is were deflecting most of the local inquiries with an ersatz story about a massive propanegas leak but not too many people are buying it of course to the world outside an earthquake down here wouldnt rate six lines buried in the last pages of the want ads but rumors are flying around the leewards you said local inquiries what about that world outside has there been anything from it there will be but not about here not about tranquility montserrat yes and the news will get a column in the london times and maybe an inch in the new york and washington papers but i dont think itll touch us stop being so cryptic well talk later say whatever you like john broke in the doctor im just about finished so im not paying much attention and even if i heard you im entitled to ill make it brief said st jacques walking to the right of the chair the crown governor he continued you were right at least i have to assume you were right why the news came in while you were getting cleaned up the cgs boat was found smashed on one of the nastier reefs off antigua halfway to barbuda there was no sign of survivors plymouth assumes it was one of those whipsaw squalls that can come out of south nevis but its hard to swallow not a squall necessarily but the circumstances which were his usual two crewmen werent with him he dismissed them at the yacht club saying he wanted to take the boat out by himself yet he told henry he was going out for the running big fish which means he wouldve had to have a crew interrupted the canadian physician oh sorry yes he wouldve agreed the owner of tranquility inn you cant fish the big fellas and skipper a boat at the same timeat least the cg couldnt he was afraid to take his eyes off the charts but he could read them couldnt he asked jason the charts as a navigator he was no captain bligh sailing by the pacific stars but he was good enough to stay out of trouble he was told to go out alone said bourne ordered to rendezvous with a boat in waters that called for him to really keep his eyes on the charts jason suddenly realized that the doctors nimble fingers were no longer touching his neck instead there was the constricting bandage and the physician was standing beside him looking down how are we doing asked bourne looking up an appreciative smile creasing his lips were done said the canadian well then i think wed better meet later for a drink all right good heavens youre just getting to the good part its not good doctor its not good at all and id be a very ungrateful patientwhich im notif i even unwittingly let you hear things i dont think you should hear the elderly canadian locked his eyes with jasons you mean that dont you in spite of everything thats happened you really dont want to involve me any further and youre not playing melodramatic games secrecy for secrecys sakean old dodge for inferior doctors incidentallybut youre really concerned arent you i guess i am considering whats happened to you and i dont just mean these past few hours which ive been a part of but what the scars on your body tell me youve been through before its rather remarkable that you can be concerned for anyone but yourself youre a strange man mr webb at times you even sound like two different people im not strange doctor said jason bourne momentarily closing his eyes his lids briefly tight i dont want to be strange or different or anything exotic at all i want to be as normal and ordinary as the next fellow no games at all im just a teacher and thats all i want to be but in the present circumstances i have to do things my way which means i leave for my own benefit yes it does and if i ever learn all the facts ill realize that your instructions were very educational i hope so ill bet youre one hell of a teacher mr webb doctor webb interjected john st jacques spontaneously as if the clarification were mandatory my brotherinlaws a doctor too like my sister hes got a phd he speaks a couple of oriental languages and is a full professor places like harvard mcgill and yale have been after him for years but he wont budge will you please be quiet said bourne close to laughing albeit kindly at his wifes brother my entrepreneurial young friend is impressed with any alphabet after a name despite the fact that left to my own resources i couldnt afford one of these villas for more than a couple of days thats a crock i said my own resources youve got a point ive got a rich wife forgive us doctor its an old family argument not only a good teacher the physician repeated but under the grim exterior i suspect a very engaging one the canadian walked to the door he turned and added ill take you up on that drink later id really like that thanks said jason thanks for everything the doctor nodded and left closing the door firmly behind him bourne turned to his brotherinlaw hes a good friend johnny actually hes a cold fish but a hell of a doctor thats the most human ive ever seen him so you figure the jackal had the crown governor meet him somewhere off the antigua coast got the cgs information killed him and fed him to the sharks conveniently foundering the boat in reef waters completed jason perhaps opening the throttle and setting a short highspeed course into the shoals a tragedy at sea and a link to carlos vanishesthats vital to him thats also something i have trouble with said st jacques i didnt go into it but the section of reef north of falmouth where he bought it is called devils mouth and its not the kind of place thats advertised charters just stay away from it and no one boasts about the number of lives and boats its claimed so so assuming the jackal told the cg where to rendezvous someplace obviously close to devils mouth how the hell did the jackal know about it your two commandos didnt tell you tell me what i sent them right over to henry to give him a full report while we took care of you there wasnt time to sit down and talk and i figured every moment counted then henry knows by now hes probably in shock hes lost two drug boats in two days and only one is likely to be paid for and he still doesnt know about his boss the so honorable crown governor lackey of the jackal who made fools of the foreign office by passing off a smalltime paris hit man as a venerable hero of france the wires will be burning all night between government house and whitehall another drug boat what are you trying to tell me what does henry know nowwhat could my guards tell him your question a minute ago was how did the jackal know about the reef off the coast of antigua called devils mouth take my word for it doctor webb i remember the question how could he because he had a third man here thats what your royal commandos have told henry by now a blondhaired son of a bitch who heads up montserrats drug patrols him rickman the oneman british ku klux klan bytherulesrickman scourge of anybody whos afraid to yell back at him holy christ henry wont believe it why not you just described a likely disciple of carlos i suppose i did but it seems so unlikely hes the original sanctimonious deacon prayer meetings before work in the morning calling on god to aid him in his battle against satan no alcohol no women savonarola id say that fitsfrom what i remember reading for history courses then id say hes prime meat for the jackal and henry will believe it when his lead boat doesnt come back to plymouth and the bodies of the crew float up on shore or simply dont show up for the prayer meetings thats how carlos got away yes bourne nodded and gestured at the couch several feet in front of him the space between taken up by a glasstopped coffee table sit down johnny we have to talk what have we been doing not about what has happened bro but about whats going to happen whats going to happen asked st jacques lowering himself on the couch im leaving no cried the younger man shooting to his feet as if propelled by a bolt of electricity you cant i have to he knows our names where we live everything where are you going paris goddamn it no you cant do that to marie or to the kids for christs sake i wont let you you cant stop me for gods sake david listen to me if washingtons too cheap or doesnt give a shit believe me ottawas cut from better stock my sister worked for the government and our government doesnt kiss people off because its inconvenient or too expensive i know peoplelike scotty the doc and others a few words from them and youll be put in a fortress in calgary no one could touch you you think my government wouldnt do the same let me tell you something bro there are people in washington whove put their lives on the line to keep marie and the children and me alive selflessly without any reward for themselves or the government if i wanted a safe house where no one could touch us id probably get an estate in virginia with horses and servants and a full platoon of armed soldiers protecting us around the clock then thats the answer take it to what end johnny to live in our own personal prison the kids not allowed to go over to friends houses guards with them if they go to school and not tutored by themselves no over nights no pillow fightsno neighbors marie and i staring at each other glancing over at the searchlights outside the windows hearing the footsteps of the guards the occasional cough or sneeze or heaven forbid the crack of a rifle bolt because a rabbit disturbed a garden thats not living thats imprisonment your sister and i couldnt handle it neither could i not the way you describe it but what can paris solve i can find him i can take him hes got the manpower over there ive got jason bourne said david webb i dont buy that crap neither do i but it seems to work im calling in your debt to me johnny cover for me tell marie im fine not hurt at all and that ive got a lead on the jackal that only old fontaine could have providedwhich is the truth actually a café in argenteuil called le coeur du soldat tell her im bringing in alex conklin and all the help washington can provide but youre not are you no the jackal would hear about it hes got ears up and down the quai dorsay solos the only way dont you think shell know that shell suspect it but she cant be certain ill have alex call her confirming that hes in touch with all the heavy covert firepower in paris but first it comes from you why the lie you shouldnt have to ask that bro ive put her through enough all right ill tell her but she wont believe me shell see right through me she always has since i was a kid those big brown eyes would look into mine most of the time pissed off but not like our brothers notoh i dont knownot with that disgust in their faces because the kid was a screwup can you understand that its called caring shes always cared for youeven when you were a screwup yeah mares okay somewhat more than that i think call her in a couple of hours and bring them back here its the safest place they can be what about you how are you going to get to paris the connections out of antigua and martinique are lousy sometimes booked days in advance i cant use those airlines anyway ive got to get in secretly under a shroud somehow a man in washington will have to figure it out somehow hes got to alexander conklin limped out of the small kitchen in the cias vienna apartment his face and hair soaking wet in the old days before the old days fell into a distillery vat he would calmly leave the officewherever it waswhen things got too heavy too fast and indulge himself in an unwavering ritual he would seek out the best steak houseagain wherever he washave two dry martinis and a thick rare slab of meat with the greasiest potatoes on the menu the combination of the solitude the limited intake of alcohol the bloodrare hunk of beef and in particular the greaseladen potatoes had such a calming effect on him that all the rushing conflicting complexities of the hectic day sorted themselves out and reason prevailed he would return to his officewhether a smart flat in londons belgravia square or the back rooms of a whorehouse in katmanduwith multiple solutions it was how he got the sobriquet of saint alex of conklin he had once mentioned this gastronomical phenomenon to mo panov who had a succinct reply if your crazy head doesnt kill you your stomach will these days however with postalcoholic vacuum and various other impediments such as high cholesterol and dumb little triglycerides whatever the hell they were he had to come up with a different solution it came about by accident one morning during the irancontra hearings which he found to be the finest hours of comedy on television his set blew out he was furious so he turned on his portable radio an instrument he had not used in months or perhaps years as the television set had a builtin radio componentalso inoperable at the timebut the portable radios batteries had long since melted into white slime his artificial foot in pain he walked to his kitchen telephone knowing that a call to his television repairman for whom he had done several favors would bring the man running to his emergency unfortunately the call only brought forth a hostile diatribe from the repairmans wife who screamed that her husband the customerfucker had run off with a horny rich black bitch from embassy row zaire as it later turned out in the puerta vallarta papers conklin in progressive apoplexy had rushed to the kitchen sink where his stress and blood pressure pills stood on the windowsill above the sink and turned on the cold water the faucet exploded surging out of its recess into the ceiling as a powerful gush of water inundated his entire head caramba the shock calmed him down and he remembered that the cable network was scheduled to rebroadcast the hearings in full that evening a happy man he called the plumber and went out and bought a new television set so since that morning whenever his own furies or the state of the world disturbed himthe world he knewhe lowered his head in a kitchen sink and let the cold water pour over his head he had done so this morning this goddamned fuckedup morning desole killed in an accident on a deserted country road in maryland at that morning what the hell was steven desole a man whose drivers license clearly stated that he was afflicted with night blindness doing on a backcountry road outside annapolis at in the morning and then charlie casset a very angry casset calling him at six oclock yelling his usually cool head off telling alex he was going to put the commander of nato on the goddamned spit and demand an explanation for the buried fax connection between the general and the dead chief of clandestine reports who was not a victim of an accident but of murder furthermore one retired field officer named conklin had better damned well come clean with everything he knew about desole and brussels and related matters or all bets were off where said retired field agent and his elusive friend jason bourne were concerned noon at the latest and then ivan jax the brilliant black doctor from jamaica phoned telling him he wanted to put norman swaynes body back where he had found it because he did not want to be loused up by another agency fiasco but it was not agency cried conklin to himself unable to explain to ivan jax the real reason he had asked for his help medusa and jax could not simply drive the corpse back to manassas because the police on federal ordersthe orders of one retired field agent using appropriated codes he was not entitled to usehad sealed off general norman swaynes estate without explanation what do i do with the body jax had yelled keep it cold for a while cactus would want it that way cactus ive been with him at the hospital all night hes going to be okay but he doesnt know what the hell is going on any more than i do we in the clandestine services cant always explain things alex said wincing as he spoke the ridiculous words ill call you back so he had gone into the kitchen and put his head under a spray of cold water what else could go wrong and naturally the telephone rang dunkin donuts said conklin the phone to his ear get me out of here said jason bourne not a trace of david webb in his voice to paris what happened he got away thats what happened and i have to get to paris under a cover no immigration no customs hes got them all wired and i cant give him the chance to track me alex are you listening to me desole was killed last night killed in an accident that was no accident at four oclock in the morning medusas closing in i dont give a damn about medusa for me its history we made a wrong turn i want the jackal and ive got a place to start i can find him take him leaving me with medusa you said you wanted to go higheryou said youd only give me fortyeight hours until you did shove the clock ahead the fortyeight hours are over so go higher just get me out of here and over to paris theyll want to talk to you who peter holland casset whoever else they bring in the attorney general christ the president himself about what you spoke at length with armbruster with swaynes wife and that sergeant flannagan i didnt i just used a few code words that triggered responses from armbruster and ambassador atkinson in london nothing substantive youve got the fuller picture firsthand im too deniable theyll have to talk to you and put the jackal on a back burner just for a day two at the most goddamn it no because it doesnt work that way and you know it once im back there im their only material witness shunted from one closed interrogation to another and if i refuse to cooperate im in custody no way alex ive got only one priority and hes in paris listen to me said conklin there are some things i can control others i cant we needed charlie casset and he helped us but hes not someone you can con nor would i want to he knows desoles death was no accidenta man with night blindness doesnt take a fivehour drive at four oclock in the morningand he also knows that we know a lot more about desole and brussels than were telling him if we want the agencys help and we need it for things like getting you on a military or a diplomatic flight into france and god knows what else when youre there i cant ignore casset hell step on us and by his lights he should bourne was silent only his breathing was heard all right he said i see where were at you tell casset that if he gives us whatever we ask for now well give himno ill give him keep yourself cleaner than meenough information for the department of justice to go after some of the biggest fish in the government assuming justice isnt part of snake lady you might add thatll include the location of a cemetery that might prove enlightening it was conklins turn to be silent for a moment he may want more than that considering your current pursuits oh oh i see in case i lose okay add that when i get to paris ill hire a stenographer and dictate everything i know everything ive learned and send it to you ill trust saint alex to carry it from there maybe a page or two at a time to keep them cooperative ill handle that part now paris or close by from what i recall montserrats near dominica and martinique isnt it less than an hour to each and johnny knows every pilot on the big island martiniques french well go with that i know people in the deuxième bureau get down there and call me from the airport terminal ill have made the arrangements by then will do theres a last item alex marie she and the children will be back here this afternoon call her and tell her im covered with all the firepower in paris you lying son of a bitch do it of course i will on that score and not lying if i live through the day im having dinner with mo panov at his place tonight hes a terrible cook but he thinks hes the jewish julia child id like to bring him up to date hell go crazy if i dont sure without him wed both be in padded cells chewing rawhide talk to you later good luck the next day at in the morning washington time dr morris panov accompanied by his guard walked out of walter reed hospital after a psychiatric session with a retired army lieutenant suffering from the aftereffects of a training exercise in georgia that took the lives of twentyodd recruits under his command eight weeks before there was not much mo could do the man was guilty of competitive overachievement military style and had to live with his guilt the fact that he was a financially privileged black and a graduate of west point did not help most of the twenty dead recruits were also black and they had been underprivileged panov muddling over the available options with his patient looked at his guard suddenly startled youre a new man arent you i mean i thought i knew all of you yes sir were often reassigned on short notice keeps all of us on our toes habitoriented anticipationit can lull anybody the psychiatrist continued across the pavement to where his armorplated car was usually waiting for him it was a different vehicle this isnt my car he said bewildered get in ordered his guard politely opening the door what a pair of hands from inside the car grabbed him and a uniformed man pulled him into the backseat as the guard followed sandwiching panov between them the two men held the psychiatrist as the one who had been inside yanked mos seersucker jacket off his shoulder and shoved up the short sleeve of his summer shirt he plunged a hypodermic needle into panovs arm good night doctor said the soldier with the insignia of the medical corps on the lapels of his uniform call new york he added the air france from martinique circled orly airport in the early evening haze over paris it was five hours and twentytwo minutes behind schedule because of the severe weather patterns in the caribbean as the pilot entered his final approach the flight officer acknowledged their clearance to the tower then switched to his prescribed sterile frequency and sent a last message in french to an off limits communications room deuxième special cargo please instruct your interested party to go to his designated holding area thank you out instructions received and relayed was the terse reply out the special cargo in question sat in the left rear bulkhead seat in the firstclass section of the aircraft the seat beside him was unoccupied on orders of the deuxième bureau in cooperation with washington impatient annoyed and unable to sleep because of the constricting bandage around his neck bourne close to exhaustion reflected on the events of the past nineteen hours to put it mildly they had not gone as smoothly as conklin had anticipated the deuxième had balked for over six hours as phone calls went back and forth feverishly between washington paris and finally vienna virginia the stumbling block and it was more of a hard rock was the cias inability to spell out the covert operation in terms of one jason bourne for only alexander conklin could release the name and he refused to do so knowing that the jackals penetrations in paris extended to just about everywhere but the kitchens of the tour dargent finally in desperation and realizing it was lunchtime in paris alex placed ordinary unsafe overseas telephone calls to several cafés on the rive gauche finding an old deuxième acquaintance at one on the rue de vaugirard do you remember the tinamou and an american somewhat younger than he is now who made things a little simpler for you ah the tinamou the bird with hidden wings and ferocious legs they were such better days younger days and if the somewhat older american was at the time given the status of a saint i shall never forget him dont now i need you it is you alexander it is and ive got a problem with d bureau it is solved and it was but the weather was insoluble the storm that had battered the central leeward islands two nights before was only a prelude to the torrential rain and winds that swept up from the grenadines with another storm behind it the islands were entering the hurricane season so the weather was not astonishing it was merely a delaying factor finally when clearance for takeoff was around the chronological corner it was discovered that there was a malfunction in the far starboard engine no one argued while the problem was traced found and repaired the elapsed time however was an additional three hours except for the churning of his mind the flight itself was uneventful for jason only his guilt interfered with his thoughts of what was before himparis argenteuil a café with the pro vocative name of le coeur du soldat the soldiers heart the guilt was most painful on the short flight from montserrat to martinique when they passed over guadeloupe and the island of basseterre he knew that only a few thousand feet below were marie and his children preparing to fly back to tranquility isle to the husband and father who would not be there his infant daughter alison would of course know nothing but jamie would his wide eyes would grow larger and cloud over as words tumbled out about fishing and swimming and mariechrist i cant think about her it hurts too much shed think he had betrayed her run away to seek a violent confrontation with an enemy from long ago in another faroff life that was no longer their life she would think like old fontaine who had tried to persuade him to take his family thousands of miles away from where the jackal prowled but neither of them understood the aging carlos might die but on his deathbed he would leave a legacy a bequest that would hinge on the mandatory death of jason bournedavid webb and his family im right marie try to understand me i have to find him i have to kill him we cant live in our personal prison for the rest of our lives monsieur simon said the stoutish welltailored frenchman an older man with a closecropped white chin beard pronouncing the name seemohn thats right replied bourne shaking the hand extended to him in a narrow deserted hallway somewhere in orly airport i am bernardine françois bernardine an old colleague of our mutual friend alexander the saint alex mentioned you said jason smiling tentatively not by name of course but he told me you might bring up his sainthood it was how id know you werehis colleague how is he we hear stories of course bernardine shrugged banal gossip by and large wounded in the futile vietnam alcohol dismissed disgraced brought back a hero of the agency so many contradictory things most of them true hes not afraid to admit that hes a cripple now and he doesnt drink and he was a hero i know i see again stories rumors who can believe what flights of fancy out of beijing hong kongsome concerning a man named jason bourne ive heard them yes of course but now paris our saint said you would need lodgings clothes purchased en scène as it were french to the core a small but varied closet agreed jason i know where to go what to buy and i have sufficient money then we are concerned with lodgings a hotel of your choice la trémoille george cinq plazaathénée smaller much smaller and far less expensive money is a problem then not at all only appearances ill tell you what i know montmartre ill find a place myself what i will need is a carregistered under another name preferably a name thats a dead end which means a dead man its been arranged it is in the underground garage on the capucines near the place vendôme bernardine reached into his pocket pulled out a set of keys and handed them to jason an older peugeot in section e there are thousands like them in paris and the license number is on the tab alex told you im traveling deep he didnt really have to i believe our saint scoured the cemeteries for useful names when he worked here i probably learned it from him we all learned things from that extraordinary mind the finest in our profession yet so selfeffacing so je ne sais quoi so why not try it yes yes why not try it i must tell you though said bernardine laughing he once chose a name admittedly from a tombstone that drove the sûreté foucrazy it was the alias of an ax murderer the authorities had been hunting for months that is funny agreed bourne chuckling yes very he told me later that he found it in rambouilletin a cemetery on the outskirts of rambouillet rambouillet the cemetery where alex had tried to kill him thirteen years ago all traces of a smile left jasons lips as he stared at alexs friend from the deuxième bureau you know who i am dont you he asked softly yes answered bernardine it was not so difficult to piece together not with the rumors and the gossip out of the far east after all it was here in paris where you made your mark on europe mr bourne does anyone else know mon dieu non nor will they i must explain i owe my life to alexander conklin our modest saint of les opérations noiresthe black assignments in your language thats not necessary i speak french fluently or didnt alex tell you that oh my god you doubt me said the deuxième man his gray eyebrows arched take into account young manyounger manthat i am in my seventieth year and if i have lapses of language and try to correct them it is because i mean to be kind not subreptice daccord je regrette i mean that bien alex is several years younger than i am but i wonder how hes handling it the age that is same as you badly there was an english poeta welsh poet to be exactwho wrote do not go gently into that good night do you remember it yes his name was dylan thomas and he died in his midthirties he was saying fight like a son of a bitch dont give in i mean to do that bernardine again reached into a pocket and pulled out a card here is my officemerely consultant status you understandand on the back ive written down my home phone it is a special telephone actually unique call me whatever you need will be provided remember i am the only friend you have in paris no one else knows you are here may i ask you a question mais certainement how can you do the things youre doing for me when for all intents and purposes youve been put out to pasture ah exclaimed the consultant to the deuxième bureau the younger man grows older like alex i carry my credentials in my head i know the secrets how is it otherwise you could be taken out neutralizedhave an accident stupide young man what is in both our heads we say is written down locked away to be revealed should such unnatural acts occur of course its all nonsense for what do we really know that could not be denied labeled as the ramblings of old men but they do not know that fear monsieur it is the most potent weapon in our profession second of course is embarrassment but that is usually reserved for the soviet kgb and your federal bureau of investigation both of which fear embarrassment more than their nations enemies you and conklin come from the same street dont you but of course to the best of my knowledge neither of us has a wife or a family only sporadic lovers to fill our beds and loud annoying nephews and nieces to fill our flats on certain holidays no really close friends except now and then an enemy we respect who for all we know and in spite of our truce might shoot us or poison us with a drink we must live alone you see for we are the professionalswe have nothing to do with the normal world we merely use it as a couvertureas we slink around in dark alleys paying or compromising people for secrets that mean nothing where summit conferences are concerned then why do you do it why not walk away if its so useless its in the blood rushing through our veins weve been trained beat the enemy in the deadly gamehe takes you or you take him and it is better that you take him thats dumb but of course its all dumb so why does jason bourne go after the jackal here in paris why doesnt he walk away and say enough complete protection is yours for the asking sos prison can you get me out of here and into the city ill find a hotel and be in touch with you before you are in touch with me reach alex what alex wants you to call him something happened wheres a phone not now two oclock washington time you have well over an hour he wont be back before then did he say what it was i think hes trying to find out he was very upset the room at the pontroyal on the rue montalembert was small and in a secluded corner of the hotel reached by taking the slow noisy brass elevator to the top floor and walking down two narrow intersecting hallways all of which was satisfactory to bourne it reminded him of a mountain cave remote and secure to chew up the minutes before calling alex he walked along the nearby boulevard saintgermain making necessary purchases various toiletries joined several articles of clothing casual denims called for summer shirts and a lightweight safari jacket dark socks required tennis shoes to be scuffed and soiled whatever he could supply himself now would save time later fortunately there was no need to press old bernardine for a weapon during the drive into paris from orly the frenchman had opened the glove compartment of his car in silence withdrawn a taped brown box and handed it to jason inside was an automatic with two boxes of shells underneath neatly layered were thirty thousand francs in varying denominations roughly five thousand dollars american tomorrow i will arrange a method for you to obtain funds whenever necessary within limits of course no limits bourne had contradicted ill have conklin wire you a hundred thousand and then another hundred after that if its necessary you just tell him where of contingency funds no mine thanks for the gun with both his hands holding the looped strings of shopping bags he headed back to montalembert and the hotel in a few minutes it would be two in the afternoon in washington eight at night in paris as he walked rapidly down the street he tried not to think about alexs newsan impossible demand on himself if anything had happened to marie and the children hed go out of his mind yet what could have happened they were back on tranquility by now and there was no safer place for them there was not he was sure of that as he entered the old elevator and lowered the bags in his right hand so as to push the number of his floor and remove the hotel key from his pocket there was a stinging sensation in his neck he gaspedhe had moved too fast stretched the gut of a suture perhaps he felt no warm trickle of blood it was merely a warning this time he rushed down the two narrow corridors to his room unlocked the door threw the shopping bags on the bed and rapidly took the three necessary steps to the desk and the telephone conklin was true to his word the phone in vienna virginia was picked up on the first ring alex its me what happened marie no interrupted conklin curtly i spoke to her around noon she and the kids are back at the inn and shes ready to kill me she doesnt believe a word i told her and im going to erase the tape i havent heard that kind of language since the mekong delta shes upset so am i broke in alex not bothering to make light of bournes understatement mos disappeared what you heard me panovs gone vanished my god how he was guarded every minute were trying to piece it together thats where i was over at the hospital hospital walter reed he was in a psych session with a military this morning and when it was over he never came out to his detail they waited twenty minutes or so then went in to find him and his escort because he was on a tight schedule they were told he left thats crazy it gets crazier and scarier the head floor nurse said an army doctor a surgeon came to the desk showed his id and instructed her to tell dr panov that there was a change of routing for him that he was to use the eastwing exit because of an expected protest march at the main entrance the east wing has a different hallway to the psych area than the one to the main lobby yet the army surgeon used the main doors come again he walked right past our escort in the hallway and obviously out the same way and around to the eastwing hall nothing onscene unusual a doctor with clearance in a restricted area in and out and while hes in he delivers false instructions but christ alex who carlos was on his way back here to paris whatever he wanted in washington he got he found me he found us he didnt need any more desole said conklin quietly desole knew about me and mo panov i threatened the agency with both of us and desole was there in the conference room im not with you what are you telling me desole brussels medusa all right im slow its not he david its they desole was taken out our connection removed its medusa to hell with them theyre on my back burner youre not on theirs you cracked their shell they want you i couldnt care less i told you yesterday ive only got one priority and hes in paris square one in argenteuil then i havent been clear said alex his voice faint the tone defeated last night i had dinner with mo i told him everything tranquility your flying to paris bernardine everything a former judge of the first circuit court residing in boston massachusetts united states of america stood among the small gathering of mourners on the flat surface of the highest hill on tranquility isle the cemetery was the final resting placein voce verbatim via amicus curiae as he legally explained to the authorities on montserrat brendan patrick pierre prefontaine watched as the two splendid coffins provided by the generous owner of tranquility inn were lowered into the ground along with the absolutely incomprehensible blessings of the native priest who no doubt usually had the neck of a dead chicken in his mouth while intoning his benediction in voodoo language jean pierre fontaine and his wife were at peace nevertheless barbarism notwithstanding brendan the quasialcoholic street lawyer of harvard square had found a cause a cause beyond his own survival and that in itself was remarkable randolph gates lord randolph of gates dandy randy of the courts of the elite was in reality a scumball a conduit of death in the caribbean and the outlines of a scheme were forming in prefontaines progressively clearer mind clearer because among other inhumane deprivations he had suddenly decided to do without his four shots of vodka upon waking up in the morning gates had provided the essential information that led the wouldbe killers of the webb family to tranquility isle why that was basically even legally irrelevant the fact that he had supplied their whereabouts to known killers with prior knowledge that they were killers was not that was accomplice to murder multiple murder dandy randys testicles were in a vise and as the plates closed he wouldhe had toreveal information that would assist the webbs especially the glorious auburnheaded woman he wished to almighty god he had met fifty years ago prefontaine was flying back to boston in the morning but he had asked john st jacques if he might return one day perhaps not with a prepaid reservation judge my house is your house was the reply i might even earn that courtesy albert armbruster chairman of the federal trade commission got out of his limousine and stood on the pavement before the steep steps of his town house in georgetown check with the office in the morning he said to the chauffeur holding the rear door as you know im not a well man yes sir the driver closed the door would you like assistance sir hell no get out of here yes sir the government chauffeur climbed into the front seat the sudden roar of his engine was not meant as a courteous exit as he sped down the street armbruster climbed the stone staircase his stomach and chest heaving with each step cursing under his breath at the sight of his wifes silhouette beyond the glass door of their victorian entrance shitkicking yapper he said to himself as he neared the top gripping the railing before facing his adversary of thirty years a spit exploded out of the darkness from somewhere within the grounds of the property next door armbrusters arms flew up his wrists bent as if trying to locate the bodily chaos it was too late the chairman of the federal trade commission tumbled back down the stone staircase his thumping dead weight landing grotesquely on the pavement below bourne changed into the french denim trousers slipped on a dark shortsleeved shirt and the cotton safari jacket put his money his weapon and all his idsauthentic and falseinto his pockets and left the pontroyal before doing so however he stuffed the bed with pillows and hung his traveling clothes in clear view over the chair he walked casually past the ornate front desk and once outside on montalembert ran to the nearest telephone kiosk he inserted a coin and dialed bernardines home its simon he said i thought so replied the frenchman i was hoping so ive just heard from alex and told him not to tell me where you were one cannot reveal what one does not know still if i were you id go to another place at least for the night you may have been spotted at the airport what about you i intend to be a canard a duck the sitting variety the deuxième has my flat under watch perhaps ill have a visitor it would be convenient nestce pas you didnt tell your office about about you interrupted bernardine how could i monsieur when i dont know you my protective bureau believes i had a threatening call from an old adversary known to be a psychopath actually i removed him in the maritimes years ago but i never closed the file should you be telling me this on your telephone i thought i mentioned that it was a unique instrument you did suffice it to say it cannot be tapped and still function you need rest monsieur you are no good to anyone least of all yourself without it find a bed i cannot help you there rest is a weapon said jason repeating a phrase he had come to believe was a vital truth vital for survival in a world he loathed i beg your pardon nothing ill find a bed and call you in the morning tomorrow then bonne chance mon ami for both of us he found a room at the avenir an inexpensive hotel on the rue gaylussac registering under a false name promptly forgotten he climbed the stairs to his room removed his clothes and fell into the bed rest is a weapon he said to himself staring at the ceiling at the flickering lights of the paris streets as they traveled across the plaster whether rest came in a mountain cave or a rice paddy in the mekong delta it did not matter it was a weapon frequently more powerful than firepower that was the lesson drummed into his head by danjou the man who had given his life in a beijing forest so that jason bourne might live rest is a weapon he considered touching the bandage around his neck yet not really feeling it its constricting presence fading as sleep came he woke up slowly cautiously the noise of the traffic in the streets below pounding up to his window the metallic horns like the erratic cawing of angry crows amid the irregular bursts of angry engines full bore one moment abrupt quiet the next it was a normal morning in the narrow streets of paris holding his neck rigid jason swung his legs to the floor from the inadequate bed and looked at his watch startled at what he saw wondering for an instant whether he had adjusted the watch for paris time of course he had it was in the morningparis time he had slept nearly eleven hours a fact confirmed by the rumbling in his stomach exhaustion was now replaced by acute hunger food however would have to wait there were things to take care of and first on the list was to reach bernardine and then to learn the security status of the pontroyal hotel he got to his feet stiffly unsteadily numbness momentarily invading his legs and arms he needed a hot shower which was not to be had at the avenir then mild exercise to limber up his body therapies unnecessary only a few years ago he removed his wallet from his trousers pulled out bernardines card and returned to the bed to use the telephone beside it he dialed le canard had no visitors im afraid said the deuxième veteran not even the hint of a hunter which i presume is favorable news its not until we find panovif we find him the bastards yes that must be faced its the ugliest part of our work goddamn it i cant dismiss a man like mo with that must be faced im not asking you to im only remarking upon the reality your feelings are meaningful to you but they dont change reality i did not mean to offend you and i didnt mean to mouth off sorry its just that hes a very special person i understand what are your plans what do you need i dont know yet answered bourne ill pick up the car in the capucines and an hour or so later ill know more will you be home or at the deuxième bureau until i hear from you i will stay in my flat and near my very unique telephone under the circumstances i prefer that you do not call me at the office thats an astonishing statement i dont know everyone these days at the deuxième and at my age caution is not merely the better part of valor its frequently a substitute besides to call off my protection so swiftly might generate rumors of senility speak to you later mon ami jason replaced the phone tempted to pick it up again and reach the pontroyal but this was paris the city of discretion where hotel clerks were loath to give information over the telephone and would refuse to do so with guests they did not know he dressed quickly went down to pay his bill and walked out onto the rue gaylussac there was a taxi stand at the corner eight minutes later he walked into the lobby of the pontroyal and up to the concierge je mappelle monsieur simon he said to the man giving his room number i ran into a friend last night he continued in flawless french and i stayed at her place would you know if anyone came around looking for me perhaps asking for me bourne removed several large franc notes his eyes telling the man he would pay generously for confidentiality or even describing someone like me he added softly merci bien monsieur i understand i will check further with the night concierge but im sure he would have left a note for my personal attention if someone had come here seeking you why are you so sure because he did leave such a note for me to speak with you ive been calling your room since seven oclock this morning when i came on duty what did the note say asked jason his breathing on hold its what im to say to you reach his friend across the atlantic the man has been phoning all night i can attest to the accuracy of that monsieur the switchboard tells me that last call was less than thirty minutes ago thirty minutes ago said jason looking hard at the concierge and then at his watch its five am over there all night the hotel man nodded as bourne started for the elevator alex for christs sake what is it they told me youve been calling all are you at the hotel interrupted conklin quickly yes i am get to a public phone in the street and call me back hurry again the slow cumbersome elevator the faded ornate lobby now half filled with parisians talking manically many heading for the bar and their prenoon apéritifs and again the hot bright summer street outside and the maddening congested traffic where was a telephone he walked rapidly down the pavement toward the seinewhere was a phone there across the converging rue du bac a reddomed booth with posters covering the sides dodging the onslaught of automobiles and small trucks all with furious drivers he raced to the other side of the street and down to the booth he sped inside deposited a coin and after an agonizing few moments during which he explained that he was not calling austria the international operator accepted his att credit number and put the call through to vienna virginia why the hell couldnt i talk from the hotel asked bourne angrily i called you last night from there that was last night not today any news about mo nothing yet but they may have made a mistake we may have a line on the army doctor break him with pleasure ill take off my foot and smash his face with it until he begs to cooperateif the line on him is rumb thats not why youve been calling me all night though is it no i was with peter holland for five hours yesterday i went over to see him after we talked and his reaction was exactly what i thought it would be with a few generous broadsides in the bargain medusa yes he insists you fly back immediately youre the only one with direct knowledge its an order bullshit he cant insist i do anything much less give me an order he can cut you off and i cant do anything about it if you need something in a hurry he wont deliver bernardines offered to help whatever you need those were his words bernardines limited like me he can call in debts but without access to the machine hes too restricted did you tell holland im writing down everything i know every statement that was made to me every answer to every question i asked are you i will he doesnt buy it he wants to question you he says he cant question pages of paper im too close to the jackal i wont do it hes an unreasonable son of a bitch i think he wanted to be reasonable said conklin he knows what youre going through what youve been through but after seven oclock last night he closed the doors why armbruster was shot to death outside his house theyre calling it a georgetown robbery which of course it isnt and wasnt oh jesus there are a couple of other things you ought to know to begin with were releasing swaynes suicide for gods sake why to let whoever killed him think hes off the hook and more important to see who shows up during the next week or so at the funeral no thats a closed family affair no guests no formal ceremony then whos going to show up where at the estate in one form or another we checked with swaynes attorney very officially of course and he confirmed what swaynes wife told you about his leaving the whole place to a foundation which one asked bourne one youve never heard of funded privately a few years ago by wealthy close friends of the august wealthy general its as touching as can be it goes under the title of the soldiers sailors and marines retreat the board of directors is already in place medusans or their surrogates well see alex what about the names i gave you the six or seven names flannagan gave me and that slew of license plate numbers from their meetings cute real cute said conklin enigmatically whats cute take the namestheyre the dregs of the wingding social set no relation to the georgetown upper crust theyre out of the national enquirer not the washington post but the licenses the meetings thats got to be the ball of wax even cuter observed alex a ball of sheep dip every one of those licenses is registered to a limousine company read that companies i dont have to tell you how authentic the names would be even if we had the dates to trace them theres a cemetery out there where is it how big how small there are twentyeight acres start looking and advertise what we know youre right youre playing it right alex tell holland you couldnt reach me youre joking no i mean it ive got the concierge i can cover give holland the hotel and the name and tell him to call himself or send over whoever he likes from the embassy to verify the concierge will swear i checked in yesterday and he hasnt seen me since even the switchboard will confirm it buy me a few days please holland could still pull all the plugs and probably will he wont if he thinks ill come back when you find me i just want him to keep looking for mo and keep my name out of paris good or bad no webb no simon no bourne ill try was there anything else ive got a lot to do yes casset is flying over to brussels in the morning hes going to nail teagartenhim we cant allow and it wont touch you agreed on a side street in anderlecht three miles south of brussels a military sedan bearing the flags of a fourstar general officer pulled up to the curb in front of a sidewalk café general james teagarten commander of nato his tunic emblazoned with five rows of ribbons stepped gingerly out of the car into the bright early afternoon sunlight he turned and offered his hand to a stunning wac major who smiled her thanks as she climbed out after him gallantly with military authority teagarten released the womans hand and took her elbow he escorted her across the wide pavement toward a cluster of umbrellatopped tables behind a row of flowering planter boxes that was the alfresco section of the café they reached the entrance a latticework archway profusely covered with baby roses and walked inside all the tables were occupied save one at the far end of the enclosed pavement the hum of luncheon conversation was punctuated by the tinkling of wine bottles gently touching wineglasses and the delicate clatter of utensils lowered on china plates the decibel level of the conversation was suddenly reduced and the general aware that his presence inevitably brought stares amiable waves and not infrequently mild applause smiled benignly at no one in particular and yet at everyone as he guided his lady to the deserted table where a small folded card read réservé the owner with two waiters trailing behind him like anxious egrets practically flew between the tables to greet his distinguished guest when the commander was seated a chilled bottle of cortoncharlemagne was presented and the menu discussed a young belgian child a boy of five or six walked shyly up to the table and brought his hand to his forehead he smiled and saluted the general teagarten rose to his feet standing erect and saluted the child back vous etes un soldat distingué mon camarade said the general his commanding voice ringing through the sidewalk café his bright smile winning the crowd who responded with appreciative applause the child retreated and the meal continued a leisurely hour later teagarten and his lady were interrupted by the generals chauffeur a middleaged army sergeant whose expression conveyed his anxiety the commander of nato had received an urgent message over his vehicles secure phone and the chauffeur had had the presence of mind to write it down and repeat it for accuracy he handed teagarten the note the general stood up his tanned face turning pale as he glanced around the nowhalfempty sidewalk café his eyes narrowed angry afraid he reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded wad of belgian franc notes peeled off several large ones and dropped them on the table come on he said to the woman major lets go youhe turned to his driverget the car started what is it asked his luncheon companion london over the wire armbruster and desole are dead oh my god how it doesnt matter whatever they say is a lie whats happening i dont know i just know were getting out of here come on the general and his lady rushed through the latticework archway across the wide pavement and into the military vehicle on either side of the hood something was missing the middle aged sergeant had removed the two redandgold flags denoting the impressive rank of his superior the commander of nato the car shot forward traveling less than fifty yards when it happened a massive explosion blew the military vehicle into the sky shards of glass and metal pieces of flesh and streaks of blood filling the narrow street in anderlecht monsieur cried the petrified waiter as crews of police firemen and sanitation workers went about their grisly business in the road what is it replied the distraught owner of the sidewalk café still shaking from the harsh interrogation he had gone through by the police and the descending hordes of journalists i am ruined we will be known as the café de la mort the restaurant of death monsieur look the waiter pointed at the table where the general and his lady had sat the police have gone over it said the disconsolate owner no monsieur now across the glass top of the table the capital letters scrawled in glistening red lipstick was a name jason bourne stunned marie stared at the television set at the satellite news program beamed from miami then she screamed as a camera moved in on a glass table in a town called anderlecht in belgium and the name printed in red across the top johnny st jacques burst through the bedroom door of the suite he had built for himself on the second floor of tranquility inn christ what is it tears streaming down her face marie pointed in horror at the set the announcer on the overseas feed was speaking in the monotonic drone peculiar to such satellite transmissions as if a bloodstained savage from the past had returned to terrorize civilized society the infamous killer jason bourne second only to carlos the jackal in the assassin forhire market has claimed responsibility for the explosion that took the lives of general james teagarten and his companions conflicting reports have come from washington and london intelligence circles and police authorities sources in washington claim that the assassin known as jason bourne was hunted down and killed in hong kong five years ago in a joint britishamerican operation however spokesmen for both the foreign office and british intelligence deny any knowledge of such an operation and say that a joint effort as was described is highly unlikely still other sources these from interpols headquarters in paris have stated that their branch in hong kong knew of the supposed death of jason bourne but as the widely circulated reports and photographs were so sketchy and unidentifiable they did not give much credence to the story they assumed as was also reported that bourne disappeared into the peoples republic of china for a last contract fatal to himself all thats clear today is that in the quaint city of anderlecht in belgium general james teagarten commander of nato was assassinated and someone calling himself jason bourne has taken credit for killing this great and popular soldier we now show you an old composite photograph from interpols files produced by a consensus of those who purportedly had seen bourne at close range remember this is a composite the features put together separately from scores of other photographs and considering the killers reputation for changing his appearance probably not of great value the screen was suddenly filled with the face of a man somewhat irregular and lacking definition its not david said john st jacques it could be bro said his sister and now to other news the drought that has plagued large areas of ethiopia turn that goddamned thing off shouted marie lurching out of the chair and heading for the telephone as her brother switched off the set wheres conklins number i wrote it down here on your desk somewhere here it is on the blotter saint alex has a hell of a lot to explain that son of a bitch she dialed angrily but accurately sitting in st jacquess chair tapping her clenched fist as the tears continued to roll down her cheeks tears of sorrow and fury its me you bastard youve killed him you let him gohelped him to goand youve killed him i cant talk to you now marie said a cold controlled alexander conklin ive got paris on the other line screw paris where is he get him out believe me were trying to find him all fucking hell has broken out here the british want peter hollands ass for even hinting at a far east connection and the french are in an up roar over something they cant figure out but suspect like special deuxième cargo on a plane from martinique which was originally rejected ill call you back i swear it the line was disconnected and marie slammed down the phone im flying to paris johnny she said breathing deeply and wiping the tears from her face youre what you heard me bring mrs cooper over here jamie loves her and shes better with alison than i could ever beand why not shes had seven children all grown up who still come back to her every sunday youre crazy i wont let you somehow said marie giving her brother a withering look i have an idea you probably said something like that to david when he told you he was going to paris yes i did and you couldnt stop him any more than you can stop me but why because i know every place he knows in paris every street every café every alley from sacrécoeur to montmartre he has to use them and ill find him long before the deuxième or the sûreté the telephone rang marie picked it up i told you id call you right back said the voice of alex conklin bernardine has an idea that might work whos bernardine an old deuxième colleague and a good friend whos helping david whats his idea he got jasondavida rental car he knows the licenseplate number and is having it radioed to all the paris police patrols to report it if seen but not to stop the car or harass the driver simply keep it in sight and report directly to him and you think davidjasonwont spot something like that youve got a terrible memory worse than my husbands its only one possibility there are others such as well well hes bound to call me when he hears the news about teagarten hes got to call me why like you say to get him out with carlos in the offing fat chance fathead ive got a better idea im flying to paris you cant i dont want to hear that anymore i wont hear that anymore are you going to help me or do i do it by myself i couldnt get a postage stamp from a dispensing machine in france and holland couldnt get the address of the eiffel tower then im on my own which frankly under the circumstances makes me feel a lot safer what can you do marie i wont give you a litany but i can go to all those places he and i went to used when we were running hell use them again somehow some way he has to because in your crazy jargon they were secure and in his crazy frame of mind hell return to them because he knows theyre secure god bless favorite lady he abandoned us alex god doesnt exist prefontaine walked through the terminal at bostons logan airport to the crowded platform and raised his hand to hail a cab but after looking around he lowered his hand and stood in line things had changed in thirty years everything including airports had become cafeterias one stood in line for a plate of thirdrate mulligan stew as well as for a taxi the ritzcarlton said the judge to the driver you haind got no luggage asked the man nudding but dliddle bag no i do not replied prefontaine and unable to resist a followup added i keep wardrobes wherever i go tuttifruitee said the driver removing an outsized widetoothed comb from his hair as he swung out into the traffic you have a reservation sir asked the tuxedoed clerk behind the counter at the ritz i trust one of my law clerks made it for me the names scofield justice william scofield of the supreme court id hate to think that the ritz had lost a reservation especially these days when everyones screaming for consumer protection justice scofield im sure its here somewhere sir i specifically requested suite threec im sure its in your computer threec its booked what no no im wrong mr justice they havent arrived i mean its an error theyre in another suite the clerk pounded his bell with ferocity bellboy bellboy no need for that young fella i travel light just give me the key and point me in the right direction yes sir i trust youve got a few bottles of decent whisky up there as usual if theyre not they will be mr justice any particular brands good rye good bourbon and good brandy the white stuff is for sissies right right sir right away sir twenty minutes later his face washed and a drink in his hand prefontaine picked up the phone and dialed dr randolph gates the gates residence said the woman on the line oh come on edie id know your voice under water and its been almost thirty years i know yours too but i simply cant place it try a rough adjunct professor at the law school who kept beating the hell out of your husband which made no impression upon him and he was probably right because i ended up in jail the first of the local judges to be put away and rightfully so brendan dear god its you i never believed all those things they said about you believe my sweet they were true but right now i have to speak to the lord of the gates is he there i suppose he is i dont really know he doesnt speak to me very much anymore things are not well my dear id love to talk to you brendan hes got a problem a problem i never knew about i suspect he has edie and of course well talk but at the moment i have to speak with him right now ill call him on the intercom dont tell him its me edith tell him its a man named blackburne from the island of montserrat in the caribbean what do as i say dear edie its for his sake as well as yoursperhaps more for you if truth were told hes sick brendan yes he is lets try to make him well get him on the line for me ill put you on hold the silence was interminable the two minutes more like two hours until the graveled voice of randolph gates exploded on the line who are you whispered the celebrated attorney relax randy its brendan edith didnt recognize my voice but i sure remembered hers youre one lucky fellow what do you want whats this about montserrat well i just came back from there you what i decided i needed a vacation you didnt gatess whisper was now essentially a cry of panic oh but i did and because i did your whole life is going to change you see i ran into the woman and her two children that you were so interested in remember them its quite a story and i want to tell it to you in all its fascinating detail you set them up to be killed dandy randy and thats a nono a dreadful nono i dont know what youre talking about ive never heard of montserrat or any woman with two children youre a desperate sniveling drunk and ill deny your insane allegations as the alcoholic fantasies of a convicted felon well done counselor but denying any allegations made by me isnt the core of your dilemma no thats in paris paris a certain man in paris someone i didnt realize was a living person but i learned otherwise its somewhat murky how it came about but a strange thing happened in montserrat i was mistaken for you you were what gates was barely audible his thin voice tremulous yes odd isnt it i imagine that when this man in paris tried to reach you here in boston someone told him your imperial presence was out or away and thats how the mixup began two brilliant legal minds both with an elusive connection to a woman and her two children and paris thought i was you what happened calm down randy at the moment he probably thinks youre dead what he tried to have me killedyou killed for transgression oh my god and when he finds out youre very much alive and eating well in boston he wont permit a second attempt to fail jesus christ there may be a way out dandy boy which is why you must come and see me incidentally im in the same suite at the ritz that you were in when i came to see you threec just take the elevator be here in thirty minutes and remember i have little patience with clients who abuse schedules for im a very busy man by the way my fee is twenty thousand dollars an hour or any part thereof so bring money randy lots of it in cash he was ready thought bourne studying himself in the mirror satisfied with what he saw he had spent the last three hours getting ready for his drive to argenteuil to a restaurant named le coeur du soldat the message center for a blackbird for carlos the jackal the chameleon had dressed for the environment he was about to enter the clothes were simple the body and the face less so the first required a trip to the secondhand stores and pawn shops in montmartre where he found faded trousers and a surplus french army shirt and an equally faded small combat ribbon that denoted a wounded veteran the second somewhat more complex demanded hair coloring a days growth of beard and another constricting bandage this bound around his right knee so tight he could not forget the limp he had quickly perfected his hair and eyebrows were now a dull reddirty unkempt red which fit his new surroundings a cheap hotel in montparnasse whose front desk wanted as little contact as possible with its clientele his neck was more an irritant now than an impediment either he was adjusting to the stiff restricted movement or the healing process was doing its mysterious work and that re stricted movement was not a liability where his current appearance was concerned in truth it was an asset an embittered wounded veteran a discarded son of france would be hard pressed to forget his dual immobility jason shoved bernardines automatic into his trousers pocket checked his money his car keys and his scabbarded hunting knife the latter purchased at a sporting goods store and strapped inside his shirt and limped to the door of the small filthy depressing room next stop the capucines and a nondescript peugeot in an underground garage he was ready out on the street he knew he had to walk a number of blocks before he found a taxi station cabs were not the fashion in this section of montparnasse neither was the commotion around a newspaper kiosk at the second corner people were shouting many waving their arms clutching papers in their fists anger and consternation in their voices instinctively he quickened his pace reached the stand threw down his coins and grabbed a newspaper the breath went out of him as he tried to suppress the shock waves that swept through him teagarten killed the assassin jason bourne jason bourne madness insanity what had happened was it a resurrection of hong kong and macao was he losing what was left of his mind was he in some nightmare so real he had entered its dimensions the horror of demented sleep the fantasy of conjured improvised terror turned into reality he broke away from the crowd reeled across the pavement and leaned against the stone wall of a building gasping for air his neck now in pain trying desperately to find a reasonable train of thought alex a telephone what happened he screamed into the mouthpiece to vienna virginia come down and stay cold said conklin in a low monotone listen to me i want to know exactly where you are bernardine will pick you up and get you out hell make the arrangements and put you on the concorde to new york wait a minutewait a minute the jackal did this didnt he from what were told it was a contract from a crazy jihad faction out of beirut theyre claiming it was their kill the actual executioner is unimportant that may be true and it may not at first i didnt buy it not after desole and armbruster but the numbers add up teagarten was forever sounding off about sending nato forces into lebanon and leveling every suspected palestinian enclave hes been threatened before its just that the medusa connection is too damned coincidental for me but to answer your question of course it was the jackal so he laid it on me carlos laid it on me hes an ingenious fucker ill say that for him you come after him and he uses a contract that freezes you in paris then we turn it around what the hell are you talking about you get out no way while he thinks im running hiding evadingim walking right into his nest youre nuts you get out while we can still get you out no i stay in number one he figures i have to in order to reach him but as you say hes locked me in ice he thinks that after all these years ill panic in my fashion and make stupid movesgod knows i made enough on tranquilitybut so stupid here that his army of old men will find me by looking in the right places and knowing what to look for christ hes good shake the bastard up so hell make a mistake i know him alex i know the way he thinks and ill outthink him ill stay on course no prolonged safe cave for me cave what cave a figure of speech forget it i was in place before the news of teagarten im okay youre not okay youre a fruitcake get out sorry saint alex this is exactly where i want to be im going after the jackal well maybe i can move you off that place youre clinging to i spoke to marie a couple of hours ago guess what you aging neanderthal shes flying to paris to find you she cant thats what i said but she wasnt in a listening mode she said she knew all the places you and she used when you were running from us thirteen years ago that youd use them again i have several but she mustnt tell her not me whats the tranquility number ive been afraid to call herto be honest ive tried like hell to put her and the kids out of my mind thats the most reasonable statement youve made here it is conklin recited the area code number and the instant he had done so bourne slammed down the phone frantically jason went through the agonizing process of relaying destination and credit card numbers accompanied by the beeps and stutters of an overseas call to the caribbean and finally after subduing some idiot at the front desk of tranquility inn got through to his brotherinlaw get marie for me he ordered david yes david get marie i cant shes gone she left an hour ago where to she wouldnt tell me she chartered a plane out of blackburne but she wouldnt tell me what international island she was going to theres only antigua or martinique around here but she could have flown to sint maarten or puerto rico shes on her way to paris couldnt you have stopped her christ i tried david goddamn it i tried did you ever think about locking her up marie i see what you mean she cant get here until tomorrow morning at the earliest have you heard the news cried st jacques general teagarten was killed and they say it was jason oh shut up said bourne replacing the phone and leaving the booth walking down the street to collect what thoughts he could generate peter holland director of the central intelligence agency rose to his feet behind his desk and roared at the crippled man seated in front of him do nothing have you lost your fucking senses did you lose yours when you issued that statement about a joint britishamerican operation in hong kong it was the goddamned truth there are truths and then again there are other truths such as denying the truth when it doesnt serve the service shit fairy politicians id hardly say that genghis khan ive heard of such men going to the wall accepting execution rather than betraying the current truth they had to live by youre off base peter exasperated holland sank back into his chair maybe i really dont belong here maybe you dont but give yourself a little more time maybe youll become as dirty as the rest of us it could happen you know the director leaned back arching his head over the chair he spoke in a broken cadence i was dirtier than any of you in the field alex i still wake up at night seeing the faces of young men staring at me as i ripped a knife up their chests taking their lives away somehow knowing that they had no idea why they were there it was either you or them they would have put a bullet in your head if they could have yes i suppose so the dci shot forward his eyes locked with conklins but thats not what were talking about is it you might say its a variation on the theme cut the horseshit its a musicians term i like music then get to the main symphonic line alex i like music too all right bournes disappeared he told me that he thinks hes found a cavehis word not minewhere hes convinced he can track the jackal he didnt say where it is and god knows when hell call me again i sent our man at the embassy over to the pontroyal asking for simon what they told you is true simon checked in went out and never came back where is he staying out of sight bernardine had an idea but it blew up in his face he thought he could quietly close in on bourne by circulating the license number of the rental car but it wasnt picked up at the garage and we both agree it wont be he doesnt trust anybody now not even me and considering his history he has every right not to hollands eyes were cold and angry youre not lying to me are you conklin why would i lie at a time like this about a friend like this thats not an answer its a question then no im not lying i dont know where he is and in truth alex did not so your idea is to do nothing theres nothing we can do sooner or later hell call me have you any idea what a senate investigating committee will say a couple of weeks or months down the road when all this explodes and it will explode we covertly send a man known to be jason bourne over to paris which is as close to brussels as new york is to chicago closer i think thanks i need that the illustrious commander of nato is assassinated with said jason bourne taking credit for the kill and we dont say a goddamned thing to anybody jesus ill be cleaning latrines on a tugboat but he didnt kill him you know that and i know that but speaking of his history theres a little matter of mental illness thatll come out the minute our clinical records are subpoenaed its called amnesia it has nothing to do with violence hell no its worse he cant remember what he did conklin gripped his cane his wandering eyes intense i dont give a goddamn what everything appears to be theres a gap every instinct i have tells me teagartens assassination is tied to medusa somehow somewhere the wires crossed a message was intercepted and a hell of a diversion was put in a game plan i believe i

testimony i can pull in burton on the joint chiefs and certainly atkinson in london no leave them alone watch them but dont sink their dinghies admiral like swaynes retreat the bees will flock to the honey sooner or later then what are you suggesting what i said when i came in here do nothing its the waiting game alex suddenly slammed his cane against the table son of a bitch its medusa it has to be the hairless old man with a wrinkled face struggled to his feet in a pew of the church of the blessed sacrament in neuillysurseine on the outskirts of paris step by difficult step he made his painful way to the second confessional booth on the left he pulled back the black curtain and knelt in front of the black latticework covered with black cloth his legs in agony angelus domini child of

frequencydetonated explosive apparently monseigneur we have learned nothing else but why why we cannot see into mens minds monseigneur across the atlantic ocean in an opulent apartment in brooklyn heights with the lights of the east river and the brooklyn bridge seductively pulsating beyond the windows a capo supremo lounged in an overstuffed couch a glass of perrier in his hand he spoke to his friend sitting across from him in an armchair drinking a gin and tonic the young man was slender darkhaired and striking you know frankie im not just bright im brilliant you know what i mean i pick up

back of the plane drinking coffee from a plastic cup trying desperately to recall every placeevery hiding and resting placeshe and david had used thirteen years ago there were the rockbottom cafés in montparnasse the cheap hotels as well and a motelwhere was itten miles outside of paris and an inn with a balcony in argenteuil where davidjasonfirst told her he loved her but could not stay with her because he loved herthe goddamned ass and there was the sacrécoeur far up on the steps where jasondavidmet the man in a dark alley who gave them the information they neededwhat was it who was he mesdames et messieurs came the voice over the flight decks loudspeaker jesuis votre capitaine bienvenu the pilot continued first in french then he and his crew repeated the in formation in english german italian and finally with a female interpreter in japanese we anticipate a very smooth flight to marseilles our estimated flight time is seven hours and fourteen minutes landing on or before schedule at six oclock in the morning paris time enjoy the moonlight outside bathed the ocean below as marie st jacques webb looked out the window she had flown to san juan puerto rico and taken the night flight to marseilles where french immigration was at best a mass of confusion and at worst intentionally lax at least that was the way it was thirteen years ago a time she was reentering she would then take a domestic flight to paris and she would find him as she had done thirteen years ago she would find him she had to as it had been thirteen years ago if she did not the man she loved was a dead man morris panov sat listlessly in a chair by a window looking out over the pasture of a farm somewhere he assumed in maryland he was in a small secondfloor bedroom dressed in a hospital nightshirt his bare right arm confirming the story he knew only too well he had been drugged repeatedly taken up to the moon in the parlance of those who usually administered such narcotics he had been mentally raped his mind penetrated violated his innermost thoughts and secrets brought chemically to the surface and exposed the damage he had done was incalculable he understood that what he did not understand was why he was still alive even more perplexing was why he was being treated so deferentially why was his guard with the foolish black mask so courteous the food plentiful and decent it was as if the present imperative of his captivity was to restore his strengthprofoundly sapped by the drugsand make him as comfortable as possible under the extraordinarily difficult circumstances why the door opened and his masked guard walked in a short heavyset man with a rasping voice panov placed somewhere in the northeastern united states or possibly chicago in another situation he might have appeared comic his large head too massive for the asinine lone ranger eyecovering which would certainly not impede instant identification however in the current state of affairs he was not comic at all his obsequiousness was in itself menacing over his left arm were the psychiatrists clothes okay doc you gotta get dressed i made sure everything was cleaned and pressed even the undershorts how about that you mean you have your own laundry and dry cleaners out here fuck no we take em over to oh no you dont get me that way doc the guard grinned with slightly yellowed teeth pretty smart huh you figure ill tell you where we are huh i was simply curious yeah sure like i got a nephew my sisters kid whos always simply curious askin me questions i dont wanna answer like hey unc howd you put me through medical school huh yeah hes a doctor like you what do you think of that id say his mothers brother is a very generous person yeah well wadda you gonna do huh come on put on the threads doc were going on a little trip the guard handed mo his clothes i suppose it would be foolish to ask where said panov getting out of the chair removing his hospital nightshirt and putting on his shorts very foolish i hope not as foolish as your nephew not telling you about a symptom you have that id find somewhat alarming if i were you mo casually pulled up his trousers wadda you talkin perhaps nothing replied panov putting on his shirt and sitting down to pull up his socks when did you last see your nephew a couple of weeks ago i put in some bread to cover his insurance shit those mothers are bleeders wadda you mean when did i last see the prick i just wondered if he said anything to you about what about your mouth mo laced his shoes and gestured with his head theres a mirror over the bureau go take a look at what the capo subordinato walked quickly to the mirror smile at what yourself see the yellow on your teeth the fading red of your gums and how the gums recede the higher they go so they always been like that it might be nothing but he should have spotted it spotted what for christs sake oral ameloblastoma possibly what the hell is that i dont brush too good and i dont like dentists theyre butchers you mean you havent seen a dentist or an oral surgeon in quite a while so the capo bared his teeth again in front of the mirror that could explain why your nephew didnt say anything why he probably figures you have regular dental checkups so let those people explain it to you shoes tied panov stood up i dont getcha well hes grateful for everything youve done for him appreciative of your generosity i can understand why hed hesitate telling you telling me what the guard spun away from the mirror i could be wrong but you really ought to see a periodontist mo put on his jacket im ready he said what do we do now the capo subordinato his eyes squinting his forehead creased in ignorance and suspicion reached into his pocket and pulled out a large black kerchief sorry doc but i gotta blindfold you is that so you can put a bullet in my head when mercifully i dont know its going to happen no doctor no bambam for you youre too valuable valuable asked the capo supremo rhetorically in his opulent living room in brooklyn heights like a gold mine just popped out of the ground and landed in your minestrone this jew has worked on the heads of some of the biggest lasagnas in washington his files have got to be worth the price of detroit youll never get them louis said the attractive middleaged man dressed in an expensive tropical worsted suit sitting across from his host theyll be sealed and carted off out of your reach well were working on that mr park avenue manhattan sayjust for laughssay we got em what are they worth to you the guest permitted himself a thin aristocratic smile detroit he replied va bene i like you you got a sense of humor as abruptly as he had grinned the mafioso became serious even ugly the five mill still holds for this bournewebb character right with a proviso i dont like provisos mr lawyer i dont like them at all we can go elsewhere youre not the only game in town let me explain something to you signor avvocato in a lot of ways weall of weare the only game in town we dont mess with other families hits you know what i mean our councils have decided hits are too personal it makes for bad blood will you listen to the proviso i dont think youll be offended shoot i wish youd use another word go ahead therell be a twomilliondollar bonus because we insist you include webbs wife and his government friend conklin done mr park avenue manhattan good now to the rest of our business i want to talk about the jew well get to him now please dont give orders to me said the attorney from one of wall streets most prestigious firms youre really not in a position to do that wop hey farabutto you dont talk to me like that ill talk to you any way i like on the outside and to your credit in negotiations youre a very masculine very macho fellow the lawyer calmly uncrossed and crossed his legs but the insides quite different isnt it youve got a soft heart or should i say hard loins for pretty young men silenzio the italian shot forward on the couch i have no wish to exploit the information on the other hand i dont believe gay rights are very high on the cosa nostras agenda do you you son of a bitch you know when i was a young army lawyer in saigon i defended a career lieutenant who was caught in flagrante delicto with a vietnamese boy a male prostitute obviously through legal maneuvers using ambiguous phrases in the military code regarding civilians i saved him from a dishonorable discharge but it was obvious that he had to resign from the service unfortunately he never went on to a productive life he shot himself two hours after the verdict you see hed become a pariah a disgrace before his peers and he couldnt handle the burden get on with your business said the capo supremo named louis his voice low and flat and filled with hatred thank you first i left an envelope on your foyer table it contains payment for armbrusters tragic confrontation in georgetown and teagartens equally tragic assassination in brussels according to the yid head doctor interrupted the mafioso you got two more they know about an ambassador in london and that admiral on the joint chiefs you wanna add another bonus possibly later not now they both know very little and nothing about the financial operations burton thinks that were essentially an ultraconservative veterans lobbying effort that grew out of the vietnam disgracelegally borderline for him but then he has strong patriotic feelings atkinsons a rich dilettante he does what hes told but he doesnt know why or by whom hed do anything to hold on to the court of saint jamess and has his only connection was with teagarten conklin hit pay dirt with swayne and armbruster teagarten and of course desole but the other two are window dressing quite respectable window dressing i wonder how it happened when i find out and i will find out ill let you know gratis oh the attorney raised his eyebrows how well get to it whats your other business two items both vital and the first ill give yougratis get rid of your current boyfriend he goes to places he shouldnt and throws money around like a cheap hoodlum were told he boasts about his connections in high places we dont know what else he talks about or what he knows or what hes pieced together but he concerns us id think hed concern you too il prostitute roared louis slamming his clenched fist down on the arm of the couch il pinguino hes dead i accept your thanks the other item is far more important certainly to us swaynes house in manassas a book was removed an office diary which swaynes lawyer in manassasour lawyer in manassascould not find it was on a bookshelf its binding identical with all the other books in that row the entire row on the shelf a person would have to know exactly which one to take so what do you want from me the gardener was your man he was put in place to do his job and he was given the only number we knew was totally secure namely desoles so to do his job to mount the suicide authentically he had to study swaynes every move you yourself explained that to me ad nauseam when you demanded your outrageous fee its not hard to picture your man peering through the window at swayne in his study the place where swayne supposedly would take his life gradually your man realizes that the general keeps taking a specific book from off his shelf writes in it and returns it to the same spot that has to intrigue him that particular book has to be valuable why wouldnt he take it i would you would so where is it the mafioso got slowly menacingly to his feet listen to me avvocato you gotta lot of fancy words that make for conclusions but we aint got no book like that and ill tell you how i can prove it if there was anything anywhere written down that could burn your ass id be shoving it in your face right now capisce thats not illogical said the welldressed attorney once again uncrossing and crossing his legs as the resentful capo sullenly returned to the couch flannagan added the wall street lawyer naturally of course flannagan he and his hairdresser bitch had to have their insurance policy no doubt with minor extortion in the bargain actually im relieved they could never use it without exposing themselves accept my apologies louis your business finished i believe so now the jew shrink what about him like i said hes a gold mine without his patients files less than twentyfour carat i think then you think wrong countered louis like i told armbruster before he became another big impediment for you we got doctors too specialists in all kinds of medical things including what they call motor responses and get this triggered mental recall under states of external controli remembered that one especially its a whole different kind of gun at your head only no blood i assume theres a point to this you can bet your country club on it were moving the jew to a place in pennsylvania a kind of nursing home where only the richest people go to get dried out or straightened out if ya know what i mean i believe i do advanced medical equipment superior staffwellpatrolled grounds yeah sure you do a lot of your crowd passes through go on interrupted the attorney looking at his gold rolex watch i havent much time make time for this according to my specialistsand i purposely used the word my if you follow meon a prearranged schedule say every fourth or fifth day the new patient is shot up to the moonthats the phrase they use its not mine christ knows between times hes been treated real good hes been fed the right neutermints or whatever they are given the proper exercise a lot of sleep and all the rest of that shit we should all be so careful of our bodies right avvocato some of us play squash every other day well youll forgive me mr park avenue manhattan but squash to me is zucchini and i eat it linguistic and cultural differences do crop up dont they yeah i cant fault you there consigliere hardly and my title is attorney give me time it could be consigliere theres not enough years in our lifetimes louis do you go on or do i leave i go on mr attorney so each time the jew shrink is shot up to that moon my specialist talks about hes in pretty good shape right i see the periodic remissions to normalcy but then im not a doctor i dont know what the fuck youre talking about but then im not a doctor either so ill take my specialists word for it you see every time hes shot up his mind is pretty clear inside and then hes fed name after name after name a lot maybe most wont mean a thing but every now and then one will and then another and another with each they start what they call a probe finding out bits and pieces of information just enough to get a sketch of the patient hes talking aboutjust enough to scare the shit out of that lasagna when hes reached remember these are stressful times and this hebe doctor treats some of the fattest cats in washington in and outside the government how does that grab you mr attorney its certainly unique replied the guest slowly studying the capo supremo his files of course would be infinitely preferable yeah well like i say were working on that but itll take time this is now immediato hell be in pennsylvania in a couple of hours you want to deal you and me over what something you dont have and may never get hey come on what do you think i am im sure you dont want to hear that cut the crap say in a day or so maybe a week we meet and i give you a list of names i think you might be interested in all of which we got information onlets say information not readily available you pick one or two or maybe none what can you lose were talkin spitballs anyway cause the deals between you and me only no one else is involved except my specialist and his assistant who dont know you and you dont know them a side arrangement as it were not as it were like it is depending on the information ill figure out the charge it may only be a thou or two or it may go to twenty or it may be gratis who knows id be fair because i want your business capisce its very interesting you know what my specialist says he says we could start our own cottage industry he called it snatch a dozen shrinks all with heavy government connections like in the senate or even the white house i understand fully interrupted the attorney getting to his feet but my times up bring me a list louis the guest walked toward the short marble foyer no fancy attaché case signor avvocato said the capo rising from the couch and upset the not so delicate mechanisms in your doorway hey its a violent world out there i wouldnt know about that the wall street attorney left and at the sound of the closing door louis rushed across the room to the inlaid queen anne desk and virtually pounced on the ivory french telephoneas usual tipping over the tall thin instrument twice before securing the stem with one hand while dialing with the other fucking swish horn he mumbled goddamned fairy decorator mario hello lou said the pleasant voice in new rochelle ill bet you called to wish anthony a happy birthday huh who my kid anthony hes fifteen today did you forget the whole familys out in the garden and we miss you cousin and hey lou what a garden this year im a real artist you also may be something else what buy anthony a present and send me the bill at fifteen maybe a broad hes ready for manhood lou youre too much there are other things theres only one thing now mario and i want the truth from your lips or ill carve them out of your face there was a brief pause from new rochelle before the pleasantsounding executioner spoke i dont deserve to be talked to that way cugino maybe maybe not there was a book taken from that generals place in manassas a very valuable book they found out it was missing huh holy shit you got it i had it lou it was going to be a present to you but i lost it you lost it what the fuck did you do leave it in a taxi no i was running for my life that maniac with the flares whats his name webb unloading at me in the driveway he grazed me and i fell and the lousy book flew out of my handjust as the police car arrived he picked it up and i ran like hell for the fence webbs got it i guess so christ on a trampoline anything else lou were about to light the candles on the cake yeah mario i may need you in washingtona big cannoli without a foot but with a book hey wait a minute cugino you know my rules always a month between business trips what did manassas take six weeks and last may in key west three almost four weeks i cant call i cant write a postcardno lou always a month i got responsibilities to angie and the children im not going to be an absentee parent theyve got to have a role model you know what i mean i got ozzie nelson for a fuckin cousin louis slammed down the phone and instantly grabbed it as it crashed over on the desk its delicate ivory stem displaying a crack the best hit man in the business and hes a freak mumbled the capo supremo as he dialed frantically when the line was picked up the anxiety and the anger disappeared from his voice it was not apparent but it had not gone away hello frankie baby hows my closest friend oh hi lou came the floating but hesitant languorous tones from an expensive apartment in greenwich village can i call you back in two minutes im just putting my mother into a cab to take her back to jersey okay sure kid two minutes mother the whore il pinguino louis walked to his mirrored marble bar with the pink angels flying over the lalique inset above the whisky bottles he poured himself a drink and took several calming swallows the bar phone rang yeah he said carefully picking up the fragile crystal instrument its me lou frankie i said goodbye to mama thats a good boy frankie never forget your mama oh i never do lou you taught me that you told me you gave your mama the biggest funeral they ever saw in east hartford yeah i bought the fuckin church man real nice real nice now lets get to something else real nice okay its been one of those days frankie lots of turmoil you know what i mean sure lou so i got an itch i gotta get some relief come on over here frankie as fast as a cab can take me lou prostituto it would be frankie the big mouths last service for him out on the street the welldressed attorney walked two blocks south and a block east to his waiting limousine parked beneath the canopy of another impressive residence in brooklyn heights his stocky chauffeur of middle years was talking pleasantly with the uniformed doorman whom he had generously tipped by now spotting his employer the driver walked rapidly to the limousines rear door and opened it several minutes later they were in traffic heading for the bridge in the quiet of the backseat the lawyer undid his alligator belt pressed the upper and lower rims of the buckle and a small cartridge fell out between his legs he picked it up and refastened the belt holding the cartridge up to the filtered light from the window he studied the miniaturized voiceactivated recording device it was an extraordinary machine tiny enough and with an acrylic mechanism that permitted it to fly through the most sophisticated detectors the attorney leaned forward in his seat and spoke to the driver william yes sir the chauffeur glanced up at his rearview mirror and saw his employers outstretched hand he reached back take this over to the house and put it on a cassette will you please right major the manhattan lawyer reclined in the seat smiling to himself louis would give him anything he wanted from now on a capo did not make side arrangements where the family was concerned to say nothing of acknowledging certain sexual preferences morris panov sat blindfolded in the front seat of the sedan with his guard his hands loosely almost courteously bound as if the capo subordinato felt he was following unnecessary orders they had been driving for about thirty minutes in silence when the guard spoke whats a perryohdentist he asked an oral surgeon a doctor trained to operate inside patients mouths on problems relating to teeth and gum tissue silence then seven minutes later what kind of problems any number of them from infections to scraping the roots to more complicated surgery usually in tandem with an oncologist silence four minutes later what was that lastthe tandyuncle stuff oral cancer if its caught in time it can be arrested with minor bone removal if not the entire jaw might have to go panov could feel the car briefly swerve as the driver momentarily lost control silence a minute and a half later the whole fuckin jaw half the face its either that or the whole of the patients life thirty seconds later you think i could have something like that im a doctor not an alarmist i merely noted a symptom i did not make a diagnosis so bullshit so make a dagassnossis im not qualified bullshit youre a doctor aint you i mean a real doctor not a fasullo who says he is but aint got no shingle thats legit if you mean medical school yes im that kind of doctor so look at me i cant im blindfolded panov suddenly felt the guards thick strong hand clawing at his head yanking the kerchief off him the dark interior of the automobile answered a question for mo how could anyone travel in a car with a blindfolded passenger in that car it was no problem except for the windshield the windows were not merely tinted they were damn near opaque which meant from the outside they were opaque no one could see inside go on look the capo subordinato his eyes on the road tilted his large head grotesquely toward panov his thick lips were parted and his teeth bared like those of a child playing monster in the mirror he shouted again so tell me what you see its too dark in here replied mo seeing essentially what he wanted to see in the front window they were on a country road so narrow and so country the next step lower was dirt wherever he was being taken he was being driven there by an extremely circuitous route open the fuckin window yelled the guard his head still twisted his eyes still on the road his gaping mouth approaching a caricature of orca the abouttovomit whale dont hold nothin back ill break every goddamn finger in that pricks hands he can do his fuckin surgery with his elbows i told that stupid sister of mine he was no fuckin good that fairy always readin books no action on the street yknow what i mean if youll stop shouting for a few seconds i can get a closer look said panov having lowered the window at his side seeing nothing but trees and the coarse underbrush of a distinctly backcountry road one he doubted was on too many maps there we are continued mo raising his loosely bound hands to the capos mouth his eyes however not on that mouth but on the road ahead oh my god cried panov what screamed the guard pus pockets of pus everywhere in the upper and lower mandibles the worst sign oh christ the car swerved wildly but it did not swerve enough a huge tree up ahead on the lefthand side of the deserted road morris panov surged his bound hands over to the wheel lifting his body off the seat as he propelled the steering wheel to the left then at the last second before the car hit the tree he hurled himself to the right curling into a fetal position for protection the crash was enormous shattered glass and crushed metal accompanied the rising mists of steam from burst cylinders and the growing fires of viscous fluids underneath that would soon reach a gas tank the guard was moaning semiconscious his face bleeding panov pulled him out of the wreck and into the grass as far as he could until exhaustion overtook him just before the car exploded in the moist overgrowth his breath somewhat restored but his fear still at the forefront mo released his loosely bound hands and picked the fragments of glass out of his guards face he then checked for broken bonesthe right arm and the left leg were candidatesand with stolen stationery from a hotel he had never heard of from the capos pocket he used the guards pen to write out his diagnosis among the items he removed was a gunwhat kind he had no ideabut it was heavy and too large for his pocket and sagged in his belt enough hippocrates had his limits panov searched the guards clothing astonished at the money that was theresome six thousand dollarsand the various drivers licensesfive different identities from five different states he took the money and the licenses to turn them over to alex conklin but he left the capos wallet otherwise intact there were photographs of his family his children grandchildren and assorted relativesand somewhere among them a young surgeon he had put through medical school ciao amico thought mo as he crawled over to the road stood up and smoothed his clothes trying to look as respectable as possible standing on the hard coarse surface common sense dictated that he continue north in the direction the car was heading to return south was not only pointless but conceivably dangerous suddenly it struck him good god did i just do what i just did he began to tremble the trained psychiatrically oriented part of him telling him it was posttraumatic stress bullshit you asshole it wasnt you he started walking and then kept walking and walking and walking he was not on a backcountry road he was on tobacco road there were no signs of civilization not a car in either direction not a housenot even the ruins of an old farmhouseor a primitive stone wall that would at least have proved that humans had visited the environs mile after mile passed and mo fought off the effects of the druginduced exhaustion how long had it been they had taken his watch his watch with the day and date in impossible small print so he had no idea of either the present time or the time that had elapsed since he had been taken from walter reed hospital he had to find a telephone he had to reach alex conklin something had to happen soon it did he heard the growing roar of an engine and spun around a red car was speeding up the road from the southno not speeding but racing with its accelerator flat on the floor he waved his arms wildlygestures of helplessness and appeal to no avail the vehicle rushed past him in a blur then to his delighted surprise the air was filled with dust and screeching brakes the car stopped he ran ahead as the automobile actually backed up the tires still screaming he remembered the words his mother incessantly repeated when he was a youngster in the bronx always tell the truth morris its the shield god gave us to keep us righteous panov did not precisely subscribe to the admonition but there were times when he felt it had socially interactive validity this might be one of them so somewhat out of breath he approached the opened passenger window of the red automobile he looked inside at the woman driver a platinum blonde in her midthirties with an overly madeup face and large breasts encased in décolletage more fitting to an xrated film than a backcountry road in maryland nevertheless his mothers words echoed in his ears so he spoke the truth i realize that i look rather shabby madam but i assure you its purely an exterior impression im a doctor and ive been in an accident get in for christs sake thank you so very much no sooner had mo closed the door than the woman slammed the car into gear gunned the engine to its maximum and seemingly launched off the rough pavement and down the road youre obviously in a hurry offered panov so would you be pal if you were me i gotta husband back there whos puttin his truck together to come after my ass oh really stupid fuckin jerk he rolls across the country three weeks outta the month layin every broad on the highways then blows his keister when he finds out i had a little fun of my own oh im terribly sorry youll be a hell of a lot sorrier if he catches up with us i beg your pardon you really a doctor yes i am maybe we can do business i beg your pardon can you handle an abortion morris panov closed his eyes bourne walked for nearly an hour through the streets of paris trying to clear his head ending up at the seine on the pont de solferino the bridge that led to the quai des tuileries and the gardens as he leaned against the railing absently watching the boats lazily plowing the waters below the question kept assaulting him why why why what did marie think she was doing flying over to paris it wasnt just foolish it was stupidyet his wife was neither a fool nor an idiot she was a very bright lady with reserves of control and a quick analytical mind that was what made her decision so untenable what could she possibly hope to accomplish she had to know he was far safer working alone rather than worrying about her while tracking the jackal even if she found him the risk was doubled for both of them and that she had to understand completely figures and projections were her profession so why there was only one conceivable answer and it infuriated him she thought he might slip back over the edge as he had done in hong kong where she alone had brought him to his senses to the reality that was uniquely his own a reality of frightening half truths and only partial remembrances episodic moments she lived with every day of their lives together god how he adored her he loved her so and the fact that she had made this foolish stupid untenable decision only fueled that love because it was soso giving so outrageously unselfish there were moments in the far east when he had craved his own death if only to expunge the guilt he felt at putting her in such dangerousuntenablepositions the guilt was still there always there but the aging man in him recognized another reality their children the cancer of the jackal had to be ripped out of all their lives couldnt she realize that and leave him alone no for she was not flying to paris to save his lifeshe had too much confidence in jason bourne for that she was coming to paris to save his mind ill handle it marie i can and will handle it bernardine he could do it the deuxième could find her at orly or de gaulle find her and take her put her under guard at a hotel and claim no one knew where he was jason ran from the pont de solferino to the quai des tuileries and to the first telephone he could find can you do it asked bourne shes only got one updated passport and its american not canadian i can try on my own answered bernardine but not with any help from the deuxième i dont know how much saint alex told you but at the moment my consultant status has been canceled and i think my desk has been thrown out the window shit merde to the triple mon ami the quai dorsay wants my underwear burned with me in it and were it not for certain information i possess regarding several members of the assembly they would no doubt revive the guillotine can you pass around some money at immigration it would be better if i acted in my former official capacity on the assumption that the deuxième does not so swiftly advertise its embarrassments her full name please marie elise st jacques webb ah yes i recall now at least the st jacques broke in bernardine the celebrated canadian economist the newspapers were filled with her photograph la belle mademoiselle it was exposure she could have done without im certain it was did alex say anything about mo panov your doctor friend yes im afraid not goddamn it if i may suggest you must think of yourself now i understand will you pick up the car should i frankly i wouldnt if i were you its unlikely but the invoice might be traced back to me theres risk however minor thats what i thought i bought a métro map ill use the trains when can i call you give me four perhaps five hours to get back here from the airports as our saint explained your wife could be leaving from several different points of embarkation to get all those passenger manifests will take time concentrate on the flights arriving early tomorrow morning she cant fake a passport she wouldnt know how to do it according to alex one does not underestimate marie elise st jacques he even spoke french he said she was formidable she can come at you from the outer limits ill tell you that questce que cest shes an original lets leave it there and you im taking the subway its getting dark ill call you after midnight bonne chance merci bourne left the booth knowing his next move as he limped down the quai the bandage around his knee forcing him to assume a damaged leg there was a métro station by the tuileries where he would catch a train to havrecaumartin and switch to the regional express north line past stdenisbasilique to argenteuil argenteuil a town of the dark ages founded by charlemagne in honor of a nunnery fourteen centuries ago now fifteen hundred years later a city that housed the message center of a killer as brutal as any man who roamed the bloody fields with a broadsword in charlemagnes barbaric days then as now celebrating and sanctifying brutality in the shadows of religiosity le coeur du soldat was not on a street or a boulevard or an avenue instead it was in a deadend alleyway around the corner and across from a longsinceclosed factory whose faded signs indicated a once flourishing metallurgical refining plant in what had to be the ugliest part of the city nor was the soldat listed in the telephone directory it was found by innocently asking strangers where it was as the inquirer was to meet une grosse secousse at this undiscoverable pissoir the more dilapidated the buildings and the filthier the streets the more cogent were the directions bourne stood in the dark narrow alley leaning against the aged rough brick of the opposing structure across from the bistros entrance above the thick massive door in square block letters several missing was a dull red sign l c eur d soldat as the door was sporadically opened for entering or departing clientele metallic martial music blared forth into the alley and the clientele were not candidates for an haute couture cotillion his appearance was in keeping thought jason as he struck a wooden match against the brick lighting a thin black cigar as he limped toward the door except for the language and the deafening music it might have been a waterfront bar in sicilys palermo reflected bourne as he made his way to the crowded bar his squinting eyes roaming absorbing everything he could observebriefly confused wondering when he had been in palermo sicily a heavyset man in a tank shirt got off a stool jason slid on top of it the clawlike hand gripped his shoulder bourne slapped his right hand up grabbing the wrist and twisting it clockwise pushing the barstool away and rising to his full height whats your problem he asked calmly in french but loud enough to be heard thats my seat pig im just taking a piss so maybe when youre finished ill take one said jason his gaze boring into the mans eyes the strength of his grip unmistakableemphasized by pressing a nerve with his thumb which had nothing to do with strength ah youre a fucking cripple cried the man trying not to wince i dont pick on invalids ill tell you what said bourne releasing his thumb you come back well take turns and ill buy you a drink each time you let me get off this bum leg of mine okay looking up at jason the heavyset man slowly grinned hey youre all right im not all right but im certainly not looking for a fight either shit youd hammer me to the floor bourne released the muscular tank shirts arm im not so sure of that said the man now laughing and holding his wrist sit sit ill take a piss and come back and buy you a drink you dont look like youre loaded with francs well like they say appearances are deceiving replied jason sitting down ive got different better clothes and an old friend told me to meet him here but not to wear them i just got back from good money in africa you know training the savages cymbals crashed in the metallic deafening martial music as tank shirts eyes widened africa interrupted the stranger i knew it that griplpn what remained of the chameleons memory data banks expanded into the code lpnlegion patria nostra frances foreign legion the mercenaries of the world it was not what he had in mind but it would certainly do christ you too he asked again coarsely but innocently la légion étrangère the legion is our fatherland this is crazy we dont announce ourselves of course theres great jealousy naturally because we were the best and we were paid for it but still these are our people soldiers when did you leave the legion asked bourne sensing a cloud that could be troublesome ah nine years ago they threw me out before my second conscription for overweight they were right and they probably saved my life im from belgique a corporal i was discharged a month ago before my first term was over wounds during our incursion into angola and the fact that they figured i was older than my papers said they dont pay for extended recoveries how easily the words came angola we did that what was the quai dorsay thinking about i dont know im a soldier i follow orders and dont question those i cant understand sit my kidneys are bursting ill be right back maybe we know friends i never heard of any angola operation jason leaned forward over the bulging bar and ordered une bière grateful that the bartender was too busy and the music too loud for the man to have overheard the conversation however he was infinitely more grateful to saint alex of conklin whose primary advice to a field agent was to get in bad with a mark first before you get in good the theory being that the reversal from hostility to amiability was far stronger for the change bourne swallowed the beer in relief he had made a friend at le coeur du soldat it was an inroad minor but vital and perhaps not so minor tank shirt returned his thick arm around the shoulders of a younger man in his early twenties of medium height and with the physique of a large safe he was wearing an american field jacket jason started to get off the barstool sit sit cried his new friend leaning forward to be heard through the crowds and the music i brought us a virgin what you forgot so quickly hes on his way to becoming a legion recruit oh that laughed bourne covering his gaffe i wondered in a place like this in a place like this broke in tank shirt half will take it or give it either way as long as its rough but thats neither here nor there i thought he should talk to you hes american and his french is grotesque but if you speak slow hell catch on no need to said jason in faintly accented english i grew up in neufchâtel but i spent several years in the states thats nice to heah the americans speech was distinctly deep south his smile genuine his eyes wary but unafraid then let us start again said the belgian in heavily accented english my name is maurice its as good a name as any my young friend here is ralph at least he says it is whats yours my wounded hero francois replied jason thinking of bernardine and wondering briefly how he was doing at the airports and im no hero they died too quickly order your drinks im paying they did and bourne did his mind racing trying to recall the little he knew about the french foreign legion a lot has changed in nine years maurice how very easily the words came thought the chameleon why are you enlisting ralph ah figure its the wisest thing i can dokinda disappear for a few years and i understand five is the minimum if you last the first mon ami interjected the belgian maurice is right listen to him the officers are tough and difficult all french added the belgian ninety percent at least only one foreigner in perhaps three hundred reach the officer corps have no illusions but ahm a college man an engineer so youll build fine latrines for the camps and design perfect shit holes in the field laughed maurice tell him françois explain how the savants are treated the educated ones must first know how to fight said jason hoping he was right always first exclaimed the belgian for their schooling is suspicious will they doubt will they think when they are paid only to follow orders oh no mon ami i would not emphasize your érudition let it come out gradually added bourne when they need it not when you want to offer it bien cried maurice he knows what hes talking about a true légionnaire can you fight asked jason could you go after someone to kill him ah killed mah feeancee and her two brothers and a cousin all with a knife and my bare hands she was fuckin a big banker in nashville and they were coverin for her because he was payin all of em a lot of money yeah i can kill mr françois manhunt for crazed killer in nashville young engineer with promising future escapes dragnet bourne remembered the newspaper headlines of only weeks ago as he stared at the face of the young american go for the legion he said if push comes to shove mr françois could i use you as a reference it wouldnt help you young man it might only hurt if youre pressed just tell the truth its your credentials aussi bien he knows the legion they will not take maniacs if they can help it but theyhow do you say it françois look the other way i think oui they look the other way when there areencore francois when there are extenuating circumstances see my friend francois also has brains i wonder how he survived by not showing them maurice a waiter wearing about the filthiest apron jason had ever seen clapped the belgian on the neck votre table rené so shrugged tank shirt just another name quelle différence we eat and with good fortune we will not be poisoned two hours later with four bottles of rough vin ordinaire consumed by maurice and ralph along with suspicious fish le coeur du soldat settled in for its nightly endurance ritual fights occurred episodically broken up by muscular waiters the blaring music marshaled memories of battles won and lost engendering arguments between old soldiers who had basically been the assault troops cannon fodder at once resentful and filled with the pride of survival because they had survived the blood and horror their goldbraided superiors knew nothing about it was the collective roar of the underprivileged foot soldiers heard from the time of the pharaohs legions to the grunts of korea and vietnam the properly uniformed officers decreed from far behind the lines and the foot soldiers died to preserve their superiors wisdom bourne remembered saigon and could not fault the existence of le coeur du soldat the head bartender a massive bald man with steelrimmed glasses picked up a telephone concealed below the far end of the bar and brought it to his ear jason watched him between the roving figures the mans eyes spun around the crowded roomwhat he heard appeared to be important what he saw dismissible he spoke briefly plunged his hand below the bar and kept it there for several moments he had dialed again he spoke quickly then calmly replaced the phone out of sight it was the kind of sequence described by old fontaine on tranquility isle message received message relayed and at the end of that receiving line was the jackal it was all he wanted to see that evening there were things to consider perhaps men to hire as he had hired men in the past expendable men who meant nothing to him people who could be paid or bribed blackmailed or threatened into doing what he wanted them to do without explanation i just spotted the man i was to meet here he said to the barely conscious maurice and ralph he wants me to go outside youre leaving us whined the belgian hey man you shouldnt do thayat added the young american from the south only for tonight bourne leaned over the table im working with another légionnaire someone whos on to something that involves a lot of money i dont know you but you seem like decent men bourne pulled out his roll of bills and peeled off a thousand francs five hundred for each of his companions take this both of youshove it in your pockets quickly holy sheeitt merde its no guarantee but maybe we can use you keep your mouths shut and get out of here ten or fifteen minutes after i leave also no more wine i want you sober tomorrow when does this place open maurice im not sure it closes i myself have been here at eight oclock in the morning naturally it is not so crowded be here around noon but with clear heads all right i shall be le caporal extraordinaire of la légion the man that i once was should i wear my uniform maurice belched hell no ahll wear a suit and a tie i got a suit and a tie honest the american hiccupped no both of you be like you are now but with your heads straight do you understand me you sound très américain mon ami he sure do im not but then the truths not a commodity here is it ah know what he means i learned it real well you kinda fib with a tie on no tie ralph see you tomorrow bourne slid out of the booth and suddenly a thought struck him instead of heading for the door he cautiously made his way to the far end of the bar and the huge bald bartender no seats were available so again cautiously politely he squeezed sideways between two customers ordered a pemod and asked for a napkin on which to write a message ostensibly personal to no one who might concern the establishment on the back of the napkins crude coat of arms he wrote the following with his ballpoint pen in french the nest of a blackbird is worth a million francs object confidential business advice if interested be at the old factory around the corner in thirty minutes where is the harm an additional f for being there alone bourne palmed the napkin along with a hundredfranc note and signaled the bartender who adjusted his steelrimmed glasses as if the unknown patrons gesture were an impertinence slowly he moved his large body forward and leaned his thick tattooed arms on the bar what is it he asked gruffly i have written out a message for you replied the chameleon his eyes steady focused on the bartenders glasses i am by myself and hope you will consider the request i am a man who carries wounds but i am not a poor man bourne quickly but gentlyvery gentlyreached for the bartenders hand passing the napkin and the franc note with a final imploring look at the astonished man jason turned and headed for the door his limp pronounced outside bourne hurried up the cracked pavement toward the alleys entrance he judged that his interlude at the bar had taken between eight and twelve minutes knowing the bartender was watching him he had purposely not tried to see if his two companions were still at the table but he assumed they were tank shirt and field jacket were not at their sharpest and in their condition minutes did not count he could only hope five hundred francs apiece might bring about a degree of responsibility and that they would leave soon as instructed oddly enough he had more faith in mauricerené than in the young american who called himself ralph a former corporal in the foreign legion was imbued with an automatic reflex where orders were concerned he followed them blind drunk or blind sober jason hoped so it was not mandatory but he could use their assistanceif if the bartender at le coeur du soldat had been sufficiently intrigued by the excessive sums of money as well as by a solitary conversation with a cripple he could obviously kill with one tattooed arm bourne waited in the street the wash of the streetlights diminishing in the alley fewer and fewer people going in or coming out those arriving in better shape than those departing all passing jason without a glance at the derelict weaving against the brick instinct prevailed tank shirt pulled the much younger field jacket through the heavy door and at one point after the door had swung shut slapped the american across the face telling him in unclear words to follow orders for they were rich and could become much richer it is better than being shot in angola cried the former légionnaire loud enough for bourne to hear why did they do that jason stopped them at the entrance to the alley pulling both men around the edge of the brick building its me he said his voice commanding sacrebleu what the gawdamn hell be quiet you can make another five hundred francs tonight if you want to if not there are twenty other men who will we are comrades protested mauricerené and ah could bust your ass for scarin us like thayat but mah buddys right were comradesthat aint commie stuff is it maurice taisezvous that means shut up explained bourne ah know thayat i hear it a lot listen to me within the next few minutes the bartender in there may come out looking for me he may he also may not i simply dont know hes the large bald man wearing glasses do either of you know him the american shrugged but the belgian nodded his floating head his lips flat until he spoke his name is santos and he is espagnol spanish or latinoaméricain no one knows ilich ramirez sanchez thought jason carlos the jackal venezuelan by birth rejected terrorist whom even the soviets could not handle of course he would return to his own how well do you know him it was the belgians turn to shrug he is the complete authority where le coeur du soldat is concerned he has been known to crush mens heads if they behave too badly he always takes off his glasses first and that is the first sign that something will happen that even proven soldiers do not care to witness if he is coming out here to see you i would advise you to leave he may come because he wants to see me not because he wants to harm me that is not santos you dont have to know the particulars they dont concern you but if he does come out that door i want you to engage him in conversation can you do that mais certainement on several occasions i have slept on his couch upstairs personally carried there by santos himself when the cleaning women came in upstairs he lives above the café on the second floor it is said that he never leaves never goes into the streets even to the markets other people purchase all the supplies or they are simply delivered i see jason pulled out his money and distributed another five hundred francs to each weaving man go back into the alley and if santos comes out stop him and behave like youve had too much to drink ask him for money a bottle whatever like children mauricerené and ralph clutched the franc notes glancing at each other both as conspirators and as victors françois the crazy légionnaire was passing out money as if he printed it himself their collective enthusiasm grew how long do you want us to hassle this turkey asked the american from the deep south i will talk the ears off his bald head added the belgian no just long enough for me to see that hes alone said bourne that no one else is with him or comes out after him piece a cake man we shall earn not only your francs but your respect you have the word of a légion corporal im touched now get back in there the two inebriated men lurched down the alley field jacket slapping tank shirt triumphantly across the shoulders jason pressed his back against the streetside brick inches from the edge of the building and waited six minutes passed and then he heard the words he so desperately wanted to hear santos my great and good friend santos what are you doing here rené my young american friend was sick to his stomach but it has gonehe vomited american let me introduce you santos hes about to become a great soldier there is a childrens crusade somewhere bourne peered around the corner as the bald bartender looked at ralph good luck baby face go find your war in a playground you talk french awful fast mistuh but i caught some of that youre a big mother but i can be a mean son of a bitch the bartender laughed and switched effortlessly to english then youd better be mean someplace else baby face we only permit peaceable gentlemen in le coeur du soldat now i must go santos cried mauricerené lend me ten francs i left my billfold back at my flat if you ever had a billfold you left it back in north africa you know my policy not a sou for any of you what money i had went for your lousy fish it made my friend vomit for your next meal go down to paris and dine at the ritz ah yes you did have a mealbut you did not pay for it jason pulled quickly back as the bartender snapped his head around and looked up the alley good night rené you too baby warrior i have business bourne ran down the pavement toward the gates of the old factory santos was coming to meet him alone crossing the street into the shadows of the shutdown refinery he stood still moving only his hand so as to feel the hard steel and the security of his automatic with every step santos took the jackal was closer moments later the immense figure emerged from the alley crossed the dimly lit street and approached the rusted gates i am here monsieur said santos and i am grateful id rather youd keep your word first i believe you mentioned five thousand francs in your note its here jason reached into his pocket removed the money and held it out for the manager of le coeur du soldat thank you said santos walking forward and accepting the bills take him he added suddenly from behind bourne the old gates of the factory burst open two men rushed out and before jason could reach his weapon a heavy blunt instrument crashed down on his skull were alone said the voice across the dark room as bourne opened his eyes santoss huge frame minimized the size of his large armchair and the low wattage of the single floor lamp heightened the whiteness of his immense bald head jason arched his neck and felt the angry swelling on top of his skull he was angled into the corner of a sofa theres no break no blood only what i imagine is a very painful lump commented the jackals man your diagnosis is accurate especially the last part the instrument was hard rubber and cushioned the results are predictable except where concussions are concerned at your side on a tray is an ice bag it might be well to use it bourne reached down in the dim light grabbed the bulky cold bag and brought it to his head youre very considerate he said flatly why not we have several things to discuss perhaps a million if broken down into francs its yours under the conditions stated who are you asked santos sharply thats not one of the conditions youre not a young man not that it matters but neither are you you carried a gun and a knife the latter is for younger men who said so our reflexes what do you know about a blackbird you might as well ask me how i knew about le coeur du soldat how did you someone told me who sorry not one of the conditions im a broker and thats the way i work my clients expect it do they also expect you to bind your knee so as to feign an injury as your eyes opened i pressed the area there was no sign of pain no sprain no break also you carry no identification but considerable amounts of money i dont explain my methods i only clarify my restrictions as i understand them to be i got my message through to you didnt i since i had no telephone number i doubt i could have done so very successfully had i arrived at your establishment in a business suit carrying an attaché case santos laughed you never would have gotten inside you would have been rudely stopped in the alley and stripped the thought occurred to me do we do business say a million francs worth the jackals man shrugged it would seem to me that if a buyer mentions such an amount in his first offer he will go higher say a million and a half perhaps even two but im not the buyer im the broker i was authorized to pay one million which is far too much in my opinion but time is of the essence take it or leave it i have other options do you really certainly not if youre a corpse found floating in the seine without any identification i see jason looked around the darkened flat it bore little relationship to the shabby café below the furniture was large as required by the oversized owner but tastefully selected not elegant but certainly not cheap what was mildly astonishing were the bookshelves covering the wall between the two front windows the academic in bourne wished he could read the titles they might give him a clearer picture of this strange huge man whose speech might have been formed at the sorbonnea committed brute on the outside perhaps someone else inside his eyes returned to santos then my leaving here freely under my own power is not a given is it no answered the jackals conduit it might have been had you answered my simple questions but you tell me that your conditions or should i say your restrictions forbid you to do so well i too have conditions and you will live or die by them thats succinct theres no reason not to be of course youre forfeiting any chance of collecting a million francsor as you suggested perhaps a great deal more then may i also suggest said santos crossing his thick arms in front of him and absently glancing at the large tattoos on his skin that a man with such funds available will not only part with them in exchange for his life but will happily deliver the information requested so as to avoid unnecessary and excruciating pain the jackals man suddenly slammed his clenched right fist down on the armrest and shouted what do you know about a blackbird who told you about le coeur du soldat where do you come from and who are you and who is your client bourne froze his body rigid but his mind spinning whirling racing he had to get out he had to reach bernardinehow many hours was his call overdue where was marie yet what he wanted to do had to do could not be done by opposing the giant across the room santos was neither a liar nor a fool he would and could kill his prisoner handily and without hesitation and he would not be duped by outright false or convoluted information the jackals man was protecting two turfshis own and his mentors the chameleon had only one option open to expose a part of the truth so dangerous as to be credible the ring of authenticity so plausible that the risk of rejecting it was unacceptable jason put the ice bag on the tray and spoke slowly from the shadows of the large couch obviously i dont care to die for a client or be tortured to protect his information so ill tell you what i know which isnt as much as id like under the present circumstances ill take your points in order if im not too damned frightened to forget the sequence to begin with the funds are not available to me personally i meet with a man in london to whom i deliver the information and he releases an account in bern switzerland to a name and a numberany name any numberthat i give him well skip over my life and the excruciating painive answered both lets see what do i know about a blackbird the coeur du soldat is part of that question incidentally i was told that an old manname and nationality unknown at least to me but i suspect frenchapproached a wellknown public figure and told him he was the target of an assassination who believes a drunken old man especially one with a long police record looking for a reward unfortunately the assassination took place but fortunately an aide to the deceased was by his side when the old man warned him even more fortunate the aide was and is extremely close to my client and the assassination was a welcome event to both the aide secretly passed on the old mans information a blackbird is sent a message through a café known as le coeur du soldat in argenteuil this blackbird must be an extraordinary man and now my client wants to reach him as for myself my offices are hotel rooms in various cities im currently registered under the name of simon at the pontroyal where i keep my passport and other papers bourne paused his palms outstretched ive just told you the entire truth as i know it not the entire truth corrected santos his voice low and guttural who is your client ill be killed if i tell you ill kill you right now if you dont said the jackals conduit removing jasons hunting knife from his wide leather belt the blade glistening in the light of the floor lamp why not give me the information my client wants along with a name and a numberany name any numberand ill guarantee you two million francs all my client asks is for me to be the only intermediary wheres the harm the blackbird can turn me down and tell me to go to hell three million santoss eyes wavered as if the temptation were almost too much for his imagination perhaps well do business later now no carloss man pushed his immense body out of the chair and walked toward the couch the knife held threateningly in front of him your client plural replied bourne a group of powerful men in the united states who they guard their names like nuclear secrets but i know of one and he should be enough for you who find out for yourselfat least learn the enormity of what im trying to tell you protect your blackbird by all means ascertain that im telling you the truth and in the process make yourself so rich you can do anything you want to do for the rest of your life you could travel disappear perhaps have time for those books of yours rather than being concerned with all that garbage downstairs as you pointed out neither of us is young i make a generous brokering fee and youre a wealthy man free of care of unpleasant drudgery again wheres the harm i can be turned down my clients turned down theres no trap my clients dont ever want to see him they want to hire him how could this be done how could i be satisfied invent some high position for yourself and reach the american ambassador in londonthe name is atkinson tell him youve received confidential instructions from snake lady ask him if you should carry them out snake lady whats that medusa they call themselves medusa mo panov excused himself and slid out of the booth he made his way through the crowded highway diner toward the mens room frantically scanning the wall at the far end for a pay phone there was none the only goddamned phone was ten feet from the booth and in clear sight of the wildeyed platinum blonde whose paranoia was as deeply embedded as the dark roots of her hair he had casually mentioned that he thought he should call his office and tell his staff about the accident and where he was and was instantly met with invective and have a swarm of cops coming out to pick you up not on your fuckin life medicine man your office calls the fuzz they call my devoted chief forkinmouth and my ass is bouncing into every barbedwire fence in the county hes in with every cop on the roads i think he tells em where to get laid thered be no reason for me to mention you and i certainly wouldnt if you recall you said he might resent me resent dont count hed just cut your cute little nose off im not takin any chancesyou dont look like youre too withit youd blurt out about your accidentnext thing the cops you know youre not really making sense all right ill make sense ill yell rape and tell these notsopansy truckers i picked you up on the road two days ago and ive been a sex slave ever since how does that grab you very firmly may i at least go to the mens room its urgent that i do be my guest they dont put phones in the can in these places really no honestly im not chagrined not disappointedjust curious why dont they truckers make good money theyre not interested in stealing dimes or quarters boy youre from la la land doc things happen on the highways things get switched or snitched you dig if people make phone calls other people want to know who makes them really oh jesus hurry up we only got time for a couple of greasies so ill order hell head up seventy not ninetyseven he wouldnt figure figure what what are seventy and ninetyseven routes for christs sake there are routes and there are routes you are one dumb medicine man hit the head then maybe later well stop at a motel where we can continue our business discussion while you get an advance bonus i beg your pardon im prochoice is that against your religion good lord no im a firm advocate good hurry up so panov headed for the mens room and indeed the woman was right there was no phone and the window to the outside was too small for anyone but a small cat or a large rat to crawl through but he had money a great deal of money along with five drivers licenses from five different states in jason bournes lexicon these were weapons especially the money mo went to the urinallong overdueand then to the door he pulled it back several inches to observe the blonde suddenly the door swung violently back several feet and panov crashed into the wall hey sorry pal cried a short heavyset man who grabbed the psychiatrist by the shoulders as mo grabbed his face you okay buddy oh certainly yes of course the hell you are you got a nosebleed cmon over here by the towels ordered the tshirted trucker one sleeve rolled up to hold a pack of cigarettes cmon put your head back while i get some cold water on your schnoz loosen up and lean against the wall there thats better well stop this sucker in a moment or two the short man reached up and gently pressed the wet paper towels across panovs face while holding the back of his neck and every few seconds checking the flow of blood from mos nostrils there yare buddy its damned near stopped just breathe through your mouth deep breaths you got me head tilted okay thank you said panov holding the towels and amazed that a nosebleed could be stopped so quickly thank you very much dont thank me i bashed you one by mistake answered the trucker relieving himself feel better now he asked zipping up his trousers yes i do and against the advice of his dear deceased mother mo decided to take advantage of the moment and forgo righteousness but i should explain that it was my mistake not yours waddaya mean asked the trucker washing his hands frankly i was hiding behind the door looking at a woman im trying to get away fromif that makes sense to you panovs personal medic laughed as he dried his hands whose sense wouldnt it make its the story of mankind pal they getcha in their clutches and whammo they whine and you dont know what to do they scream and youre at their feet now me i got it different i married a real european you know she dont speak so good english but shes grateful great with the kids great

get out of here without her seeing me leave i have some money hold the money who is she both men went to the door and panov pulled it back a few inches shes the one over there the blonde who keeps looking in this direction and at the front door shes getting very agitated holy shit interrupted the short trucker thats the bronks wife shes way off course off course the bronk he trucks the eastern routes not these what the hell is she doing here i think shes trying to avoid him yeah agreed mos companion i heard shes been messing around and dont charge no money do you know her hell yeah i been

hummin and the bronk is headin south to the carolinasat least thats what i heard how can i ever repay you probably with some of that money you keep talkin about not too much though the bronks an animal and im a bornagain christian the short trucker swung back the door nearly shoving panov back into the wall again mo watched as his conspiratorial colleague approached the booth his conspiratorial arms extended as the trucker embraced an old friend and started talking rapidly the womans eyes were attentiveshe was mesmerized panov rushed out of the mens room through the diners entrance and toward the huge redandwhitestriped truck he crouched breathlessly behind the cab his chest pounding and waited suddenly the bronks wife came racing out of the diner her platinum hair rising grotesquely in the air behind her as she ran to her bright red automobile she climbed inside and in seconds the engine roared she continued north as mo watched astonished how are ydoing buddywherever the hell you are shouted the short man with no name who had not only amazingly stopped a nosebleed but had rescued him from a manic wife whose paranoid mood swings were rooted in equal parts of vengeance and guilt stop it asshole cried panov to himself as he raised his voice over here buddy thirtyfive minutes later they reached the outskirts of an unidentified town and the trucker stopped in front of a cluster of stores that bordered the highway youll find a phone there buddy good luck are you sure asked mo about the money i mean sure im sure replied the short man behind the wheel two hundred dollars is finemaybe even what i earnedbut more than that corrupts dont it i been offered fifty times that to haul stuff i wont haul and you know what i tell em what do you tell them i tell em to go piss into the wind with their poison its gonna flash back and blind em youre a good person said panov climbing out onto the pavement i got a few things to make up for the door of the cab slammed shut and the huge truck shot forward as mo turned away looking for a telephone where the hell are you shouted alexander conklin in virginia i dont know answered panov if i were a patient id ponderously explain that it was an extension of some freudian dream sequence because it never happens but it happened to me they shot me up alex stay cold we assumed that we have to know where you are lets face it others are looking for you too all right all right wait a minute theres a drugstore across the street the sign says battle fords best will that help the sigh on the line from virginia was the reply yes it does if you were a socially productive civil war buff rather than an insignificant shrink youd know it too what the hell does that mean head for the old battleground at fords bluff its a national landmark there are signs everywhere a helicopter will be there in thirty minutes and dont say a goddamned thing to anybody do you know how extreme you sound yet i was the object of hostility out coach bourne walked into the pontroyal and immediately approached the night concierge peeling off a fivehundredfranc note and placing it quietly in the mans hand the name is simon he said smiling ive been away any messages no messages monsieur simon was the quiet reply but two men are outside one on montalembert the other across on the rue du bac jason removed a thousandfranc note and palmed it to the man i pay for such eyes and i pay well keep it up of course monsieur bourne crossed to the brass elevator reaching his floor he walked rapidly down the intersecting corridors to his room nothing was disturbed everything was as he had left it except that the bed had been made up the bed oh god he needed to rest to sleep he couldnt do it any longer something was happening inside himless energy less breath yet he had to have both now more than ever oh christ he wanted to lie down no there was marie there was bernardine he went to the telephone and dialed the number he had committed to memory im sorry im late he said four hours late mon ami what happened no time what about marie there is nothing absolutely nothing she is not on any international flight currently in the air or scheduled for departure i even checked the transfers from london lisbon stockholm and amsterdamnothing there is no marie elise st jacques webb en route to paris there has to be she wouldnt change her mind its not like her and she wouldnt know how to bypass immigration i repeat shes not listed on any flight from any country coming into paris damn i will keep trying my friend the words of saint alex keep ringing in my ears do not underestimate la belle mademoiselle shes not a goddamned mademoiselle shes my wife shes not one of us bernardine shes not an agent in the field who can cross and doublecross and triplecross thats not her but shes on her way to paris i know it the airlines do not what more can i say just what you said said jason his lungs seemingly incapable of absorbing the air he needed his eyelids heavy keep trying what happened tonight tell me tomorrow replied david webb barely audible tomorrow im so tired and i have to be somebody else what are you talking about you dont even sound like yourself nothing tomorrow i have to think or maybe i shouldnt think marie stood in marseilless immigration line mercifully short because of the early hour and assumed an air of boredom the last thing she felt it was her turn to go to the passport counter américaine said the halfawake official are you beer on bizziness or playseeoor madame je parle français monsieur je suis canadienne doriginequébec séparatiste ah bien the sleepy clerks eyes opened somewhat wider as he proceeded in french you are in business no im not this is a journey of memories my parents came from marseilles and both died recently i want to see where they came from where they livedperhaps what i missed how extraordinarily touching lovely lady said the immigration official appraising the most appealing traveler perhaps also you might need a guide there is no part of this city that is not indelibly printed on my mind youre most kind ill be at the sofitel vieux port whats your name you have mine lafontaine madame at your service lafontaine you dont say i do indeed how interesting i am very interesting said the official his eyelids half closed but not with sleepiness as his rubber stamps flew recklessly down to process the tourist i am at your every service madame it must run in that very peculiar clan thought marie as she headed for the luggage area from there she would board a domestic flight to paris under any name she chose françois bernardine awoke with a start shooting up on his elbows frowning disturbed shes on her way to paris i know it the words of the husband who knew her best shes not listed on any flight from any other country coming into paris his own words paris the operative word was paris but suppose it was not paris the deuxième veteran crawled rapidly out of bed in the early morning light shining through the tall narrow windows of his flat in fewer minutes than his face appreciated he shaved then completed his ablutions dressed and walked down into the street to his peugeot where there was the inevitable ticket on the windshield alas it was no longer officially dismissible with a quiet phone call he sighed picked it off the glass and climbed in behind the wheel fiftyeight minutes later he swung the car into the parking lot of a small brick building in the huge cargo complex of orly airport the building was nondescript the work inside was not it was a branch of the department of immigration an allimportant arm known simply as the bureau of air entries where sophisticated computers kept uptotheminute records of every traveler flying into france at all the international airports it was vital to immigration but not often consulted by the deuxième for there were far too many other points of entry used by the people in which the deuxième was interested nevertheless over the years bernardine operating on the theory of the obvious being unnoticed had sought information from the bureau of air entries every now and then he had been rewarded he wondered if that would be the case this morning nineteen minutes later he had his answer it was the case but the reward was considerably diminished in value for the information came too late there was a pay phone in the bureaus lobby bernardine inserted a coin and dialed the pontroyal yes coughed the voice of jason bourne i apologize for waking you françois yes i was just getting up there are two men down in the street far more tired than i am unless theyre replacements relative to last night all night yes ill tell you about it when i see you is that why you called no im out at orly and im afraid i have bad news information that proves me an idiot i should have considered it your wife flew into marseilles slightly over two hours ago not paris marseilles why is that bad news cried jason we know where she is we can oh christ i see what you mean subdued bournes words trailed off she can take a train hire a car she can even fly up to paris under any name she cares to added bernardine still i have an idea its probably as worthless as my brain but i suggest it anyway do you and she have specialhow do you say itnicknames for each other sobriquets of endearment perhaps were not much for the cute stuff frankly wait a minute a couple of years ago jamie thats our son had trouble with mommy he turned it around and called her meemom we kidded about it and i called her that for a few months off and on until he got it right i know she speaks french fluently does she read the papers religiously at least the financial pages im not sure she goes seriously much beyond them its her morning ritual even in a crisis especially in a crisis she claims it calms her lets send her a messageon the financial pages ambassador phillip atkinson settled in for a morning of dreary paperwork at the american embassy in london the dreariness was compounded by a dull throbbing at his temples and a sickening taste in his mouth it was hardly a typical hangover because he rarely drank whisky and for over twentyfive years had never been drunk he had learned a long time ago roughly thirty months after saigon fell the limits of his talents his opportunities and above all his resources when he returned from the war with reasonable if not exceptional commendations at twentynine his family had purchased him an available seat on the new york stock exchange where in thirty additional months he had lost something over three million dollars didnt you ever learn a goddamned thing at andover and yale his father had roared at least make a few connections on the street dad they were all jealous of me you know that my looks the girlsi look like you dadthey all conspired against me sometimes i think they were really getting at you through me you know how they talk senior and junior dashing socialites and all that crap remember the column in the daily news when they compared us to the fairbankses ive known doug for forty years yelled the father hes got it upstairs one of the best he didnt go to andover and yale dad he didnt have to for christs sake hold it foreign service what the hell was that degree you got at yale bachelor of arts screw that there was something else the courses or something i majored in english literature and minored in political science thats it shove the fairy stuff on the back burner you were outstanding in the other onethe political science bullshit dad it wasnt my strongest course you passed yes barely not barely with honors thats it and so phillip atkinson iii began his career in the foreign service by way of a valuable political contributor who was his father and never looked back and although that illustrious man had died eight years ago he never forgot the old war horses last admonition dont fuck this up son you want to drink or you want to whore around you do it inside your own house or in a goddamned desert somewhere understand and you treat that wife of yours whatever the hell her name is with real affection wherever anybody can see you got it yes dad which was why phillip atkinson felt so blah on this particular morning he had spent the previous evening at a dinner party with unimportant royals who drank until the drink flowed out of their nostrils and with his wife who excused their behavior because they were royals all of which he could tolerate only with seven glasses of chablis there were times when he longed for the freewheeling freedrinking days of the old saigon the telephone rang causing atkinson to blur his signature on a document that made no sense to him yes the high commissioner from the hungarian central committee is on the line sir oh whos thatwho are they do we recognize themithim i dont know mr ambassador i really cant pronounce his name very well put him through mr ambassador said the deep accented voice on the phone mr atkinson yes this is atkinson forgive me but i dont recollect either your name or the hungarian affiliation you speak for it does not matter i speak on behalf of snake lady stop cried the ambassador to the court of st jamess stay on the line and well resume talking in twenty seconds atkinson reached down snapped on his scrambler and waited until the spiraling sounds of the preinterceptor subsided all right continue i have received instructions from snake lady and was told to confirm the origin from you confirmed and therefore i am to carry out these instructions good lord yes whatever they say my god look what happened to teagarten in brussels armbruster in washington protect me do whatever they say thank you mr ambassador bourne first sat in the hottest tub he could endure then took the coldest shower he could tolerate he then changed the dressing around his neck walked back into the small hotel room and fell on the bed so marie had found a simple ingenious way to reach paris goddamn it how could he find her protect her had she any idea what she was doing david would go out of his mind hed panic and make a thousand mistakes oh my god i am david stop it control pull back the telephone rang he grabbed it off the bedside table yes santos wants to see you with peace in his heart the emergency medical service helicopter was lowered into its threshold the rotors were cut and the blades thumped to a stop following ems procedure when disembarking ambulatory patients only then did the exit door open and the metal steps slap down to the ground a uniformed paramedic preceded panov turning and assisting the doctor to the tarmac where a second man in civilian clothes escorted him to a waiting limousine inside were peter holland director of the cia and alex conklin the latter in the right jump seat obviously for conversational purposes the psychiatrist climbed in beside holland he took several deep breaths sighed audibly and fell back into the seat i am a maniac he stated emphasizing each word certifiably insane and ill sign the papers of commitment myself youre safe thats all that matters doctor said holland good to see you crazy mo added conklin have you any idea what i did i purposely crashed a car into a tree with me in it then after walking at least half the distance to the bronx i was picked up by the only person i know who may have more loose bananas in her head than i do her libido is unhinged and shes running away from her trucker husbandhot on her french heelswho i subsequently learned has the cuddly name of the bronk my hooker chauffeur proceeds to hold me hostage with such wiles as threatening to yell rape in a diner filled with a collection of the nfls most carnivorous linebackersexcept for one who got me out panov abruptly stopped and reached into his pocket here he continued thrusting the five drivers licenses and the roughly six thousand dollars into conklins hands whats this asked the bewildered alex i robbed a bank and decided to become a professional driver what do you think it is i took it from the man who was guarding me i described as best i could to the choppers crew where the crash took place theyre flying back to find him they will hes not walking anywhere peter holland reached for the limousines telephone pushing three buttons in less than two seconds he spoke get word to emsarlington equipment fiftyseven the man theyre picking up is to be brought directly to langley to the infirmary and keep me informed as to their progress sorry doctor go on go on whats to go on to i was kidnapped and held in some farmhouse and injected with enough sodium pentothal if im not mistaken to make me a resident ofof la la land which i was recently accused of being by madame scylla charybdis what the hell are you talking about said holland flatly nothing admiral or mr director or peters fine mo completed holland i simply didnt understand you theres nothing to understand but the facts my allusions are compulsive attempts at false erudition its called posttraumatic stress of course now youre perfectly clear panov turned to the dci with a nervous smile its my turn to be sorry peter im still wound up this last day or so hasnt exactly been representative of my normal lifestyle i dont think its anybodys concurred holland ive seen my share of rotten stuff but nothing like this nothing that tampers with the mind i missed all that theres no hurry mo added conklin dont press yourself youve taken a lot of punishment if you like we can postpone the briefing for a few hours so you can rest calm down dont be a damn fool alex protested the psychiatrist sharply for the second time ive put davids life in jeopardy the knowledge of that is far worse punishment theres not a minute to lose forget langley peter take me to one of your clinics freefloating i want to get out everything i can recall consciously or unconsciously hurry ill tell the doctors what to do youve got to be joking said holland staring at panov im not joking for an instant you both have to know what i knowwhether i realize i know it or not cant you understand that the director again reached for the telephone and pressed a single button in the front seat beyond the glass partition the driver picked up the phone recessed in the seat beside him theres been a change of plans said holland head for sterile five the limousine slowed down and at the next intersection turned right toward the rolling hills and verdant fields of the virginia hunt country morris panov closed his eyes as if in a trance or as a man might do facing some appalling ordealhis own execution perhaps alex looked at peter holland they both glanced at mo then back at each other whatever panov was doing there was a reason for it until they reached the gates of the estate that was sterile house five thirty minutes later no one spoke dci and company announced the driver to the guard wearing the uniform of a private security firm in reality a cia proprietary the limousine proceeded down the long treelined entrance thanks said mo opening his eyes and blinking as im sure you gathered im trying to clear my head and with any luck bring down my blood pressure you dont have to do this insisted holland yes i do said panov maybe with time i could piece things together with a degree of clarity but i cant now and we dont have the time mo turned to conklin how much can you tell me peter knows everything for the sake of that blood pressure of yours i wont fill you in on all the details but the bottom line is that davids all right at least we havent heard otherwise marie the children on the island replied alex avoiding hollands eyes what about this sterile five asked panov now looking at holland i assume theres a specialist or specialists the kind i need in relays and around the clock you probably know a few of them id rather not the long dark vehicle swung around the circular drive and stopped in front of the stone steps of the pillared georgian mansion that was the focal point of the estate lets go said mo quietly stepping outside the sculptured white doors the rosecolored marble floors and the elegant winding staircase in the great hall all combined to furnish a superb cover for the work done at sterile five defectors double and triple agents and field officers returned from complex assignments for rest and debriefing were continuously processed through its various agendas the staff each with a four zero clearance consisted of two doctors and three nurses in relay units cooks and domestic attendants recruited from the foreign servicein the main overseas embassiesand guards all with ranger training or its equivalent they moved about the house and grounds unobtrusively eyes constantly alert each with either a concealed or an unconcealed weapon except for the medical personnel visitors without exception were given small lapel pins by the wellspoken darksuited house steward who admitted them and directed them to the locations of their scheduled appointments the man was a retired grayhaired interpreter for the central intelligence agency but he suited his position so well in appearance he might have come from central casting naturally at the sight of peter holland the steward was astonished he prided himself on committing to memory every schedule at sterile five a surprise visit sir good to see you frank the dci shook hands with the former interpreter you may remember alex conklin good lord is that you alex its been years again hands were shaken when was the last time that crazy woman from warsaw wasnt it the kgbs been chuckling ever since laughed conklin the only secret she had was the recipe for the worst golumpki ive ever tasted still keeping your hand in frank every now and then replied the steward grimacing in mock disapproval these young translators dont know a quiche from a kluski since i dont either said holland may i have a word with you frank the two older men walked off to the side speaking quietly as alex and mo panov held their places the latter frowning and sporadically breathing deeply the director returned handing lapel pins to his colleagues i know where to go now he said frank will call ahead the three of them walked up the curving ornate staircase conklin limping and down a lushly carpeted hallway on the left to the rear of the enormous house on the right wall was a door unlike any of the doors they had passed it was made of thick varnished oak with four small windows in the upper recessed panels and two black buttons set in an outlet casing beside the knob holland inserted a key twisted it and pressed the lower button instantly a red light appeared in the small stationary camera mounted on the ceiling twenty seconds later there was the familiar muffled metallic clanking of an elevator coming to a stop inside gentlemen ordered the dci the door closed and the elevator began its descent we walked up to go down asked conklin security answered the director its the only way to get where were going theres no elevator on the first floor why not may the man with one foot missing ask said alex id think youd be able to answer that better than me retorted the dci apparently all accesses to the cellars are sealed off except for two elevators that bypass the first floor and for which you need a key this one and another on the other side this takes us to where we want to go the other leads to the furnaces airconditioning units and all the rest of the normal basement equipment frank gave me the key incidentally if it doesnt return to its slot within a given period of time another alarm goes off it all strikes me as unnecessarily complicated said panov curtly nervously expensive games not necessarily mo interrupted conklin gently explosives can be concealed pretty easily in heating pipes and ducts and did you know that during the last days of hitlers bunker a few of his saner aides tried to insert poison gas into the airfiltering machinery these are just precautions the elevator stopped and the door opened to your left doctor holland said the hallway was a glistening pristine white antiseptic in its way which was altogether proper as this underground complex was a highly sophisticated medical center it was devoted not only to the healing of men and women but also to the process of breaking them down crippling their resistance so that information might be revealed truths learned that could prevent the penetration of highrisk operations frequently saving lives as a result they entered a room that was in stark contrast to the antiseptic quality of the fluorescentlit hallway there were heavy armchairs and soft indirect lighting a coffee urn on a table with cups and saucers newspapers and magazines were folded neatly on other tables all the comforts of a lounge designed for those waiting for someone or something from an inner door a man in a white medical jacket appeared he was frowning looking uncertain director holland he said approaching peter extending his hand im dr walsh second shift needless to say we didnt expect you im afraid its an emergency and hardly one of my choosing may i introduce you to dr morris panovunless you know him of him of course walsh again extended his hand a pleasure doctor also a privilege you may take both back before were finished doctor may we talk privately certainly my office is inside the two men disappeared through the inner door shouldnt you go with them asked conklin looking at peter why not you goddamn it youre the director you should insist youre his closest friend so should you i dont have any clout here mine disappeared when mo dismissed us come on lets have some coffee this place gives me the proverbial creeps holland went to the table with the coffee urn and poured two cups how do you like it with more milk and sugar than im supposed to have ill do it i still take it black said the director moving away from the table and removing a pack of cigarettes from his shirt pocket my wife says the acid will kill me one day other people say tobacco will what look alex pointed at the sign on the opposite wall it read thank you for not smoking that ive got enough clout for announced holland quietly as he snapped his lighter and lit a cigarette nearly twenty minutes passed every now and then one or the other of them picked up a magazine or a newspaper only to put it down moments later and look up at the inner door finally twentyeight minutes after he had disappeared with panov the doctor named walsh reappeared he tells me you know what hes requesting and that you have no objections director holland ive got plenty of objections but it seems hes overruled them oh excuse me doctor this is alex conklin hes one of us and a close friend of panov how do you feel mr conklin asked walsh nodding at alex as he returned the greeting i hate what hes doingwhat he wants to dobut he says it makes sense if it does its right for him and i understand why he insists on doing it if it doesnt make sense ill pull him out of there myself one foot and all does it make sense doctor and whats the risk of damage theres always a risk where drugs are concerned especially in terms of chemical balance and he knows that its why hes designed an intravenous flow that prolongs his own psychological pain but somewhat reduces the potential damage somewhat cried alex im being honest so is he bottom line doctor said holland if things go wrong two or three months of therapy not permanent and the sense insisted conklin does it make sense yes replied walsh what happened to him is not only recent its consumed him its obsessed his conscious which can only mean that its inflamed his subconscious hes right his unreachable recall is on the cutting edge i came in here as a courtesy hes insisted we proceed and from what hes told me id do the same thing each of us would whats the security asked alex the nurse will be dismissed and stay outside the door therell be only a single batteryoperated tape recorder and me and one or both of you the doctor turned to the door then glanced back ill send for you at the proper time he added again disappearing inside conklin and peter holland looked at each other the second period of waiting began to their astonishment it ended barely ten minutes later a nurse came out into the lounge and asked them to follow her they walked through what appeared to be a maze of antiseptic white walls broken up only by recessed white panels with glass knobs that denoted doors only once on their brief journey did they see another human being it was a man in a white smock wearing a white surgical mask who walked out of yet another white door his sharp intense eyes above the white cloth somehow accusing determining them to be aliens from some different world that had not been cleared for sterile house five the nurse opened a door there was a blinking red light above its top frame she put her index finger to her lips indicating silence holland and conklin walked quietly inside a dark room and confronted a drawn white curtain concealing a bed or an examining table beyond a small circle of intense light shining through the cloth they heard the softly spoken words of dr walsh you are going back doctor not far back just a day or so just when you began to feel the dull constant pain in your arm your arm doctor why are they inflicting pain on your arm you were in a farmhouse a small farmhouse with fields outside your window and then they put a blindfold on you and began hurting your arm your arm doctor suddenly there was a muted flashing of green light reflected on the ceiling the curtain parted electronically several feet revealing the bed the patient and the doctor walsh took his finger off a bedside button and looked at them gesturing slowly with his hands as if to say theres no one else here confirmed both witnesses nodded at first mesmerized then repelled at the sight of panovs grimacing pale face and the tears that began to flow from his wideopen eyes then as one they saw the white straps that emerged from under the white sheet holding mo in place the order had to be his the arm doctor we have to begin with the physically invasive procedure dont we because you know what it does doctor dont you it leads to another invasive procedure that you cannot permit you must stop its progression the earshattering scream was a prolonged shriek of defiance and horror no no i wont tell you i killed him once i wont kill him again get away from meeeee alex slumped falling to the floor peter holland grabbed him and gently the strong broadshouldered admiral a veteran of the darkest operations in the far east led conklin silently through the door to the nurse get him away from here please yes sir peter coughed alex trying to stand collapsing on his false foot im sorry christ im sorry what for whispered holland i should watch but i cant watch i understand its all too close if i were you i probably couldnt either no you dont understand mo said he killed david but of course he didnt but i meant to i really wanted to kill him i was wrong but i tried with all the expertise in my bones to kill him and now ive done it again i sent him to paris its not mo its me put him against the wall miss let him sink to the floor and leave us alone yes sir the nurse did as she was ordered and fled leaving holland and alex alone in the antiseptic maze now you listen to me field man whispered the grayhaired director of the central intelligence agency kneeling in front of conklin this fucking merrygoround of guilt had better stophas got to stopor nobodys going to be any good to anybody i dont give a good goddamn what you or panov did thirteen years ago or five years ago or now were all reasonably bright people and we did what each of us did because we thought they were the right moves at the time guess what saint alex yes ive heard the term we make mistakes fucking inconvenient isnt it maybe were not so brilliant after all maybe panov isnt the greatest behavioral whateverthehellitis maybe youre not the shrewdest son of a bitch in the field the one who got canonized and maybe im not the superjock behindthelines strategist theyve made me out to be so what we take our baggage and go where we have to go oh for christs sake shut up yelled conklin struggling against the wall shhh oh shit the last thing i need is a sermon from you if i had a foot id take you now were physical i was black belt first class admiral golly gee i dont even know how to wrestle their eyes met and alex was the first to laugh quietly youre too much peter i got your message help me up will you ill go back to the lounge and wait for you come on give me a hand the hell i will said holland getting to his feet and standing over conklin help yourself someone told me that the saint made it back through a hundred and forty miles in enemy territory through rivers and streams and jungle and arrived at the foxtrot base camp asking if anybody had a bottle of bourbon yeah well that was different i was a hell of a lot younger and i had another foot pretend you got one now saint alex holland winked im going back inside one of us has to be there bastard for an hour and fortyseven minutes conklin sat in the lounge his attachable footless foot never throbbed but it was throbbing now he did not know what the impossible feeling meant but he could not dismiss the beat that surged through his leg if nothing else it was something to think about and he thought wistfully of the younger days when he had both feet and before oh how he had wanted to change the world and how he had felt so right in a destiny that forced him to become the youngest valedictorian in his high schools history the youngest freshman ever accepted at georgetown a bright bright light that shimmered at the end of the tunnels of academe his decline started when someone somewhere found out that his name at birth was not alexander conklin but aleksei nikolae konsolikov that now faceless man had casually asked him a question the answer to which had changed conklins life do you by any chance speak russian of course he had replied amused that his visitor would even think he might not as you obviously know my parents were immigrants i grew up not only in a russian home but in a russian neighborhoodat least in the early years you couldnt buy a loaf of bread at the ovoshchnoi otdel if you didnt and at church school the older priests and nuns like the poles held ferociously on to the language im sure it contributed to my leaving the faith those were the early years however as i believe you mentioned yes what changed im sure its in your government report somewhere and will hardly satisfy your iniquitous senator mccarthy the face came back to alex with the memory of those words it was a middleaged face and it had suddenly become expressionless the eyes clouded but with suppressed anger in them i assure you mr conklin i am in no way associated with the senator you call him iniquitous i have other terms but theyre not pertinent here what changed quite late in his life my father became what he had been in russia a highly successful merchant a capitalist at last count he owned seven supermarkets in upscale malls theyre called conklins corners hes over eighty now and although i love him dearly i regret to say hes an ardent supporter of the senator i simply consider his years his struggles his hatred of the soviets and avoid the subject youre very bright and very diplomatic bright and diplomatic alex had agreed ive shopped at a couple of conklins corners kind of expensive oh yes where did the conklin come from my father my mother says he saw it on a billboard advertising motor oil she thinks about four or five years after they got here and of course the konsolikov had to go as my considerably bigoted father once said only the jews with russian names can make money over here again i avoid the subject very diplomatic its not difficult he has his share of good points as well even if he didnt im sure you could be convincing in your diplomacy in the concealment of your feelings why do i think thats a leading statement because it is mr conklin i represent a government agency thats extremely interested in you and one in which your future would be as unlimited as that of any potential recruit ive spoken to in a decade that conversation had taken place nearly thirty years ago mused alex his eyes drifting up once again to the inner door of sterile fives waiting lounge in its own private medical center and how crazy the intervening years had been in a stressdefying bid for unrealistic expansion his father had overextended himself committing enormous sums of money that existed only in his imagination and in the minds of avaricious bankers he lost six of his seven supermarkets the smallest and last supporting a lifestyle that he found unacceptable so he conveniently had a massive stroke and died as alexs own adult life was about to begin berlineast and west moscow leningrad tashkent and kamchatka vienna paris lisbon and istanbul then back across the world to stations in tokyo hong kong seoul cambodia laos and finally saigon and the tragedy that was vietnam over the years with his facile mastery of languages and the expertise that came with survival he had become the agencys point man in clandestine operations its primary scout and often the onscene strategist for covert activities then one morning with the mists hanging over the mekong delta a land mine shattered his life as well as his foot there was little left for a field man who depended on mobility in his chosen work the rest was downhill and out of the field his excessive drinking he accepted and excused as genetic the russians winter of depression carried over into spring summer and autumn the skeletal trembling wreck of a man who was about to go under was given a reprieve david webbjason bournecame back into his life the door opened mercifully cutting short his reverie and peter holland walked slowly into the lounge his face was pale and drawn his eyes glazed and in his left hand were two small plastic containers each presumably holding a cassette tape as long as i live said peter his voice low and hollow barely above a whisper i hope to christ i never go through anything like this again never witness anything like this again hows mo i didnt think hed live i thought hed kill himself every now and then walsh would stop let me tell you he was one frightened doctor why didnt he call it off for gods sake i asked him that he said panovs instructions were not only explicit but that hed written them out and signed them and expected them to be followed to the letter maybe theres some kind of unwritten code of ethics between doctors i dont know but i do know walsh hooked him up to an ekg which he rarely took his eyes off neither did i it was easier than looking at mo jesus lets get out of here wait a minute what about panov hes not ready for a welcomehome party hell stay here for a couple of days under observation walsh will call me in the morning id like to see him i want to see him theres nothing to see but a human dishrag believe me you dont and he wouldnt want you to lets go where your place in viennaour place in vienna i assume youve got a cassette machine ive got everything but a moon rocket most of which i cant operate i want to stop and get a bottle of whisky theres whatever you want at the apartment it doesnt bother you asked holland studying alex would it matter if it did not a bit if i remember theres an extra bedroom isnt there yes good we may be up most of the night listening to these the director held up the cassettes the first couple of times wont mean anything all well hear is the pain not the information it was shortly past five oclock in the afternoon when they left the estate known within the agency as sterile house five the days were growing shorter september on the cusp the descending sun announcing the forthcoming change with an intensity of color that was the death of one season and the birth of another the lights always brightest before we die said conklin leaning back in the seat beside holland in the limousine staring out the window i find that not only inappropriate but quite possibly sophomoric declared peter wearily i wont commit to the latter until i know who said it who was it jesus i think the scriptures were never edited too many campfires no onscene confirmation alex laughed softly reflectively did you ever actually read them the scriptures i mean most of itmost of them because you had to hell no my father and mother were as agnostic as any two people could be without being branded godless pariahs they shut up about it and sent me and my two sisters to a protestant service one week a catholic mass on another and a synagogue after that never with any regularity but i guess they figured we should catch the whole scene thats what makes kids want to read natural curiosity wrapped in mysticism irresistible agreed conklin i lost my faith and now after years of proclaiming my spiritual independence i wonder if im missing something like what comfort peter i have no comfort for what i dont know things i cant control maybe you mean you dont have the comfort of an excuse a metaphysical excuse sorry alex we part company were accountable for what we do and no confessional absolution can change that conklin turned his head his eyes wide open and looked at holland thank you he said for what for sounding like me even using a variation of the words ive used i came back from hong kong five years ago with the banner of accountability on my lance youve lost me forget it im back on track beware the pitfalls of ecclesiastical presumption and selfabsorbed thought who the hell said that either savonarola or salvador dali i cant remember who oh for christs sake cut the crap laughed holland why should i its the first chuckle weve had and what about your two sisters what happened to them its a better joke replied peter his head angled down into his chin a mischievous smile on his lips ones a nun in new delhi and the others president of her own public relations firm in new york and uses better yiddish than most of her colleagues in the profession a couple of years ago she told me they stopped calling her shiksa she loves her life so does my other sister in india yet you chose the military not yet alex and i chose it i was an angry young man who really believed this country was being dumped on i came from a privileged familymoney influence an expensive prep schoolthat guaranteed meme not the black kid on the streets of philadelphia or harlemautomatic admittance to annapolis i simply figured i had to somehow earn that privilege i had to show that people like me didnt just use our advantages to avoid but instead to extend our responsibilities aristocracy reborn said conklin noblesse obligenobility imposes obligations thats not fair protested holland yes it is in a very real sense in greek aristo means the best and kratia is the word for rule in ancient athens such young men led armies their swords up front not behind if only to prove to the troops that they would sacrifice with the lowliest of them for the lowliest were under their commands the commands of the finest peter hollands head arched back into the top of the velvet seat his eyes half closed maybe that was part of it im not sureim not sure at all we were asking so much for what pork chop hill unidentifiable useless terrain in the mekong why for christs sake why men shot their stomachs and chests blown away by an enemy two feet in front of them by a cong who knew jungles they didnt know what kind of war was that if guys like me didnt go up with the kids and say look here i am im with you how the hell do you think we could have lasted as long as we did there might have been mass revolts and maybe there should have been those kids were what some people call niggers and spics and the foulups who couldnt read or write beyond a thirdgrade level the privileged had defermentsdeferments from getting soiledor service that damn near guaranteed no combat the others didnt and if my being with themthis privileged son of a bitchmeant anything it was the best gig i ever did in my life holland suddenly stopped talking and shut his eyes im sorry peter i didnt mean to rough up past roads i really didnt actually i started with my guilt not yours its crazy how it all dovetails and feeds upon itself isnt it what did you call it the merrygoround of guilt where does it stop now said holland sitting up in the seat straightening his back and shoulders he picked up the limousine telephone punched two numbers and spoke drop us off in vienna please and when youve done that go find a chinese restaurant and bring us back the best theyve got frankly im partial to spare ribs and lemon chicken holland proved to be half right the first hearing of panovs session under the serum was agonizing to listen to the voice devastating the emotional content blurring the information especially for anyone who knew the psychiatrist the second hearing however produced instantaneous concentration engendered without question by the very pain they heard there was no time to indulge in personal feelings the information was suddenly everything both men began taking copious notes on legal pads frequently stopping and replaying numerous sections for clarity and understanding the third hearing refined the salient points further by the end of the fourth both alex and peter holland had thirty to forty pages of notes apiece they spent an additional hour in silence each going over his own analysis are you ready asked the cias director from the couch a pencil in his hand sure said conklin seated at the desk with his various electronic equipment the tape machine at his elbow any opening remarks yes replied alex ninetynine point fortyfour percent of what we listened to gives us nothing except to tell us what a terrific prober this walsh is he hopscotched around picking up cues faster than i could find them and i wasnt exactly an amateur when it came to interrogations agreed said holland i wasnt so bad either especially with a blunt instrument walsh is good better than that but that doesnt concern us what he pulled out of mo doesagain with a but its not in panovs recapturing what he revealed because we have to assume he revealed almost everything i told him instead its in what he repeated having heard conklin separated several pages heres an example the family will be pleased our supreme will give us his blessing hes repeating someone elses words not his own now mo isnt familiar with criminal jargon certainly not to the point where he would automatically make a connection but the connections there take the word supreme and change it by removing one vowel and inserting another supremocapo supremo hardly a heavenly supreme being suddenly the family is light years away from norman rockwell and blessing is interchangeable with a reward or a bonus mafia said peter his eyes steady and clear despite a number of drinks that had obviously been burned out of his system i hadnt thought that one through but i marked it instinctively okay heres something else along the same lines the same lines because i also picked up on the unlikepanov phrases holland flipped through his legal pad and stopped at a specific page here new york wants it all peter continued slapping over the pages again here that wall street is something once more the dci progressed through his legal pad and this one blondie fruitsthe rest is garbled i missed that i heard it but it didnt make any sense to me why should it mr aleksei konsolikov holland smiled underneath that anglosaxon exterior education and all beats the heart of a russian youre not sensitive to what some of us have to endure huh im a wasp and blondie fruits is but one more pejorative description given us by i must admit other trampledupon minorities think about it armbruster swayne atkinson burton teagartenblondies all and wall street certain firms in that originally wasp financial bastion at any rate medusa said alex nodding medusa and the mafia holy christ weve got a telephone number peter leaned forward on the couch it was in the ledger bourne brought out of swaynes house ive tried it remember its an answering machine thats all it is and thats enough we can get a location to what end whoever picks up the messages does it by remote and if he or she has half a brain its done from a public phone the relay is not only untraceable but capable of erasing all other messages so we cant tap in youre not very into high tech are you field man lets put it this way replied conklin i bought one of those vcrs so i could watch old movies and i cant figure out how to turn off the goddamn blinking clock i called the dealer and he said read the instructions on the interior panel i cant find the interior panel then let me explain what we can do to an answering machine we can jam it externally gee willikers sandy whats next for orphan annie what the hell is that going to do other than kill the source youre forgetting we have the location from the numbers oh someone has to come and repair the machine oh we take him and find out who sent him there you know peter youve got possibilities for a neophyte you understand your current outrageously undeserved position notwithstanding sorry i cant offer you a drink bryce ogilvie of the law firm ogilvie spofford crawford and cohen was dictating a highly complex reply to the justice departments antitrust division when his very private telephone line rang it rang only at his desk he picked up the phone pressed the green button and spoke rapidly hold on he ordered looking up at his secretary would you excuse me please certainly sir the secretary got out of her chair walked across the large impressive office and disappeared beyond the door yes what is it asked ogilvie returning to the phone the machine isnt working said the voice on the sacrosanct line what happened i dont know all i get is a busy signal thats the best equipment available perhaps someone was calling in when you called ive been trying for the past two hours theres a glitch even the best machines break down all right send someone up to check it out use one of the niggers naturally no white man would go up there it was shortly past midnight when bourne got off the métro in argenteuil he had divided the day into segments splitting the hours between the arrangements he had to make and looking for marie going from one arrondissement to another scouting every café every shop every large and small hotel he could recall having been a part of their fugitive nightmare thirteen years ago more than once he had gasped seeing a woman in the distance or across a caféthe back of a head a quick profile and twice a crown of dark red hair any of which from a distance or in a cafés dim light might have belonged to his wife none of these had turned out to be marie but he began to understand his own anxiety and by understanding it was better able to control it these were the most impossible parts of the day the rest was merely filled with difficulty and frustration alex where the hell was conklin he could not reach him in virginia because of the time difference he had counted on alex to take care of the details swiftly expediting the transfer of funds primarily the business day on the eastern seaboard of the united states began at four oclock paris time and the business day in paris stopped at five oclock or before paris time that left barely an hour to release and transfer over a million american dollars to one mr simon at his chosen bank in paris and that meant said mr simon had to make himself known to the aforementioned as yet unchosen paris bank bernardine had been helpful helpful hell he had made it possible theres a bank on the rue de grenelle that the deuxième frequently uses they can be accommodating in terms of hours and the absence of an authentic signature or two but they give nothing for nothing and they trust no one especially anyone associated with our benevolent socialist government you mean regardless of the teletypes if the moneys not there you dont get it not a sou the president himself could call and he would be told to pick it up in moscow where they firmly believe he belongs since i cant reach alex ive bypassed the bank in boston and called our man in the cayman islands where marie put the bulk of the money hes canadian and sos the bank hes waiting for instructions ill make a phone call are you at the pontroyal no ill call you back where are you i suppose you could say im an anxious and confused butterfly going from one vaguely remembered place to another you are looking for her yes but then that wasnt a question was it forgive me but in some ways i hope you do not find her thanks ill call you back in twenty minutes he had gone to yet another point of recall the trocadéro and the palais de chaillot he had been shot at in the past on one of the terraces there had been gunfire and men running down the endless stone steps intermittently obscured by the huge gilded statues and the great sprays of the fountains disappearing into the formal gardens finally out of sight out of range what had happened why did he remember the trocadéro but marie had been theresomewhere where had she been in that enormous complex where a terrace she had been on a terrace near a statuewhat statue descartes racine talleyrand the statue of descartes came to his mind first he would find it he had found it and there was no marie he had looked at his watch it had been nearly fortyfive minutes since he had talked to bernardine like the men in his inner screen he had raced down the steps to a telephone go to the banque normandie and ask for monsieur tabouri he understands that a monsieur simon intends to transfer over seven million francs from the caymans by way of voice authorization through his private banker in the islands he is most happy to let you use his phone but believe me hell charge you for the call thanks françois where are you now the trocadéro its crazy i have the damnedest feelings like vibrations but shes not there its probably the things i cant remember hell i may have taken a bullet here i simply dont know go to the bank he had done so and within thirtyfive minutes after his call to the caymans the oliveskinned perpetually smiling monsieur tabouri confirmed that his funds were in place he re quested francs in the largest notes possible they were delivered to him and the grinning obsequious banker took him confidentially aside away from the deskwhich was rather foolish as there was no one else in the officeand spoke quietly by a window there are some marvelous real estate opportunities in beirut believe me i know i am the expert on the middle east and these stupid conflagrations cannot last much longer mon dieu no one will be left alive it will once again rise as the paris of the mediterranean estates for a fraction of their value hotels for a ridiculous price it sounds interesting ill be in touch he had fled the banque normandie as if its confines held the germs of a lethal disease he had returned to the pontroyal and again tried to reach alex conklin in the united states it was then close to one oclock in the afternoon in vienna virginia and still all he had heard was an answering machine with alexs disembodied voice instructing the caller to leave a message for any number of reasons jason had chosen not to do so and now he was in argenteuil walking up the steps of the métro to the pavement where he would slowly cautiously make his way into the uglier streets and the vicinity of le coeur du soldat his instructions were clear he was not to be the man he was last night no limp no ragged castoff army clothing no image that anyone might recognize he was to be a simple laborer and reach the gates of the old closeddown refinery and smoke cigarettes while leaning against the wall this was to take place between and one oclock in the morning no sooner and no later when he had asked santoss messengersafter giving them several hundred francs for their inconveniencethe reason for these latenight precautions the less inhibited man had replied santos never leaves le coeur du soldat he left last evening for minutes only rejoined the more voluble messenger i understand bourne nodded but he had not understood he could only speculate was santos in some way the jackals prisoner confined to the sleazy café night and day it was a fascinating query in light of the managers size and sheer raw power both combined with a faraboveaverage intellect it was when jason in blue jeans cap and a dark tattered vnecked sweater reached the gates of the old factory he took out a pack of gauloise cigarettes and leaned against the wall lighting one with a match holding the flame longer than necessary before he blew it out his thoughts returned to the enigmatic santos the premier conduit in carloss army the most trusted satellite in the jackals orbit a man whose french might have been formed at the sorbonne yet santos was a latin american a venezuelan if bournes instincts had merit fascinating and santos wanted to see him with peace in his heart bravo amigo thought jason santos had reached a terrified ambassador in london with a question so loaded it made a political partys private poll look like the essence of nonpartisan neutrality atkinson had no choice but to state emphatically if not in panic that whatever instructions snake lady issued were to be carried out the power of snake lady was the ambassadors only protection his ultimate refuge so santos could bend that decision was rooted in intellect not loyalty not obligation the conduit wanted to crawl out of his sewer and with three million francs in the offing combined with a multitude of faraway places across the globe to choose from the conduits mind told him to listen to consider there were alternatives in life if opportunities were presented one had been presented to santos vassal to carlos whose fealty to his lord had perhaps run its suffocating course it was this instinctive projection that made bourne include in his pleacalmly but firmly the emphasis in understatementsuch phrases as you could travel disappear a wealthy man free of care and unpleasant drudgery the key words were free and disappear and santoss eyes had responded he was ready to take the threemillionfranc bait and bourne was perfectly happy to let him break the line and swim with it jason looked at his watch fifteen minutes had passed no doubt santoss minions were checking the streets a final inspection before the high priest of conduits appeared bourne thought briefly of marie of the sensations he felt at the trocadéro remembering old fontaines words when the two of them watched the paths of tranquility inn from the high storage room waiting for carlos hes near i feel it like the approach of distant thunder in a differentfar differentway jason had like feelings at the trocadéro enough santos the jackal his watch read one oclock and the two messengers from the pontroyal walked out of the alley and across the street to the gates of the old refinery santos will see you now said the voluble one i dont see him you are to come with us he does not leave le coeur du soldat why do i find that not to my liking theres no reason for such feelings he has peace in his heart what about his knife he has no knife no weapon he never carries either thats nice to hear lets go he has no need for such weapons added the messenger disquietingly he was escorted down the alley past the neonlit entrance to a barely negotiable break in the buildings one by one jason between the two men they made their way to the rear of the café where there was just about the last thing bourne expected to see in this rundown section of the city it was well an english garden a plot of ground perhaps thirty feet in length twenty in depth and trellises supporting a variety of flowering vines a barrage of color in the french moonlight thats quite a sight commented jason it didnt come about through neglect ah it is a passion with santos no one understands it but no one touches a single flower either fascinating bourne was led to a small outside elevator whose steel frame was attached to the stone wall of the building there was no other access in sight the conveyance barely held the three of them and once the iron gate was closed the silent messenger pressed a button in the darkness and spoke we are here santos camellia bring us up camellia asked jason he knows everything is all right if not my friend might have said lily or rose what would happen then you dont want to think about it i dont care to think about it naturally of course the outside elevator stopped with a disturbing double jerk and the quiet messenger opened a thick steel door that required his full weight to open bourne was led into the familiar room with the tasteful expensive furniture the bookcases and the single floor lamp that illuminated santos in his outsized armchair you may leave my friends said the large man addressing the messengers pick up your money from the faggot and for gods sake tell him to give rené and the american who calls himself ralph fifty francs apiece and get them out of here theyre pissing in the corners say the moneys from their friend from last night who forgot about them oh shit exploded jason you did forget didnt you santos grinned ive had other things on my mind yes sir yes santos the two messengers instead of heading for the back of the room and the elevator opened a door in the left wall and disappeared bourne looked after them bewildered there is a staircase leading to our kitchen such as it is said santos answering jasons unspoken question the door can be opened from this side not from the steps below except by me sit down monsieur simon you are my guest how is your head the swellings gone down thank you bourne sat on the large couch sinking into the pillows it was not an authoritative position nor was it not meant to be i understand you have peace in your heart and a desire for three million francs in the avaricious section of that heart then you were satisfied with your call to london no one could have programmed that man into reacting the way he did there is a snake lady and she instills extraordinary devotion and fear in high placeswhich means that female serpent is not without power thats what i tried to tell you your word is accepted now let me recapitulate your request your demand as it were my restrictions interrupted jason very well your restrictions agreed santos you and you alone must reach the blackbird correct its an absolute again i must ask why speaking frankly you already know too much more than my clients realize but then none of them was about to lose his own life on the second floor of a café in argenteuil they want nothing to do with you they want no traces and in that area youre vulnerable how santos crashed his fist against the arm of the chair an old man in paris with a police record who tried to warn a member of the assembly that he was to be assassinated he was the one who mentioned the blackbird he was the one who spoke of le coeur du soldat fortunately our man heard him and silently passed the word to my clients but thats not good enough how many other old men in paris in their senile delusions may mention le coeur du soldatand you no you can have nothing to do with my clients even through you i disappear you dont although in all honesty i believe you should think about doing so here i brought you something bourne sat forward on the couch and reached into his back pocket he pulled out a roll of tightly wound franc notes held together by a thick elastic band he threw it over to santos who caught it effortlessly in midair two hundred thousand francs on accounti was authorized to give this to you on a bestefforts basis you give me the information i need i deliver it to london and whether or not the blackbird accepts my clients offer you still receive the balance of the three million but you could disappear before then couldnt you have me watched as youve been doing have me followed to london and back ill even call you with the names of the airlines and the flight numbers what could be fairer one thing more could be fairer monsieur simon replied santos pushing his immense frame out of the chair and baronially striding to a card table against the lacquered brick wall of his flat if you will please come over here jason rose from the couch and walked over to the card table instantly astonished youre thorough arent you i try to be oh dont blame the concierges they belong to you im much further below scale chambermaids and stewards are more to my liking theyre not so spoiled and nobody really misses them if they dont show up one day spread across the table were bournes three passports courtesy of cactus in washington as well as the gun and the knife taken from him last night youre very convincing but it doesnt solve anything does it well see answered santos ill accept your money nowfor my best effortsbut instead of your flying to london have london fly to paris tomorrow morning when he arrives at the pontroyal youll call meill give you my private number of courseand well play the soviets game exchange for exchange like walking across a bridge with our respective prisoners in tow the money for the information youre crazy santos my clients dont expose themselves that way you just lost the rest of the three million why not try them they could always hire a blind couldnt they an innocent tourist with a false bottom in his or her louis vuitton carryon no alarms are set off with paper try it it is the only way youll get what you want monsieur ill do what i can said bourne here is my telephone santos picked up a prearranged card from the table with numbers scrawled across it call me when london arrives in the meantime i assure you you will be watched youre a real swell guy ill escort you to the elevator marie sat up in bed sipping hot tea in the dark room listening to the sounds of paris outside the windows not only was sleep impossible but it was intolerable a waste of time when every hour counted she had taken the earliest flight from marseilles to paris and had gone directly to the meunce on the rue de rivoli the same hotel where she had waited thirteen years ago waited for a man to listen to reason or lose his life and in doing so losing a large part of hers she had ordered a pot of tea then and he had come back to her she ordered tea now from the night floor steward absently perhaps as if the repeated ritual might bring about a repetition of his appearance so long ago oh god she had seen him it was no illusion no mistake it was david she had left the hotel at midmorning and begun wandering going down the list she had made on the plane heading from one location to another without any logical sequence in mind simply following the succession of places as they had come to herthat was her sequence it was a lesson she had learned from jason bourne thirteen years ago when running or hunting analyze your options but remember your first its usually the cleanest and the best most of the time youll take it so she had followed the list from the pier of the bateau mouche at the base of the avenue george v to the bank on the madeleine to the trocadéro she had wandered aimlessly along the terraces of the last as if in a trance looking for a statue she could not remember jostled by the intermittent groups of tourists led by loud officious guides the huge statues all began to look alike she had felt lightheaded the late august sun was blinding she was about to sit down on a marble bench remembering yet another dictate from jason bourne rest is a weapon suddenly up ahead she saw a man wearing a cap and a dark vnecked sweater he had turned and raced toward the palatial stone steps that led to the avenue gustave v she knew that run that stride she knew it better than anyone how often had she watched himfrequently from behind bleachers sight unseenas he had pounded around the university track ridding himself of the furies that had gripped him it was david she had leaped up from the bench and raced after him david david its me jason she had collided with a tour guide leading a group of japanese the man was incensed she was furious so she furiously pummeled her way through the astonished orientals the majority shorter than she was but her superior sight lines were no help her husband had disappeared where had he gone into the gardens into the street with the crowds and the traffic from the pont diéna for christs sake where jason she had screamed at the top of her voice jason come back people had looked at her some with the empathetic glances of lovers burned most simply disapproving she had run down the neverending steps to the street spendinghow long a time she could not recallsearching for him finally in exhaustion she had taken a taxi back to the meurice in a daze she reached her room and fell on the bed refusing to let the tears come it was no time for tears it was a time for a brief rest and food energy to be restored the lessons of jason bourne then back into the streets the hunt to continue and as she lay there staring at the wall she felt a swelling in her chest in her lungs perhaps and it was accompanied by a sense of passive elation as she was looking for david he was looking for her her husband had not run away even jason bourne had not run away neither part of the same man could have seen her there had been another unknown reason for the sudden hurried exit from the trocadéro but there was only one reason for his being at the trocadéro he too was searching what memories he had of paris thirteen years ago he too understood that somewhere someplace in those memories he would find her she had rested ordered room service and two hours later gone out again into the streets now at the moment as she drank her tea she could not wait for the light to come the day ahead was meant for searching bernardine mon dieu it is four oclock in the morning so i can assume you have something vital to tell this seventyyearold man ive got a problem i think you have many problems but i suppose its a minor distinction what is it im as close as i can be but i need an end man please speak clearer english or if you will far clearer french it must be an american term this end man but then you have so many esoteric phrases im sure someone sits in langley and thinks them up come on i havent time for your bon mots you come on my friend im not trying to be clever im trying to wake up there my feet are on the floor and a cigarettes in my mouth now what is it my access to the jackal expects an englishman to fly over from london this morning with two million eight hundred thousand francs far less than you have at your disposal i assume interrupted bernardine the banque normandie was accommodating was it not very the moneys there and that tabouri of yours is a beaut he tried to sell me real estate in beirut that tabouri is a thiefbut beirut is interesting please sorry go ahead im being watched so i cant go to the bank and i dont have any englishman to bring what i cant get to the pontroyal thats your problem yes are you willing to part with say fifty thousand francs what for tabouri i suppose so you signed papers of course of course sign another paper handwritten by you and also signed releasing the money to wait a moment i must go to my desk there was silence on the line as bernardine obviously went to another room in his flat his voice returned allo im here oh this is lovely intoned the former deuxième specialist i sank him in his sailboat off the shoals of the costa brava the sharks had a feeding frenzy he was so fat and delectable the name is antonio scarzi a sardinian who traded drugs for information but you know nothing about that of course of course bourne repeated the last name spelling it out correct seal the envelope rub a pencil or a pen over your thumb and press your prints along the seal then give it to the concierge for mr scarzi understood what about the englishman this morning its only a few hours away the englishman is not a problem the morning isthe few hours are its a simple matter to transfer funds from one bank to anotherbuttons are pressed computers instantly crosscheck the data and poof figures are entered on paper its quite another thing to collect nearly three million francs in cash and your access certainly wont accept pounds or dollars for fear of being caught exchanging them or depositing them add to this the problem of collecting notes large enough to be part of a bundle small enough to be concealed from customs inspectors your access mon ami has to be aware of these difficulties jason looked aimlessly at the wall his thoughts on bernardines words you think hes testing me he has to the money could be gotten together from the foreign departments of different banks a small private plane could hop across the channel and land in a pasture where a cars waiting to bring the man to paris bien of course however these logistics take time even for the most influential people dont make it all appear too simple that would be suspect keep your access informed as to the progress being made emphasizing the secrecy how there can be no risk of exposure explain the delays if there were none he might think its a trap i see what you mean it comes down to what you just saiddont make it seem so easy because thats not credible theres something else mon ami a chameleon may be many things in daylight still he is safer in darkness you forgot something said bourne what about the englishman tallyho old chap said bernardine the operation went as smoothly as any jason had ever engineered or been witness to perhaps thanks to the flair of a resentful talented man who had been sent to the pastures too soon while throughout the day bourne made progress calls to santos bernardine had someone other than himself pick up the sealed instructions from the concierge and bring them to him at which point he made his appointment with monsieur tabouri shortly after fourthirty in the afternoon the deuxième veteran walked into the pontroyal dressed in a dark pinstriped suit so obviously british that it screamed savile row he went to the elevator and eventually after two wrong turns reached bournes room heres the money he said dropping the attaché case on the floor and going straight to jasons hotel wet bar he removed two miniature bottles of tanqueray gin snapped them open and poured the liquor into a questionably clean glass a votre santé he added swallowing half his drink before breathing heavily through his mouth and then rapidly swallowing the rest i havent done anything like that in years you havent frankly no i had others do such things its far too dangerous nevertheless tabouri is forever in your debt and frankly hes convinced me i should look into beirut what of course i havent your resources but a percentage of forty years of les fonds de contingence have found their way to geneva on my behalf im not a poor man you may be a dead man if they pick you up leaving here oh but i shant go said bernardine once again searching the small refrigerator i shall stay in this room until you have concluded your business françois ripped open two additional bottles and poured them into his glass now perhaps my old heart will beat slower he added as he walked to the inadequate desk placed his drink on the blotter and proceeded to take out two automatics and three grenades from his pockets placing them all in a row in front of his glass yes i will relax now what the hell is thatare they cried jason i think you americans call it deterrence replied bernardine although i frankly believe both you and the soviets are playing with yourselves as you both put so much money into weaponry that doesnt work now i come from a different era when you go out to do your business you will leave the door open if someone comes down that narrow corridor he will see a grenade in my hand that is not nuclear abstraction that is deterrence ill buy it said bourne going to the door i want to get this over with out on montalembert jason walked to the corner and as he had done at the old factory in argenteuil leaned against the wall and lit a cigarette he waited his posture casual his mind in high gear a man walked across from the bisecting rue du bac toward him it was the talkative messenger from last night he approached his hand in his jacket pocket wheres the money said the man in french wheres the information answered bourne the money first thats not the arrangement without warning jason grabbed the minion from argenteuil by his lapel yanking him forward off his feet bourne whipped up his free hand and gripped the messengers throat his fingers digging into the mans flesh you go back and tell santos hes got a oneway ticket to hell i dont deal this way enough said the low voice its owner rounding the corner on jasons right the huge figure of santos approached let him go simon he is nothing it is now only you and me i thought you never left le coeur du soldat youve changed that havent you apparently bourne released the messenger who looked at santos with a gesture of his large head the man raced away your englishman arrived said santos when they were alone he carried a valise i saw for myself he arrived carrying a valise agreed jason so london capitulates no london is very anxious the stakes are very high and thats all ill say about it the information please let us first again define the procedure shall we weve defined it several times you give me the information my client tells me to act upon it and if satisfactory contact is made i bring you the remainder of the three million francs you say satisfactory contact what will satisfy you how will you know the contact is firm how do i know that you will not claim it is unsatisfactory and steal my money when indeed you have made the connection your clients have paid for youre a suspicious fellow arent you oh very suspicious our world mr simon is not peopled with saints is it perhaps more than you realize that would astonish me please answer my questions all right ill try how will i know the contacts firm thats easy ill simply know because its my business to know its what im paid for and a man in my position does not make mistakes at this level and live to apologize ive refined the process done my research and ill ask two or three questions myself then ill knowone way or another thats an elusive reply in our world mr santos being elusive is hardly a negative is it as to your concern that i would lie to you and take your money let me assure you i dont cultivate enemies like you and the network your blackbird obviously controls any more than i would make enemies of my clients that way is madness and a much shorter life i admire your perspicacity as well as your caution said the jackals intermediary the bookcases didnt lie youre a learned man thats neither here nor there but i have certain credentials appearances can be a liability as well as an asset what i am about to tell you mr simon is known by only four men on the face of the earth all of whom speak french fluently how you wish to use that information is up to you however if you even hint at argenteuil ill know it instantly and you will never leave the pontroyal alive the contact can be made so quickly with a telephone number but you will not place the call for at least an hour from the moment we part if you do again i will know it and again i tell you youre a dead man an hour agreed only three other people have this number why not pick one youre not particularly fond of so i might peripherally allude to himif its necessary santos permitted himself a small flat smile moscow he said softly high up in dzerzhinsky square the kgb the blackbird is building a cadre in moscow always moscow its an obsession with him ilich ramirez sanchez thought bourne trained at novgorod dismissed by the komitet as a maniac the jackal ill bear it in mindif its called for the number please santos recited it twice along with the words bourne was to say he spoke slowly obviously impressed that bourne wrote nothing down is it all clear indelibly no pencil or paper required if everything goes as i trust it will how do you want me to get you the money phone me youve got my number i will leave argenteuil and come to you and never return to argenteuil good luck santos something tells me you deserve it no one more so i have drunk the hemlock far too many times socrates said jason not directly platos dialogues to be precise au revoir santos walked away and bourne his chest pounding headed back to the pontroyal desperately suppressing his desire to run a running man is an object of curiosity a target a lesson from the cantos of jason bourne bernardine he yelled racing down the narrow deserted hallway to his room all too aware of the open door and the old man seated at the desk a grenade in one hand a gun in the other put the hardware away weve hit pay dirt whos paying asked the deuxième veteran as jason closed the door i am answered bourne if this works out the way i think it will you can add to your account in geneva i do not do what im doing for that my friend it has never been a consideration i know but as long as were passing out francs like were printing them in the garage why shouldnt you get a fair share i cant argue with that either an hour announced jason fortythree minutes now to be exact for what to find out if its real actually real bourne fell on the bed his arms behind his head on the pillow his eyes alive write this down françois jason recited the telephone number given him by santos buy bribe or threaten every highlevel contact youve ever had in the paris telephone service but get me the location of that number its not such an expensive request yes it is countered bourne hes got it guarded inviolate he wouldnt do it any other way only four people in his entire network have it then perhaps we do not go highlevel but instead far lower to the ground underground actually into the tunnels of the telephone service beneath the streets jason snapped his head over at bernardine i hadnt thought of that why should you you are not deuxième the technicians are the source not the bureaucrats behind the desks i know several i will find one and give him a quiet call at home later tonight tonight broke in bourne raising himself off the bed it will cost a thousand francs or so but youll get the location of the telephone i cant wait until later tonight then you add a risk by trying to reach such a man at work these men are monitored no one trusts anyone in the telephone service its the socialists paradox give its laboring forces responsibility but no individual authority hold it said jason from the bed you have the home phone numbers right theyre in the book yes these people dont keep private listings have someones wife call an emergency someones got to get home bernardine nodded his head not bad my friend not bad at all the minutes turned into quarter hours as the retired deuxième officer went to work unctuously with promises of reward for the wives of telephone technicians if they would do what he asked them to do two hung up on him three turned him down with epithets born of the suspicious paris curbsides but the sixth amid obscenities declared why not as long as the rodent she had married understood that the money was hers the hour was over and jason left the hotel walking slowly deliberately down the pavement crossing four streets until he saw a public phone on the quai voltaire by the seine a blanket of darkness was slowly floating down over paris the boats on the river and the bridges dotted with lights as he approached the red kiosk he breathed steadily inhaling deeply exercising a control over himself that he never thought possible he was about to place the most important phone call of his life but he could not let the jackal know that if indeed it was the jackal he went inside inserted the coin and dialed yes it was a womans voice the french oui sharp and harsh a parisienne blackbirds circle in the sky said bourne repeating santoss words in french they make a great deal of noise all but one he is silent where do you call from here in paris but i am not from paris from where then where the winters are far colder answered jason feeling the moisture on his hairline control control it is urgent that i reach a blackbird the line was suddenly filled with silence a sonic void and bourne stopped breathing then came the voice low steady and as hollow as the previous silence we speak to a muscovite the jackal it was the jackal the smooth swift french could not hide the latino trace i did not say that answered bourne his own french dialect was one he employed frequently with the guttural tinge of gascony i merely said the winters were colder than paris who is this someone who is considered by someone who knows you sufficiently impressive to be given this number along with the proper words to go with it i can offer you the contract of your career of your life the fee is immaterialname your ownbut those who pay are among the most powerful men in the united states they control much of american industry as well as that countrys financial institutions and have direct access to the nerve centers of the government this is also a very strange call very unorthodox if youre not interested ill forget this number and go elsewhere im merely the broker a simple yes or no will suffice i do not commit to things i know nothing about to people i never heard of youd recognize their positions if i were at liberty to reveal them believe that however im not seeking a commitment only your interest at this point if the answer is yes i can reveal more if its no well i tried but am forced to go elsewhere the newspapers say he was in brussels only yesterday ill find him there was a short sharp intake of breath at the mention of brussels and the unspoken jason bourne yes or no blackbird silence finally the jackal spoke call me back in two hours he ordered hanging up the phone it was done jason leaned against the pay phone the sweat pouring down his face and breaking out on his neck the pontroyal he had to get back to bernardine it was carlos he announced closing the door and crossing directly to the bedside phone while taking santoss card out of his pocket he dialed in seconds he spoke the birds confirmed he said give me a name any name the pause was brief ive got it the merchandise will be left with the concierge itll be locked and taped count it and send my passports back to me have your best boy pick everything up and call off the dogs they could lead a blackbird to you jason hung up and turned to bernardine the telephone number is in the fifteenth arrondissement said the deuxième veteran our man knew that or at least assumed it when i gave it to him whats he going to do go back into the tunnels and refine things further will he call us here fortunately he drives a motorbike he said he would be back at work in ten minutes or so and reach us by this room number within the hour perfect not entirely he wants five thousand francs he could have asked ten times that whats within the hour how long before he calls you were gone perhaps thirty thirtyfive minutes and he reached me shortly after you left id say within the next half hour the telephone rang twenty seconds later they had an address on the boulevard lefebvre im leaving said jason bourne taking bernardines automatic off the desk and putting two grenades in his pocket do you mind be my guest replied the deuxième reaching under his jacket and removing a second weapon from his belt pickpockets so abound in paris one should always carry a backup but what for ive got at least a couple of hours and i want to look around alone how else if we call for support i risk being gunned down or spending the rest of my life in jail for an assassination in belgium i had nothing to do with former judge of the first circuit court in boston the once honorable brendan patrick prefontaine watched the weeping disconsolate randolph gates as he sat forward on the couch at the ritzcarlton hotel his face in his widespread hands oh good christ how the mighty fall with such a thud of finality observed brendan pouring himself a short bourbon on the rocks so you got snookered randy french style your facile brain and your imperial presence didnt help you very much when you saw paree huh you should have stayed down on the farm soldier boy my god prefontaine you dont know what it was like i was setting up a cartelparis bonn london and new york with the far east labor marketsan enterprise worth billions when i was taken from the plazaathénée and put in a car and blindfolded then i was thrown into a plane and flown to marseilles where the most horrible things happened to me i was kept in a room and every few hours i was injectedfor over six weeks women were brought in films takeni wasnt myself maybe you were the self you never recognized dandy boy the same self that learned to anticipate instant gratification if i use the phrase correctly make your clients extraordinary profits on paper which they trade on the exchanges while thousands of jobs are lost in buyouts oh yes my dear royalist thats instant gratification youre wrong judge so lovely to hear that term again thank you randy the unions became too strong industry was being crippled many companies had to go overseas to survive and not talk oddly enough you may have a point but you never considered an alternative regardless we stray you emerged from your confinement in marseilles an addict and of course there were the films of the eminent attorney in compromising situations what could i do screamed gates i was ruined we know what you did you became this jackals confidence man in the world of high finance a world where competition is undesirable baggage better lost along the way its how he found me to begin with the cartel we were forming was opposed by japanese and taiwanese interests they hired him oh my god hell kill me again asked the judge what you forget he thinks youre already deadthanks to me i have cases coming up a congressional hearing next week hell know im alive not if you dont show up i have to my clients expect then i agree interrupted prefontaine hell kill you sorry about that randy what am i going to do theres a way dandy boy not only out of your current dilemma but for years to come of course it will require some sacrifice on your part for starters a long convalescence at a private rehabilitation center but even before that your complete cooperation right now the first ensures your imminent disappearance the secondthe capture and elimination of carlos the jackal youll be free randy anything how do you reach him i have a telephone number gates fumbled for his wallet yanking it out of his pocket and with trembling fingers digging into a recess only four people alive have it prefontaine accepted his first anhour fee instructed randy to go home beg ediths forgiveness and be prepared to leave boston tomorrow brendan had heard of a private treatment center in minneapolis he thought where the rich sought help incognito he would refine the details in the morning and call him naturally expecting a second payment for his services the instant a shaken gates left the room prefontaine went to the phone and called john st jacques at tranquility inn john its the judge dont ask me questions but i have urgent information that could be invaluable to your sisters husband i realize i cant reach him but i know hes dealing with someone in washington his name is alex conklin interrupted st jacques wait a minute judge marie wrote the number down on the desk blotter let me get over there the sound of one phone being placed on a hard surface preceded the clicks of another being picked up here it is maries brother recited the number ill explain everything later thank you john an awful lot of people keep telling me that goddamn it said st jacques prefontaine dialed the number with a virginia area code it was answered with a short brusque yes mr conklin my name is prefontaine and i was given this number by john st jacques what i have to tell you is in the nature of an emergency youre the judge broke in alex past tense im afraid very past what is it i know how to reach the man you call the jackal what listen to me bernardine stared at the ringing telephone briefly debating with himself whether or not to pick it up there was no question he had to yes jason its you isnt it perhaps i have the wrong room alex this is you françois what are you doing there wheres jason things have happened so fast i know hes been trying to reach you its been a rough day weve got panov back thats good news ive got other news a telephone number where the jackal can be reached weve got it and a location our man left an hour ago for christs sake how did you get it a convoluted process i sincerely believe only your man could have negotiated hes brilliantly imaginative a true caméléon lets compare said conklin whats yours bernardine complied reciting the number he had written down on bournes instructions the silence on the phone was a silent scream theyre different said alex finally his voice choked theyre different a trap said the deuxième veteran god in heaven its a trap twice bourne had passed the dark quiet row of old stone houses on the boulevard lefebvre in the concrete backwater of the fifteenth arrondissement he then doubled back to the rue dalésia and found a sidewalk café the outdoor tables their candles flickering under glass were peopled mostly by gesturing argumentative students from the nearby sorbonne and montparnasse it was nearing ten oclock and the aproned waiters were growing irritable the majority of customers were not full of largess either in their hearts or in their pockets jason wanted only a strong espresso but the perpetual scowl on the face of the approaching garçon convinced him he would get mud if he ordered only the coffee so he added the most expensive brandy he could recall by name as the waiter returned to the service bar jason pulled out his small notebook and ballpoint pen shutting his eyes for a moment then opening them and sketching out everything he could envision from the row of houses on his inner screen there were three structures of two attached houses each separated by two narrow alleyways each double complex was three stories high each front entrance reached by climbing a steep flight of brick steps and at either end of the row were vacant lots covered with rubble the remains of demolished adjacent buildings the address of the jackals buried telephone numberthe address was available in the underground tunnels solely for repair purposeswas the final structure on the right and it took no imagination to know he occupied the entire building if not the entire row carlos was the consummate selfprotector so one had to assume that his paris command post would be a fortress employing every human and electronic security device that loyalty and high technology could provide and the seemingly isolated all but deserted section of the outlying fifteenth arrondissement served his purposes far better than any crowded section of the city for that reason bourne had first paid a drunken tramp to walk with him during his initial foray past the houses he himself limping unsteadily in the shadows beside his companion and for his second appraisal he had hired a middleaged whore as his cover with no limp or stagger in his gait he knew the terrain now for all the good it did him but it was the beginning of the end he swore himself to that the waiter arrived with his espresso and the cognac and only when jason placed a hundredfranc note on the table accompanied by a wave of his hand did the mans hostile countenance move to neutral ground merci he mumbled is there a pay phone nearby asked bourne removing an additional tenfranc note down the street fifty sixty meters replied the waiter his eyes on the new money nothing closer jason peeled off another note twenty francs im calling right here within a few blocks come with me said the aproned garçon gingerly picking up the franc notes and leading bourne through the open doors of the café to a cashier seated on high at the far end of the restaurant the gaunt sallowfaced woman looked annoyed obviously she assumed that bourne was a discontented customer let him use your telephone said the waiter why spat out the harridan so he can call china he calls up the street he will pay jason proffered a tenfranc note his innocent eyes looking blankly at the highly suspicious woman augh take it she said removing a phone from under her cashregister stand and grasping the money it has an extension so you can move to the wall as they all do men business and the bed its all you think about he dialed the pontroyal and asked for his room expecting bernardine to pick up on the first or second ring by the fourth he was concerned by the eighth he was profoundly disturbed bernardine was not there had santos no the deuxième veteran was armed and knew how to use his deterrencethere would have been at the least loud gunfire at the last a room blown apart by a grenade bernardine had left under his own control why there could be any one of several reasons thought bourne handing back the telephone and returning to his table outside the first and most wished for was news of marie the old intelligence officer would not raise false hopes by detailing the nets he had spread throughout the city but they were there jason was sure of it bourne could not think of another reason so it was best not to think about bernardine he had other pressing considerations the most intensely pressing of his life he returned to the strong coffee and his notebook every detail had to be exact an hour later he finished his espresso taking a sip of the cognac and spilling the rest on the pavement under the usual soiled red tablecloth he left the café and the rue dalésia turning right and walking slowly as a far older man might walk toward the boulevard lefebvre the closer he came to the last corner the more he became aware of the undulating erratic sounds from apparently different directions sirens the twonote sirens of the paris police what had happened what was happening jason abandoned his elderly gait and ran to the edge of the building fronting the lefebvre and the row of old stone houses instantly he was in shock fury and astonishment joining together in panic what were they doing five patrol cars converged on the row of stone houses each successively screeching to a halt in front of the structure on the right then a large black police van appeared swinging directly around to face the two entrances of the building its searchlight shooting out as a squad of blackuniformed men with automatic weapons leaped into the street and took up crouching attack positions only partially concealed by the patrol carsan assault was in the making fools goddamned fools to give carlos a warning was to lose the jackal killing was his profession escape his obsession thirteen years ago bourne had been told that carloss huge retreat in the village hills of vitrysurseine outside paris had more false walls and concealed staircases than a noblemans loire château in the time of louis xiv the fact that no one had ever determined which estate it was or whom it was assigned to did not vitiate the all too acceptable rumors and with three supposedly separated structures on the boulevard lefebvre it was also all too acceptable to presuppose hidden underground tunnels linking each to the others for christs sake who had done this had a terrible error been made had he and bernardine been so obtuse as to think the deuxième or peter hollands paris station of the cia had overlooked tapping into his pontroyal telephone or bribed or enlisted the various relays of operators on the hotels switchboard if so that obtuseness was rooted in an absolute it was next to impossible to tap a phone on short notice in a relatively small hotel without being detected technology required a stranger on the premises and bribe money spread around was countered with larger bribes by the subject under surveillance santos bugs placed in the room by a chambermaid or a bellman not likely the huge conduit to the jackal especially if he had reneged on their contract would not expose the jackal who how the questions burned into jasons imagination as he watched in horror and dismay the scene taking place on the boulevard lefebvre on police authority all residents will evacuate the building the orders over the loudspeaker metallically echoed throughout the street you have one minute before we take aggressive procedures what aggressive procedures screamed bourne into the silent void of his mind youve lost him ive lost him insanity who why the door at the top of the brick steps on the left side of the building opened first a petrified man short obese in an undershirt his trousers held up by suspenders cautiously walked out into the flood of the searchlight spreading his hands in front of his face and turning his head away from the blinding beam what is it messieurs he cried his voice tremulous i am merely a bakera good bakerbut i know nothing about this street except that the rent is cheap is that a crime to the police our concerns are not with you monsieur continued the amplified voice not with me you say you arrive here like an army frightening my wife and children into thinking it is their last minutes on earth and yet you say we dont concern you what kind of reasoning is that we live among fascists hurry up thought jason for gods sake hurry every second is a minute in escape time an hour for the jackal the door above the flight of brick steps on the right now opened and a nun in the full flowing black robe of a religious habit appeared she stood defiantly in the frame no fear whatsoever in her almost operatic voice how dare you she roared these are the hours of vespers and you intrude better you should be asking forgiveness for your sins than interrupting those who plead with god for theirs nicely said sister intoned the unimpressed police officer over the loudspeaker but we have other information and we respectfully insist on searching your house if you refuse we shall disrespectfully carry out our orders we are the magdalen sisters of charity exclaimed the nun these are the sacrosanct quarters of women devoted to christ we respect your position sister but we are still coming inside if what you say is so im sure the authorities will make a generous contribution to your cause youre wasting time screamed bourne to himself hes getting away then may your souls be damned for transgression but come ahead and invade this holy ground really sister asked another official over the loudspeaker i dont believe theres anything in the canons that gives you the right to condemn souls to hell on such a flimsy excuse go ahead monsieur inspector under the habit you may find lingerie more suited to the faubourg he knew that voice it was bernardine what had happened was bernardine no friend after all was it all an act the smooth talk of a traitor if so there would be another death that night the blackuniformed squad of antiterrorists their automatic weapons bolted into firing mode raced to the base of the brick steps as the gendarmes blocked off the boulevard lefebvre north and south while the red and blue lights of the patrol cars incessantly blinked their bright warnings to all beyond the area stay away may i go inside screamed the baker no one replied so the obese man ran through his door clutching his trousers an official in civilian clothes the obvious leader of the assault joined his invading unit on the pavement below the steps with a nod of his head he and his men raced up the brick staircase through the door held open by the defiant nun jason held his place at the edge of the building his body pressed against the stone the sweat pouring from his hairline and his neck his eyes on the incomprehensible scene being played out on the lefebvre he knew the who now but why was it true was the man most trusted by alex conklin and himself in reality another pair of eyes and ears for the jackal christ he did not want to believe it twelve minutes passed and with the reemergence of pariss version of a swat team and its leader several members bowing and kissing the hand of the real or wouldbe abbess bourne understood that his and conklins instincts had been on true course bernardine screamed the official approaching the first patrol car you are finished out never are you to talk to the lowest recruit in the deuxième even the man who cleans the toilets you are ostracized if i had my way youd be shot international murder in the boulevard lefebvre a friend of the bureau an agent we must protect a fucking nunnery you miserable son of a bitch shit a nunnery get out of my car you smelly pig get out before a weapon goes off by mistake and your stomachs on the street where it belongs bernardine lurched out of the patrol car his old unsteady legs barely able to maintain balance twice falling into the street jason waited wanting to rush to his friend but knowing he had to wait the patrol cars and the van raced away still bourne had to wait his eyes alternately watching bernardine and the front entrance of the jackals house and it was the jackals house the nun proved it carlos could never let go of his lost faith he consistently used it as a viable cover but it was much more than that much more bernardine staggered into the shadows of a longabandoned storefront across from the house on the boulevard lefebvre jason breached the corner and ran down the pavement racing into the recess and grabbing the deuxième veteran as he leaned against a long glass window breathing heavily for gods sake what happened cried bourne supporting bernardine by both shoulders easy mon ami choked bernardine the pig i sat next toa politician no doubt looking for an issuepunched me in the chest before he threw me out of the car i told you i dont know all the new people who attach themselves to the bureau these days you have the same problems in america so please do not give me a lecture its the last thing im about to do this is the house bernardine right here right in front of us this is also a trap what alex and i confirmed it the telephone numbers were different i gather you did not make your call to carlos as he instructed you to no i had the address and i wanted him stretched whats the difference this is the house oh this is where your mr simon was to go and if he was truly mr simon he would be taken to another rendezvous but if he was not monsieur simon but someone else then he would be shotproofanother corpse in search of the jackal youre wrong insisted jason shaking his head and speaking quietly rapidly this may be a detour but carlos is still on the switch hes not going to allow anyone to waste me but himself thats his commandment as yours is regarding him yes i have a family he has a borderline legend mine is complete for me but his is a vacuumwithout any real meaning for him any longer hes gone as far as he can go the only way he can go further is to move into my territorydavid webbs territoryand eliminate jason bourne webb david webb who in the name of almighty god is that me replied bourne smiling forlornly and leaning beside bernardine against the window its nuts isnt it nuts cried the former deuxième it is fou insane not to be believed believe it you are a family man with children and you do this work alex never told you if he did so i passed it off as a coverone goes along with anything shaking his head the older man looked up at his taller companion you really have a family whom you do not wish to escape from on the contrary i want to get back to them as soon as i can theyre the only people on earth i really care about but you are jason bourne the killer chameleon the deepest recesses of the criminal world tremble at your name oh come on thats a bit much even from you not for an instant you are bourne second only to the jackal no shouted the suddenly forgotten david webb hes no match for me ill take him ill kill him very well very well mon ami said bernardine calmly reassuringly staring at the man he could not understand what do you want me to do jason bourne turned and breathed heavily against the glass window for several momentsand then through the mists of indecision the chameleons strategy became clear he swung around and looked across the dark street at the stone building on the right the police are gone he said quietly of course i realize that did you also realize that no one from the other two buildings came outside yet there are lights on in a number of the windows i was preoccupied what can i say i did not notice bernardine raised his eyebrows in sudden recollection but there were faces at the windows several faces i saw them yet no one came outside very understandable the police men with weapons racing around best to barricade oneself no even after the police and the weapons and the patrol cars have left they all just go back to their television sets as if nothing had happened no one comes out to check with the neighbors thats not natural françois its not even unnaturally natural its been orchestrated what do you mean how one man walks out on the porch and shouts into a searchlight attention is drawn to him and precious seconds of a minutes warning evaporate then a nun emerges on the other side draping herself in holy indignationmore seconds lost more hours for carlos the assaults mounted and the deuxième comes up with zero and when its all over everythings back to normalan abnormal normalcy a job was done according to a predesigned plan so theres no call for really normal curiosityno gathering in the street no excitement not even a collective postcrisis indignation simply people inside undoubtedly checking with one another doesnt it all tell you something bernardine nodded a prearranged strategy carried out by professionals said the veteran field officer thats what i think too its what you saw and i did not countered bernardine stop being kind jason ive been too long away from the cold too soft too old too unimaginative so have i said bourne its just that the stakes are so high for me that i have to force myself into thinking like a man i wanted to forget this is monsieur webb speaking i guess it is so where does that leave us with an irate baker and an angry nun and if they prove to be ciphers several faces in various windows at this juncture the pickings are ours but that wont last long i doubt through the morning i beg your pardon carlos will close up shop here and hell do it quickly he hasnt got a choice now someone in his praetorian guard gave someone else the location of his paris headquarters and you can bet your pensionif youve still got onethat hes climbing the walls trying to figure out who betrayed him get back cried bernardine interrupting and grabbing jason by the cloth of his black jacket yanking him into the farthest recess of the dark storefront get out of sight flat on the pavement both men threw themselves down lying prone on the broken concrete bournes face against the short wall below the glass his head angled to see the street a second dark van appeared from the right but it was not police equipment instead it was shinier and smaller somehow thicker lower to the ground and more powerful the one glaring blinding similarity it had to the police van was the searchlight no not one but two searchlights one on either side of the windshield both beams swinging back and forth scanning the vehicles flanks jason reached for the weapon in his beltthe gun he had borrowed from bernardineknowing that his companion already had his backup automatic out of his pocket the beam of the left searchlight shot over their bodies as bourne whispered good work but how did you spot it the moving reflections of the lamps on the side windows replied old françois i thought for a moment it was my former colleague returning to finish the job he had contemplated namely my stomach in the street my god look the van swept past the first two buildings then suddenly swerved into the curb and stopped in front of the last structure nearly two hundred feet from the storefront the building farthest from the jackals telephone the instant the vehicle came to a halt the rear door opened and four men jumped out automatic weapons in their hands two running to the street side one racing down the pavement to the front the last guard standing menacingly by the open doors his mac ready to fire a dull wash of yellow light appeared at the top of the brick steps the door had been opened and a man in a black raincoat came outside he stood for a moment looking up and down the boulevard lefebvre is that him whispered francois no not unless hes wearing high heels and a wig answered jason reaching into his jacket pocket ill know him when i see himbecause i see him every day of my life bourne took out one of the grenades he had also borrowed from bernardine he checked the release laying down his gun and gripping the pockmarked steel oval tugging at the pin to make certain it was free of corrosion what the hell do you think youre doing asked the old deuxième veteran that man up there is a decoy replied jason his soft voice suspended in a cold monotone in moments another will take his place run down the steps and get into the van either in the front seat or through the rear doorsi hope the latter but it wont make much difference youre mad youll be killed what good is a corpse to that family of yours youre not thinking françois the guards will run back and climb up through the rear doors because theres no room in front theres a lot of difference between climbing into a truck and jumping out of it for starters its a slower sequence by the time the last man gets in and reaches out to close those wide doors ill have a primed grenade inside that van and i have no intention of becoming a corpse stay here before bernardine could object further medusas delta crawled out into the dark boulevard dark but for the harsh stationary beams of the searchlights which were now angled on the flanks thus actually enhancing bournes concealment the hot white light around the vehicle obscured the darkness beyond his only extreme risk was the guard posted by the open doors hugging the shadows of the successive storefronts as though he were threading his way through the high grass of the mekong delta toward a floodlit prisoner compound jason crept slowly forward with each wayward glance of the rear guard his eyes darting continuously up to the man by the door above the brick steps suddenly another figure emerged it was a woman carrying a small suitcase in one hand a large purse in the other she spoke to the man in the black raincoat as the guards attention was drawn to both of them bourne scrambled his elbows and knees silently pounding the hard pavement until he reached that point nearest the van where he could observe the scene on the staircase with minimum risk of being spotted he was relieved to see that the two guards in the street continuously winced and blinked under the beam of the searchlight his status was as clean as it could be under the tenuous circumstances everything now was timing precision and all the expertise he could summon from times too often unremembered or too vague or too long ago he had to remember now instinct had to propel him through his personal mists now the end of the nightmare was at hand it was happening suddenly there was furious activity at the door as a third figure came rushing out joining the other two the man was shorter than his male colleague wearing a beret and carrying a briefcase he obviously issued orders that included the rear guard who ran up to the pavement as the new arrival hurled his briefcase down over the brick steps the guard instantly clutched his weapon under his left arm and effortlessly caught the leather missile in midair allezvousen nous partons vite shouted the second man gesturing for the other two on the brick steps to precede him down to the van they did so the man in the raincoat joining the guard at the rear doors the woman accompanying the one who gave the orders the jackal was it carlos was it bourne desperately wanted to believe that it wastherefore it was the sound of the vehicles curbside door slamming shut was followed rapidly by the gunning of the vehicles powerful engine both were a signal the three other guards raced from their posts to the rear doors of the van one by one they climbed up inside after the man in the black raincoat their legs stretched arms bracing shoulders curved hands gripping the two metal frames that with instant muscular strain propelled them inside as their weapons were thrown in front of them then a pair of hands reached out for the interior door handles now bourne pulled the pin of the grenade and lurched to his feet running as he had never run in his life toward the swinging rear doors of the van he dived twisting his body in flight landing on his back as he gripped the left panel and threw the grenade inside the bombs release in his hand six seconds and it would detonate jason got to his knees arms extended and crashed the doors shut a fusillade of gunfire erupted but it was an unintended miracleas the jackals van was bulletproof it was also impervious to bullets shot from within there were no penetrations of the steel only thuds and the screaming whistles of ricochets and the screams of the wounded inside the glistening vehicle shot forward on the boulevard lefebvre as bourne sprang to a crouch and raced toward the deserted storefronts on the east side of the street he was nearly across the wide avenue when the impossible happened the impossible the jackals van blew up the explosion firing the dark paris sky and the moment it happened a brown limousine screeched around the nearest corner the windows open men in the black spaces weapons in their grips spraying the entire area with thunderous indiscriminate fire jason lunged into the nearest recess curling up into a fetal position in the shadows accepting the factnot in fear but in furythat it might well be his last moments of life he had failed failed marie and his children but not this way he spun off the concrete the weapon in his hand he would kill kill that was the way of jason bourne then the incredible happened the incredible a siren the police the brown limousine shot forward skirting the flaming wreck of the jackals van and disappeared into the dark streets as a patrol car raced out of the opposing darkness its siren screaming the tires screeching as it skidded to a stop only yards from the flames of the demolished vehicle nothing made sense thought jason where before there had been five patrol cars only one had returned why and even that question was superfluous carlos had mounted a strategy employing not one but seven conceivably eight decoys all expendable all led to their terrible death by the consummate selfprotector the jackal had sprung himself from the trap that had been reversed by his hated quarry delta the product of medusa a creation of american intelligence once again the assassin had outthought him but he had not killed him there would be another day another night bernardine screamed the deuxième official who less than thirty minutes ago had officially disowned his colleague leaping out of the patrol car the man shouted again bernardine where are you my god where are you i came back old friend for i could not leave you my god you were right i see that now for myself oh christ tell me youre alive answer me another is dead came the reply from bernardine as his gaunt figure walked slowly with difficulty out of the storefront two hundred feet north of bourne i tried to tell you but you would not listen i was perhaps too hasty roared the official running to the old man and embracing him as the others in the patrol car their arms crossed in front of their faces surrounded the burning van but at a considerable distance ive radioed for our people to return added the official you must believe me old friend i came back because i couldnt leave you in anger not my old comrade i had no idea that pig from the newspaper actually assaulted you struck you he told me and i threw him out i came back for you you see that dont you but my god i never expected anything like this its horrible said the deuxième veteran while cautiously his eyes straying rapidly up and down the boulevard he surveyed the area he specifically noted the many frightened intense faces in the windows of the three stone buildings the scenario had blown apart with the vans explosion and the disappearance of the brown limousine the minions were without their leader and filled with anxiety its not entirely your error alonemy old comrade he continued a note of apology in his voice i had the wrong building ah ha cried the deuxième associate relishing a minor triumph of selfvindication the wrong building that is indeed a mistake of consequence eh françois the consequences might have been far less tragic had you not abandoned me so hastily as you so aptly phrased it instead of listening to a man with my vast experience you ordered me out of your car only to have me witness the horror moments after you fled we followed your orders we searched the buildingthe wrong building had you remained if only for a brief conference this might have been avoided and a friend might be alive i shall have to include that judgment in my report please old friend broke in the associate let us reason together for the good of the bureau the interruption now came with the shrill appearance of a fire truck bernardine held up his hand and led his protesting former comrade across the boulevard ostensibly to get out of the way of the firemen more purposefully to be within earshot of jason bourne when our people arrive went on the associate of the deuxième his voice rising with authority we shall empty the buildings and detain every resident for thorough interrogation my god exclaimed bernardine dont add asininity to incompetence what the limousine the brown limousinesurely you saw it yes of course the driver said it raced away thats all he told you well the truck was in flames and there was so much confusion radioing for personnel look at the shattered glass commanded françois pointing at the storefronts away from the recess where bourne was hiding look at the pits on the pavement and in the street gun fire my old comrade those involved escaped believing they had killed me say nothing do nothing leave these people alone you are incomprehensible and you are a fool if for any reason whatsoever there is the slightest possibility that even one of those killers is ordered to return here there can be no impediments now you are inscrutable not at all protested bernardine as the firemen hosed down the flames of the van their efforts augmented by giant extinguishers send your people into each building inquiring if everything is all right explaining that the authorities have determined the terrible events on the boulevard were criminally oriented the crisis has passed there is no further alarm but is that true its what we want them to believe an ambulance stormed into the street followed by two additional patrol cars all the sirens at maximum volume from the rue dalésia apartment dwellers had gathered at both corners many in hastily pulledon street attiretrousers and undershirtswhile others were in night clothesfrayed bathrobes and worn slippers noting that the jackals van was now a smoldering mass of twisted steel and shattered glass bernardine continued give the crowds time to satisfy their morbid viewing then send men to disperse them in an hour or so when the rubble is under control and the bodies carted away proclaim loudly to your police detachment that the emergency is over ordering all but one man back to the precinct that man is to remain here on duty until the debris is cleared from the boulevard he is also to be instructed not to interfere with anyone leaving the buildings is that clear not for a moment you said that someone might be hiding i know what i said pressed the former deuxième consultant it changes nothing you will stay here then yes i will move slowly inconspicuously around the area i see what about the police report and my report use some of the truth not all of it of course word was passed to youinformers name withheldthat an act of violence related to the bureaus narcotics division was to take place on the boulevard lefebvre at precisely this hour you commandeered a police contingent and found nothing but shortly thereafter your highly professional instincts sent you back beyond the time span unfortunately too late to stop the carnage i might even be commended said the associate suddenly frowning wary and your report he asked quietly well see if one is necessary wont we replied the newly reinstated deuxième consultant the medical team wrapped the bodies of the victims and placed them in the ambulance as a wrecker hoisted what was left of the destroyed vehicle into the huge attached dumpster the crew swept the street several remarking that they should not sweep too thoroughly or no one would recognize the lefebvre a quarter of an hour later the job was finished the wrecker departed the lone patrolman joining the crew to be dropped off at the nearest police phone several blocks away it was well past four oclock in the morning and soon the dawn would light up the sky over paris preceding the boisterous human carnival below now however the only signs of life on the boulevard lefebvre were five lighted windows in the row of stone buildings controlled by carlos the jackal inside those rooms were men and women for whom sleep was not permitted they had work to do for their monseigneur bourne sat on the pavement his legs outstretched his back against the inside wall of a storefront across from the building where the frightened yet argumentative baker and the indignant nun had confronted the police bernardine was in a similar recess several hundred feet away opposite the first building where the jackals van had stopped for its condemned cargo their agreement was firm jason would follow and take by force whoever left first from any building the old deuxième veteran would follow whoever left second ascertain his or her destination but make no contact bournes judgment was that either the baker or the nun would be the assassins messenger so he had selected the north end of the row of stone houses he was partially right but he had not anticipated an embarrassment of personnel and conveyances at two bicycles ridden by nuns in full habits and white hats wheeled up from the south side of the boulevard ringing the muted bells on their handlebars as they stopped in front of the house that was supposedly the quarters of the magdalen sisters of charity the door opened and three additional nuns each carrying a bicycle walked out and down the brick steps to join their charitable sisters they discreetly mounted their saddles and the procession started up the street the one consoling fact for jason was that carloss indignant nun took up the single rear position not knowing how it would happen knowing only that it would happen bourne lurched out of the storefront and ran across the dark boulevard as he reached the shadows of the deserted lot adjacent to the jackals house another door opened he crouched watching the overweight irate baker waddle rapidly down his brick steps and head south bernardine had his work cut out for him too thought jason as he got to his feet and ran after his procession of cycling nuns paris traffic is an endless enigma regardless of the hour of day or night it also provides palpable excuses for anyone wishing to be early or late or having arrived at the right destination or the wrong one in a phrase parisians behind a steering wheel embody the last civilized vestiges of lethal abandonpossibly outdone by their counterparts in rome or athens and so it was for the magdalen sisters of charity especially for the officious superior hen on the single rear point at an intersection of the rue lecourbe in montparnasse a congestion of produce trucks prevented her from keeping up with her religious colleagues benignly she waved them on and abruptly turned into a narrow side street suddenly pedaling faster than before bourne his wound from tranquility isle now pulsating throughout his neck did not increase his pace he did not have to the whitelettered blue sign on the building fronting the street read impasse a dead end there was no other way out he found the bicycle chained to an extinguished street lamp and waited in the darkness of a doorway no more than fifteen feet away he raised his hand and touched the warm moistness of the bandage around his neck the bleeding was slight with luck no more than one suture had burst oh christ his legs were tiredno tired was inadequate they ached with the pain that came with unused and abused muscles the rhythmic strides of jogging even running were no preparation for lurching or weaving or for violently sudden stops and starts he leaned against the stone breathing heavily his eyes on the bicycle trying to suppress a thought that kept recurring with infuriating regularity only a few short years ago he would never have noticed the discomfort in his legs there would have been none the sound of an unlatched bolt broke the stillness of the predawn narrow street followed rapidly by the grating noise of a heavy door being opened it was the entrance to the flat in front of the chained bicycle his back against the wall jason removed the gun from his belt and watched the woman in the nuns habit rush to the lamppost she fumbled with a key in the dim light awkwardly trying to insert it into the base of the lock bourne stepped out on the pavement and walked swiftly silently forward youll be late for early mass he said the woman spun around the key flying into the street her black cloth snapping in the turn as she plunged her right hand between the folds of her habit jason lurched gripping her arm with his left hand and tearing off the large white hat with his right at the sight of the exposed face in front of him he gasped my god he whispered its you i know you cried bourne paris years ago your name is lavier jacqueline lavier you had one of those dress shops les classiquessthonorécarloss drop in the faubourg i found you in a confessional booth in neuillysurseine i thought you were dead the womans sharp creased middleaged fade was contorted in frenzy she tried to twist out of his grip but jason stepped sideways as she pivoted yanking her away in a sweeping circular motion crashing her against the wall pinning her his left forearm across her throat but you werent dead you were part of the trap that ended at the louvre blew apart at the louvre by christ youre coming with me men died in that trapfrenchmen diedand i couldnt stay around and tell them how it happened or who was responsible in my country you kill a cop it doesnt go off the books its no different over here and when its cops they dont stop looking oh theyll remember the louvre theyll remember their men youre wrong choked the woman her wide green eyes bulging im not who you think i am youre lavier queen of the faubourg sole contact to the jackals woman the generals wife dont tell me im wrong i followed the two of you out to neuillyto that church with the bells ringing and priests everywhereone of them carlos moments later his whore came back out but you didnt she left in a hurry so i ran inside and described you to an old priestif he was a priestand he told me you were in the second confessional from the left i walked over and pulled the curtain and there you were dead i thought youd just been killed and everything was happening so fast carlos had to be there he was within my reach my gunor maybe i was within his i raced around like a maniac and finally i saw him out in the street in his priestly black clothesi saw him i knew it was him because he saw me and started to run through the traffic and then i lost him i lost him but i had a card to play you i passed the wordlaviers dead it was just what i was supposed to do wasnt it wasnt it i tell you again you are wrong the woman no longer struggled it was pointless instead she remained rigid against the wall no part of her body moving as if by doing so she might be permitted to speak will you listen to me she asked with difficulty jasons forearm still pressed against her throat forget it lady answered bourne youre going out of here limpa sister of charity being helped not assaulted by a stranger youre about to have a fainting spell at your age its a fairly common occurrence isnt it wait too late we must talk we will releasing his arm jason instantly crashed both his hands simultaneously into the womans shoulder blades where the tendons weave into the neck muscles she collapsed he caught her in the fall and carried her out of the narrow street as an adoring supplicant might a religious social worker the dawn light was beginning to fill the sky and several early risers one a young jogger in shorts converged on the man carrying the nun shes been with my wife and sick children for nearly two days without sleep pleaded the chameleon in street french will someone please find me a taxi so i can take her back to her convent in the ninth arrondissement i shall roared the young runner theres an allnight stand on the rue de sèvres and im very fast you are a gift monsieur said jason appreciating but instantly disliking the all too confident all too young jogger six minutes later the taxi arrived the youth inside i told the driver you have money he said climbing out i trust its so of course and thanks tell the sister what i did added the young man in running shorts helping bourne gently insert the unconscious woman into the back of the taxi ill need all the help i can get when my time comes i trust thats not imminent said jason trying to return the youths grin not likely i represent my firm in the marathon the overgrown child began running in place thanks again i hope you win the next one tell the sister to pray for me cried the athlete racing away the bois de boulogne said bourne closing the door and addressing the driver the bois that ventilating nut told me it was an emergency you had to get the nun to a hospital she drank too much wine what can i tell you the bois de boulogne said the driver nodding his head let her walk it off i have a second cousin in the lyons convent she gets out for a week shes soused to the temples who can blame her the bench on the graveled path of the bois progressively received the warm rays of the early sun as the middleaged woman in the religious habit began shaking her head how are you doing sister asked jason sitting beside his prisoner i believe i was struck by an army tank replied the woman blinking and opening her mouth to swallow air at least a tank which i suspect you know more about than a welfare wagon from the magdalen sisters of charity quite so agreed the woman dont bother to look for your gun said bourne i removed it from the very expensive belt under your habit im glad you recognized the value its part of what we must talk about since i am not in a police station i assume youve granted me my request to talk only if what you say suits my purpose i assume you understand that but it must you see suit your purpose as you say ive failed ive been taken im not where i should be and whatever the time is the light tells me im too late for excuses also my bicycle has either disappeared or is still chained to the lamppost i didnt take it then im a dead woman and if its gone im just as dead dont you see because youve disappeared not where youre supposed to be of course youre lavier thats true im lavier but im not the woman you knew you knew my sister jacquelinei am dominique lavier we were close in age and since we were children strongly resembled each other but you are not wrong about neuillysurseine or what you saw there my sister was killed because she broke a cardinal rule committed a mortal sin if you like she panicked and led you to carloss woman his most cherished and useful secret me you know who i am all paristhe jackals parisknows who you are monsieur bourne not by sight i grant you but they know you are here and they know youre tracking carlos and youre part of that paris i am good christ lady he killed your sister im aware of that still you work for him there are times when a persons choices are considerably reduced say to live or to die until six years ago when les classiques changed ownership it was vital to the monseigneur i took jacquis place just like that it wasnt difficult i was younger and more to the point i looked younger the lines in the middleaged laviers face cracked with a brief pensive smile my sister always said it came with living on the mediterranean at any rate cosmetic surgery is commonplace in the world of haute couture jacqui supposedly went to switzerland for a facelift and i returned to paris after eight weeks of preparation how could you knowing what you knew how the hell could you i did not know earlier what i learned later by which time it was irrelevant by then i had the choice i just mentioned to live or to die it never occurred to you to go to the police or the sûreté regarding carlos the woman looked at bourne as if rebuking a foolish child as the british say in cap ferrat surely you jest so you blithely went into the killing game not consciously i was gradually led into it my education slow piecemeal in the beginning i was told jacqueline had died in a boating accident with her lover of the month and that i would be enormously well paid to carry on in her place les classiques was far more than a grand salon far more agreed jason interrupting it was the drop for frances most highly classified military and intelligence secrets funneled to the jackal by his woman a celebrated generals wife i was not aware of that until long after the general killed her villiers was his name i believe it was jason looked across the path at the still dark waters of a pond white lilies floating in clusters images came back to him im the one who found him found them villiers was in a highbacked chair a gun in his hand his wife lying on the bed naked bleeding dead he was going to kill himself it was a proper execution for a traitor he said for his devotion to his wife had blinded his judgment and in that blindness he had betrayed his beloved france i convinced him there was another way it almost workedthirteen years ago in a strange house on seventyfirst street in new york i dont know what happened in new york but general villiers left instructions that after his death what happened in paris was to be made part of the public record when he died and the truth was known it was said that carlos went mad with fury killing several highranking military commanders simply because they were generals its all an old story interrupted bourne sharply this is now thirteen years later what happens now i dont know monsieur my choices are zero arent they one or the other of you will kill me i suppose maybe not help me take him and youre free of both of us you can go back to the mediterranean and live in peace you wont even have to disappearyou merely return to wherever it is after a number of profitable years in paris disappear asked lavier studying the haggard face of her captor as in the word vanish no need for that carlos cant reach you because hell be dead yes i understand that part its the disappearance that interests me along with the profitable years does this profit come from you yes i see is that what you offered santos a profitable disappearance it was as if the words were hard flesh and had slapped him across the face jason looked at his prisoner so it was santos after all he said softly the lefebvre was a trap christ hes good hes dead le coeur du soldat cleaned out and closed down what stunned bourne again stared at the lavier woman that was his reward for cornering me no for betraying carlos i dont understand the monseigneur has eyes everywhere im sure thats no surprise to you santos the total recluse was observed sending several heavy boxes out with his main food supplier and yester day morning he did not clip and water his precious garden a summer ritual as predictable as the sun a man was sent to the suppliers warehouse and opened the boxes books broke in jason quietly placed in storage until further instructions completed dominique lavier santoss departure was to be swift and secret and carlos knew there was no one in moscow giving out a telephone number i beg your pardon nothing what kind of man was santos i never knew him never even saw him ive only heard the downstairs rumors which werent many i havent time for many what were they apparently he was a very large man i know that interrupted jason impatiently and from the books we both know that he was well read probably well educated if his speech was indicative where did he come from and why did he work for the jackal they say he was cuban and fought in fidels revolution that he was a deep thinker as well as a law student with castro and once a great athlete then of course as in all revolutions the internal strife sours the victoriesat least thats what my old friends from the may day barricades tell me translation please fidel was jealous of the leaders of certain cadres especially che guevara and the man you knew as santos where castro was larger than life those two were larger than he was and fidel could not tolerate the competition che was sent on a mission that ended his life and trumped up counterrevolutionary charges were brought against santos he was within an hour of being executed when carlos and his men broke into the prison and spirited him away spirited dressed as priests no doubt i have no doubts the church with all its medieval lunacies once held sway over cuba you sound bitter im a woman the pontiff is not hes merely medieval judgment decreed so santos joined forces with carlos two disillusioned marxists in search of their personal causeor maybe their own personal hollywood thats beyond me monsieur but if i vaguely understand you the fantasy belongs to the brilliant carlos the bitter disillusion was santoss fate he owed his life to the jackal so why not give it what was left for him until you came along thats all i need thanks i just wanted a few gaps filled in gaps things i didnt know what do we do now monsieur bourne wasnt that your original question what do you want to do madame lavier i know i dont want to die and i am not madame lavier in the marital sense the restrictions never appealed to me and the benefits seemed unnecessary for years i was a highpriced call girl in monte carlo nice and cap ferrat until my looks and my body deserted me still i once had friends from the old days intermittent lovers who took care of me for old times sake most are dead now a pity really i thought you said you were enormously well paid for assuming your sisters identity oh i was and to a degree i still am for im still valuable i move among the elite of paris where gossip abounds and thats often helpful i have a beautiful flat on the avenue montaigne antiques fine paintings servants charge accountseverything a woman once in high fashion should be expected to have for the circles she still travels in and money every month my bank receives eighty thousand francs from genevasomewhat more than enough for me to pay the bills for you see i have to pay them no one else can do so so then youve got money no monsieur i have a lifestyle not money thats the way of the jackal except for the old men he pays only for what he gets in terms of immediate service if the money from geneva does not arrive at my bank on the tenth of every month id be thrown out in thirty days but then if carlos decided to get rid of me there would be no need for geneva id be finishedas i am no doubt finished now if i returned to my flat in the montaigne this morning id never come out as my sister never came out of that church in neuillysurseine at least not alive youre convinced of that of course the stop where i chained the bicycle was made to receive instructions from one of the old men the orders were precise and to be precisely followed a woman i know would meet me in twenty minutes at a bakery in saintgermain where we were to exchange clothes she was to proceed to the magdalen mission and i was to meet a courier from athens in a room at the hôtel trémoille the magdalen mission you mean those women on the bicycles were actually nuns complete with vows of chastity and poverty monsieur i am a frequent visiting superior from the convent at saintmalo and the woman at the bakery is she she falls from grace now and then but shes a perfectly splendid administrator jesus mumbled bourne hes frequently on their lips do you see now the hopelessness of my position im not sure i do then i am forced to wonder if you really are the chameleon i was not at the bakery the meeting with the greek courier never took place where was i you were delayed the bicycle chain broke you got grazed by one of those trucks on the rue lecourbe hell you got mugged whats the difference you were delayed how long has it been since you rendered me unconscious jason looked at his watch now easily seen in the bright morning sunlight something over an hourplus i think perhaps an hour and a half considering how you were dressed the taxi driver cruised around trying to find a place to park where we could help you to a bench on the path with as little scrutiny as possible he was well paid for his assistance an hour and a half asked lavier pointedly so so why didnt i call the bakery or the hôtel trémoille complications no too easily verified added bourne shaking his head or lavier locked her large green eyes with his or monsieur the boulevard lefebvre replied jason slowly softly the trap as i reversed his on me he reversed mine for him three hours later then i broke the strategy and took you exactly the once and former whore of monte carlo nodded and he cannot know what transpired between us therefore im marked for execution a pawn is removed for she is merely a pawn she can tell the authorities nothing of substance shes never seen the jackal she can only repeat the gossip of lowly subordinates youve never seen him i may have but not to my knowledge again the rumors fly around paris this one with swarthy latin skin or that one with black eyes and a dark mustache he is really carlos you knowhow often have i heard the phrases but no no man has ever come up to me and said i am he and i make your life pleasant you aging elegant prostitute i simply report to old men who every now and then convey information that i must havesuch as this evening on the boulevard lefebvre i see bourne got to his feet stretching his body and looking down at his prisoner on the bench i can get you out he said quietly out of paris out of europe beyond carloss reach do you want that as eagerly as santos did answered lavier her eyes imploring i willingly trade my allegiance from him to you why because he is old and grayfaced and is no match for you you offer me life he offers death thats a reasonable decision then said jason a tentative but warm smile on his lips do you have any money with you i mean nuns are sworn to poverty monsieur replied dominique lavier returning his smile actually i have several hundred francs why its not enough continued bourne reaching into his pocket and taking out his impressive roll of franc notes heres three thousand he said handing her the money buy some clothes somewhereim sure you know howand take a room at the the meurice on the rue de rivoli what name should i use what suits you how about brielle a lovely seaside town why not give me ten minutes to get out of here and then leave ill see you at the meurice at noon with all my heart jason bourne lets forget that name the chameleon walked out of the bois de boulogne to the nearest taxi station within minutes an ecstatic cabdriver accepted a hundred francs to remain in place at the end of the threevehicle line his passenger slumped in the rear seat waiting to hear the words the nun comes out monsieur cried the driver she enters the first taxi follow it said jason sitting up on the avenue victor hugo laviers taxi slowed down and pulled up in front of one of pariss few exceptions to traditionan open plasticdomed public telephone stop here ordered bourne who climbed out the instant the driver swung into the curb limping the chameleon walked swiftly silently to the telephone directly behind and unseen by the frantic nun under the plastic dome he was not seen but he could hear clearly as he stood several feet behind her the meurice she shouted into the phone the name is brielle hell be there at noon yes yes ill stop at my flat change clothes and be there in an hour lavier hung up and turned gasping at the sight of jason no she screamed yes im afraid said bourne shall we take my taxi or yours hes old and grayfacedthose were your words dominique pretty goddamned descriptive for someone who never met carlos a furious bernardine walked out of the pontroyal with the doorman who had summoned him this is preposterous he shouted as he approached the taxi no its not he amended looking inside its merely insane get in said jason on the far side of the woman dressed in the habit of a nun francois did so staring at the black clothes the white pointed hat and the pale face of the religious female between them meet one of the jackals more talented performers added bourne she could make a fortune in your cinémavérité take my word for it im not a particularly religious man but i trust you have not made a mistake i didor should i say we didwith that pig of a baker why hes a baker thats all he is i damn near put a grenade in his ovens but no one but a french baker could plead the way he did it fits said jason the illogical logic of carlosi cant remember who said that probably me the taxi made a uturn and entered the rue du bac were going to the meurice added bourne im sure theres a reason stated bernardine still looking at the enigmatically passive face of dominique lavier i mean this sweet old lady says nothing im not old cried the woman vehemently of course not my dear agreed the deuxième veteran only more desirable in your mature years boy did you hit it why the meurice asked bernardine its the jackals final trap for me answered bourne courtesy of our persuasive magdalen sister of charity here he expects me to be there and ill be there ill call in the deuxième thanks to a frightened bureaucrat theyll do anything i ask dont endanger yourself my friend i dont mean to insult you francois but you yourself told me you didnt know all of the people in the bureau these days i cant take the chance of a leak one man could send out an alarm let me help the low softspoken voice of dominique lavier broke the hum of the outside traffic like the initial burr of a chain saw i can help i listened to your help before lady and it was leading me to my own execution no thanks that was before not now as must be obvious to you my position now is truly hopeless didnt i hear those words recently no you did not i just added the word now for gods sake put yourself in my place i cant pretend to understand but this ancient boulevardier beside me casually mentions that hell call in the deuxièmethe deuxième monsieur bourne for some that is no less than frances gestapo even if i survived im marked by that infamous branch of the government id no doubt be sent to some horrible penal colony halfway across the worldoh ive heard the stories of the deuxième really said bernardine i havent sounds positively marvelous how wonderful besides continued lavier looking hard at jason as she yanked the pointed white hat off her head a gesture that caused the driver seeing it in the rearview mirror to raise his eyebrows without me without my presence in decidedly different clothing at the meurice carlos wont come near the rue de rivoli bernardine tapped the womans shoulder bringing his index finger to his lips and nodding toward the front seat dominique quickly added the man you wish to confer with will not be there shes got a point said bourne leaning forward and looking past lavier at the deuxième veteran shes also got an apartment on the montaigne where shes supposed to change clothes and neither of us can go in with her that poses a dilemma doesnt it responded bernardine theres no way we can monitor the telephone from outside in the street is there you fools i have no choice but to cooperate with you and if you cant see that you should be led around by trained dogs this old old man here will have my name in the deuxième files the first chance he gets and as the notorious jason bourne knows if he has even a nodding acquaintance with the deuxième several profound questions are raisedonce raised by my sister jacqueline incidentally who is this bourne is he real or unreal is he the assassin of asia or is he a fraud a plant she phoned me herself one night in nice after too many brandiesa night perhaps you recall monsieur le caméléona terribly expensive restaurant outside paris you threatened her in the name of powerful unnamed people you threatened her you demanded that she reveal what she knew about a certain acquaintance of herswho it was at the time i had no ideabut you frightened her she said you appeared deranged that your eyes became glazed and you uttered words in a language she could not understand i remember interrupted bourne icily we had dinner and i threatened her and she was frightened she went to the ladies room paid someone to make a phone call and i had to get out of there and now the deuxième is allied with those powerful unnamed people dominique lavier shook her head repeatedly and lowered her voice no messieurs i am a survivor and i do not fight against such odds one knows when to pass the shoe in baccarat after a short period of silence bernardine spoke whats your address on the avenue montaigne ill give it to the driver but before i do understand me madame if your words prove false all the true horrors of the deuxième will be visited upon you marie sat at the roomservice table in her small suite at the meurice reading the newspapers her attention constantly strayed concentration was out of the question her anxiety had kept her awake after she returned to the hotel shortly past midnight having made the rounds of five cafés she and david had frequented so many years ago in paris finally by foursomething in the morning exhaustion had shortcircuited her tossing and turning she fell asleep with the bedside lamp switched on and was awakened by the same light nearly six hours later it was the longest she had slept since that first night on tranquility isle itself a distant memory now except for the very real pain of not seeing and hearing the children dont think about them it hurts too much think about david no think about jason bourne where concentrate she put down the paris tribune and poured herself a third cup of black coffee glancing over at the french doors that led to a small balcony overlooking the rue de rivoli it disturbed her that the once bright morning had turned into a dismal gray day soon the rain would come making her search in the streets even more difficult resigned she sipped her coffee and replaced the elegant cup in the elegant saucer annoyed that it was not one of the simple pottery mugs favored by david and her in their rustic country kitchen in maine oh god would they ever be back there again dont think about such things concentrate out of the question she picked up the tribune aimlessly scanning the pages seeing only isolated words no sentences or paragraphs no continuity of thought or meaning merely words then one stood out at the bottom of a meaningless column a single meaningless line bracketed at the bottom of a meaningless page the word was memom followed by a telephone number and despite the fact that the tribune was printed in english the french in her switchable frenchthinking brain absently translated the word as maymohm she was about to turn the page when a signal from another part of her brain screamed stop memom mommyturned around by a child struggling with his earliest attempts at language meemom jamietheir jamie the funny inverted name he had called her for several weeks david had joked about it while she frightened had wondered if their son had dyslexia he could also just be confused memom david had laughed david she snapped up the page it was the financial section of the paper the section she instinctively gravitated to every morning over coffee david was sending her a message she pushed back her chair crashing it to the floor as she grabbed the paper and rushed to the telephone on the desk her hands trembling she dialed the number there was no answer and thinking that in her panic she had made an error or had not used the local paris digit she dialed again now slowly precisely no answer but it was david she felt it she knew it he had been looking for her at the trocadéro and now he was using a briefly employed nickname only the two of them would know my love my love ive found you she also knew she could not stay in the confining quarters of the small hotel suite pacing up and down and dialing every other minute driving herself crazy with every unanswered ring when youre stressed out and spinning until you think youll blow apart find someplace where you can keep moving without being noticed keep moving thats vital you cant let your head explode one of the lessons from jason bourne her head spinning marie dressed more rapidly than she had ever done in her life she tore out the message from the tribune and left the oppressive suite trying not to run to the bank of elevators but needing the crowds of the paris streets where she could keep moving without being noticed from one telephone kiosk to another the ride down to the lobby was both interminable and insufferable the latter because of an american couplehe laden with camera equipment she with purple eyelids and a peroxide bouffant apparently set in concretewho kept complaining that not enough people in paris france spoke english the elevator doors thankfully opened and marie walked out rapidly into the crowded meurice lobby as she crossed the marble floor toward the large glass doors of the ornate filigreed entrance she suddenly involuntarily stopped as an elderly man in a dark pinstriped suit gasped his slender body lurching forward in a heavy leather chair below on her right the old man stared at her his thin lips parted in astonishment his eyes in shock marie st jacques he whispered my god get out of here i beg your what the aged frenchman quickly with difficulty rose to his feet his head subtly swiftly jerking in short movements as he scanned the lobby you cannot be seen here mrs webb he said his voice still a whisper but no less harsh and commanding dont look at me look at your watch keep your head down the deuxième veteran glanced away nodding aimlessly at several people in nearby chairs as he continued his lips barely moving go out the door on the far left the one used for luggage hurry no replied marie her head down her eyes on her watch you know me but i dont know you who are you a friend of your husband my god is he here the question is why are you here i stayed at this hotel once before i thought he might remember it he did but in the wrong context im afraid mon dieu he never would have chosen it otherwise now leave i wont i have to find him where is he you will leave or you may find only his corpse theres a message for you in the paris tribune its in my purse the financial page memom call in several hours you cant do this to me you cannot do this to him youll kill him get out of here now her eyes half blinded with fury and fear and tears marie started toward the left side of the lobby desperately wanting to look back but just as desperately knowing she could not do so she reached the narrow set of glass double doors colliding with a uniformed bellhop carrying suitcases inside pardon madame moi aussi she stammered maneuvering again blindly around the luggage and out to the pavement what could she dowhat should she do david was somewhere in the hotelin the hotel and a strange man recognized her and warned her and told her to get outget away what was happening my god someones trying to kill david the old frenchman had said as muchwho was it who were they where were they help me for gods sake jason tell me what to do jason yes jason help me she stood frozen as taxis and limousines broke off from the noonday traffic and pulled up to the meurices curb where a goldbraided doorman under the huge canopy greeted newcomers and old faces and sent bellboys scurrying in all directions a large black limousine with a small discreet religious insignia on its passenger door the cruciform standard of some high office of the church inched its way to the canopied area marie stared at the small emblem it was circular and no more than six inches in diameter a globe of royal purple surrounding an elongated crucifix of gold she winced and held her breath her panic now had a disturbing new dimension she had seen that insignia before and all she remembered was that it had filled her with horror the limousine stopped both curbside doors were opened by the smiling bowing doorman as five priests emerged one from the front seat four from the spacious rear section those from the back immediately oddly threaded their way into the noonday crowds of strollers on the pavement two forward in front of the vehicle two behind it one of the priests whipping past marie his black coat making contact with her his face so close she could see the blazing unpriestly eyes of a man who was no part of a religious order then the association with the emblem the religious insignia came back to her years ago when davidwhen jasonwas in maximum therapy with panov mo had him sketch draw doodle whatever images came to him time and again that terrible circle with the thin crucifix appeared invariably torn apart or stabbed repeatedly with the pencil point the jackal suddenly maries eyes were drawn to a figure crossing the rue de rivoli it was a tall man in dark clothesa dark sweater and trousersand he was limping dodging the traffic a hand shielding his face from the drizzle that soon would turn into rain the limp was false the leg straightened if only for an instant and the swing of the shoulder that compensated was a defiant gesture she knew only too well it was david another no more than eight feet from her also saw what she saw a miniature radio was instantly brought to the mans lips marie rushed forward her extended hands the claws of a tigress as she lunged at the killer in priests clothing david she screamed drawing blood from the face of the jackals man gunshots filled the rue de rivoli the crowds panicked many running into the hotel many more racing away from the canopied entrance all shrieking yelling seeking safety from the murderous insanity that had suddenly exploded in the civilized street in the violent struggle with the man who would kill her husband the strong canadian ranch girl ripped the automatic out of his belt and fired it into his head blood and membranes were blown into the air jason she screamed again as the killer fell instantly realizing that she stood alone with only the corpse beneath hershe was a target then from certain death there was the sudden possibility of life the old aristocratic frenchman who had recognized her in the lobby came crashing out of the front entrance his automatic weapon on repeat fire as he sprayed the black limousine stopping for an instant to switch his aim and shattering the legs of a priest whose weapon was leveled at him mon ami roared bernardine here shouted bourne where is she a votre droite auprès de a single gunshot exploded from the glass double doors of the meurice as he fell the deuxième veteran cried out les capucines mon ami les capucines bernardine slumped to the pavement a second gunshot ended his life marie was paralyzed she could not move everything was a blizzard a hurricane of iced particles crashing with such force against her face she could neither think nor find meaning weeping out of control she fell to her knees then collapsed in the street her screams of despair clear to the man who suddenly was above her my children oh god my children our children said jason bourne his voice not the voice of david webb were getting out of here can you understand that yes yes marie awkwardly painfully swung her legs behind her and lurched to her feet held by the husband she either knew or did not know david of course im david come on you frighten me i frighten myself lets go bernardine gave us our exit run with me hold my hand they raced down the rue de rivoli swinging east into the boulevard stmichel until the parisian strollers in their nonchalance de jour made it clear that the fugitives were safe from the horrors of the meurice they stopped m an alleyway and held each other why did you do it asked marie cupping his face why did you run away from us because im better without you you know that you werent before davidor should i say jason names dont matter we have to move where to im not sure but we can move thats the important thing theres a way out bernardine gave it to us he was the old frenchman lets not talk about him okay at least not for a while im shredded enough all right we wont talk about him still he mentioned les capucineswhat did he mean its our way out theres a car waiting for me in the boulevard des capucines thats what he was telling me lets go they raced south out of paris in the nondescript peugeot taking the barbizon highway to vilieneuvestgeorges marie sat close to her husband their bodies touching her hand clutching his arm she was however sickeningly aware that the warmth she intended was not returned in equal measure only a part of the intense man behind the wheel was her david the rest of him was jason bourne and he was now in command for gods sake talk to me she cried im thinking why did you come to paris good christ exploded marie to find you to help you im sure you thought it was right it wasnt you know that voice again protested marie that goddamned disembodied tone of voice who the hell do you think you are to make that judgment god to put it bluntlyno not bluntly but brutallythere are things you have trouble remembering my darling not about paris objected jason i remember everything about paris everything your friend bernardine didnt think so he told me you never would have chosen the meurice if you did what bourne briefly harshly glanced at his wife think why did you chooseand you did choosethe meurice i dont know im not sure its a hotel the name just came to me think what happened years ago at the meuriceright outside the meurice ii know something happened you yes my love me i stayed there under a false name and you came to meet me and we walked to the newsstand on the corner where in one horrible moment we both knew my life could never be the same againwith you or without you oh jesus i forgot the newspapersyour photograph on all the front pages you were the canadian government official the escaped canadian economist broke in marie hunted by the authorities all over europe for multiple killings in zurich in tandem with the theft of millions from swiss banks those kinds of headlines never leave a person do they they can be refuted proved to be totally false yet still there is that lingering doubt where theres smoke there must be fire i believe is the bromide my own colleagues in ottawa dear dear friends id worked with for years were afraid to talk to me wait a minute shouted bourne his eyes again flashing at davids wife they were falseit was a treadstone ploy to pull me inyou were the one who understood it i didnt of course i did because you were so stretched you couldnt see it it didnt matter to me then because id made up my mind my very precise analytical mind a mind id match against yours any day of the week my sweet scholar what watch the road you missed the turn just the way you missed the one to our cabin only days agoor was it years ago what the hell are you talking about that small inn we stayed at outside the barbizon you politely asked them to please light the fire in the dining roomwe were the only people there it was the third time i saw through the mask of jason bourne to someone else someone i was falling deeply in love with dont do this to me i have to david if only for myself now i have to know youre there silence a uturn on the grandroute and the driver pressed the accelerator to the floor im here whispered the husband lifting his right arm and pulling his wife to him i dont know for how long but im here hurry my darling i will i just want to hold you in my arms and i want to call the children now i know im here youll tell us everything we want to know voluntarily or well send you up into a chemical orbit your hacks never dreamed of with dr panov said peter holland director of the central intelligence agency his quiet monotone as hard and as smooth as polished granite furthermore i should elaborate on the extremes to which im perfectly willing to go because im from the old school paisan i dont give a shit for rules that favor garbage you play cipher with me ill deepsix you still breathing a hundred miles off hatteras in a torpedo casing am i clear the capo subordinato thick plaster casts around his left arm and right leg lay on the bed in langleys deserted infirmary room deserted since the dci ordered the medical staff to get out of hearing range for their own good the mafiosos naturally puffed face was additionally enlarged by swellings around both eyes as well as his generous lips the result of his head having smashed into the dashboard when mo panov sent the car into a maryland oak he looked up at holland his heavylidded gaze traveling over to alexander conklin seated in a chair the everpresent cane gripped in anxious hands you got no right mr big shot said the capo gruffly cause i got rights you know what i mean so did the doctor and you violated themjesus did you violate them i dont gotta talk without my lawyer where the hell was panovs lawyer shouted alex thumping his cane on the floor thats not the way the system works protested the patient attempting to raise his eyebrows in indignation besides i was good to the doc he took advantage of my goodness help me god youre a cartoon said holland youre a hot sketch but youre not remotely amusing there are no lawyers here linguine just the three of us and a torpedo casing is very much in your future whaddaya want from me cried the mafioso what do i know i just do what im told like my older brother didmay he rest in peaceand my fathermay he also rest in peaceand probably his father which i dont know nothin about its like succeeding generations on welfare isnt it observed conklin the parasites never get off the dole hey thats my family youre talkin aboutwhatever the fuck youre talkin about my apologies to your heraldry added alex and its that family of yours were interested in augie broke in the dci it is augie isnt it that was the name on one of the five drivers licenses and we thought it seemed most authentic well youre not so authentically bright mr big shot spat out the immobilized patient through his painfully swollen lips i got none of them names we have to call you something said holland if only to burn it into the casing down at hatteras so that some scaleheaded archaeologist several thousand years from now can give an identity to the teeth hes measuring how about chauncy asked conklin too ethnic replied peter i like asshole because thats what he is hes going to be strapped into a tube and dropped over the continental shelf into six miles of seawater for crimes other people committed i mean thats being an asshole cut it out roared the asshole awright my names nicolo nicholas dellacroce and for even giving you that you gotta get me protection like with valachi thats part of the deal it is holland frowned i dont remember mentioning it then you dont get nuthin youre wrong nicky broke in alex from across the small room were going to get everything we want the only drawback being that its a onetime shot we wont be able to crossexamine you or bring you into a federal court or even have you sign a deposition huh youll come out a vegetable with a refried brain of course i suppose its a blessing in a way youll hardly know it when youre packed into that shell casing in hatteras hey waddaya talkin simple logic answered the former naval commando and present head of the central intelligence agency after our medical team gets finished with you you cant expect us to keep you around can you an autopsy would railroad us to a rock pile for thirty years and frankly i havent got that kind of time whatll it be nicky you want to talk to us or do you want a priest i gotta think lets go alex said holland curtly walking away from the bed toward the door ill send for a priest this poor son of a bitch is going to need all the comfort he can get its times like this added conklin planting his cane on the floor and rising when i seriously ponder mans inhumanity to man then i rationalize its not brutality for thats only a descriptive abstraction its merely the custom of the trade were all in still theres the individualhis mind and his flesh and his all too sensitive nerve endings its the excruciating pain thank heavens ive always been in the background out of reachlike nickys associates they dine in elegant restaurants and he goes over in a tube beyond the continental shelf six miles down in the sea his body imploding into itself awright awright screamed nicolo dellacroce twisting on the bed his obese frame tangling the sheets ask your fuckin questions but you give me protection capisce that depends on the truthfulness of your answers said holland returning to the bed id be very truthful nicky observed alex limping back to the chair one misstatement and you sleep with the fishesi believe thats the customary phrase i dont need no coaching i know where its at lets begin mr dellacroce said the cia chief taking a small tape recorder out of his pocket checking the charge and placing it on the high white table by the patients bed he drew up a chair and continued speaking addressing his opening remarks to the thin silver recorder my name is admiral peter holland currently director of the central intelligence agency voice confirmation to be verified if necessary this is an interview with an informer well call john smith voice distortion to follow on interagency master tape identification in the dcis classified files all right mr smith were going to cut through the bullshit to the essential questions ill generalize them as much as possible for your protection but youll know exactly what im referring to and i expect specific answers whom do you work for mr smith atlas coin vending machines long island city replied dellacroce his words slurred and spoken gruffly who owns it i dunno who owns it most of us work from homesome fifteen maybe twenty guys you know what i mean we service the machines and send in our reports holland glanced over at conklin both men smiled with one answer the mafioso had placed himself within a large circle of potential informers nicolo was not new to the game who signs your paychecks mr smith a mr louis defazio a very legitimate businessman to dbest of my knowledge he gives us our assignments do you know where he lives brooklyn heights on the river i think someone told me what was your destination when our personnel intercepted you dellacroce winced briefly closing his swollen eyes before answering one of those drunkanddope tanks somewhere south of phillywhich you already know mr big shot cause you found the map in the car holland angrily reached for the recorder snapping it off youre on your way to hatteras you son of a bitch hey you get your info your way i give it mine okay there was a maptheres always a mapand each of us has to take those cockamamy back roads to the joint like we were driving the president or even a don superiore to an appalachian meet you gimme that message pad and the pencil ill give you the location right down to the brass plate on the stone gate the mafioso raised his uncased right arm and jabbed his index finger at the dci itll be accurate mr big shot because i dont wanna sleep with no fishes capisce but you wont put it on tape said holland a disturbed inflection in his voice why not tape shit what did you call it an interagency master bullshit what do you think our people cant tap into this place hoohah that fuckin doctor of yours could be one of us hes not but were going to get to an army doctor who is peter holland picked up the message pad and pencil from the bedside table handing both to dellacroce he did not bother to switch on the tape recorder they were beyond props and into hardball in new york city on th street between broadway and amsterdam avenue the hard core of harlem a large disheveled black man in his midthirties staggered up the sidewalk he bounced off the chipped brick wall of a rundown apartment building and slumped down on the pavement his legs extended his unshaven face angled into the right collar of his torn armysurplus shirt with the looks im getting he said quietly into the miniaturized microphone under the cloth youd think id invaded the high colonic white shopping district of palm springs youre doing beautifully came the metallic voice over the tiny speaker sewn into the back of the agents collar weve got the place covered well give you plenty of notice that answering machines so jammed its sending out whistling smoke how did you two lily boys get into that trap over there very early this morning so early no one noticed what we looked like i cant wait to watch you get out its a needle condo if i ever saw one speaking of which which we are in a way are the cops on this beat alerted id hate like hell to get hauled in after growing this bristle on my face it itches like crazy and my new wife of three weeks doesnt dig it you should have stayed with the first one buddy funny little white boy she didnt like the hours or the geography like in being away for weeks at a time playing games in zimbabwe answer me please the blue coats have your description and the scenario youre part of a federal bust so theyll leave you alone hold it conversations over this has to be our man hes got a telephone satchel strapped to his belt it is hes heading for the doorway its all yours emperor jones funny little white boy ive got him and i can tell you now hes a soft chocolate mousse hes scared shitless to go into this palace which means hes legitimate said the metallic voice in the collar thats good thats bad junior countered the black agent instantly if youre right he doesnt know anything and the layers between him and the source will be as thick as southern molasses oh then how do you read it onscene tech i have to see the numbers when he programs them into his troubleshooter what the hell does that mean he may be legit but hes also been frightened and not by the premises what does that mean its all over his face man he could enter in false numbers if he thinks hes being followed or watched youve lost me buddy he has to duplicate the digits that correspond to the remote so the beeps can be relayed forget it said the voice from the back of the collar that hightech im not besides we got a man down at that company recosomethingorother now hes waiting for you then ive got work to do out but keep me monitored the agent rose from the pavement and unsteadily made his way into the dilapidated building the telephone repairman had reached the second floor where he turned right in the narrow filthy corridor he had obviously been there before as there was no hesitation no checking the barely legible numbers on the doors things were going to be a little easier considered the cia man grateful because his assignment was beyond the purview of the agency purview shit it was illegal the agent took the steps three at a time his soft doublesoled rubber shoes reducing the noise to the inevitable creaks of an old staircase his back against the wall he peered around the corner of the trashfilled hallway and watched the repairman insert three separate keys into three vertical locks turning each in succession and entering the last door on the left things reconsidered the agent might not be so easy after all the instant the man closed the door he ran silently down the corridor and stood motionless listening not wonderful but not the worst he thought as he heard the sound of only one lock being latched the repairman was in a hurry he placed his ear against the peeling paint of the door and held his breath no echo from his lungs disturbing his hearing thirty seconds later he turned his head exhaled then took a deep breath and went back to the door although muffled he heard the words clearly enough to piece together the meaning central this is mike up on a hundred thirtyeighth street section twelve machine sixteen is there another unit in this building which i wouldnt believe if you said there was the following silence lasted perhaps twenty additional seconds we dont huh well we got a frequency interference and it dont make no sense to me the what cable tv aint no one in this neighborhood got the bread for that oh i gotcha brother area cable the drug boys live high dont they their addresses may be shit but inside them homes they got theyselves a pile of fancy crap so clear the line and reroute it ill stay here until i get a clean signal okay brother the agent again turned away from the door and again breathed now in relief he could leave without a confrontation he had all he needed one hundred thirtyeighth street section twelve machine sixteen and they knew the firm that installed the equipment the recometropolitan company sheridan square new york the lilywhites could handle it from there he walked back to the questionable staircase and lifted the collar of his armysurplus shirt in case i get run over by a truck heres the input are you reading me loud and clear emperor jones its machine sixteen in what they call section twelve got it youve earned your paycheck you might at least say outstanding old chap hey youre the guy who went to college over there not me some of us are overachievers hold it ive got company below on the bottom of the staircase a small compact black man appeared his dark eyes bulging staring up at the agent a gun in his hand the cia man spun behind the edge of the wall as four successive gunshots shattered the corridor lunging across the open space his revolver ripped from its holster the agent fired twice but once was enough his assailant fell to the floor of the soiled lobby i caught a ricochet in my leg cried the agent but hes downdeep dead or not i cant tell sweep up the vehicle and get us both out pronto on its way stay put it was shortly past eight oclock the next morning when alex conklin limped into peter hollands office the guards at the cia gates were impressed with his immediate access to the director anything asked the dci looking up from the papers on his desk nothing answered the retired field officer angrily heading for the couch against the wall rather than a chair not a goddamned thing jesus what a fuckedup day and it hasnt even begun casset and valentino are down in the cellars sending out queries all over the paris sewers but so far nothing christ look at the scenario and find me a thread swayne armbruster desoleour mute son of a bitch the mole then for gods sake teagarten with bournes calling card when we know damned well its a trap for jason set by the jackal but theres no logic anywhere that ties carlos to teagarten and by extension to medusa nothing makes sense peter weve lost the spineeverythings gone off the wire calm down said holland gently how the hell can i bournes disappearedi mean really disappeared if he isnt dead and theres no trace of marie no word from her and then we learn that bernardine was killed in a shootout only hours ago on the rivolichrist shot in broad daylight and that means jason was therehe had to be there but since none of the dead or wounded fits his description we can assume he got away cant we we can hope yes you asked for a thread mused the dci im not sure i can actually provide one but i can give you something like it new york conklin sat forward on the couch the answering machine that defazio hood in brooklyn heights well get to new york to all of thatthem right now lets concentrate on that thread of yours that spine you mentioned im not the slowest kid on the block but where is it holland leaned back in his chair gazing first at the papers on his desk and then up at alex seventytwo hours ago when you decided to come clean with me about everything you said that the idea behind bournes strategy was to persuade the jackal and this latterday medusa to join forces with bourne as the common target one feeding the other wasnt that basically the premise both sides wanted him killed carlos had two reasonsrevenge and the fact that he believes bourne could identify him the medusans because bourne had pieced together so much about them that was the premise yes agreed conklin nodding its why i dug around and made those phone calls never expecting to find what i did jesus a global cartel born twenty years ago in saigon peopled by some of the biggest fish in and out of the government and the military it was the kind of pay dirt i didnt want and wasnt looking for i thought i might dig up maybe ten or twelve hotshot millionaires with postsaigon bank accounts that couldnt bear scrutiny but not this not this medusa to put it as simply as possible continued holland frowning his eyes again straying down to the papers in front of him then up at alex once the connection was made between medusa and carlos word would be passed to the jackal that there was a man medusa wanted eliminated and cost was no object so far yes the key here was the caliber and the status of those reaching carlos explained conklin they had to be as close to bona fide olympians as we could find the kind of clients the jackal doesnt get and never got then the name of the target is revealedsay in a way such as john smith once known years ago as jason bourneand the jackal is hooked bourne the one man he wants dead above all others yes thats why the medusans reaching carlos had to be so solid so above questioning that carlos accepts them and dismisses any sort of a trap because added the cias director jason bourne came out of saigons medusaa fact known to carlosbut he never shared in the riches of the later postwar medusa thats the background scenario isnt it the logics as clean as it can be for three years he was used and damn near killed in a black operation and along the way he supposedly discovered that more than a few undistinguished saigon pricks were driving jaguars and were sailing yachts and pulling down sixfigure retainers while he went on a government pension that could try the patience of john the baptist to say nothing of barabbas its a terrific libretto allowed holland a slow smile breaking across his face i can hear the tenors soaring in triumph and the machiavellian bassos slinking offstage in defeat dont scowl at me alex i mean it its really ingenious its so inevitable it became a selffulfilling prophecy what the hell are you talking about your bourne was right from the beginning it all took place the way he saw it but not in any way he could have imagined because it was inevitable somewhere there had to be a crosspollinator please come down from mars and explain to an earthling peter medusas using the jackal now teagartens assassination proves it unless you want to concede that bourne actually blew up that car outside of brussels of course not then carloss name had to surface for someone in medusa who already knew about jason bourne it couldnt be otherwise you didnt mention either one to armbruster or swayne or atkinson in london did you again of course not the time wasnt right we werent ready to pull those triggers whos left asked holland alex stared at the dci good lord he said softly desole yes desole the grossly underpaid specialist who complained amusingly but incessantly that there was no way a man could properly educate his children and grandchildren on government pay he was brought in on everything we discussed starting with your assault on us in the conference room he certainly was but that was limited to bourne and the jackal there was no mention of armbruster or swayne no teagarten or atkinsonthe new medusa wasnt even in the picture hell peter you didnt know about it until seventytwo hours ago yes but desole did because hed sold out he was part of it he had to have been alerted watch it weve been penetrated some maniac says hes going to expose us blow us apart you told me yourself that panic buttons were punched from the trade commission to pentagon procurements to the embassy in london they were punched agreed conklin so hard that two of them had to be taken out along with teagarten and our disgruntled mole snake ladys elders quickly decided who their vulnerable people were but where does carlos or bourne fit in theres no attribution i thought we agreed that there was desole conklin shook his head its a provocative thought but it doesnt wash he couldnt have presumed that i knew about medusas penetration because we hadnt even started it but when you did the sequence had to bother him if only in the sense that although they were poles apart one crisis followed too quickly upon another what was it a matter of hours less than twentyfour still they were poles apart not for an analysts analyst countered holland if it walks like an odd duck and sounds like an odd duck look for an odd duck i submit that somewhere along the line desole made the connection between jason bourne and the madman who had infiltrated medusathe new medusa for christs sake how i dont know maybe because you told us bourne came out of the old saigon medusathats one hell of a connection to begin with my god you may be right said alex falling back on the couch the driving force we gave our unnamed madman was that hed been cut off from the new medusa i used the words myself with every phone call hes spent years putting it together hes got names and ranks and banks in zurich jesus im blind i said those things to total strangers on a telephone fishing expedition and never even thought about having mentioned bournes origins in medusa at that meeting when desole was here why should you have thought about it you and your man decided to play a separate game all by yourselves the reasons were goddamned valid broke in conklin for all i knew you were a medusan thanks a bunch come on dont give me that shit weve got a top max out at langley those were the words i heard from london what would you have thought what would you have done exactly what you did answered holland a tight grin on his lips but youre supposed to be so bright so much smarter than im supposed to be thanks a bunch dont be hard on yourself you did what any of us would have done in your place for that i do thank you and youre right of course it had to be desole how he did it i dont know but it had to be him it probably went back years inside his headhe never really forgot anything you know his mind was a sponge that absorbed everything and never let a recollection drip away he could remember words and phrases even spontaneous grunts of approval or disapproval the rest of us forgot and i gave him the whole bournejackal historyand then someone from medusa used it in brussels they did more than that alex said holland leaning forward in his chair and picking up several papers from his desk they stole your scenario usurped your strategy theyve pitted jason bourne against carlos the jackal but instead of the controls being in your hands medusa has them bournes back where he was in europe thirteen years ago maybe with his wife maybe not the only difference being that in addition to carlos and interpol and every other police authority on the continent ready to waste him on sight hes got another lethal monkey on his back thats whats in those pages youre holding isnt it the information from new york i cant guarantee it but i think so its the crosspollinator i spoke about before the bee that went from one rotten flower to another carrying poison deliver please nicolo dellacroce and the higherups above him mafia its consistent if not socially acceptable medusa grew out of saigons officer corps and it still relegates its dirty work to the hungry grunts and corrupt ncos check out nicky d and men like sergeant flannagan when it comes to killing or kidnapping or using drugs on prisoners the starchedshirt boys stay far in the background theyre nowhere to be found but i gather you found them said the impatient conklin again we think sowe being our people in quiet consultation with new yorks anticrime division especially a unit called the us platoon never heard of it theyre mostly italian americans they gave themselves the name untouchable sicilians thus the us initials with a dual connotation nice touch unnice work according to the recometropolitans billing files the who the company that installed the answering machine on one hundred thirtyeighth street in manhattan sorry go on according to the files the machine was leased to a small importing firm on eleventh avenue several blocks from the piers an hour ago we got the telephone records for the past two months for the company and guess what we found id rather not wait said alex emphatically nine calls to a reasonably acceptable number in brooklyn heights and three in the space of an hour to an extremely unlikely telephone on wall street someone was excited thats what we thoughtwe in this case being our own unit we asked the sicilians to give us what they had on brooklyn heights defazio lets put it this way he lives there but the phone is registered to the atlas coin vending machine company in long island city it fits dumb but it fits what about defazio hes a middlelevel but ambitious capo in the giancavallo family hes very close very underground very vicious and very gay holy christ the untouchables swore us to secrecy they intend to spring it themselves bullshit said conklin softly one of the first things we learn in this business is to lie to anyone and everyone especially anyone whos foolish enough to trust us well use it anytime it gets us a square forward whats the other telephone number the unlikely one just about the most powerful law firm on wall street medusa concluded alex firmly thats the way i read it theyve got seventysix lawyers on two floors of the building which one is itor who among them are they i dont give a goddamn we go after defazio and whatever controls hes sending over to paris to europe to feed the jackal theyre the guns after jason and thats all i care about go to work on defazio hes the one under contract peter holland leaned back in his chair rigid intense it had to come to this didnt it alex he asked quietly we both have our priorities id do anything within my sworn capacity to save the lives of jason bourne and his wife but i will not violate my oath to defend this country first i cant do it and i suspect you know that my priority is medusa in your words a global cartel that intends to become a government within our government over here thats whom i have to go after first and immediately and without regard to casualties to put it plainly my friendand i hope youre my friendthe bournes or whoever they are are expendable im sorry alex thats really why you asked me to come over here this morning isnt it said conklin planting his cane on the floor and awkwardly getting to his feet yes it is youve got your own game plan against medusaand we cant be a part of it no you cant its a fundamental conflict of interest ill grant you that wed louse you up in a minute if itd help jason and marie naturally my personal and professional opinion is that if the whole fucking united states government cant rip out a medusa without sacrificing a man and a woman whove given so much im not sure its worth a damn neither am i said holland standing up behind the desk but i swore an oath to tryin order of my sworn priorities have i got any perks left anything i can get you that doesnt compromise our going after medusa how about two seats on a military aircraft agencycleared to paris two seats panov and me we went to hong kong together why not paris alex youre out of your goddamned mind i dont think you understand peter mos wife died ten years after they were married and i never had the courage to give it a try so you see jason bourne and marie are the only family we have she makes a hell of a meat loaf let me tell you two tickets to paris said holland his face ashen marie watched her husband as he walked back and forth the pacing deliberate energized he tramped angrily between the writing table and the sunlit curtains of the two windows overlooking the front lawn of the auberge des artistes in barbizon the country inn was the one marie remembered but it was not part of david webbs memory and when he said as much his wife briefly closed her eyes hearing another voice from years ago above everything hes got to avoid extreme stress the kind of tension that goes with survival under lifethreatening circumstances if you see him regressing into that state of mindand youll know it when you see itstop him seduce him slap him cry get angry anything just stop him morris panov dear friend doctor and the guiding force behind her husbands therapy she had tried seduction within minutes after they were alone together it was a mistake even a touch farcical awkward for both of them neither was remotely aroused yet there was no embarrassment they held each other on the bed both understanding were a couple of real sexpots arent we said marie weve been there before replied david webb gently and ive no doubt well be there again then jason bourne rolled away and stood up i have to make a list he said urgently heading for the quaint country table against the wall that served as a desk and a place for the telephone we have to know where we are and where were going and i have to call johnny on the island added marie rising to her feet and smoothing her skirt after i talk to him ill speak to jamie ill reassure him and tell him well be back soon the wife crossed to the table she stopped blocked by her husbandher husband yet not her husband no said bourne quietly shaking his head dont say that to me protested the mother anger flashing in her eyes three hours ago in the rivoli changed everything nothings the same now dont you understand that i understand that my children are several thousand miles away from me and i intend to reach them dont you understand that of course i do i just cant allow it answered jason goddamn you mr bourne will you listen to me youll talk to johnny and to jamiewell both talk to thembut not from here and not while theyre on the island what im calling alex in a few minutes and telling him to get all of them out of there including mrs cooper of course marie had stared at her husband suddenly understanding oh my god carlos yes as of this noon hes got only one place to zero in ontranquility if he doesnt know now hell learn soon enough that jamie and alison are with johnny i trust your brother and his personal tonton macoute but i still want them away from there before its night in the islands i also dont know if carlos has sources in the islands trunk lines that could trace a call between there and here but i do know that alexs phone is sterile thats why you cant call now from here to there then for gods sake call alex what the hell are you waiting for im not sure for a moment there was a blank panicked look in her husbands eyesthey were the eyes of david webb not jason bourne i have to decidewhere do i send the kids alex will know jason said marie her own eyes leveled steadily on his now yes yes of course now the veiled vacuous look passed and bourne reached for the phone alexander conklin was not in vienna virginia usa instead there was the monotonic voice of a recorded operator that had the effect of crashing thunder the telephone number you have called is no longer in service he had placed the call twice again believing in desperate hope that an error had been made by the french telephone service then bolts of lightning followed the telephone number you have called is no longer in service for a third time the pacing had begun from the table to the windows and back again over and over the curtains were pulled aside anxious eyes nervously peering out then seconds later poring over a growing list of names and places marie suggested lunch he did not hear her so she watched him in silence from across the room the quick abrupt movements of her husband were like those of a large disquieted cat smooth fluid alert for the unexpected they were the movements of jason bourne and before him medusas delta not david webb she remembered the medical records compiled by mo panov in the early days of davids therapy many were filled with wildly divergent descriptions from people who claimed to have seen the man known as the chameleon but among the most reliable was a common reference to the catlike mobility of the assassin panov had been looking for clues to jason bournes identity then for all they had at the time were a first name and fragmented images of painful death in cambodia mo often wondered aloud if there was more to his patients physical dexterity than mere athleticism oddly enough there was not as marie looked back the subtle physical differences between the two men who were her husband both fascinated and repelled her each was muscular and graceful each capable of performing difficult tasks requiring physical coordination but where davids strength and mobility came from an easy sense of accomplishment jasons was filled with an inner malice no pleasure in the accomplishment only a hostile purpose when she had mentioned this to panov his reply was succinct david couldnt kill bourne can he was trained to still mo was pleased that she had spotted the different physical manifestations as he called her observation its another signpost for you when you see bourne bring david back as fast as you can if you cant call me she could not bring david back now she thought for the sake of the children and herself and david she dared not try im going out for a while announced jason by the window you cant cried marie for gods sake dont leave me alone bourne frowned lowering his voice somewhere an undefined conflict within him im just driving out on the highway to find a phone thats all take me with you please i cant stay by myself any longer all right as a matter of fact well need a few things well find one of those malls and buy some clothestoothbrushes a razor whatever else we can think of you mean we cant go back to paris we can and probably will go back to paris but not to our hotels do you have your passport passport money credit cards everything they were all in my purse which i didnt know i had until you gave it to me in the car i didnt think it was such a good idea to leave it at the meurice come on a phone first who are you calling alex you just tried him at his apartment he was thrown out of his security tent in virginia then ill reach mo panov lets go they drove south again to the small city of corbeilessonnes where there was a relatively new shopping center several miles west of the highway the crowded merchandising complex was a blight on the french countryside but a welcome sight for the fugitives jason parked the car and like any husband and wife out for lateafternoon shopping they strolled down the central mall all the while frantically looking for a public telephone not a goddamned one on the highway said bourne through clenched teeth what do they think people are supposed to do if they have an accident or a flat tire wait for the police answered marie and there was a phone only it was broken into maybe thats why there arent more theres one once again jason went through the irritating process of placing an overseas call with local operators who found it irritating to ring through to the international branch of the system and then the thunder returned distant but implacable this is alex said the recorded voice over the line ill be away for a while visiting a place where a grave error was made call me in five or six hours its now ninethirty in the morning eastern standard time out juneau stunned his mind spinning bourne hung up the phone and stared at marie somethings happened and i have to make sense out of it his last words wereout juneau juneau marie squinted her eyes blocking out the light then she opened them and looked at her husband alpha bravo charlie she began softly adding alternating military alphabets then she spoke rapidly foxtrot gold india juneau juneaus for j and j is for jason what was the rest hes visiting someplace come on lets walk she broke in noticing the curious faces of two men waiting to use the phone she grabbed his arm and pulled him away from the booth he couldnt be clearer she asked as they entered the flow of the crowds it was a recording where a grave error was made the what he said to call him in five or six hourshe was visiting a place where a grave errorgravemy god its rambouillet the cemetery where he tried to kill me thirteen years ago thats it rambouillet not in five or six hours objected marie no matter when he left the message he couldnt fly to paris and then drive to rambouillet in five hours he was in washington of course he could weve both done it before an army jet out of andrews air force base under diplomatic cover to paris peter holland threw him out but he gave him a going away present immediate separation but a bonus for bringing him medusa bourne suddenly whipped his wrist up and looked at his watch its still only around noon in the islands lets find another phone johnny tranquility you really think i cant stop thinking interrupted jason rushing ahead holding maries hand as she stumblingly kept up with him glace he said looking up to his right ice cream theres a phone inside over there he answered slowing them both down and approaching the huge windows of a pâtisserie that had a red banner over its door announcing an ice cream counter with several dozen flavors get me a vanilla he said ushering them both into the crowded store vanilla what whatever you wont be able to hear hell hear me thats all that matters take your time give me time bourne crossed to the phone instantly understanding why it was not used the noise of the store was nearly unbearable mademoiselle sil vous plaît cest urgent three minutes later holding his palm against his left ear jason had the unexpected comfort of hearing tranquility inns most irritating employee over the phone this is mr pritchard tranquility inns associate manager my switchboard informs me that you have an emergency sir may i inquire as to the nature of your you can shut up shouted jason from the cacophonous ice cream parlor in corbeilessonnes in france get jay st jay on the phone now this is his brotherinlaw oh it is such a pleasure to hear from you sir much has happened since you left your lovely children are with us and the handsome young boy plays on the beachwith me sirand all is mr st jacques please now of course sir he is upstairs johnny david where are you that doesnt matter get out of there take the kids and mrs cooper and get out we know all about it dave alex conklin called several hours ago and said somebody named holland would reach us i gather hes the chief honcho of your intelligence service he is did he yeah about twenty minutes after i talked to alex he told us we were being choppered out around two oclock this afternoon he needed the time to clear a military aircraft in here mrs cooper was my idea your backward son says he doesnt know how to change diapers sport david what the hell is going on wheres marie shes all rightill explain everything later just do as holland says did he say where you were being taken he didnt want to ill tell you that but no fucking americans going to order me and your kids aroundmy canadian sisters kidsand i told him that in a seven spade flush thats nice johnny make friends with the director of the cia i dont give a shit on that score in my country we figure those initials mean caught in the act and i told him so thats even nicer what did he say he said we were going to a safe house in virginia and i said mines pretty goddamned safe right here and we had a restaurant and room service and a beach and ten guards who could shoot his balls off at two hundred yards youre full of tact and what did he say to that actually he laughed then he explained that his place had twenty guards who could take out one of my balls at four hundred yards along with a kitchen and room service and television for the kids that i couldnt match thats pretty persuasive well he said something else that was even more persuasive that i really couldnt match he told me there was no public access to the place that it was an old estate in fairfax turned over to the government by a rich ambassador who had more money than ottawa with its own airfield and an entrance road four miles from the highway i know the place said bourne wincing at the noise of the pâtisserie its the tannenbaum estate hes right its the best of the sterile houses he likes us i asked you beforewheres marie shes with me she found you later johnny ill reach you in fairfax jason hung up the phone as his wife awkwardly made her way through the crowd and handed him a pink plastic cup with a blue plastic spoon plunged into a mound of dark brown the children she asked raising her voice to be heard her eyes on fire everythings fine better than we might have expected alex reached the same conclusion about the jackal as i did peter hollands flying them all up to a safe house in virginia mrs cooper included thank god thank alex bourne looked at the pink plastic cup with the thin blue spoon what the hell is this they didnt have vanilla its a hot fudge sundae it was meant for the man beside me but he was yelling at his wife so i took it i dont like hot fudge so yell at your wife come on weve got to buy clothes the early afternoon caribbean sun burned down on tranquility inn as john st jacques descended the staircase into the lobby carrying a lesport duffel bag in his right hand he nodded to mr pritchard whom he had spoken to over the phone only moments ago explaining that he was leaving for several days and would be in touch within hours after he reached toronto what remained of the staff had been apprised of his sudden quite necessary departure and he had full confidence in the executive manager and his valuable assistant mr pritchard he assumed that no problems would arise beyond their combined expertise tranquility inn for all intents and purposes was virtually shut down however sir henry sykes at government house on the big island should be contacted in the event of difficulties there shall be none beyond my expertise pritchard had replied the repair and maintenance crews will work every bit as hard in your absence st jacques walked out the glass doors of the circular building toward the first villa on the right the one nearest the stone steps to the pier and the two beaches mrs cooper and the two children waited inside for the arrival of the united states navy longrange seagoing helicopter that would take them to puerto rico where they would board a military jet to andrews air force base outside washington through the huge glass windows mr pritchard watched his employer disappear through the doors of villa one at that same moment he heard the growing sounds of a large helicopters rotors thumping in the air above the inn in minutes it would circle the water beyond the pier and descend awaiting its passengers apparently those passengers heard what he had heard thought mr pritchard as he saw st jacques gripping his young nephews hand and the insufferably arrogant mrs cooper who was holding a blanketed infant in her arms come out of the villa followed by the two favorite guards carrying their luggage pritchard reached below the counter for the telephone that bypassed the switchboard he dialed this is the office of the deputy director of immigration himself speaking esteemed uncle it is you broke in the official from blackburne airport abruptly lowering his voice what have you learned everything is of immense value i assure you i heard it all on the telephone we shall both be greatly rewarded i have that on the highest authority they may all be undercover terrorists you know st jacques himself the leader it is said they may even fool washington what can i pass on brilliant nephew they are being taken to what is called a safe house in virginia it is known as the tannenbaum estate and has its own airport can you believe such a thing i can believe anything where these animals are concerned be sure to include my name and position esteemed uncle would i do otherwise could i do otherwise we shall be the heroes of montserrat but remember my intelligent nephew everything must be kept in utmost secrecy we are both sworn to silence never forget that just think weve been selected to render service to a great international organization leaders the world over will know of our contributions my heart bursts with pride may i know what this august organization is called shhh it has no name that is part of the secrecy the money was wired through a bank computer transfer directly from switzerland that is the proof a sacred trust added mr pritchard also well paid trusted nephew and it is only the beginning i myself am monitoring all aircraft arriving here and sending the manifests on to martinique to a famous surgeon no less of course at the moment all flights are on hold orders from government house the american military helicopter asked the awed pritchard shhh it too is a secret everything is secret then it is a very loud and apparent secret my esteemed uncle people are on the beach watching it now what its here mr saint jay and the children are boarding as we speak also that dreadful mrs cooper i must call paris at once interrupted the immigration officer disconnecting the line paris repeated mr pritchard how inspiring how privileged we are i didnt tell him everything said peter holland quietly shaking his head as he spoke i wanted toi intended tobut it was in his eyes in his own words actually he said that hed louse us up in a minute if it would help bourne and his wife he would too charles casset nodded he sat in the chair in front of the directors desk a computer printout of a longburied classified file in his hand when you read this youll understand alex really did try to kill bourne in paris years agohis closest friend and he tried to put a bullet in his head for all the wrong reasons conklins on his way to paris now he and morris panov thats on your head peter i wouldnt have done it not without strings i couldnt refuse him of course you could you didnt want to we owed him he brought us medusaand from here on charlie thats all that concerns us i understand director holland said casset coldly and i assume that due to foreign entanglements youre working backwards into a domestic conspiracy that should be incontestably established before you alert the guardians of domestic accord namely the federal bureau are you threatening me you lowlife i certainly am peter casset dropped the ice from his expression replacing it with a calm thin smile youre breaking the law mr director thats regrettable old boy as my predecessors might have said what the hell do you want from me cried holland cover one of our own one of the best we ever had i not only want it i insist upon it if you think im going to give him everything including the name of medusas law firm on wall street youre out of your fucking mind its our keystone for gods sake go back into the navy admiral said the deputy director his voice level again cold without emphasis if you think thats what im suggesting you havent learned very much in that chair hey come on smart ass thats pretty close to insubordination of course it is because im insubordinatebut this isnt the navy you cant keelhaul me or hang me from the yardarm or withhold my ration of rum all you can do is fire me and if you do a lot of people will wonder why which wouldnt do the agency any good but thats not necessary what the hell are you talking about charlie well to begin with im not talking about that law firm in new york because youre right it is our keystone and alex with his infinite imagination would probe and threaten to the point where the shredding begins and our paper trail here and abroad ends i had something like that in mind then again you were right interrupted casset nodding so we keep alex away from our keystone as far away from us as possible but we give him our marker something tangible he can plug into knowing its value silence then holland spoke i dont understand a word youre saying you would if you knew conklin better he knows now that theres a connection between medusa and the jackal what did you call it a selffulfilling prophecy i said the strategy was so perfect it was inevitable and therefore selffulfilling desole was the unexpected catalyst who moved everything ahead of schedulehim and whatever the hell happened down in montserrat whats this marker of yours this tangible item of value the string peter knowing what he knows you cant let alex bounce around europe like a loose cannon any more than you could give him the name of that law firm in new york we need a pipeline to him so we have some idea what hes up tomore than an idea if we can manage it someone like his friend bernardine only someone who can also be our friend where do we find such a person i have a candidateand i hope were not being taped count on it said holland with a trace of anger i dont believe in that crap and this office is swept every morning whos the candidate a man at the soviet embassy in paris replied casset calmly i think we can deal a mole not for a minute a kgb officer whose first priority never changes find carlos kill carlos protect novgorod novgorod the americanized village or town where the jackal was initially trained in russia half trained and escaped from before he could be shot as a maniac only its not just an american compoundthats a mistake we make so often there are british and french compounds too also israeli dutch spanish west german and god knows how many others dozens of square miles cut out of the forests along the volkhov river dotted with settlements so that youd swear you were in a different country with each one you enteredif you could get inside which you couldnt like the aryan breeding farms the lebensborn of nazi germany novgorod is one of moscows most closely guarded secrets they want the jackal as badly as jason bourne does and you think this kgb fellow will cooperate keep us informed about conklin if they make contact i can try after all we have a common objective and i know alex would accept him because he knows how much the soviets want carlos on the dead list holland leaned forward in his chair i told conklin id help him any way i could as long as it didnt compromise our going after medusa hell be landing in paris within the hour shall i leave instructions at the diplomatic counter for him to reach you tell him to call charlie bravo plus one said casset getting up and dropping the computer printout on the desk i dont know how much i can give him in an hour but ill go to work ive got a secure channel to our russian thanks to an outstanding consultant of ours in paris give him a bonus shes already asked for oneharassed me is more appropriate she runs the cleanest escort service in the city the girls are checked weekly why not hire them all asked the director smiling i believe seven are already on the payroll sir answered the deputy director his demeanor serious in contrast to his arched eyebrows dr morris panov his legs unsteady was helped down the metal steps of the diplomatically cleared jet by a strapping marine corporal in starched summer khakis carrying his suitcase how do you people manage to look so presentable after such a perfectly horrendous trip asked the psychiatrist none of us will look this presentable after a couple of hours of liberty in paris sir some things never change corporal thank god wheres that crippled delinquent who was with me he was vehicled off for a diplograph sir come again a nouns a verb leading to the incomprehensible its not so hard doctor laughed the marine leading panov to a motorized cart complete with a uniformed driver and a stenciled american flag on the side during our descent the tower radioed the pilot that there was an urgent message for him i thought he went to the bathroom that too i believe sir the corporal put the suitcase on a rear rack and helped mo into the cart easy now doctor lift your leg up a little higher thats the other one not me protested the psychiatrist hes the one without a foot we were told youd been ill sir not in my goddamned legs sorry young man no offense i just dont like flying in small tubes a hundred and ten miles up in the sky not too many astronauts come from tremont avenue in the bronx hey youre kidding doc what im from garden street you know across from the zoo the names fleishman morris fleishman nice to meet a fellow bronxite morris said panov shaking hands morris the marine i should have had a talk with your parents stay well mo and thank you for your concern you get better doc and when you see tremont avenue again give it my best okay i will indeed morris replied morris raising his hand as the diplomatic cart shot forward four minutes later escorted by the driver panov entered the long gray corridor that was the immigrationfree access to france for government functionaries of nations accredited by the quai dorsay they walked into the large holding lounge where men and women were gathered in small groups conversing quietly the sounds of different languages filling the room alarmed mo saw that conklin was nowhere in sight he turned to the driverescort as a young woman dressed in the neutral uniform of a hostess approached docteur she asked addressing panov yes replied mo surprised but im afraid my french is pretty rusty if not nonexistent its of no matter sir your companion requested that you remain here until he returns it will be no more than a few minutes he was quite sure please sit down may i bring you a drink bourbon with ice if youd be so kind answered panov lowering himself into the armchair certainly sir the hostess retreated as the driver placed mos suitcase beside him i have to get back to my vehicle said the diplomatic escort youll be fine here i wonder where my friend went mused panov glancing at his watch probably to an outside phone doctor they come in here get messages at the counters then go like hell into the terminal to find public pay phones they dont like the ones in here the russkies always walk the fastest the arabs the slowest must be their respective climates offered the psychiatrist smiling dont bet your stethoscope on it the driver laughed and brought his hand up for an informal salute take care sir and get some rest you look tired thank you young man goodbye i am tired thought panov as the escort disappeared into the gray corridor so tired but alex was right if hed flown here alone i would never have forgiven him david weve got to find him the damage to him could be incalculablenone of them understands with a single act his fragile damaged mind could regress yearsthirteen yearsto where he was a functioning killer and for him nothing else a voice the figure above was talking to him im sorry forgive me your drink doctor said the hostess pleasantly i debated whether to wake you but then you moved and sounded as though you were in pain no not at all my dear just tired i understand sir sudden flights can be so exhausting and if they are long and uncomfortable even worse you touched on all three points miss agreed panov taking his drink thank you you are american of course how could you tell im not wearing cowboy boots or a hawaiian shirt the woman laughed charmingly i know the driver who brought you in here hes american security and quite nice very attractive security you mean like in police oh very much so but we never use the word oh heres your companion coming back inside the hostess lowered her voice may i ask quickly doctor does he require a wheelchair good heavens no hes walked like that for years very well enjoy your stay in paris sir the woman left as alex limping weaved around several groups of chattering europeans to the chair next to panov he sat down and leaned forward awkwardly in the soft leather he was obviously disturbed whats the matter asked mo i just talked to charlie casset in washington hes the one you like the one you trust isnt he hes the best there is when he has personal access or at least human intelligence when he can see and hear and look for himself and not simply read words on paper or a computer screen without asking questions are you perchance moving into my territory again doctor conklin i accused david of that last week and ill tell you what he told me its a free country and your training notwithstanding you dont have a franchise on common sense mea culpa agreed panov nodding i gather your friend did something you dont approve of he did something he wouldnt approve of if he had more information on whom he did it with that sounds positively freudian even medically imprudent both are part of it i guess he made an outside unsanctioned deal with a man named dimitri krupkin at the russian embassy here in paris well be working with the local kgbyou me bourne and marieif and when we find them hopefully in rambouillet in an hour or so what are you saying asked mo astonished and barely audible long story short time moscow wants the jackals head the rest of him separated from it washington cant feed us or protect us so the soviets will act as our temporary paterfamilias if we find ourselves in a bind panov frowned then shook his head as though absorbing very strange information then spoke i suppose its not your runofthemill development but theres a certain logic even comfort to it on paper mo said conklin not with dimitri krupkin i know him charlie doesnt oh hes one of the evil people kruppie evil no not really kruppie we go way back as young hustlers to istanbul in the late sixties and athens after that then amsterdam later krupkins not malevolent and he works like a son of a bitch for moscow with a damn good secondrate mind better than eighty percent of the clowns in our business but hes got a problem hes fundamentally on the wrong side in the wrong society his parents should have come over with mine when the bolsheviks took the throne i forget your family was russian speaking the language helps with kruppie i can nail his nuances hes the quintessential capitalist like the economic ministers in beijing he doesnt just like money hes obsessed with itand everything that goes with it out of sight and out of sanction he could be bought you mean by the jackal i saw him bought in athens by greek developers selling additional airstrips to washington when they knew the communists were going to throw us out they paid him to shut up then i watched him broker diamonds in amsterdam between the merchants on the nieuwmarkt and the dachaelite in moscow we had drinks one night in the kattengat and i asked him kruppie what the fuck are you doing you know what he said he said in clothes i couldnt afford aleksei ill do everything i can to outsmart you to help the supreme soviet to gain world dominance but in the meantime if youd like a holiday i have a lovely house on the lake in geneva thats what he said mo hes remarkable of course you told your friend casset all this of course i didnt broke in conklin good god why not because krupkin obviously never told charlie that he knew me casset may have the deal but im dealing with what how davidjasonhas over five million in the caymans with only a spit of that amount ill turn kruppie so hell be working only for us if we need him or want him to which means you dont trust casset not so said alex i trust charlie with my life its just that im not sure i want it in his hands he and peter holland have their priorities and we have ours theirs is medusa ours are david and marie messieurs the hostess returned and addressed conklin your car has arrived sir it is on the south platform youre sure its for me asked alex forgive me monsieur but the attendant said a mr smith had a difficult leg hes certainly right about that ive called a porter to carry your luggage messieurs its a rather long walk hell meet you on the platform thanks very much conklin got to his feet and reached into his pocket pulling out money pardon monsieur interrupted the hostess we are not permitted to accept gratuities thats right i forgot my suitcase is behind your counter isnt it where your escort left it sir along with the doctors it will be at the platform within minutes thanks again said alex sorry about the tip we are well paid sir but thank you for the thought as they walked to the door that led into the main terminal of orly airport conklin turned to panov how did she know you were a doctor he asked you soliciting couch business hardly the commuting would be a bit strenuous then how i never said anything about your being a doctor she knows the security escort who brought me into the lounge in fact i think she knows him quite well she said in that delectable french accent of hers that he was verry attractiefe looking up at the signs in the crowded terminal they started toward the south platform what neither of them saw was a distinguishedlooking oliveskinned man with wavy black hair and large dark eyes walk quickly out of the diplomatic lounge his steady gaze directed at the two americans he crossed to the wall rushing past the crowds until he was diagonally in front of conklin and panov near the taxi platform then squinting as if unsure he removed a small photograph from his pocket and kept glancing at it as he raised his eyes and looked up at the departing passengers from the united states the photograph was of dr morris panov dressed in a white hospital gown a glazed unearthly expression on his face the americans went out on the platform the darkhaired man did the same the americans looked around for a taxi the darkhaired man signaled a private car a driver got out of a cab he approached conklin and panov speaking quietly as a porter arrived with their luggage the two americans climbed into the taxi the stranger who followed them slipped into the private car two vehicles behind the cab pazzo said the darkhaired man in italian to the fashionably dressed middleaged woman behind the wheel i tell you its crazy for three days we wait all incoming american planes watched and we are about to give up when that fool in new york turns out to be right its them here ill drive you get out and reach our people over there tell them to call defazio instruct him to go to his other favorite restaurant and await my call to him he is not to leave until we speak is this you old man asked the hostess in the diplomatic lounge speaking softly into the telephone at her counter it is i replied the quavering voice at the other end of the line and the angelus rings for eternity in my ears it is you then i told you that so get on with it the list we were given last week included a slender middleaged american with a limp possibly accompanied by a doctor is this correct correct and they have passed through i used the title doctor with the cripples companion and he responded to it where have they gone its vital that i know it was not disclosed but i will soon learn enough for you to find out old man the porter who took their luggage to the south platform will get the description and the license of the car that meets them in the name of god call me back with the information three thousand miles from paris louis defazio sat alone at a rear table in trafficantes clam house on prospect avenue in brooklyn new york he finished his late afternoon lunch of vitello tonnato and dabbed his lips with the bright red napkin trying to look his usual jovial if patronizing self however if the truth were known it was all he could do to stop from gnawing on the napkin rather than caressing his mouth with it maledetto he had been at trafficantes for nearly two hourstwo hours and it had taken him fortyfive minutes to get there after the call from garafolas pasta palace in manhattan so that meant it was actually over two hours almost three since the gumball in paris france spotted two of the targets how long could it take for two bersaglios to get to a hotel in the city from the airport like three hours not unless the palermo gumball drove to london england which was not out of the question not if one knew palermo still defazio knew he had been right the way the jew shrink talked under the needle there was no other route he and the exspook could take but to paris and their good buddy the fake hit man so nicolo and the shrink disappeared went poofzam so what the fuck the jew got away and nicky would do time but nicolo wouldnt talk he understood that bad trouble like a knife in the kidney was waiting for him wherever he went if he did besides nicky didnt know anything so specific the lawyers couldnt wipe away as secondhand horseshit from a fifthrate horses ass and the shrink only knew he was in a room in some farmhouse if he could even remember that he never saw anybody but nicolo when he was compass mantis as they say but louis defazio knew he was right and because he was right there were more than seven million big ones waiting for him in paris seven million holy christ he could give the palermo gumballs in paris more than they ever expected and still walk away with a bundle an old waiter from the old country an uncle of trafficante approached the table and louis held his breath theres a telephone call for you signor defazio as was usual the capo supremo went to a pay phone at the end of a narrow dark corridor outside the mens room this is new york said defazio this is paris signor new york this is also pazzo whereve you been you pazzo enough to drive to london england ive been waitin three hours where ive been is on a number of unlit country roads which is important only to my nerves where i am now is crazy so where im using a gatekeepers telephone for which im paying roughly a hundred american dollars and the french buffone keeps looking through the window to see that i dont steal anythingperhaps his lunch pail who knows you dont sound too stupid for a gumball so what gatekeepers what what are you talking about im at a cemetery about twentyfive miles from paris i tell you a cimitero interrupted louis what the hell for because your two acquaintances drove here from the airport you ignorante at the moment there is a burial in progressa night burial with a candlelight procession which will soon be drowned out by rainand if your two acquaintances flew over here to attend this barbaric ceremony then the air in america is filled with braindamaging pollutants we did not bargain for this sciocchezze new york we have our own work to do they went there to meet the big cannoli said defazio quietly as if to himself as to work gumball if you ever want to work with us or philadelphia or chicago or los angeles again youll do what i tell you youll also be terrifically paid for it capisce that makes more sense i admit stay out of sight but stay with them find out where they go and who they see ill get over there as soon as i can but i gotta go by way of canada or mexico just to make sure no ones watching ill be there late tomorrow or early the next day ciao said paris omerta said louis defazio the handheld candles flickered in the night drizzle as the two parallel lines of mourners walked solemnly behind the white casket borne on the shoulders of six men several began to slip on the increasingly wet gravel of the cemeterys path flanking the procession were four drummers two on each side their snare drums snapping out the slow cadence of the death march erratically out of sequence because of the unexpected rocks and the unseen flat grave markers in the darkness of the bordering grass shaking his head slowly in bewilderment morris panov watched the strange nocturnal burial rite relieved to see alex conklin limping threading his way between the tombstones toward their meeting ground any sign of them asked alex none replied panov i gather you didnt do any better worse i got stuck with a lunatic how a light was on in the gatehouse so i went over thinking david or marie might have left us a message there was a clown outside who kept looking into a window and said he was the watchman and did i want to rent his telephone his telephone he said there were special rates for the night as the nearest pay phone was ten kilometers down the road a lunatic agreed panov i explained that i was looking for a man and a woman i was to meet here and wondered if theyd left a message there was no message but there was the telephone two hundred francscrazy i might do a flourishing business in paris said mo smiling did he by any chance see a couple wandering around i asked him that and he nodded affirmative saying there were dozens then he pointed to that candlelight parade over there before going back to his goddamn window what is that parade incidentally i asked him that too its a religious cult they bury their dead only at night he thinks they may be gypsies he said that while blessing himself theyre going to be wet gypsies observed panov pulling up his collar as the drizzle turned into rain christ why didnt i think of it exclaimed conklin looking over his shoulder the rain asked the bewildered psychiatrist no the large tomb halfway up the hill beyond the gatehouse its where it happened where you tried to mo did not finish the question he did not have to where he could have killed me but didnt completed alex come on the two americans retreated down the gravel path past the gatehouse and into the darkness of the rising hill of grass punctuated by white gravestones now glistening in the rain easy cried panov out of breath youre used to that nonexistent foot of yours but i havent quite adjusted to my pristine body having been raped by chemicals sorry mo shouted a womans voice from a marble portico above the figure waved her arms beneath the pillared overhanging roof of a grave so large it looked like a minor mausoleum marie yelled panov rushing ahead of conklin thats nice roared alex limping with difficulty up the wet slippery grass you hear the sound of a female and suddenly youre unraped you need a shrink you phony the embraces were meant a family was together while panov and marie spoke quietly jason bourne took conklin aside to the edge of the short marble roof the rain now harsh the former candlelight procession below the flickering flames now gone was half scattered half holding its position by a gravesite i didnt mean to choose this place alex said jason but with that crowd down there i couldnt think of another remember the gatehouse and that wide path to the parking lot youd won i was out of ammunition and you could have blown my head apart youre wrong how many times have i told you i couldnt have killed you it was in your eyes even though i wasnt able to see them clearly i knew what was there anger and confusion but above all confusion thats never been a reason not to kill a man who tries to kill you it is if you cant remember the memory may be gone but not the fragments not thewell for me they were pulsating images in and out in and out but there conklin looked up at bourne a sad grin on his face the pulsating bit he said that was mos term you stole it probably said jason as both men in unison looked back at marie and panov shes talking about me you know that dont you why not shes concerned and hes concerned i hate to think how many more concerns ill give them both you too i imagine what are you trying to tell me david just that forget david david webb doesnt exist not here not now hes an act i put on for his wife and i do it badly i want her to go back to the states to her children her children she wont do it she came over to find you and she found you she remembers paris thirteen years ago and she wont leave you without her then you wouldnt be alive today shes an impediment she has to go ill find a way alex looked up at the cold eyes of the creation once known as the chameleon and spoke quietly youre a fiftyyearold man jason this isnt paris thirteen years ago or saigon years before that its now and you need all the help you can get if she thinks she can provide a measure of it i for one believe her bourne snapped his head down at conklin ill be the judge of who believes what thats a touch extreme pal you know what i mean said jason softening his tone i dont want to have happen here what happened in hong kong that cant be a problem for you maybe not look lets get out of here our driver knows a little country restaurant in epernon about six miles from here where we can talk weve got several things to go over tell me said bourne why panov why did you bring mo with you because if i hadnt he would have put strychnine in my flu shot what the hell does that mean exactly what it says hes a part of us and you know it better than marie or myself something happened to him didnt it something happened to him because of me its over with and hes back thats all you have to know now it was medusa wasnt it yes but i repeat hes back and outside of being a little tired hes okay little which reminds me a little country restaurant six miles from here isnt that what your driver said yes he knows paris and everything around it thoroughly who is he a french algerian whos worked for the agency for years charlie casset recruited him for us hes tough knowledgeable and very well paid for both above all he can be trusted i suppose thats good enough dont suppose accept it they sat in a booth at the rear of the small country inn complete with a worn canopy hard pine banquettes and perfectly acceptable wine the owner an expansive florid fat man proclaimed the cuisine to be extraordinary but since no one could summon hunger bourne paid for four entrées just to keep the proprietor happy it did the owner sent over two large carafes of good vin ordinaire along with a bottle of mineral water and stayed away from the table all right mo said jason you wont tell me what happened or who did it but youre still the same functioning overbearing verbose medicine man with a chicken in his mouth weve known for thirteen years am i correct correct you schizophrenic escapee from bellevue and in case you think im being heroic let me make it absolutely clear that im here only to protect my nonmedical civil rights my paramount interest is with my adorable marie who i trust youll notice is sitting beside me not you i positively salivate thinking about her meat loaf oh how i do love you mo said david webbs wife squeezing panovs arm let me count the ways responded the doctor kissing her cheek im here said conklin my name is alex and i have a couple of things to talk about and they dont include meat loaf although i should tell you marie i told peter holland yesterday that it was terrific whats with my damned meat loaf its the red sauce interjected panov may we get to what were here for said jason bourne his voice a monotone sorry darling well be working with the soviets conklin spoke quickly his rush of words countering the immediate reaction from bourne and marie its all right i know the contact ive known him for years but washington doesnt know i know him his name is krupkin dimitri krupkin and as i told mo he can be bought for five pieces of silver give him thirtyone interrupted bourne to make sure hes on our side i figured youd say that do you have a ceiling none not so fast said marie whats a negotiable starting point our economist speaks proclaimed panov drinking his wine considering his position in the paris kgb id say around fifty thousand american offer him thirtyfive and escalate to seventyfive under pressure up to a hundred if necessary of course for christs sake cried jason controlling his voice were talking about us about the jackal give him anything he wants too easily bought too easily turned to another source to a counteroffer is she right asked bourne staring at conklin normally of course but in this case it would have to be the equivalent of a workable diamond mine no one wants carlos in the dead file more than the soviets and the man who brings in his corpse will be the hero of the kremlin remember he was trained at novgorod moscow never forgets that then do as she says only buy him said jason i understand conklin leaned forward turning his glass of water ill call him tonight pay phone to pay phone and get it settled then ill arrange a meeting tomorrow maybe lunch somewhere outside of paris very early before the regulars come in why not here asked bourne you cant get much more remote and ill know the way why not agreed alex ill talk to the owner but not the four of us justjason and me i assumed that said bourne coldly maries not to be involved shes not to be seen or heard is that clear david really yes really ill go over and stay with her interrupted panov quickly meat loaf he added obviously to lessen the tension i dont have a kitchen but theres a lovely restaurant that serves fresh trout one sacrifices sighed the psychiatrist i think you should eat in the room bournes voice was now adamant i will not be a prisoner said marie quietly her gaze fixed on her husband nobody knows who we are or where we are and i submit that someone who locks herself in her room and is never seen draws far more attention than a perfectly normal frenchwoman who goes about her normal business of living shes got a point observed alex if carlos has his network calling around someone behaving abnormally could be picked up besides panovs from left fieldpretend youre a doctor or something mo nobodyll believe it but itll add a touch of class for reasons that escape me doctors are usually above suspicion psychopathic ingrate mumbled panov may we get back to business said bourne curtly youre very rude david im very impatient do you mind okay cool it said conklin were all uptight but things have got to be clear once krupkins on board his first job will be to trace the number gates gave prefontaine in boston who gave what where asked the bewildered psychiatrist you were out of it mo prefontaines an impeached judge who fell into a jackal contact to cut it short the contact gave our judge a number here in paris to reach the jackal but it didnt coincide with the one jason already had but theres no question that the contact a lawyer named gates reached carlos randolph gates bostons gift to the boardrooms of genghis khan thats the one holy christim sorry i shouldnt say that im not a gentile what the hell im nothing but youll admit its a shock a large one and we have to know who owns that number here in paris krupkin can find out for us its corkscrew i grant you but there it is corkscrew asked panov are you now going to produce a rubiks cube in arabic or perhaps a doublecrostic from the london times what in heavens name is a prefontaine judge jury or otherwise it sounds like a bad early wine its a late very good vintage broke in marie youd like him doctor you could spend months studying him because hes got more brights than most of us and that grand intellect of his is still intact despite such inconveniences as alcohol corruption loss of family and prison hes an original mo and where the majority of felons in his league blame everyone but themselves he doesnt he retains a gloriously ironic sense of humor if the american judiciary had any brainswhich on the surface the justice department would seem to refutetheyd put him back on the bench he went after the jackals people on principle first because they wanted to kill me and my children if on the second round he makes a dollar he deserves every penny and ill see that he gets it youre succinct you like him i adore him as i adore you and alex youve all taken such risks for us may we get back to what were here for said the chameleon angrily the past doesnt interest me tomorrow does youre not only rude my dear youre terribly ungrateful so be it where were we at the moment with prefontaine replied alex sharply looking at bourne but he may not matter because he probably wont survive boston ill call you at the inn at barbizon tomorrow and set up a time for lunch out here clock yourself on the drive back so were not hanging around like mateless snow geese also if that fat guys right about his cuisine kruppie will love it and tell everybody he discovered it kruppie relax i told you we go back a long time and dont go into it added panov you really dont want to hear about istanbul and amsterdam theyre both a couple of thieves we pass said marie go on alex what about tomorrow mo and i will take a taxi out to your place and your husband and i will drive back here well call you after lunch what about that driver of yours the one casset got you asked the chameleon his eyes cold inquiring what about him hell be paid double what he can make in a month with his taxi for tonight and after he drops us off at a hotel hell disappear we wont see him again will he see anyone else not if he wants to live and send money to his relatives in algeria i told you casset cleared him hes granite tomorrow then said bourne grimly looking across the table at marie and morris panov after we leave for paris youre to stay out at barbizon and youre not to leave the inn do you both understand that you know david answered marie bristling and rigid on the pine banquette im going to tell you something mo and alex are as much a part of our family as the children so ill say it in front of them we all all of us humor you and in some ways pamper you because of the horrible things you went through but you cannot and you will not order us around as if we were inferior beings in your august presence do you understand that loud and clear lady then maybe you should go back to the states so you wont have to put up with my august presence jason bourne rose from the table pushing the chair behind him tomorrows going to be a busy day so i have to get some sleepi havent had much latelyand a better man than any of us here once told me that rest was a weapon i believe that ill be in the car for two minutes take your choice im sure alex can get you out of france you bastard whispered marie so be it said the chameleon walking away go to him interjected panov quickly you know whats happening i cant handle it mo dont handle it just be with him youre the only rope hes got you dont even have to talk just be there with him hes become the killer again hed never harm you of course not i know that then provide him with that link to david webb it has to be there marie oh god i love him so cried the wife rushing to her feet and racing after her husbandyet not her husband was that the right advice mo asked conklin i dont know alex i just dont think he should be alone with his nightmares none of us should thats not psychiatry its just common sense sometimes you sound like a real doctor you know that the algerian section of paris lies between the tenth and eleventh arrondissements barely three blocks where the low buildings are parisian but the sounds and the smells are arabic the insignia of the high church small but emblazoned in gold on its doors a long black limousine entered this ethnic enclave it stopped in front of a woodframed threestory house where an old priest got out and walked to the door he selected a name on the mail plate and pressed the button that rang a bell on the second floor oui said the metallic voice on the primitive intercom i am a messenger from the american embassy answered the visitor in religious garb his french partially ungrammatical as was all too frequent with americans i cant leave my vehicle but we have an urgent message for you ill be right down said the french algerian driver recruited by charles casset in washington three minutes later the man emerged from the building and walked out on the short narrow pavement what are you dressed like that for he asked the messenger who stood by the large automobile covering the insignia on the rear door im the catholic chaplain my son our military chargé daffaires would like a word with you he opened the door ill do many things for you people laughed the driver as he bent down to look inside the limousine but being drafted into your army isnt one of them yes sir what can i do for you where did you take our people asked the shadowed figure in the backseat his features in darkness what people said the algerian sudden concern in his voice the two you picked up at the airport several hours ago the cripple and his friend if youre from the embassy and they want you to know theyll call and tell you wont they youll tell me a third powerfully built man in a chauffeurs uniform appeared from behind the trunk of the car he walked rapidly forward raising his arm and crashing a thick ugly blackjack down on the algerians skull he shoved his victim inside the old man in the guise of a chaplain climbed in behind him pulling the door shut as the chauffeur ran around the hood to the front seat the limousine raced away down the street an hour later on the deserted rue houdon a block from place pigalle the algerians bruised and bleeding corpse was disgorged from the large automobile inside the figure in shadows addressed his aged personally ordained priest get your car and remain outside the cripples hotel stay awake for youll be relieved in the morning and can rest all day report any movements and go where he goes dont fail me never monseigneur dimitri krupkin was not a tall man but he appeared taller than he was nor was he particularly heavy yet he seemed to possess a much fuller figure than he carried he had a pleasant if somewhat fleshy face and a generous head held erect his full eyebrows and wellgroomed pepperandsalt hair and chin beard combined attractively with alert blue eyes and a seemingly perpetual smile defining a man who enjoyed his life and his work an intellect behind both at the moment he was seated in a booth facing the rear wall in the all but empty country restaurant in epernon staring across the table at alex conklin who sat beside the unidentified bourne and had just explained that he no longer drank alcohol the world is coming to an end exclaimed the russian in heavily accented english you see what happens to a good man in the selfindulgent west shame on your parents they should have stayed with us i dont think you want to compare the rates of alcoholism in our two countries not for a wager of money said krupkin grinning speaking of money my dear old enemy how and where am i to be paid according to our agreement last night on the telephone how and where do you want to be paid asked jason ah ha you are my benefactor sir ill be paying you yes hold it whispered conklin his attention drawn to the restaurants entrance he leaned toward the open side of the booth his hand on his forehead then quickly moved back as a couple were shown to a table in the corner to the left of the door what is it asked bourne i dont know im not sure who came in aleksei thats just it i think i should know him but i dont where is he seated in a booth no a table in the corner beyond the bar hes with a woman krupkin moved to the edge of his seat took out his billfold and removed from its recess a small mirror the size and thickness of a credit card cupping it in both hands he cautiously angled the glass in front of him you must be addicted to the society pages of the paris tabloids said the russian chuckling as he replaced the mirror and returned the billfold to his jacket pocket hes with the italian embassy thats his wife paolo and davinia somethingorother with pretensions to nobility i believe strictly corpo diplomatico on the protocol level they dress up a party quite nicely and theyre obviously stinking rich i dont travel in those circles but ive seen him somewhere before of course you have he looks like every middleaged italian screen star or any one of those vineyard owners who extol the virtues of the chianti classico on television commercials maybe youre right i am krupkin turned to bourne i shall write out the name of a bank and the number of an account in geneva the soviet reached into his pocket for a pen as he pulled a paper napkin in front of him he was not able to use either for a man in his early thirties dressed in a tightfitting suit walked rapidly up to the table what is it sergei asked krupkin not you sir replied the soviet aide him he added nodding at bourne what is it repeated jason you have been followed at first we were not sure for it is an old man with a urinary problem he rapidly left the car twice to relieve himself but once settled he used the car telephone and squinted through the windscreen to read the name of the restaurant that was barely minutes ago how do you know he was following me because he arrived shortly after you did and we were here a half hour before that securing the area securing the area erupted conklin looking at krupkin i thought this conference was strictly between us dear aleksei benevolent aleksei who would save me from myself can you really believe id meet with you without considering my own protection not you personally old friend but your aggressors in washington can you imagine a deputy director of the cia negotiates with me over a man he pretends to think i do not know a rank amateur ploy goddamn you i never told him oh dear me then the errors mine i apologize aleksei dont interrupted jason firmly that old mans from the jackal carlos cried krupkin his face flushed his alert blue eyes now intense angry the jackals after you aleksei no him answered conklin your benefactor good god with what weve picked up its all falling into place so i have the distinct honor to meet the infamous jason bourne a great pleasure sir we have the same objective where carlos is concerned do we not if your men are any good we may reach that objective before the next hours up come on lets get out of here and use the back way the kitchen a window whatever hes found me and you can bet your ass hes coming out here for me only he doesnt know we know that lets go as the three men rose from the table krupkin gave instructions to his aide have the car brought around to the rear the service entrance if there is one but do it casually sergei no sense of urgency you understand me we can drive half a mile down the road and turn into a pasture that will lead to the rear of the building we will not be seen by the old man in his car very good sergei and have our backup remain in place but be prepared of course comrade the aide hurried back to the front entrance a backup exploded alex you had a backup please aleksei why quibble its your own fault after all even last night on the phone you did not tell me about your conspiracy against your own deputy director it wasnt a conspiracy for christs sake it wasnt exactly a pure rapport between the home office and the field was it no aleksei nikolae konsolikov you knew you couldshall we sayuse me and you did never forget my fine old adversary you are russian will you two shut up and get out of here they waited in krupkins armorplated citroën on the edge of an overgrown field a hundred feet behind the old mans car the front of the restaurant in clear sight to bournes annoyance conklin and the kgb officer reminisced like two aging professionals dissecting each others strategies in past intelligence operations pointing out the deficiencies each held to be with the others the soviet backup was a nondescript sedan on the far shoulder of the road diagonally across from the restaurant two armed men were ready to leap out their automatic weapons prepared to fire suddenly a renault station wagon pulled up to the curb in front of the inn three couples were inside all but the driver got out all laughing playfully entwining their arms they walked with abandon toward the entrance as their companion drove the car into the small side parking lot stop them said jason they could be killed yes they could be mr bourne but if we stop them we will lose the jackal jason stared at the russian unable to speak the harsh winds of anger and confusion clouding his thoughts he started to utter a protest but could not do so the words would not come then it was too late for words a dark brown van shot up the road from the highway to paris and bourne found his voice its the one from the boulevard lefebvre the one that got away the one from where asked conklin there was trouble on lefebvre several days ago said krupkin an automobile or a truck was blown up do you refer to that it was a trap for me a van then a limo and a double for carlosa trap thats the second one it raced out of a dark side street i think and tried to cut us down with firepower us alex watched jason he saw the undisguised fury in the chameleons eyes the tight rigid set of his mouth the slow spreading and contraction of his strong fingers bernardine and me whispered bourne in reply suddenly raising his voice i want a weapon he cried the gun in my pocket isnt a goddamned weapon the driver was krupkins powerfully built soviet aide sergei he reached across his seat and pulled up a russian ak he held it over his shoulder as jason grabbed it a dark brown limousine its tires skidding on the backcountry road screamed to a stop in front of the faded worn canopy and like trained commandos two men leaped out of the side door their faces encased in stocking masks their hands holding automatic weapons they raced to the entrance each spinning his body to either side of the double doors a third man emerged from the squared vehicle a balding man in a priests black clothing with a gesture of his weapon the two assault troops spun back toward the doors their hands on the thick brass knobs the driver of the van gunned his engine in place go yelled bourne its him its carlos no roared krupkin wait its our trap now and he must be trappedinside for christs sake there are people in there countered jason all wars have casualties mr bourne and in case you dont realize it this is war yours and mine yours is far more personal than mine incidentally suddenly there was an earsplitting scream of vengeance from the jackal as the double doors were crashed back and the terrorists rushed inside their weapons on automatic fire now cried sergei the ignition started the accelerator on the floor the citroën swung out on the road rushing toward the van but in a split half second its progress was derailed a massive explosion took place on the right the old man and the nondescript gray car in which he sat was blown apart sending the citroën swerving to the left into the ancient postandrail fence that bordered the sunken parking lot on the side of the inn the instant it happened the jackals dark brown van instead of racing forward lurched backward jerking to a halt as the driver jumped out of the cab concealing himself behind it he had spotted the soviet backup as the two russians ran toward the restaurant the jackals driver killed one with a burst from his weapon the other threw himself into the bordering sloping grass watching helplessly as carloss driver shot out the tires and the windows of the soviet vehicle get out yelled sergei pulling bourne from the seat onto the dirt by the fence as his stunned superior and alex conklin crawled out behind him lets go cried jason gripping the ak and getting to his feet that son of a bitch blew up the car by remote ill go first said the soviet why frankly im younger and stronger shut up bourne raced ahead zigzagging to draw fire then plummeting to the ground when it came from the driver of carloss van he raised his weapon in the grass knowing that the jackals man believed his fusillade had been accurate the head appeared and then was no more as jason squeezed the trigger the second russian backup hearing the death cry from behind the van rose from the sloping grass and continued toward the restaurants entrance from inside came the sound of erratic gunfire sudden bursts accompanied by screams of panic followed by additional bursts a living nightmare of terror and blood was taking place within the confines of a once bucolic country inn bourne got to his feet sergei at his side running they joined the other surviving soviet aide at jasons nod the russians pulled back the doors and as one they burst inside the next sixty seconds were as terrifying as the shrieking hell depicted by munch a waiter and two of the men who were among the three couples were dead the waiter and one man sprawled on the floor their skulls shattered what was left of their faces lying in blood the third man was splayed back in the banquette his eyes wide and glassdead his clothes riddled with bullets rivulets of blood rolling down the fabric the women were in total shock alternately moaning and screaming as they kept trying to crawl over the pine walls of the booth the welldressed man and wife from the italian embassy were nowhere in sight sergei suddenly rushed forward his weapon on auto fire in a rear corner of the room he had spotted a figure whom bourne had not seen the stockingfaced killer sprang out of the shadows his machine swinging into position but before he could exercise his advantage the soviet cut him down another a body lurching behind the short counter that served as a bar was it the jackal jason pivoted into the diagonal wall crouching his eyes darting into every recess in the vicinity of the wine racks he lunged to the base of the bar as the second russian backup assessing the situation ran to the hysterical women spinning around his gun swinging back and forth protecting them the stockingfaced head shot up from behind the counter his weapon surging out over the wood bourne sprang to his feet gripping the hot barrel with his left hand his right commanding the ak he fired pointblank into the terrorists contorted face beyond the silk it was not carlos where was the jackal in there shouted sergei as if he had heard jasons furious question where those doors it was the country restaurants kitchen both men converged on the swinging doors again bourne nodded the signal for them to crash inside but before they could move both were partially blown back by an explosion from within a grenade had been set off with fragments of metal and glass embedded in the doors the smoke billowed wafting out into the dining room the smell was acrid sickening silence jason and sergei once more approached the kitchens entrance and once again they were stopped by a second sudden explosion followed by staccato gunfire the bullets piercing the thin louvered panels of the swinging doors silence standoff silence it was too much for the furious impassioned chameleon he cracked the bolt of his ak pulled the selective lever and then the trigger for auto fire and crashed the doors open lunging for the floor silence another scene from another hell a section of the outside wall had been blown away the obese owner and his chef still wearing his toque were dead corpses pinned against the lower shelves of the kitchen blood streaming across and down the wood bourne slowly rose to his feet his legs in agony every nerve in his body frayed the edge of hysteria not far away as if in a trance he looked around through the smoke and the debris his eyes finally settling on a large ominous fragment of brown butchers paper nailed to the wall with a heavy cleaver he approached it and yanking out the cleaver read the words printed in a black butchers pencil the trees of tannenbaum will burn and children will be the kindling sleep well jason bourne the mirrors of his life were shattered into a thousand pieces of glass there was nothing else to do but scream stop it david my god hes insane aleksei sergei grab him hold him you help sergei put him on the ground so i can talk to him we must leave here quickly it was all the two russian aides could do to wrestle the screaming bourne to the grass he had raced out through the exploded hole in the wall running into the high grass in a futile attempt to find the jackal firing his ak into the field beyond until his magazine was empty sergei and the surviving backup had rushed in after him the former ripping the weapon out of jasons hands together leading the hysterical man back to the rear of the mutilated country inn where alex and krupkin were waiting for them forcibly their charge in a sweating erratically breathing trance the five men walked rapidly to the front of the restaurant there the uncontrollable hysteria again seized the chameleon the jackals van was gone carlos had reversed his line of flight and escaped and jason bourne had gone mad hold him roared krupkin kneeling beside jason as the two aides pinned bourne to the ground the kgb officer reached down and spread his hand across the americans face gouging his cheeks with thumb and forefinger forcing treadstone seventyone to look at him ill say this once mr bourne and if it doesnt sink in you may stay here by yourself and take the consequences but we must leave if you get hold of yourself well be in touch with the proper officials of your government within the hour from paris ive read the warning to you and i can assure you your own people are capable of protecting your familyas your family was explained to me by aleksei but you yourself must be part of that communication you can become rational mr bourne or you can go to hell which will it be the chameleon straining against the knees pinning him to the ground exhaled as if it were his final breath his eyes came into focus and he said get these bastards off me one of those bastards saved your life said conklin and i saved one of theirs so be it the armorplated citroën sped down the country road toward the paris highway on the scrambled cellular telephone krupkin ordered a team to epernon for the immediate removal of what was left of the russian backup vehicle the body of the slain man had been placed carefully in the citroëns trunk and the official soviet comment if asked for was one of noninvolvement two lowerlevel diplomatic staff had gone out for a country lunch when the massacre occurred several killers were in stocking masks the others barely seen as the staff members escaped through a back door running for their lives when it was over they returned to the restaurant covering the victims trying to calm the hysterical women and the lone surviving man they had called their superiors to report the hideous incident and were instructed to inform the local police and return at once to the embassy soviet interests could not be jeopardized by the accidental presence at the scene of an act of french criminality it sounds so russian krupkin said will anyone believe it alex wondered it doesnt matter answered the soviet epernon reeks of a jackal reprisal the blownapart old man two subordinate terrorists in stocking masksthe sûreté knows the signs if we were involved we were on the correct side so they wont pursue our presence bourne sat silently by the window krupkin was beside him with conklin in the jump seat in front of the russian jason broke his angry silence taking his eyes off the rushing scenery and slamming his fist on the armrest oh christ the kids he shouted how could that bastard have learned about the tannenbaum house forgive me mr bourne broke in krupkin gently i realize its far easier for me to say than for you to accept but very soon now youll be in touch with washington i know something about the agencys ability to protect its own and i guarantee you its maddeningly effective it cant be so goddamned great if carlos can penetrate this far perhaps he didnt said the soviet perhaps he had another source there werent any one never knows sir they sped through the streets of paris in the blinding afternoon sun as the pedestrians sweltered in the summer heat finally they reached the soviet embassy on the boulevard lannes and raced through the gates the guards waving them on instantly recognizing krupkins gray citroën they swung around the cobblestone courtyard stopping in front of the imposing marble steps and the sculptured arch that formed the entrance stay available sergei ordered the kgb officer if theres to be any contact with the sûreté youre selected then as if it were an afterthought krupkin addressed the aide sitting next to sergei in the front seat no offense young man he added but over the years my old friend and driver has become highly resourceful in these situations however you also have work to do process the body of our loyal deceased comrade for cremation internal operations will explain the paperwork with a nod of his head dimitri krupkin instructed bourne and alex conklin to get out of the car once inside dimitri explained to the army guard that he did not care for his guests to be subjected to the metal detecting trellises through which all visitors to the soviet embassy were expected to pass as an aside he whispered in english to his guests can you imagine the alarms that would go off two armed americans from the savage cia roaming the halls of this bastion of the proletariat good heavens i can feel the cold of siberia in my testicles they walked through the ornate richly decorated nineteenthcentury lobby to a typical brassgrilled french elevator they entered and proceeded to the third floor the grille opened and krupkin continued as he led the way down a wide corridor well use an inhouse conference room he said youll be the only americans who have ever seen it or will ever see it as its one of the few offices without listening devices you wouldnt want to submit that statement to a polygraph would you asked conklin chuckling like you aleksei i learned long ago how to fool those idiot machines but even if that were not so in this case i would willingly submit it for its true in all honesty its to protect ourselves from ourselves come along now the conference room was the size of an average suburban dining room but with a long heavy table and dark masculine furniture the chairs thick unwieldy and quite comfortable the walls were covered with deep brown paneling the inevitable portrait of lenin centered ostentatiously behind the head chair beside which was a low table designed for the telephone console within easy reach i know youre anxious said krupkin going to the console so ill authorize an international line for you lifting the phone touching a button and speaking rapidly in russian dimitri did so then hung up and turned to the americans youre assigned number twentysix its the last button on the right second row thanks conklin nodded and reached into his pocket pulling out a scrap of paper and handing it to the kgb officer i need another favor kruppie thats a telephone number here in paris its supposed to be a direct line to the jackal but it didnt match the one bourne was given that did reach him we dont know where it fits in but wherever it is its tied to carlos and you dont want to call it for fear of exposing your possession of the numberinitial codes that sort of thing i understand of course why send out an alert when its unnecessary ill take care of it krupkin looked at jason his expression that of an older understanding colleague be of good and firm heart mr bourne as the czarists would say facing no discernible harm whatsoever despite your apprehensions i have enormous faith in langleys abilities theyve harmed my not insignificant operations more than i care to dwell upon im sure youve done your share of damage to them said jason impatiently glancing at the telephone console that knowledge keeps me going thanks kruppie said alex in your words youre a fine old enemy again shame on your parents if they had stayed in mother russia just think by now you and i would be running the komitet and have two lakefront houses are you crazy aleksei we would own the entire lake geneva krupkin turned and walked to the door letting himself out with quiet laughter its all a damned game with you people isnt it said bourne up to a point agreed alex but not when stolen information can lead to the loss of lifeon both sides incidentally thats when the weapons come out and the games are over reach langley said jason abruptly nodding at the console hollands got some explaining to do reaching langley wouldnt help what its too early its barely seven oclock in the states but not to worry i can bypass conklin again reached into a pocket and withdrew a small notebook bypass cried bourne what kind of double talk is that im close to the edge alex those are my children over there relax all it means is that ive got his unlisted home number conklin sat down and picked up the phone he dialed bypass for christs sake you relics of outmoded ciphers cant use the english language bypass sorry professor its habit peter its alex open your eyes and wake up sailor weve got complications i dont have to wake up said the voice from fairfax virginia i just got back from a fivemile jog oh you people with feet think youre so smart jesus im sorry alex i didnt mean of course you didnt ensign holland but weve got a problem which means at least youve made contact you reached bourne hes standing over my shoulder and were calling from the soviet embassy in paris what holy shit not holy just casset remember oh yes i forgot what about his wife mo panovs with her the good doctors covering the medical bases for which im grateful so am i any other progress nothing you want to hear but youre going to hear it loud and clear what are you talking about the jackal knows about the tannenbaum estate youre nuts shouted the director of the central intelligence agency so loudly that there was a metallic ring on the transoceanic line nobody knows only charlie casset and myself we built up a chrono with false names and central american bios so far removed from paris that no one could make a connection also there was no mention of the tannenbaum place in the orders s help me alex it was airtight because we wouldnt let anyone else handle it facts are facts peter my friend got a note saying the trees of tannenbaum would burn the children with them son of a bitch yelled holland stay on the line he ordered ill call st jacques over there then maxsecurity and have them moved this morning stay on the line conklin looked up at bourne the telephone between them the words heard by both men if theres a leak and there is a leak it cant come from langley said alex it has to he hasnt looked deep enough where does he look christ youre the experts the helicopter that flew them out the crew the people who cleared an american aircraft flying into uk territory my god carlos bought the lousy crown governor of montserrat and his head drug chief whats to prevent him from owning the communications between our military and plymouth but you heard him insisted conklin the names were fake the chronologies oriented to central america and above all no one on the relay flights knew about the tannenbaum estate no one weve got a gap please spare me that cryptojargon its not cryptic at all a gaps a space that hasnt been filled alex the angry voice of peter holland was back on the line yes peter were moving them out and i wont even tell you where theyre going st jacquess pissed off because mrs cooper and the kids are settled but i told him hes got an hour i want to talk to johnny said bourne bending over and speaking loud enough to be heard nice to meet you if only on the phone broke in holland thanks for all youre doing for us managed jason quietly sincerely i mean that quid pro quo bourne in your hunt for the jackal you pulled a big ugly rabbit out of a filthy hat nobody knew was there what medusa the new one hows it going interrupted conklin were doing our own crosspollinating between the sicilians and a number of european banks its dirtying up everything it touches but weve now got more wires into that highpowered law firm in new york than in a nasa liftoff were closing in good hunting said jason may i have the number at tannenbaums so i can reach john st jacques holland gave it to him alex wrote it down and hung up the horns all yours said conklin awkwardly getting out of the chair by the console and moving to the one at the right corner of the table bourne sat down and concentrated on the myriad buttons below him he picked up the telephone and reading the numbers alex had recorded in his notebook touched the appropriate digits on the console the greetings were abrupt jasons questions harsh his voice demanding who did you talk to about the tannenbaum house back up david said st jacques instinctively defensive what do you mean who did i talk to just that from tranquility to washington who did you speak to about tannenbaums you mean after holland told me about it for christs sake johnny it couldnt be before could it no it couldnt sherlock holmes then who you only you esteemed brotherinlaw what you heard me everything was happening so fast i probably forgot tannenbaums name anyway and if i remembered it i certainly wasnt going to advertise it you must have there was a leak and it didnt come from langley it didnt come from me either look dr academic i may not have an alphabet after my name but im not exactly an idiot thats my niece and nephew in the other room and i fully expect to watch them grow up the leaks why were being moved isnt it yes how severe maximum the jackal jesus exploded st jacques that bastard shows up in the neighborhood hes mine easy canada said jason his voice now softer conveying thought not anger you say and i believe you that you described the tannenbaum place only to me and if i recall i was the one who identified it thats right i remember because when pritchard told me you were on the phone i was on the other line with henry sykes in serrat remember henry the cgs aide of course i was asking him to keep half an eye on tranquility because i had to leave for a few days naturally he knew that because he had to clear the us aircraft in here and i distinctly recall his asking me where i was going and all i said was washington it never even occurred to me to say anything about tannenbaums place and sykes didnt press me because he obviously figured it had something to do with the horrible things that had happened i suppose you could say hes a professional in these matters st jacques paused but before bourne could speak he uttered hoarsely oh my god pritchard supplied jason he stayed on the line why why would he do it you forget explained bourne carlos bought your crown governor and his savonarola drug chief they had to cost heavy money he could have bought pritchard for a lot less no youre wrong david pritchard may be a deluded selfinflated jackass but he wouldnt turn on me for money its not that important in the islandsprestige is and except when he drives me up the wall i feed it to him actually he does a pretty damn good job theres no one else bro theres also one way to find out im here not there and im not about to leave here whats your point i want to bring in henry sykes is that all right with you do it hows marie as well as can be expected under the circumstances and johnny i dont want her to know a thing about any of this do you understand me when she reaches you and she will just tell her youre settled in and everythings okay nothing about the move or carlos i understand everything is all right isnt it how are the kidshows jamie taking everything you may resent this but hes having a grand time and mrs cooper wont even let me touch alison i dont resent either piece of information thanks what about you any progress ill be in touch said bourne hanging up and turning to alex it doesnt make sense and carlos always makes sense if you look hard enough he leaves me a warning that drives me crazy with fear but he has no means of carrying out his threat what do you make of it the sense is in driving you crazy replied conklin the jackals not going to take on an installation like tannenbaums sterile house longdistance that message was meant to panic you and it did he wants to throw you off so youll make mistakes he wants the controls in his hands its another reason for marie to fly back to the states as soon as possible shes got to i want her inside a fortress not having lunch out in the open in barbizon im more sympathetic to that view than i was last night alex was interrupted by the sound of the door opening krupkin walked into the room carrying several computer printouts the number you gave me is disconnected he said a slight hesitancy in his voice who was it connected to asked jason you will not like this any more than i do and id lie to you if i could invent a plausible alternate but i cannot and i undoubtedly should not as of five days ago it was transferred from an obviously false organization to the name of webb david webb conklin and bourne stared in silence at the soviet intelligence officer but in that silence were the unheard static cracks of highvoltage electricity why are you so certain we wont like the information asked alex quietly my fine old enemy began krupkin his gentle voice no louder than conklins when mr bourne came out of that café of horror with the brown paper clasped in his hand he was hysterical in trying to calm him to bring him under control you called him david i now have a name i sincerely wish i did not possess forget it said bourne i shall do my best to but there are ways thats not what i mean broke in jason i have to live with the fact that you know it and ill manage where was that phone installed the address according to the billing computers its a mission home run by an organization called the magdalen sisters of charity again obviously false obviously not corrected bourne it exists they exist its legitimate down to their religious helmets and its also a usable drop or was fascinating mused krupkin so much of the jackals various façades is tied to the church a brilliant if overdone modus operandi its said that he once studied for the priesthood then the church is one up on you said alex angling his head in a humorously mocking rebuke they threw him out before you did i never underestimate the vatican laughed dimitri it ultimately proved that our mad joseph stalin misunderstood priorities when he asked how many battalions the pope had his holiness doesnt need them he achieves more than stalin ever did with all his purges power goes to the one who instills the greatest fear not so aleksei all the princes of this earth use it with brutal effectiveness and it all revolves around deaththe fear of it before and after when will we grow up and tell them all to go to the devil death whispered jason frowning death on the rivoli at the meurice the magdalen sisters my god i completely forgot dominique lavier she was at the meuriceshe may still be there she said shed work with me why would she asked krupkin sharply because carlos killed her sister and she had no choice but to join him or be killed herself bourne turned to the console i need the telephone number of the meurice four two six zero three eight six zero offered krupkin as jason grabbed a pencil and wrote down the numbers on alexs notepad a lovely place once known as the hotel of kings i especially like the grill bourne touched the buttons holding up his hand for quiet remembering he asked for madame brielles room the name they had agreed upon and when the hotel operator said mais oui he nodded rapidly in relief to alex and dimitri krupkin lavier answered yes it is i madame said jason his french just slightly coarse ever so minimally anglicized the chameleon was in charge your housekeeper suggested we might reach you here madames dress is ready we apologize for the delay it was to have been brought to me yesterdayby noonyou ass i intended to wear it last evening at le grand véfour i was mortified a thousand apologies we can deliver it to the hotel immediately you are again an ass im sure my maid also told you i was here for only two days take it to my flat on the montaigne and it had better be there by four oclock or your bill will not be paid for six months the conversation was believably terminated by a loud crack at the other end of the line bourne replaced the phone perspiration had formed at his slightly graying hairline ive been out of this too long he said breathing deeply she has a flat on the montaigne and shell be there after four oclock who the hell is dominique whatever her name is fairly yelled the frustrated conklin lavier answered krupkin only she uses her dead sisters name jacqueline shes been posing as her sister for years you know about that asked jason impressed yes but it never did us much good it was an understandable ruselookalikes several months absence minor surgery and programmingall quite normal in the abnormal world of haute couture who looks or listens to anyone in that superficial orbit we watch her but shes never led us to the jackal she wouldnt know how she has no direct access everything she reports to carlos is filtered stone walls at every relay thats the way of the jackal its not always the way said bourne there was a man named santos who managed a rundown café in argenteuil called le coeur du soldat he had access he gave it to me and it was very special was krupkin raised his eyebrows had you employ the past tense hes dead and that rundown café in argenteuil is it still flourishing its cleaned out and closed down admitted jason no defeat in his admission so the access is terminated no sure but i believe what he told me because he was killed for telling it to me you see he was getting out just as this lavier woman wants to get outonly his association went back to the beginning to cuba where carlos saved a misfit like himself from execution he knew he could use that man that huge imposing giant who could operate inside the world of the dregs of humanity and be his primary relay santos had direct access he proved it because he gave me an alternate number that did reach the jackal only a very few men could do that fascinating said krupkin his eyes firmly focused on bourne but as my fine old enemy aleksei who is now looking at you as i look at you might inquire what are you leading up to mr bourne your words are ambiguous but your implied accusations appear dangerous to you not to us i beg your pardon santos told me that only four men in the world have direct access to the jackal one of them is in dzerzhinsky square very high in the komitet were santoss words and believe me he didnt think much of your superior it was as if dimitri krupkin had been struck in the face by a director of the politburo in the middle of red square during a may day parade the blood drained from his head his skin taking on the pallor of ash his eyes steady unblinking what else did this santos tell you i have to know only that carlos had a thing about moscow that he was making contact with people in high places it was an obsession with him if you can find that contact in dzerzhinsky square it would be a big leap forward in the meantime all weve got is dominique lavier damn damn roared krupkin cutting off jason how insane yet how perfectly logical youve answered several questions mr bourne and how theyve burned into my mind so many times ive come so closeso many so closeand always nothing well let me tell you gentlemen the games of the devil are not restricted to those confined to hell others can play them my god ive been a pearl to be flushed from one oyster to another always the bigger fool make no more calls from that telephone it was in the afternoon moscow time and the elderly man in the uniform of a soviet army officer walked as rapidly as his age permitted down the hallway on the fifth floor of kgb headquarters in dzerzhinsky square it was a hot day and as usual the air conditioning was only barely and erratically adequate so general grigorie rodchenko permitted himself a privilege of rank his collar was open it did not stop the occasional rivulet of sweat from sliding in and out of the crevices of his deeply lined face on its way down to his neck but the absence of the tight redbordered band of cloth around his throat was a minor relief he reached the bank of elevators pressed the button and waited gripping a key in his hand the doors to his right opened and he was pleased to see that there was no one inside it was easier than having to order everyone outat least far less awkward he entered inserted the key in the uppermost lockrelease above the panel and again waited while the mechanism performed its function it did so quickly and the elevator shot directly down to the lowest underground levels of the building the doors opened and the general walked out instantly aware of the pervasive silence that filled the corridors both left and right in moments that would change he thought he proceeded down the left hallway to a large steel door with a metal sign riveted in the center entrance forbidden authorized personnel only it was a foolish admonition he thought as he took out a thin plastic card from his pocket and shoved it slowly carefully into a slot on the right without the pass cardand sometimes even with it if inserted too quicklythe door would not open there were two clicks and rodchenko removed his card as the heavy knobless door swung back a television monitor recording his entry the hum of activity was pronounced from dozens of lighted cubicles within the huge dark lowceilinged complex the size of a czars grand ballroom but without the slightest attempt at decor a thousand pieces of equipment in black and gray several hundred personnel in pristine white coveralls within whitewalled cubicles and thankfully the air was cool almost cold in fact the machinery demanded it for this was the kgbs communications center information poured in twentyfour hours a day from all over the world the old soldier trudged up a familiar path to the farthest aisle on the right then left to the last cubicle at the far end of the enormous room it was a long walk and the generals breath was short his legs were tired he entered the small enclosure nodding at the middleaged operator who looked up at his visitor and removed the cushioned headset from his ears on the white counter in front of him was a large electronic console with myriad switches dials and a keyboard rodchenko sat down in a steel chair next to the man catching his breath he spoke you have word from colonel krupkin in paris i have words concerning colonel krupkin general in line with your instructions to monitor the colonels telephone conversations including those international lines authorized by him i received a tape from paris several minutes ago that i thought you should listen to as usual you are most efficient and i am most grateful and as always im sure colonel krupkin will inform us of events but as you know hes so terribly busy no explanations are necessary sir the conversations you are about to hear were recorded within the past half hour the earphones please rodchenko slipped on the headset and nodded the operator placed a pad and a container of sharpened pencils in front of the general he touched a number on the keyboard and sat back as the powerful third direktor of the komitet leaned forward listening in moments the general began taking notes minutes later he was writing furiously the tape came to an end and rodchenko removed the headset he looked sternly at the operator his narrow slavic eyes rigid between the folds of lined flesh the crevices in his face seemingly more pronounced than before erase the tape then destroy the reel he ordered getting out of the chair as usual you have heard nothing as usual general and as usual you will be rewarded it was when rodchenko returned to his office and sat down at his desk studying his notes it was incredible it was beyond belief yet there it washe had heard for himself the words and the voices saying those words not those concerning the monseigneur in paris he was secondary now and could be reached in minutes if it was necessary that could wait but the other could not wait not an instant longer the general picked up his phone and rang his secretary i want an immediate satellite transmission to our consulate in new york all maximum scramblers in place and operational how could it happen medusa frowning marie listened to her husbands voice over the telephone nodding at mo panov across the hotel room where are you now she asked at a pay phone in the plazaathénée answered bourne ill be back in a couple of hours whats happening complications but also some progress that doesnt tell me anything theres not that much to tell whats this krupkin like hes an original he brought us to the soviet embassy and i talked to your brother on one of their lines what how are the children fine everythings fine jamies thoroughly enjoying himself and mrs cooper wont let johnny touch alison which means bro doesnt want to touch alison so be it whats the number i want to call hollands setting up a secure line well know in an hour or so which means youre lying so be it you should be with them if im delayed ill call you wait a minute mo wants to talk to you the line went dead across the room panov slowly shook his head as he watched maries reaction to the suddenly terminated conversation forget it he said im the last person he wants to talk to hes back there mo hes not david any longer he has a different calling now added panov softly david cant handle it i think thats the most frightening thing ive ever heard you say the psychiatrist nodded it may well be the gray citroën was parked several hundred feet diagonally across from the canopied entrance of dominique laviers apartment building on the fashionable avenue montaigne krupkin alex and bourne sat in the back conklin again in the jump seat his size and disabled leg making the position more feasible conversation was at a minimum as the three men anxiously kept glancing over at the glass doors of the apartment are you sure this is going to work asked jason i am only sure that sergei is an immensely talented professional replied krupkin he was trained in novgorod you know and his french is impeccable he also carries on him a variety of identifications that would fool the division of documents at the deuxième bureau what about the other two pressed bourne silent subordinates controlled by and subservient to their superior theyre also experts at their craft here he comes sergei could be seen walking out of the glass doors he turned left and within moments crossed the wide boulevard toward the citroën he reached the car went around the hood and climbed in behind the wheel everything is in order he said angling his head over the front seat madame has not returned and the flat is number twentyone second floor right front side it has been swept thoroughly there are no intercepts are you certain asked conklin theres no room for error here sergei our instruments are the best sir answered the kgb aide smiling it pains me to say it but they were developed by the general electronics corporation under contract to langley two points for our side said alex minus twelve for permitting the technology to be stolen concluded krupkin besides im sure a number of years ago our madame lavier might have had bugs sewn into her mattress checked broke in sergei thank you but my point is that the jackal could hardly have monitoring personnel all over paris it all gets so complicated where are your other two men asked bourne in the lobby corridors sir ill join them shortly and we have a support vehicle down the street all in radio contact of course ill drive you over now wait a minute interrupted conklin how do we get in what do we say its been said sir you need say nothing you are authorized covert personnel from the french sedce the what broke in jason the service of external documentation and counterespionage answered alex its the nearest thing here to langley what about the deuxième special branch said conklin offhandedly his mind elsewhere some say its an elite corps others say otherwise sergei wont they check they already have sir after showing the concierge and his assistant my identification i gave them an unlisted telephone number that confirmed the service and my status i subsequently described the three of you and requested no conversation merely access to madame laviers flat ill drive over now it will make a better impression on the doorman sometimes simplicity backed by authority is best in deception observed krupkin as the citroën was maneuvered between the sparse erratic traffic across the wide avenue to the entrance of the whitestone apartment complex take the car around the corner out of sight sergei ordered the kgb officer reaching for the door handle and my radio if you please yes sir replied the aide handing krupkin a miniaturized electronic intercom over the seat ill signal you when im in position i can reach all of you with this yes comrade beyond a hundred and fifty meters the frequency is undetectable come along gentlemen inside the marble lobby krupkin nodded at the formally dressed concierge behind the counter jason and alex on the soviets right la porte est ouverte said the concierge his gaze downward avoiding direct eye contact i shall not be in evidence when madame arrives he continued in french how you got in is unknown to me however there is a service entrance at the rear of the building but for official courtesy it is the one we would have used said krupkin looking straight ahead as he and his companions walked to the elevator laviers flat was a testament to the world of haute couture chic the walls were dotted with photographs of fashion notables attending important showings and events as well as with framed original sketches by celebrated designers like a mondrian the furniture was stark in its simplicity the colors bold and predominantly red black and deep green the chairs sofas and tables only vaguely resembled chairs sofas and tablesthey seemed more suitable for use in spacecraft as if by rote both conklin and the russian immediately began examining the tables ferreting out handwritten notes a number of which were beside a motherofpearl telephone on top of a curved thick dark green table of sorts if this is a desk said alex where the hell are the drawers or the handles its the newest thing from leconte replied krupkin the tennis player interrupted conklin no aleksei the furniture designer you press in and they shoot out youre kidding try it conklin did so and a barely discernible drawer sprang loose from an all but invisible crack ill be damned krupkins miniaturized radio suddenly erupted with two sharp beeps from inside his breast pocket it must be sergei checking in said dimitri removing the instrument youre in place comrade he continued speaking into the base of the radio more than that came the aides quiet voice accompanied by minor static the lavier woman has just entered the building the concierge nowhere in sight good out aleksei get away from there lavier is on her way up you want to hide asked conklin facetiously turning the pages of a telephone notebook id rather not start off with instant hostility which will be the case if she sees you riffling through her personal effects all right all right alex returned the notebook to the drawer and closed it but if she isnt going to cooperate im taking that little black book shell cooperate said bourne i told you she wants out and the only way out for her is with a dead jackal the moneys secondarynot inconsequential but getting out comes first money asked krupkin what money i offered to pay her and i will and i can assure you money is not secondary to madame lavier added the russian the sound of a key being inserted into a latch echoed throughout the living room the three men turned to the door as a startled dominique lavier walked inside her astonishment however was so brief as to be fleeting there were no cracks whatsoever in her composure brows arched in the manner of a regal mannequin she calmly replaced the key in her beaded purse looked over at the intruders and spoke in english well kruppie i might have known you were somewhere in this bouillabaisse ah the charming jacqueline or may we drop the pretense domie kruppie cried alex domie is this old home week comrade krupkin is one of the more advertised kgb officers in paris said lavier walking to the long cubed red table behind the white silk sofa and putting down her purse knowing him is de rigueur in certain circles it has its advantages dear domie you cant imagine the disinformation im fed in those circles by the quai dorsay and once having tasted it knowing its false by the way i under stand youve met our tall american friend and even had certain negotiations with him so i think its only proper i introduce you to his colleague madame monsieur aleksei konsolikov i dont believe you hes no soviet ones nostrils become attuned to the approach of the unwashed bear ah you destroy me domie but youre right it was a parental error of judgment he may therefore introduce himself if he cares to the names conklin alex conklin miss lavier and im american however our mutual acquaintance kruppie is right in one sense my parents were russian and i speak it fluently so hes at a loss to mislead me when were in soviet company i think thats delicious well its at least appetizing if you know kruppie im wounded fatally wounded exclaimed krupkin but my injuries are not essential to this meeting you will work with us domie ill work with you kruppie my god will i work with you i ask only that jason bourne clarifies his offer to me with carlos im a caged animal but without him im a neardestitute aging courtesan i want him to pay for my sisters death and for everything hes done to me but i dont care to sleep in the gutter name your price said jason write it down clarified conklin glancing at krupkin let me see said lavier walking around the sofa and crossing to the leconte desk im within a few years of sixtyfrom one direction or another its immaterialand without the jackal and the absence of some other fatal disease i will have perhaps fifteen to twenty years she bent down over the desk and wrote a figure on a notepad tore it off then stood up and looked at the tall american for you mr bourne and id rather not argue i believe its fair jason took the paper and read the amount american its fair said bourne handing the note back to lavier add how and where you want it paid and ill make the arrangements when we leave here the money will be there in the morning the aging courtesan looked into bournes eyes i believe you she said again bending over the desk and writing out her instructions she rose and gave the paper back to jason the deal is made monsieur and may god grant us the kill if he does not we are dead youre speaking as a magdalen sister im speaking as a sister whos terrified no more and certainly no less bourne nodded ive several questions he said do you want to sit down oui with a cigarette lavier crossed to the sofa and sinking into the cushions reached for her purse on the red table she took out a pack of cigarettes extracted one and picked up a gold lighter from the coffee table such a filthy habit but at times so damned necessary she said snapping the flame and inhaling deeply your questions monsieur what happened at the meurice how did it happen the woman happenedi assume it was your womanthat was my understanding as we agreed you and your friend from deuxième were positioned so that when carlos arrived to trap you you would kill him for reasons no one can fathom your woman screamed as you crossed the rivolithe rest you saw for yourself how could you have told me to take a room at the meurice knowing she was there thats easy to answer i didnt know she was there where do we stand now carlos still trusts me he blames everything on the woman your wife im told and has no reason to hold me responsible after all you were there which proves my allegiance were it not for the deuxième officer youd be dead again bourne nodded how can you reach him i cannot myself i never have nor have i cared to he prefers it that way and as i told you the checks arrive on time so i have no reason to but you send him messages pressed jason i heard you yes i do but never directly i call several old men at cheap cafésthe names and numbers vary weekly and quite a few have no idea what im talking about but for those that do they call others immediately and they call others beyond themselves somehow the messages get through very quickly i might add what did i tell you said krupkin emphatically all the relays end with false names and filthy cafés stone walls still the messages get through said alex conklin repeating laviers words yet kruppies correct the aging but still striking woman dragged heavily nervously on her cigarette the routings are convoluted to the point of being untraceable i dont care about that said alex squinting at nothing the others could see they also reach carlos quickly you made that clear its true conklin widened his eyes and fixed them on lavier i want you to send the most urgent message youve ever relayed to the jackal you must talk to him directly its an emergency that you can entrust to no one but carlos himself about what erupted krupkin what could be so urgent that the jackal will comply like our mr bourne he is obsessed with traps and under the circumstances any direct communication smells of one alex shook his head and limped to a side window squinting again deep in thought his intense eyes reflecting his concentration then gradually slowly his eyes opened he gazed at the street below my god it could work he whispered to himself what could work asked bourne dimitri hurry call the embassy and have them send over the biggest fanciest diplomatic limousine you proletarians own what just do as i say quickly aleksei now the force and urgency of conklins command had its effect the russian walked rapidly to the motherofpearl telephone and dialed his questioning eyes on alex who kept staring down at the street lavier looked at jason he shook his head in bewilderment as krupkin spoke into the phone his russian a short series of clipped phrases its done said the kgb officer hanging up and now i think you should give me an extremely convincing reason for doing it moscow replied conklin still looking out the window alex for christs sake what are you saying roared krupkin weve got to get carlos out of paris said conklin turning where better than moscow before the astonished men could respond alex looked at lavier you say he still trusts you he has no reason not to then two words should do it moscow emergency thats the basic message youre sending him put it any way you like but add that the crisis is of such a nature that you must speak only with him but i never have i know men who have spoken with him who in drunken moments have tried to describe him but to me he is a complete stranger all the stronger for it broke in conklin turning to bourne and krupkin in this city hes got all the cards all of them hes got firepower an untraceable network of gunslingers and couriers and for every crevice he can crawl into and burst out from there are dozens more available to him paris is his territory his protectionwe could run blindly all over the city for days weeks even months getting nowhere until the moment comes when hes got you and marie in his gun sights you can also add mo and me to that scenario london amsterdam brussels rometheyd all be better for us than paris but the best is moscow oddly enough its the one place in the world that has a hypnotic hold on himand also the one thats the least hospitable aleksei aleksei cried dimitri krupkin i really think you should reconsider alcohol for its obvious youve lost your senses say domie actually reaches carlos and tells him what you say do you really believe that on the basis of an emergency in moscow hell up and take the next plane there insanity you can bet your last blackmarket ruble i do replied conklin that message is only to convince him to get in touch with her once he does she explodes the bomb shes just heard an extraordinary piece of information that she knew should only be conveyed to him not sent through the message tunnels and what in gods name might that be asked lavier extracting another cigarette and instantly lighting it the kgb in moscow is closing in on the jackals man in dzerzhinsky square theyve narrowed it down to say ten or fifteen officers in the highest ranks once they find him carlos is neutralized in the komitetworse hes about to lose an informer who knows far too much about him to the lubyanka interrogators but how would she know that said jason who would tell her added krupkin its the truth isnt it so are your very secret substations in beijing kabul andforgive my impertinencecanadas prince edward island but you dont advertise them said krupkin i didnt know about prince edward admitted alex regardless there are times when advertisements arent necessary only the means to convey the information credibly a few minutes ago i didnt have any means only authenticity but that gap has just been filled come over here kruppiejust you for the moment and stay away from the window look between the corner of the drapes the soviet did as he was told going to conklins side and parting the fold of lace fabric from the wall what do you see asked alex gesturing at a shabby nondescript brown car below on the avenue montaigne doesnt do much for the neighborhood does it krupkin did not bother to reply instead he whipped the miniaturized radio from his pocket and pressed the transmitter button sergei theres a brown automobile roughly eighty meters down the street from the buildings entrance we know sir interrupted the aide weve got it covered and if youll notice our backup is parked across the way its an old man who barely moves except to look out the window does he have a car telephone no comrade and should he leave the automobile hell be followed so there can be no outside calls unless you direct otherwise i shall not direct otherwise thank you sergei out the russian looked at conklin the old man he said you saw him bald head and all affirmed alex hes not a fool hes done this before and knows hes being watched he cant leave for fear of missing something and if he had a phone thered be others down in the montaigne the jackal said bourne stepping forward then stopping remembering conklins order to stay away from the window now do you understand asked alex addressing the question to krupkin of course conceded the kgb official smiling its why you wanted an ostentatious limousine from our embassy after we leave carlos is told that a soviet diplomatic vehicle was sent to pick us up and for what other reason would we be here but to interrogate madame lavier naturally in my welladvertised presence was a tall man who might or might not be jason bourne and another shorter individual with a disabled legthus confirming that it was jason bourne our unholy alliance is therefore established and observed and again naturally during our harsh questioning of madame lavier tempers flared and references were made to the jackals informer in dzerzhinsky square which only id known about through my dealing with santos at le coeur du soldat said jason quietly so dominique has a credible observeran old man from carloss army of old mento back up the information she delivers ive got to say it saint alex that serpentine brain of yours hasnt lost its cunning i hear a professor i once knew i thought hed left us he has only for a while i hope well done aleksei you still have the touch you may remain abstemious if you must much as it pains me its always the nuances isnt it not always by any means disagreed conklin simply shaking his head most of the time its foolish mistakes for instance our new colleague here domie as you affectionately call her was told she was still trusted but she wasnt not completely so an old man was dispatched to watch her apartmentno big deal just a little insurance in a car that doesnt belong in a street with jaguars and rollsroyces so we pay off on the small policy and with luck cash in on the big one moscow let me intellectualize said krupkin although you were always far better in that department than i aleksei i prefer the best wine to the most penetrating thoughts although the latterin both our countriesinvariably leads to the former merde yelled dominique lavier crushing out her cigarette what are you two idiots talking about theyll tell us believe me answered bourne as has been reported and repeated in secure circles too often for comfort continued the soviet years ago we trained a madman in novgorod and years ago we would have put a bullet in his head had he not escaped his methods if sanctioned by any legitimate government especially the two superpowers would lead to confrontations neither of us can ever permit yet withal in the beginning he was a true revolutionary with a capital r and we the worlds truest revolutionaries disinherited him by his lights it was a great injustice and he never forgets it he will always yearn to come back to the mothers breast for thats where he was born good god the people hes killed in the name of aggressors while he made fortunes is positively revolting but you denied him said jason flatly and he wants that denial reversed he has to be acknowledged as the master killer you trained that psychopathic ego of his is the basis for every thing alex and i mounted santos said he continuously bragged about the cadre he was building in moscowalways moscow its an obsession with himthose were santoss words the only specific person he knew about and not by name was carloss mole high up in the kgb but he said carlos claimed to have others in key positions at various powerful departments that as the monseigneur hed been sending them money for years so the jackal thinks he forms a core of supporters within our government observed krupkin despite everything he still believes he can come back he is indeed an egomaniac but hes never understood the russian mind he may temporarily corrupt a few cynical opportunists but these will cover themselves and turn on him no one looks forward to a stay at the lubyanka or a siberian gulag the jackals potemkin village will burn to the ground all the more reason for him to race to moscow and put out the brushfires said alex what do you mean asked bourne the burning will start with the exposure of carloss man in dzerzhinsky square hell know that the only way to prevent it is for him to reach moscow and make a determination either his informer will elude internal security or the jackal will have to kill him i forgot interrupted bourne something else santos said most of the russians on carloss payroll spoke french look for a man high up in the komitet who speaks french krupkins radio again intruded the two piercing beeps barely muffled by his jacket he pulled it out and spoke yes i dont know how or why comrade said the tense voice of sergei but the ambassadors limousine has just arrived at the building i swear to you i have no idea what happened i do i called for it but the embassy flags will be seen by everyone including i trust an alert old man in a brown automobile well be down shortly out krupkin turned to the others the cars here gentlemen where shall we meet domie and when tonight replied lavier theres a showing at la galerie dor in the rue de paradis the artists a young upstart who wants to be a rock star or something but hes the rage and everyone will be there tonight then come gentlemen against our instincts we must be very observable outside on the pavement the crowds moved in and out of the shafts of light while the music was provided by an earshattering rock band mercifully placed in a side room away from the main viewing area were it not for the paintings on the walls and the beams of the small spotlights illuminating them a person might think he was in a discotheque rather than in one of pariss elegant art galleries through a series of nods dominique lavier maneuvered krupkin to a corner of the large room their graceful smiles arched brows and intermittently mimed laughter covered their quiet conversation the word passed among the old men is that the monseigneur will be away for a few days however they are all to continue searching for the tall american and his crippled friend and list wherever they are seen you must have done your job well as i relayed the information he was utterly silent in his breathing however there was utter loathing i felt my bones grow cold hes on his way to moscow said the russian no doubt through prague what will you do now krupkin arched his neck and raised his eyes to the ceiling in false silent laughter leveling his gaze on her he answered smiling moscow he said bryce ogilvie managing partner of ogilvie spofford crawford and cohen prided himself on his selfdiscipline that was to say not merely the outward appearance of composure but the cold calm he forced upon his deepest fears in times of crisis however when he arrived at his office barely fifty minutes ago and found his concealed private telephone ringing he had experienced a twinge of apprehension at such an early morning call over that particular line then when he heard the heavily accented voice of the soviet consul general of new york demanding an immediate conference he had to acknowledge a sudden void in his chest and when the russian instructed himordered himto be at the carlyle hotel suite c in one hour rather than their usual meeting place at the apartment on thirtysecond and madison bryce felt a searinghot pain filling that void in his chest and when he had mildly objected to the suddenness of the proposed unscheduled conference the pain in his chest had burst into fire the flames traveling up to his throat at the soviets reply what i have to show you will make you devoutly wish we never knew each other much less had any occasion to meet this morning be there ogilvie sat back in his limousine as far back as the upholstery could be pressed his legs stretched rigid on the carpeted floor abstract swirling thoughts of personal wealth power and influence kept circling in his mind he had to get hold of himself after all he was bryce ogilvie the bryce ogilvie perhaps the most successful corporate attorney in new york and arguably second only to bostons randolph gates in the fast track of corporate and antitrust law gates the mere thought of that son of a bitch was a welcome diversion medusa had asked a minor favor of the celebrated gates an inconsequential perfectly acceptable staff appointment on an ad hoc governmentoriented commission and he had not even answered their phone calls calls put through by another perfectly acceptable source the supposedly irreproachable impartial head of pentagon procurements an asshole named general norman swayne who only wanted the best information well perhaps more than information but gates could not have known about that gates there was something in the times the other morning about his bowing out of a hostile takeover proceeding what was it the limousine pulled up to the curb in front of the carlyle hotel once the kennedy familys favored new york city address now the temporary clandestine favorite of the soviets ogilvie waited until the uniformed doorman opened the left rear door of the car before he stepped out onto the pavement he normally would not have done so believing the delay was an unnecessary affectation but this morning he did he had to get hold of himself he had to be the icecold ogilvie his legal adversaries feared the elevators ascent to the fourth floor was swift the walk over the bluecarpeted hallway to suite c far slower the distance much closer the bryce ogilvie breathed deeply calmly and stood erect as he pressed the bell twentyeight seconds later irritatingly clocked by the attorney as he silently counted one onethousand two onethousand ad nauseam the door was opened by the soviet consul general a slender man of medium height whose aquiline face had taut white skin and large brown eyes vladimir sulikov was a wiry seventythreeyearold full of nervous energy a scholar and former professor of history at moscow university a committed marxist yet oddly enough considering his position not a member of the communist party in truth he was not a member of any political orthodoxy preferring the passive role of the unorthodox individual within a collectivist society that and his singularly acute intellect had served him well he was sent to posts where more conformist men would not have been half so effective the combination of these attributes along with a dedication to physical exercise made sulikov appear ten to fifteen years younger than his age his was an unsettling presence for those negotiating with him for somehow he radiated the wisdom acquired over the years and the vitality of youth to implement it the greetings were abrupt sulikov offered nothing but a stiff cold handshake and a stiffly upholstered armchair he stood in front of the suites narrow mantel of white marble as though it were a classroom blackboard his hands clasped behind him an agitated professor about to question and lecture simultaneously an annoying disputatious graduate student to our business said the russian curtly you are aware of admiral peter holland yes of course hes the director of the central intelligence agency why do you ask is he one of you no are you quite sure of course i am is it possible he became one of you without your knowledge certainly not i dont even know the man and if this is some kind of amateurish interrogatory soviet style practice on someone else ohh the fine expensive american attorney objects to being asked simple questions i object to being insulted you made an astonishing statement over the phone id like it explained so please get to it ill get to it counselor believe me ill get to it but in my own fashion we russians protect our flanks its a lesson we learned from the tragedy and the triumph of stalingradan experience you americans never had to endure i came from another war as you well know said ogilvie coolly but if the history books are accurate you had some help from your russian winter thats difficult to explain to thousands upon thousands of frozen russian corpses granted and you have both my condolences and my congratulations but its not the explanationor even the lack of onethat i requested im only trying to explain a truism young man as has been said its the painful lessons of history we dont know about that we are bound to repeat you see we do protect our flanks and if some of us in the diplomatic arena suspect that we have been duped into international embarrassment we reinforce those flanks its a simple lesson for one so erudite as yourself counselor and so obvious its trivial what about admiral holland in a moment first let me ask you about a man named alexander conklin bryce ogilvie bolted forward in the chair stunned where did you get that name he asked barely audible theres more someone called panov mortimer or moishe panov a jewish physician we believe and finally counselor a man and a woman we assume are the assassin jason bourne and his wife my god exclaimed ogilvie his body angled and tense his eyes wide what have these people got to do with us thats what we have to know answered sulikov staring at the wall street lawyer youre obviously aware of each one arent you well yesno protested ogilvie his face flushed his words spilling over one another its an entirely different situation it has nothing to do with our businessa business weve poured millions into developed for twenty years and made millions in return counselor may i be permitted to remind you of that venture capital in the international markets cried the attorney thats no crime in this country money flows across the oceans with the touch of a computer button no crime really the soviet consul general arched his brows i thought you were a better attorney than that statement suggests youve been buying up companies all over europe through mergers and acquisitions using surrogate and misleading corporate entities the firms you acquire represent sources of supply often in the same markets and you subsequently determine prices between former competitors i believe thats called collusion and restraint of trade legal terms that we in the soviet union have no problems with as the state sets prices theres no evidence whatsoever to support such charges declared ogilvie of course not as long as there are liars and unscrupulous lawyers to bribe and advise the liars its a labyrinthine enterprise brilliantly executed and weve both profited from it youve sold us anything weve wanted or needed for years including every major item on your governments restricted lists under so many names our computers broke down trying to keep track of them no proof insisted the wall street attorney emphatically im not interested in such proof counselor im only interested in the names i mentioned to you in order they are admiral holland alexander conklin dr panov and lastly jason bourne and his wife please tell me about them why pleaded ogilvie ive just explained they have nothing to do with you and me nothing to do with our arrangements we think they might have so why not start with admiral holland oh for gods sake the agitated lawyer shook his head back and forth stammered several times and let the words rush out hollandall right youll see we recruited a man at the cia an analyst named desole who panicked and wanted to sever his relations with us naturally we couldnt permit that so we had him eliminatedprofessionally eliminatedas we were forced to do with several others who we believed were dangerously unstable holland may have had his suspicions and probably speculated on foul play but he couldnt do any more than speculatethe professionals we employed left no traces they never do very well said sulikov holding his place by the mantel and gazing down at the nervous ogilvie next alexander conklin hes a former cia station chief and tied in with panov a psychiatristtheyre both connected to the man they call jason bourne and his wife they go back years to saigon in fact you see we had been penetrated several of our people were reached and threatened and desole came to the conclusion that this bourne with conklins help was the one responsible for the penetration how could he do that i dont know i only know that he has to be eliminated and our professionals have accepted the contractcontracts they all have to go you mentioned saigon bourne was part of the old medusa admitted ogilvie quietly and like most of that crowd in the field a thieving misfit it could be something as simple as his having recognized someone from twenty years ago the story desole heard was that this trash bournethats not his real name incidentallywas actually trained by the agency to pose as an international assassin for the purpose of drawing out a killer they call the jackal ultimately the strategy failed and bourne was pensioned offgoldwatch time thanks for trying old sport but its over now obviously he wanted a great deal more than that so he came after us you can see now cant you the two issues are completely separate theres no linkage one has nothing to do with the other the russian unclasped his hands and took a step forward away from the mantel his expression was more one of concern than of alarm can you really be so blind or is your vision so tunneled that you see nothing but your enterprise i reject your insult out of hand what the hell are you talking about the connection is there because it was engineered created for one purpose only you were merely a byproduct a side issue that suddenly became immensely important to the authorities i dont understand whispered ogilvie his face growing pale you just said a killer they call the jackal and before that you alluded to bourne as a relatively insignificant rogue agent trained to pose as an assassin a strategy that failed so he was pensioned offgoldwatch time i believe you said its what i was told and what else were you told about carlos the jackal about the man who uses the name jason bourne what do you know about them very little frankly two aging killers scum whove been stalking each other for years again frankly who gives a damn my only concern is the complete confidentiality of our organizationwhich youve seen fit to question you still dont see do you see what for gods sake bourne may not be the lowly scum you think he is not when you consider his associates please be clearer said ogilvie in a flat monotone hes using medusa to hunt the jackal impossible that medusa was destroyed years ago in saigon obviously he thought otherwise would you care to remove your welltailored jacket roll up your sleeve and display the small tattoo on your inner forearm no relevance a mark of honor in a war no one supported but we had to fight oh come counselor from the piers and the supply depots in saigon stealing your forces blind and routing couriers to the banks in switzerland medals arent issued for those heroics pure speculation without foundation exclaimed ogilvie tell that to jason bourne a graduate of the original snake lady oh yes counselor he looked for you and he found you and hes using you to go after the jackal for christs sake how i honestly dont know but youd better read these the consul general crossed rapidly to the hotel desk picked up a sheaf of stapled typewritten pages and brought them over to bryce ogilvie these are decoded telephone conversations that took place four hours ago at our embassy in paris the identities are established the destinations as well read them carefully counselor then render me your legal opinion the celebrated attorney the icecold ogilvie grabbed the papers and with swift practiced eyes began reading as he flipped from one page to another the blood drained from his face to the pallor of death my god they know it all my offices are wired how why its insane were impenetrable again i suggest you tell that to jason bourne and his old friend and station chief from saigon alexander conklin they found you they couldnt have roared ogilvie we paid off or eliminated everyone in snake lady who even suspected the extent of our activities jesus there werent that many and goddamned few in the field i told you they were scum and we knew betterthey were the thieves of the world and wanted for crimes all over australia and the far east the ones in combat we knew and we reached you missed a couple i believe observed sulikov the lawyer returned to the typed pages beads of sweat rolling down his temples god in heaven im ruined he whispered choking the thought occurred to me said the soviet consul general of new york but then there are always options arent there naturally theres only one course of action for us like much of the continent we were taken in by ruthless capitalist privateers lambs led to the slaughter on the altars of greed as this american cartel of financial plunderers cornered markets selling inferior goods and services at inflated prices claiming by way of false documents to have washingtons approval to deliver thousands of restricted items to us and our satellites you son of a bitch exploded ogilvie youall of youcooperated every step of the way you brokered millions for us out of the bloc countries rerouted renamedchrist repaintedships throughout the mediterranean the aegean up the bosporus and into marmara to say nothing about ports in the baltic prove it counselor said sulikov laughing quietly if you wish i could make a laudable case for your defection moscow would welcome your expertise what cried the attorney as panic spread across his face well you certainly cant stay here an hour longer than absolutely necessary read those words mr ogilvie youre in the last stages of electronic surveillance before being picked up by the authorities oh my god you might try to operate from hong kong or macaotheyd welcome your money but with the problems they currently have with the mainlands markets and the sinobritish treaty of theyd probably frown on your indictments id say switzerlands out the reciprocal laws are so narrow these days as vesco found out ahh vesco you could join him in cuba stop it yelled ogilvie then again you could turn states evidence theres so much to unravel they might even take say ten years off your thirtyyear sentence goddamn it ill kill you the bedroom door suddenly opened as a consulate guard appeared his hand menacingly under his jacket the attorney had lurched to his feet trembling helplessly he returned to the chair and leaned forward his head in his hands such behavior would not be looked upon favorably said sulikov come counselor its a time for cool heads not emotional outbursts how the hell can you say that asked ogilvie a catch in his voice a prelude to tears im finished thats a harsh judgment from such a resourceful man as you i mean it its true you cant remain here but still your resources are immense act from that position of strength force concessions its the art of survival eventually the authorities will see the value of your contributions as they did with boesky levine and several dozen others who endure their minimal sentences playing tennis and backgammon while still possessing fortunes try it how said the lawyer looking up at the russian his eyes red pleading the where comes first explained sulikov find a neutral country that has no extradition treaty with washington one where there are officials who can be persuaded to grant you temporary residence so you can carry on your business activitiesthe term temporary is extremely elastic of course bahrain the emirates morocco turkey greecetheres no lack of attractive possibilities all with rich englishspeaking settlements we might even be able to help you very quietly why would you your blindness returns mr ogilvie for a price naturally you have an extraordinary operation in europe its in place and functioning and under our control we could derive considerable benefits from it oh my god said the leader of medusa his voice trailing off as he stared at the consul general do you really have a choice counselor come now we must hurry arrangements have to be made fortunately its still early in the day it was in the afternoon when charles casset walked into peter hollands office at the central intelligence agency breakthrough said the deputy director then added less enthusiastically of sorts the ogilvie firm asked the dci from left field replied casset nodding and placing several stock photographs on hollands desk these were faxed down from kennedy airport an hour ago believe me its been a heavy sixty minutes since then from kennedy frowning peter studied the facsimiled duplicates they comprised a sequence of photographs showing a crowd of people passing through metal detectors in one of the airports international terminals the head of a single man was circled in red in each photo what is it who is it theyre passengers heading for the aeroflot lounge moscow bound soviet carrier of course security routinely photographs us nationals taking those flights so who is he ogilvie himself what hes on the two oclock nonstop to moscow only hes not supposed to be come again three separate calls to his office came up with the same information he was out of the country in london at the dorchester which we know he isnt however the dorchester desk confirmed that he was booked but hadnt arrived so they were taking messages i dont understand charlie its a smoke screen and pretty hastily contrived in the first place why would someone as rich as ogilvie settle for aeroflot when he could be on the concorde to paris and air france to moscow also why would his office volunteer that he was either in or on his way to london when he was heading for moscow the aeroflot flights obvious said holland its the state airline and hes under soviet protection the londondorchester bit isnt too hard either its to throw people offmy god to throw us off right on master so valentino did some checking with all that fancy equipment in the cellars and guess what mrs ogilvie and their two teenage children are on a royal air maroc flight to casablanca with connections to marrakesh marrakesh air marocmorocco marrakesh wait a minute in those computer sheets conklin had us work up on the mayflower hotels registers there was a womanone of three people he tied to medusawho had been in marrakesh i commend your memory peter that woman and ogilvies wife were roommates at bennington in the early seventies fine old families their pedigrees ensure a large degree of sticking together and giving advice to one another charlie what the hell is going on the ogilvies were tipped off and have gotten out also if im not mistaken and if we could sort out several hundred accounts wed learn that millions have been transferred from new york to god knows where beyond these shores and medusas now in moscow mr director louis defazio wearily dragged his small frame out of the taxi in the boulevard masséna followed by his larger heavier far more muscular cousin mario from larchmont new york they stood on the pavement in front of a restaurant its name in redtubed script across a greentinted window tetrazzinis this is the place said louis theyll be in a private room in the back its pretty late mario looked at his watch under the wash of a street lamp i set the time for paris its almost midnight here theyll wait you still havent told me their names lou what do we call them you dont answered defazio starting for the entrance no namesthey wouldnt mean anything anyway all you gotta do is be respectful you know what i mean i dont have to be told that lou i really dont reprimanded mario in his softspoken voice but for my own information why do you even bring it up hes a highclass diplomatico explained the capo supremo stopping briefly on the pavement and looking up at the man who had nearly killed jason bourne in manassas virginia he operates out of rome from fancy government circles but hes the direct contact with the dons in sicily he and his wife are very very highly regarded you understand what im saying i do and i dont admitted the cousin if hes so grand why would he accept such a menial assignment as following our targets because he can he can go places some of our pagliacci cant get near you know what i mean also i happen to let our people in new york know who our clients were especially one capisce the dons all the way from manhattan to the estates south of palermo have a language they use exclusively between themselves did you know that cugino it comes down to a couple of orders do it and dont do it i think i understand lou we render respect respect yes my fancy rendering cousin but not no weakness capisce no weakness the words got to go up and down the line that this is an operation lou defazio took control of and ran from beginning to end you got that if thats the case maybe i can go home to angie and the kids said mario grinning what you shut up cugino with this one job you got annuities for your whole passel of bambinos not a passel lou just five lets go remember respect but we dont take no shit the small private dining room was a miniature version of tetrazzinis decor the ambience was italian in all things the walls were papered with dated now faded murals of venice rome and florence the softly pipedin music was predominantly operatic arias and tarantellas and the lighting indirect with pockets of shadows if a patron did not know he was in paris he might think he was dining on romes via frascati at one of the many commercialized family ristoranti lining that ancient street there was a large round table in the center covered by a deep red tablecloth with a generous overhang and four chairs equidistant from one another additional chairs were against the walls allowing for an expanded conference of principals or for the proper location of secondary subalterns usually armed seated at the far end of the table was a distinguishedlooking oliveskinned man with wavy dark hair on his left was a fashionably dressed wellcoiffed middleaged woman a bottle of chianti classico was between them the crude thickstemmed wineglasses in front of them not the sort one would associate with such aristocratic diners on a chair behind the diplomatico was a black leather suitcase im defazio said the capo supremo from new york closing the door this is my cousin mario of who you may have heard ofa very talented man who takes precious time away from his family to be with us yes of course said the aristocratic mafioso mario il bola esecuzione garantitodeadly with any weapon sit down gentlemen i find such descriptions meaningless responded mario approaching a chair im skilled in my craft thats all spoken like a professional signore added the woman as defazio and his cousin sat down may i order you wine drinks she continued not yet replied louis maybe latermaybe my talented relative on my mothers side may she rest in the arms of christ asked a good question outside what do we call you mr and mrs paris france which is by way of saying i dont need no real names conte and contessa is what were known by answered the husband smiling the tight smile more appropriate to a mask than a human face see what i mean cugino these are people of high regard so mr count bring us up to date how about it theres no question about it signor defazio replied the roman his voice as tight as his previous smile which had completely disappeared i will bring you up to date and were it in my powers i would leave you in the far distant past hey what kind of fuckin talk is that lou please intruded mario quietly but firmly watch your language what about his language what kind of language is that he wants to leave me in some kind of dirt you asked me what has happened signor defazio and im telling you said the count his voice as strained as before yesterday at noon my wife and i were nearly killedkilled signor defazio its not the sort of experience were used to or can tolerate have you any idea what youve gotten yourself into you they marked you if you mean by that did they know who we were happily they did not had they known its doubtful wed be sitting at this table signor defazio interrupted the contessa glancing at her husband her look telling him to calm down the word we received over here is that you have a contract on this cripple and his friend the doctor is that true yeah confirmed the capo supremo cautiously as far as that goes but it goes further you know what i mean i havent the vaguest idea replied the count icily i tell you this because its possible i could use your help for which like i told you youll be paid good real good how does the contract go further asked the wife again interrupting theres someone else we have to hit a third party these two came over here to meet the count and his countess instantly looked at each other a third party repeated the man from rome raising the wineglass to his lips i see a threetarget contract is generally quite profitable how profitable signor defazio hey come on do i ask you what you make a week in paris france lets just say its a lot and you two personally can count on six figures if everything goes according to the book six figures encompass a wide spectrum observed the countess it also indicates that the contract is worth over seven figures seven defazio looked at the woman his breathing on hold over a million dollars concluded the countess yeah well you see its important to our clients that these people leave this world said louis breathing again as seven figures had not been equated with seven million we dont ask why we just do the job in situations like this our dons are generous we keep most of the money and our thing keeps its reputation for efficiency isnt that right mario im sure it is lou but i dont involve myself in those matters you get paid dont you cugino i wouldnt be here if i didnt lou see what i mean said defazio looking at the aristocrats of the european mafia who showed no reaction at all except to stare at the capo supremo hey whats the matter oh this bad thing that happened yesterday huh what was itthey saw you right they spotted you and some gorilla got off a couple of shots to scare you away thats it isnt it i mean what else could it be right they didnt know who you were but you were therea couple of times too often maybe so a little muscle was used okay its an old scam scare the shit out of strangers you see more than once lou i asked you to temper your language temper im losing my temper i want to deal in plain words said the count disregarding defazios words with a soft voice and arched brows you say you must kill this cripple and his friend the doctor as well as a third party is that correct in plain words you got it right do you know who this third party isoutside of a photograph or a detailed description sure hes a government slime who was sent out years ago to make like he was a mario here an esecuzione can you believe it but these three individuals have injured our clients i mean really hurt them thats why the contract what else can i tell you were not sure said the countess gracefully sipping her wine perhaps you dont really know know what know that there is someone else who wants this third party dead far more than you do explained the count yesterday noon he assaulted a small café in the countryside with murderous gunfire killing a number of people because your third party was inside so were we we saw themhimwarned by a guard and race outside certain emergencies are communicated we left immediately only minutes before the massacre condannare choked defazio who is this bastard who wants the kill tell me weve spent yesterday afternoon and all day today trying to find out began the woman leaning forward delicately fingering the indelicate glass as though it were an affront to her sensibilities your targets are never alone there are always men around them armed guards and at first we didnt know where they came from then on the avenue montaigne we saw a soviet limousine come for them and your third man in the company of a wellknown kgb officer and now we think we do know only you however broke in the count can confirm it for us what is the name of this third man on your contract surely we have a right to know why not hes a loser named bourne jason bourne whos blackmailing our clients ecco said the husband quietly ultimo added the wife what do you know of this bourne she asked what i told you he went out under cover for the government and got shafted by the big boys in washington he gets pissed off so he ends up shafting our clients a real slime youve never heard of carlos the jackal said the count leaning back in the chair studying the capo supremo oh yeah sure i heard of him and i see what you mean they say this jackal character has a big thing against this bourne and vice versa but it dont cut no ice with me you know i thought that foxcat was just in books in the movies you know what i mean then they tell me hes a real hit man wadda y know very real agreed the countess but like i said him i couldnt care less about i want the jew shrink the cripple and this rotgut bourne thats all and i really want them the diplomat and his wife looked at each other they shrugged in mild astonishment then the contessa nodded deferring to her husband your sense of fiction has been shattered by reality said the count come again there was a robin hood you know but he wasnt a noble of locksley he was a barbaric saxon chief who opposed the normans a murdering butchering thief extolled only in legends and there was an innocent the third a pope who was hardly innocent and who followed the savage policies of a predecessor saint gregory the seventh who was hardly a saint between them they split europe asunder into rivers of blood for political power and to enrich the coffers of the holy empire centuries before there was the gentle quintus cassius longinus of rome beloved protector of the further spain yet he tortured and mutilated a hundred thousand spaniards what the hell are you talkin about these men were fictionalized signor defazio into many different shadings of what they may actually have been but regardless of the distortions they were real just as the jackal is real and is a deadly problem for you as unfortunately he is a problem for us for hes a complication we cannot accept huh the capo supremo mouth gaping stared at the italian aristocrat the presence of the soviets was both alarming and enigmatic continued the count then finally we perceived a possible connection which you just confirmed moscow has been hunting carlos for years solely for the purpose of executing him and all theyve gotten for their efforts is one dead hunter after another somehowgod knows howjason bourne negotiated with the russians to pursue their common objective for christs sake speak english or italian but with words that make sense i didnt exactly go to harvard city college gumball i didnt have to capisce the jackal stormed that country inn yesterday hes the one hunting down jason bourne who was foolish enough to come back to paris and persuade the soviets to work with him both were stupid for this is paris and carlos will win hell kill bourne and your other targets and laugh at the russians then hell proclaim to the clandestine departments of all governments that he has won that hes the padrone the maestro you in america have never been exposed to the whole story only bits and pieces for your interest in europe stops at the money line but we have lived through it watching in fascination and now we are mesmerized two aging master assassins obsessed with hatred each wanting only to cut the others throat hey back up gumball shouted defazio this slime bournes a fake a contraffazione he never was an executioner youre quite wrong signore said the countess he may not have entered the arena with a gun but it became his favorite instrument ask the jackal fuck the jackal cried defazio getting up from the chair lou shut up mario this bourne is mine ours we deliver the corpse we take the pictures with meusstanding over all three with a dozen ice picks in their bodies their heads pulled up by the hair so nobody can say it aint our kills now youre the one whos pazzo said the mafia count quietly in counterpoint to the capo supremos raucous yelling and please keep your voice down then dont get me excited hes trying to explain things lou said defazios relative the killer i want to hear what the gentleman has to say because it could be vital to my approach sit down cousin louis sat down please continue count thank you mario you dont object to my calling you mario not at all sir perhaps you should visit rome perhaps we should get back to paris again choked the capo supremo very well agreed the roman now dividing his attention between defazio and his cousin but favoring the latter you might take out all three targets with a longrange rifle but you wont get near the bodies the soviet guards will be indistinguishable from any other people in the area and if they see the two of you coming in to the killing ground theyll open fire assuming youre from the jackal then we must create a diversion where we can isolate the targets said mario his elbows on the table his intelligent eyes on the count perhaps an emergency in the early hours of the morning a fire in their lodgings perhaps that necessitates their coming outside ive done it before in the confusion of fire trucks and police sirens and the general panic one can pull targets away and complete the assignments its a fine strategy mario but there are still the soviet guards we take them out cried defazio you are only two men said the diplomat and there are at least three in barbizon to say nothing of the hotel in paris where the cripple and the doctor are staying so we outmatch the numbers the capo supremo pulled the back of his hand over the sweat that had gathered on his forehead we hit this barbizon first right with only two men asked the countess her cosmeticized eyes wide in surprise you got men exclaimed defazio well use a few ill pay additional the count shook his head slowly and spoke softly we will not go to war with the jackal he said those are my instructions fairy bastards an interesting comment coming from you observed the countess a thin insulting smile on her lips perhaps our dons are not as generous as yours continued the diplomat we are willing to cooperate up to a point but no further youll never make another shipment to new york or philly or chicago well let our superiors debate those issues wont we there was a sudden knocking at the door four raps in a row harsh and intrusive avanti called out the count instantly reaching under his jacket and ripping an automatic out of his belt he lowered it beneath the overhang of the red tablecloth and smiled as the manager of tetrazzims entered emergenza said the grossly overweight man walking rapidly to the welltailored mafioso and handing him a note grazie prego replied the manager crossing back to the door and exiting as quickly as he had arrived the anxious gods of sicily may be smiling down on you after all said the count reading this communication is from the man following your targets they are outside paris and they are alone and for reasons i cannot possibly explain there are no guards they have no protection where cried defazio leaping to his feet without answering the diplomat calmly reached for his gold lighter ignited it and fired the small piece of paper lowering it into an ashtray mario sprang up from his chair the man from rome dropped the lighter on the table and swiftly retrieved the gun from his lap first let us discuss the fee he said as the note coiled into flaming black ash our dons in palermo are definitely not as generous as yours please talk quickly as every minute counts you motherfucking bastard my oedipal problems are not your concern how much signor defazio ill go the limit replied the capo supremo lowering himself into the chair staring at the charred remnants of the information three hundred thousand american thats it thats excremento said the countess try again seconds become minutes and you cannot afford them all right all right double it plus expenses added the woman what the fuck can they be your cousin mario is right said the diplomat please watch your language in front of my wife holy shit i warned you signore the expenses are an additional quarter of a million american what are you nuts no youre vulgar the total is one million one hundred fifty thousand dollars to be paid as our couriers in new york so instruct you if not you will be missed inwhat is itbrooklyn heights signor defazio where are the targets said the beaten capo supremo his defeat painful to him at a small private airfield in pontcarré about fortyfive minutes from paris theyre waiting for a plane that was grounded in poitiers because of bad weather it cant possibly arrive for at least an hour and a quarter did you bring the equipment we requested asked mario rapidly its all there answered the countess gesturing at the large black suitcase on a chair against the wall a car a fast car cried defazio as his executioner retrieved the suitcase outside replied the count the driver will know where to take you hes been to that field come on cugino tonight we collect and you can settle a score except for a single clerk behind the counter in the small oneroom terminal and an air controller hired to stay the extra hours in the radio tower the private airport in pontcarré was deserted alex conklin and mo panov stayed discreetly behind as bourne led marie outside to the gate area fronting the field beyond a waisthigh metal fence two strips of receding amber ground lights defined the long runway for the plane from poitiers they had been turned on only a short time ago it wont be long now said jason this whole damn things stupid retorted webbs wife everything theres no reason for you to stay and every reason for you to leave for you to be alone here in paris would be stupid alex is right if carloss people found you youd be taken hostage so why risk it because im capable of staying out of sight and i dont want to be ten thousand miles away from you youll forgive me if i worry about you mr bourne and care for you jason looked at her in the shadows grateful for the darkness she could not clearly see his eyes then be reasonable and use your head he said coldly suddenly feeling so old too old for such a transparently false lack of feeling we know carlos is in moscow and krupkin isnt far behind him dimitris flying us there in the morning and well be under the protection of the kgb in the tightest city in the world what more could we want you were under the protection of the united states government on a short east side block in new york thirteen years ago and it didnt do you much good theres a great deal of difference back then the jackal knew exactly where i was going and when id be there right now he has no idea we even know hes in moscow hes got other problems big ones for him and he thinks were here in parishes ordered his people to keep searching for us what will you do in moscow we wont know until we get there but whatever it is its better than here in paris krupkins been busy every ranking officer in dzerzhinsky square who speaks french is being watched and is under surveillance he said the french narrowed down the possibilities and that something should break something will break the odds are on our side and when it does i cant be worried about you back here thats the nicest thing youve said in the past thirtysix hours so be it you should be with the children and you know that youll be out of reach and safe and the kids need you mrs coopers a terrific lady but shes not their mother besides your brother probably has jamie smoking his cuban cigars and playing monopoly with real money by now marie looked up at her husband a gentle smile apparent in the darkness as well as in her voice thanks for the laugh i need it its probably the truthyour brother i mean if there are goodlooking women on the staff its quite possible our sons lost his virginity david bourne was silent marie chuckled briefly then went on i suppose i really cant argue with you and you would if my argument was flawed dr st jacques thats something ive learned over the past thirteen years i still object to this crazy trip back to washington from here to marseilles then to london then on a flight to dulles itd be so much simpler just to get on a plane from orly to the states its peter hollands idea hell meet you himself so ask him he doesnt say an awful lot on the phone i suspect he doesnt want to deal with the french authorities for fear of a leak to carloss people a single woman with a common name on crowded flights is probably best ill spend more time sitting in airports than in the air probably so cover those great legs of yours and carry a bible thats sweet said marie touching his face i suddenly hear you david what again bourne did not respond to the warmth nothing do me a favor will you what is it asked jason in a distant monotone bring that david back to me lets get an update on the plane said bourne his voice flat and abrupt as he touched her elbow and led her back inside im getting olderoldand i cannot much longer be what i am not the chameleon is slipping away the imagination isnt there the way it used to be but i cannot stop not now get away from me david webb no sooner had they reentered the small terminal than the telephone on the counter began to ring the lone clerk picked it up oui he listened for no more than five seconds merci he said hanging up and addressing the four interested parties in french that was the tower the plane from poitiers will be on the ground in approximately four minutes the pilot requests that you be ready madame as he would like to fly ahead of the weather front moving east so would i agreed marie rushing to alex conklin and mo panov the farewells were brief the embraces strong the words heartfelt bourne led his wife back outside i just rememberedwhere are krupkins guards she asked as jason unlatched the gate and they walked toward the lighted runway we dont need them or want them he answered the soviet connection was made in the montaigne so we have to assume the embassys being watched no guards rushing out into cars therefore no movement on our part for carloss people to report i see the sound of a small decelerating jet could be heard as the plane circled the airfield once and made its descent onto the fourthousandfoot runway i love you so much david said marie raising her voice to be heard over the roar of the aircraft rolling toward them he loves you so much said bourne images colliding in his mind i love you so much the jet loomed clearly into view between the rows of amber lights a white bulletlike machine with short delta wings sweeping back from the fuselage giving it the appearance of an angry flying insect the pilot swung the plane around in a circle coming to a jarring stop as the automatic passenger door sprang out and up while metal steps slapped down to the ground jason and marie ran toward the jets entrance it happened with the sudden impact of a murderous wind shear at once unstoppable enveloping the swirling winds of death gunfire automatic weaponstwo of them one nearby one farther awayshattering windows ripping into wood a piercing screech of pain erupting from the terminal announcing a mortal hit with both hands bourne gripped marie by the waist heaving her up and propelling her into the plane as he shouted to the pilot shut the door and get out of here mon dieu cried the man from the open flight deck allezvousen he roared ordering jason away from the springhinged door and the metal steps gunning the jets engine as the plane lurched forward jason plunged to the ground and raised his eyes maries face was pressed against the window she was screaming hysterically the plane thundered down the runway it was free bourne was not he was caught in the wash of the amber lights the glowing rows a cyclorama of yellowish orange no matter where he stood or knelt or crouched he was in silhouette so he pulled out the automatic from his beltthe weapon he reflected given to him by bernardineand began slithering snaking his way across the asphalt toward the bordering grass outside the fencedgate area the gunfire erupted again but now they were three scattered single shots from within the terminal where the lights had been extinguished they had to have come from conklins gun or possibly the clerks if he had a weapon panov did not then who had been hit no time a shattering fusillade burst out of the nearest automatic rifle it was steady prolonged and deadly spraying the side of the small building and the gate area then the second automatic weapon commenced firing from the sound it was on the opposite side of the terminals waiting room moments later there were two single shots the last one accompanied by a scream again on the other side of the building ive been hit the voice was the cry of a man in pain on the other side of the building the automatic rifle jason slowly rose to a low crouch in the grass and peered into the darkness a fragment of blacker darkness moved he raised his automatic and fired into the moving mass getting to his feet and racing across the gate area turning and squeezing the trigger until he was both out of bullets and out of sight on the east side of the building where the runway ended and the amber lights stopped he crawled cautiously to the section of the waisthigh fence that paralleled the corner of the small terminal the grayishwhite gravel of the parking area was a gratifying sight he was able to make out the figure of a man writhing on the stones the figure gripped a weapon in his hands then pushing it into the gravel raised himself to a halfsitting position cugino he screamed help me his answer was another burst of gunfire from the west side of the building diagonally to the right of the wounded man holy christ he shrieked im hit bad again the reply was yet another fusillade from the automatic rifle these rounds simultaneous with crashing glass the killer on the west side of the building had smashed the windows and was blowing apart everything inside bourne dropped the useless automatic and grabbed the top of the fence vaulting over it his left leg landing in agony on the ground whats happened to me why do i hurt goddamn it he limped to the woodframed corner of the building and edged his face to the open space beyond the figure on the gravel fell back unable to support himself on the automatic rifle jason felt the ground found a large rock and threw it with all his strength beyond the wounded man it crashed bouncing into the gravel for an instant like the sound of approaching footsteps the killer spastically rose and spun his body to the rear gripping his weapon which twice fell out of his grasp now bourne raced across the stones of the parking lot and lunged off his feet down into the man with the gun he tore the weapon from the killers grip and crashed the metal stock into his skull the short slender man went limp and again suddenly there was another crescendo of gunfire from the west exterior of the terminal building again accompanied by the shattering of glass the first and nearer killer was narrowing down his targets he had to be stopped thought jason his breath gone every muscle in his body in pain where was the man from yesterday where was delta from medusa the chameleon from treadstone seventyone where was that man bourne grabbed the mac submachine gun from the unconscious figure on the gravel and raced toward the side door of the terminal alex he roared let me in ive got the weapon the door crashed open my god youre alive shouted conklin in the darkness of the shadows as jason ran inside mos in bad shapehe was shot in the chest the clerks dead and we cant raise the tower out on the field they must have reached it first alex slammed the door shut get down on the floor a fusillade raked the walls bourne got to his knees and fired back then threw himself down beside conklin what happened cried jason breathless his voice strained the sweat dripping down his face and stinging his eyes the jackal happened how did he do it he fooled us all you me krupkin and lavierworst of all me he sent the word out that hed be away no explanation even with you here in paris just that hed be gone for a while we thought the trap had worked everything pointed to moscow he sucked us into his own trap oh christ did he suck us in i should have known better i should have seen through it it was too clean im sorry david oh god im sorry thats him out there isnt it he wants the kill all to himselfnothing else matters to him suddenly a flashlight its powerful beam blinding was thrown through a shattered window instantly bourne raised the mac and blew the shiny metal tube away extinguishing the light the damage however had been done their bodies had been seen over here screamed alex grabbing jason and diving behind the counter as a murderous barrage came from the blurred silhouette in the window it stopped there was the crack of a bolt he has to reload whispered bourne with the break in the fire stay here jason stood up and raced to the gate doors crashing through them his weapon gripped in his right hand his body prone tense prepared to killif the years would permit it they had to permit it he crawled through the gate he had opened for marie and spun on the ground to his right scrambling along the fence he was deltaof saigons medusa he could do it there was no friendly jungle now but there was everything he could usedelta could usethe darkness the intermittent blocks of shadows from the myriad clouds intercepting the moonlight use everything it was what you were trained to do so many years agoso many forget it forget time do it the animal only yards away wants you deadyour wife dead your children dead dead it was the quickness born of pure fury that propelled him obsessed him and he knew that to win he had to win quickly with all the speed that was in him he crept swiftly along the fence that enclosed the airfield and past the corner of the terminal prepared for the instant of exposure the lethal submachine gun was still gripped in his hand his index finger now on the trigger there was a cluster of wild shrubbery preceding two thick trees no more than thirty feet away if he could reach them the advantage was his he would have the high ground the jackal in the valley of death if only because he was behind the assassin and unseen he reached the shrubbery and at the moment he heard a massive smashing of glass followed by yet another fusilladethis time so prolonged that the entire magazine had to have been emptied he had not been seen the figure by the window had backed away to reload his concentration on that task not on the possibility of an escape carlos too was growing old and losing his finesse thought jason bourne where were the flares intrinsic to such an operation where were the alert roving eyes that loaded weapons in total darkness darkness a cloud cover blocked the yellow rays of the moon there was darkness he vaulted over the fence concealing himself behind the shrubbery then raced to the first of the two trees where he could stand upright view the scene and consider his options something was wrong there was a primitiveness he could not associate with the jackal the assassin had isolated the terminal ad valorem and the price was high but there was an absence of the finer points of the deadly equation the subtlety was not there instead there was a brute force hardly to be denied but not when employed against the man they called jason bourne who had escaped from the trap the figure by the shattered window had spent his ammunition he reeled back against the building pulling another magazine out of his pocket jason raced out of the cover of the trees his mac on automatic fire exploding the dirt in front of the killer then circling the bullets around his frame thats it he shouted closing in on the assassin youre dead carlos with one pull of my fingerif you are the jackal the man by the shattered window threw down his weapon i am not he mr bourne said the executioner from larchmont new york weve met before but i am not the person you think i am hit the ground you son of a bitch the killer did so as jason approached spread your legs and your arms the command was obeyed raise your head the man did so and bourne stared at the face vaguely illuminated by the distant glow of the amber lights on the airfields runway you see now said mario im not who you think i am my god whispered jason his incredulity all too apparent you were in the driveway in manassas virginia you tried to kill cactus then me contracts mr bourne nothing more what about the tower the air controller here in the tower i do not kill indiscriminately once the plane from poitiers was given clearance to land i told him to leave forgive me but your wife was also on the list fortunately as she is a mother it was beyond my abilities who the hell are you i just told you a contract employee ive seen better im not perhaps in your league but i serve my organization well jesus youre medusa ive heard the name but thats all i can tell you let me make one thing clear mr bourne i will not leave my wife a widow or my children orphans for the sake of a contract that position simply isnt viable they mean too much to me youll spend a hundred and fifty years in prison and thats only if youre prosecuted in a state that doesnt have the death penalty not with what i know mr bourne my family and i will be well taken care ofa new name perhaps a nice farm in the dakotas or wyoming you see i knew this moment had to come whats come now you bastard is that a friend of mine inside there is shot up you did it a truce then said mario what the hell do you mean by that i have a very fast car a half mile away the killer from larchmont new york pulled a square instrument from his belt it can be here in less than a minute im sure the driver knows the nearest hospital do it its done jason bourne said mario pressing a button morris panov had been rolled into the operating room louis defazio was still on a gurney as it was determined that his wound was superficial and through backchannel negotiations between washington and quai dorsay the criminal known only as mario was securely in the custody of the american embassy in paris a whitefrocked doctor came out into the hospitals waiting room both conklin and bourne got to their feet frightened i will not pretend to be a bearer of glad tidings said the physician in french for it would be quite wrong both lungs of your friend were punctured as well as the wall of his heart he has at best a fortysixty chance of survivalagainst him im afraid still he is a strongwilled man who wants to live at times that means more than all the medical negatives what else can i tell you thank you doctor jason turned away i have to use a telephone said alex to the surgeon i should go to our embassy but i havent the time do i have any guarantee that i wont be tapped overheard i imagine you have every guarantee replied the physician we wouldnt know how to do it use my office please peter alex cried holland from langley virginia everything go all right did marie get off to answer your first question no everything did not go all right and as far as marie goes you can expect a panicked phone call from her the minute she reaches marseilles that pilot wont touch his radio what tell her were okay that davids not hurt what are you talking about broke in the director of central intelligence we were ambushed while waiting for the plane from poitiers im afraid mo panovs in bad shape so bad i dont want to think about it right now were in a hospital and the doctors not encouraging oh god alex im sorry in his own way mos a fighter ill still bet on him incidentally dont tell marie she thinks too much of course not is there anything i can do yes there is peter you can tell me why medusas here in paris in paris its not according to everything i know and i know a hell of a lot our identifications positive the two guns that hit us an hour ago were sent over by medusa weve even got a confession of sorts i dont understand protested holland paris never entered into our thinking theres no linkage in the scenario sure there is contradicted the former station chief you said it yourself you called it a selffulfilling prophecy remember the ultimate logic that bourne conceived as a theory medusa joining up with the jackal the target jason bourne thats the point alex it was only a theory hypothetically convincing but still just a theory the basis for a sound strategy but it never happened it obviously did not from this end as far as were concerned medusas now in moscow moscow conklin nearly dropped the phone on the doctors desk thats right weve concentrated on ogilvies law firm in new york tapping everything that could be tapped somehowand we dont know howogilvie was tipped off and got out of the country he took an aeroflot to moscow and the rest of his family headed to marrakesh ogilvie alex could barely be heard frowning his memory peeled away the years from saigon a legal officer from saigon thats right were convinced he runs medusa and you withheld that information from me only the name of the firm i told you we had our priorities and you had yours for us medusa came first you simple swab jockey exploded conklin i know ogilviemore precisely i knew him let me tell you what they called him in saigon icecold ogilvie the smoothesttalking legal scumball in vietnam with a few subpoenas and some research i could have told you where a few of his courtroom skeletons were buriedyou blew it you could have pulled him in for fixing the army courts in a couple of killingsthere are no statutes civilian or military on those crimes jesus why didnt you tell me in all honesty alex you never asked you simply assumedrightly sothat i wouldnt tell you all right all right its doneto hell with it by tomorrow or the next day youll have our two medusans so go to work on them they both want to save their assesthe capos a slime but his sharpshooter keeps praying for his family and its not organizational what are you going to do pressed holland were on our way to moscow after ogilvie no the jackal but if i see bryce ill give him your regards buckingham pritchard sat next to his uniformed uncle cyril sylvester pritchard deputy director of immigration in the office of sir henry sykes at government house in montserrat beside them on the deputys right was their attorney the finest native solicitor sykes could persuade to advise the pritchards in the event that the crown brought a case against them as accessories to terrorism sir henry sat behind the desk and glanced in partial shock at the lawyer one jonathan lemuel who raised his head and eyes to the ceiling not to have the benefit of the tropic fan that stirred the humid air but to show disbelief lemuel was a cambridgeeducated attorney once a scholarship boy from the colonies who years ago had made his money in london and returned in the autumn of his life to his native serrat to enjoy the fruits of his labors actually sir henry had persuaded his retired black friend to give assistance to a couple of idiots who might have involved themselves in a serious international matter the cause of sir henrys shock and jonathan lemuels disbelief cum exasperation came about through the following exchange between sykes and the deputy director of immigration mr pritchard weve established that your nephew overheard a telephone conversation between john st jacques and his brotherinlaw the american mr david webb further your nephew buckingham pritchard here freely even enthusiastically admits calling you with certain information contained in that conversation and that you in turn emphatically stated that you had to reach paris immediately is this true it is all completely true sir henry whom did you reach in paris whats the telephone number with respect sir i am sworn to secrecy at that succinct and totally unexpected reply jonathan lemuel had lifted his astonished eyes to the ceiling sykes regaining his composure put an end to the brief pause of amazement what was that mr pritchard my nephew and i are part of an international organization involving the great leaders of the world and we have been sworn to secrecy good god he believes it muttered sir henry oh for heavens sake said lemuel lowering his head our telephone service here is not the most sophisticated especially where pay phones are concerned which i presume you were instructed to use but within a day or so that number can be traced why not simply give it to sir henry now he obviously needs to know quickly so where is the harm the harm sir is to our superiors in the organizationthat was made explicitly clear to me personally whats the name of this international organization i dont know sir henry that is part of the confidensheeality do you not see im afraid youre the one who doesnt see mr pritchard said sykes his voice clipped his anger surfacing oh but i do sir henry and i shall prove it to you interrupted the deputy looking at each man as if to draw the skeptical sykes and the astonished attorney as well as his adoring nephew into his confidence a large sum of money was wired from a private banking institution in switzerland directly to my own account here in montserrat the instructions were clear if flexible the funds were to be used liberally in pursuit of the assignments delegated to me transportation entertainment lodgingsi was told i had complete discretion but of course i keep a record of all expenditures as i do as the second highest officer of immigration who but vastly superior people would put such trust in a man they knew only by an enviable reputation and position henry sykes and jonathan lemuel again looked at each other astonishment and disbelief now joined by total fascination sir henry leaned forward over the desk beyond thisshall we sayindepth observation of john st jacques requiring the obvious services of your nephew have you been given other assignments actually not sir but im sure that as soon as the leaders see how expeditiously i have performed others will follow lemuel raised his hand calmly a few inches off the arm of his chair to inhibit a redfaced sykes tell me he said quickly gently this large sum of money sent from switzerland just how large was it the amount doesnt matter legally and sir henry can always call your bank under the laws of the crown so please tell us three hundred pounds replied the elder pritchard the pride of his value in his voice three hundred the solicitors words trailed off not exactly staggering eh mumbled sir henry leaning back speechless roughly continued lemuel whats been your expenses not roughly but precisely affirmed the deputy director of immigration removing a small notebook from the breast pocket of his uniform my brilliant uncle is always precise offered buckingham pritchard thank you nephew how much insisted the attorney precisely twentysix pounds five shillings english or the equivalent of one hundred thirtytwo east caribbean dollars the ecs rounded off to the nearest double zero at the latest rate of exchangein this case i absorbed fortyseven cents so entered amazing intoned sykes numbed ive scrupulously kept every receipt went on the deputy gathering steam as he continued reading theyre locked in a strongbox at my flat on old road bay and include the following a total of seven dollars and eighteen cents for local calls to tranquilityi would not use my official phone twentythree dollars and sixtyfive cents for the longdistance call to paris sixtyeight dollars and eighty cents dinner for myself and my nephew at vue point a business conference naturally that will do interrupted jonathan lemuel wiping his perspiring black brow with a handkerchief although the tropical fan was perfectly adequate for the room i am prepared to submit everything at the proper time i said that will do cyril you should know that i refused a taxi driver when he offered to inflate the price of a receipt and soundly criticized him in my official position enough thundered sykes the veins in his neck pronounced you both have been damn fools of the first magnitude to have even considered john st jacques a criminal of any sort is preposterous sir henry broke in the younger pritchard i myself saw what happened at tranquility inn it was so horrible coffins on the dock the chapel blown up government boats around our peaceful islegunshots sir it will be months before were back in full operation exactly roared sykes and do you believe johnny st jay would willingly destroy his own property his own business stranger things have happened in the outside criminal world sir henry said cyril sylvester pritchard knowingly in my official capacity ive heard many many stories the incidents my nephew described are called diversionary tactics employed to create the illusion that the scoundrels are victims it was all thoroughly explained to me oh it was was it cried the former brigadier of the british army well let me explain something else shall i youve been duped by an international terrorist wanted the world over do you know the universal penalty for aiding and abetting such a killer ill make it plain in case its escaped your attentionin your official capacity of course it is death by firing squad or less charitably a public hanging now whats that goddamned number in paris under the circumstances said the deputy summoning what dignity he could despite the fact that his trembling nephew clutched his left arm and his hand shook as he reached for his notebook ill write it out for you one asks for a blackbird in french sir henry i speak a few words sir henry in frenchsir henry summoned by an armed guard dressed casually as a weekend guest in white slacks and a loose bulky white linen jacket john st jacques walked into the library of their new safe house an estate on chesapeake bay the guard a muscular mediumsized man with cleancut hispanic features stood inside the doorway he pointed to the telephone on the large cherrywood desk its for you mr jones its the director thanks hector said johnny pausing briefly is that mr jones stuff really necessary as necessary as hector my real names roger or daniel whatever gotcha st jacques crossed to the desk and picked up the phone holland that number your friend sykes got is a blind but useful as my brotherinlaw would say please speak english its the number of a café on the marais waterfront on the seine the routine is to ask for a blackbirdun oiseau noirand somebody shouts out if the blackbirds there contact is made if he isnt you try again why is it useful well try againand again and againwith a man inside whats happening otherwise i can only give you a limited answer goddamn you marie can fill you in marie shes on her way home shes mad as hell but shes also one relieved wife and mother why is she mad ive booked her lowkey on several long flights back for christs sake why broke in the brother angrily you send a goddamned plane for her shes been more valuable to you than anyone in your dumb congress or your corkscrew administration and you send planes for them all over the place im not joking holland i dont send those planes replied the director firmly others do the ones i send involve too many questions and too much curiosity on foreign soil and thats all ill say about it her safety is more important than her comfort we agree on that honcho the director paused his irritation apparent you know something youre not really a very pleasant fellow are you my sister puts up with me which more than offsets your opinion why is she relievedas a wife and mother i think you said again holland paused not in irritation now but searching for the words a disagreeable incident took place one none of us could predict or even contemplate oh i hear those famous fucking words from the american establishment roared st jacques what did you miss this time a truckload of us missiles to the ayatollahs agents in paris what happened for a third time peter holland employed a moment of silence although his heavy breathing was audible you know young man i could easily hang up the phone and dismiss your existence which would be quite beneficial for my blood pressure look honcho thats my sister out there and a guy shes married to who i think is pretty terrific five years ago you bastardsi repeat you bastardsdamn near killed them both over in hong kong and points east i dont know all the facts because theyre too decent or too dumb to talk about them but i know enough to know i wouldnt trust you with a waiters payroll in the islands fair enough said holland subdued not that it matters but i wasnt here then it doesnt matter its your subterranean system you would have done the same thing knowing the circumstances i might have so might you if you knew them but that doesnt matter either its history and now is now broke in st jacques what happened in paris this disagreeable incident according to conklin there was an ambush at a private airfield in pontcarré it was aborted your brotherinlaw wasnt hurt and neither was alex thats all i can tell you its all i want to hear i spoke to marie a little while ago shes in marseilles and will be here late tomorrow morning ill meet her myself and well be driven out to chesapeake what about david who my brotherinlaw oh yes of course hes on his way to moscow what the aeroflot jetliner reversed engines and swung off the runway at moscows sheremetyevo airport the pilot taxied down the adjacent exit lane then stopped a quarter of a mile from the terminal as an announcement was made in both russian and french there will be a five to sevenminute delay before disembarkation please remain seated no explanation accompanied the information and those passengers on the flight from paris who were not soviet citizens returned to their reading material assuming the delay was caused by a backup of departing aircraft however those who were citizens as well as a few others familiar with soviet arrival procedures knew better the curtainedoff front section of the huge ilyushin jet a small seating area that was reserved for special unseen passengers was in the process of being evacuated if not totally at least in part the custom was for an elevated platform with a shielded metal staircase to be rolled up to the front exit door several hundred feet away there was always a government limousine and while the backs of those disembarked special passengers were briefly in view on their way to the vehicles flight attendants roamed through the aircraft making sure no cameras were in evidence there never were these travelers were the property of the kgb and for reasons known only to the komitet they were not to be observed in sheremetyevos international terminal it was the case this late afternoon on the outskirts of moscow alex conklin limped out of the shielded staircase followed by bourne who carried the two outsized flight bags that served as their minimum luggage dimitri krupkin emerged from the limousine and hurried toward them as the steps were rolled away from the aircraft and the noise of the huge jet engines began growing in volume how is your friend the doctor asked the soviet intelligence officer shouting to be heard over the roar holding his own yelled alex he may not make it but hes fighting like hell its your own fault aleksei the jet rolled away and krupkin lowered his voice accordingly still loud but not shouting you should have called sergei at the embassy his unit was prepared to escort you wherever you wished to go actually we thought that if we did wed be sending out an alert better a prohibiting alert than inviting an assault countered the russian carloss men would never have dared to attack you under our protection it wasnt the jackalthe jackal said conklin abruptly resuming a conversational tone as the roar of the aircraft became a hum in the distance of course it wasnt himhes here it was his goons following orders not his goons not his orders what are you talking about well go into it later lets get out of here wait krupkin arched his brows well talk firstand first welcome to mother russia second it would be most appreciated if you would refrain from discussing certain aspects of my lifestyle while in the service of my government in the hostile warmongering west with anyone you might meet you know kruppie one of these days theyll catch up with you never they adore me for i feed the komitet more useful gossip about the upper ranks of the debauched socalled free world than any other officer in a foreign post i also entertain my superiors in that same debauched world far better than any other officer anywhere now if we corner the jackal here in moscow ill no doubt be made a member of the politburo hero status then you can really steal why not they all do if you dont mind interrupted bourne curtly lowering the two flight bags to the ground whats happened have you made any progress in dzerzhinsky square its not inconsiderable for less than thirty hours weve narrowed down carloss mole to thirteen possibles all of whom speak french fluently theyre under total surveillance human and electronic we know exactly where they are every minute also who they meet and who they talk to over the telephone im working with two ranking commissars neither of whom can remotely speak frenchthey cant even speak literate russian but thats the way it is sometimes the point is theyre both failsafe and dedicated theyd rather be instrumental in capturing the jackal than refight the nazi theyve been very cooperative in mounting surveillance your surveillance is rotten and you know it said alex they fall over toilet seats in the womens room when theyre chasing a guy not this time for i chose them myself insisted krupkin outside of four of our own people each trained in novgorod theyre defectors from the uk america france and south africaall with intelligence backgrounds who could lose their dachas if they screw up as you westerners say i really would like to be appointed to the presidium perhaps even the central committee i might be posted to washington or new york where you could really steal said conklin youre wicked aleksei very very wicked still after a vodka or six remind me to tell you about some real estate our chargé daffaires picked up in virginia two years ago for a song and financed by his lovers bank in richmond now a developer wants the property at ten times the price come the car i dont believe this conversation said bourne picking up the flight bags welcome to the real world of hightech intelligence explained conklin laughing quietly at least from one point of view from all points of view continued krupkin as they started toward the limousine however we will dispense with this conversation while riding in an official vehicle wont we gentlemen incidentally you have a twobedroom suite at the metropole on the marx prospekt its convenient and ive personally shut down all listening devices i can understand why but how did you manage it embarrassment as you well know is the komitets greatest enemy i explained to internal security that what might be recorded could prove most embarrassing to the wrong people who would undoubtedly transfer any who overheard the tapes to kamchatka they reached the car the left rear door opened by a driver in a dark brown business suit identical with the one worn by sergei in paris the fabrics the same said krupkin in french noting his companions reaction to the similar apparel unfortunately the tailoring is not i insisted sergei have his refitted in the faubourg the hotel metropole is a renovated prerevolutionary structure built in the ornate style of architecture favored by the czar who had visited findesiècle vienna and paris the ceilings are high the marble profuse and the occasional tapestries priceless intrinsic to the elaborate lobby is a defiance aimed at a government that would permit so many shabby citizens to invade the premises the majestic walls and the glittering filigreed chandeliers seem to stare at the unworthy trespassers with disdain these impressions however did not apply to dimitri krupkin whose baronial figure was very much at ease and at home in the surroundings comrade cried the manager sotto voce as the kgb officer accompanied his guests to the elevators there is an urgent message for you he continued walking rapidly up to dimitri and thrusting a folded note into krupkins hand i was told to deliver it to you personally you have done so and i thank you dimitri watched the man walk away then opened the paper as bourne and conklin stood behind him i must reach dzerzhinsky immediately he said turning its the extension of my second commissar come let us hurry the suite like the lobby belonged to another time another era indeed another country marred only by the faded fabrics and the less than perfect restoration of the original moldings these imperfections served to accentuate the distance between the past and the present the doors of the two bedrooms were opposite each other the space between a large sitting room complete with a copper dry bar and several bottles of spirits rarely seen on moscow shelves help yourselves said krupkin heading for a telephone on an ersatz antique desk that appeared to be a cross between queen anne and a later louis oh i forgot aleksei ill order some tea or spring water forget it said conklin taking his flight bag from jason and heading into the left bedroom im going to wash up that plane was filthy i trust you found the fare agreeable responded krupkin raising his voice and dialing incidentally you ingrate youll find your weapons in your bedside table drawers each is a caliber graz burya automatic come mr bourne he added youre not abstemious and it was a long tripthis may be a long conversation my commissar number two is a windy fellow i think i will said jason dropping his bag by the door to the other bedroom he crossed to the bar and chose a familiar bottle pouring himself a drink as krupkin began talking in russian it was not a language he understood so bourne walked to a pair of tall cathedral windows overlooking the wide avenue known as the marx prospekt dobryi dyen da da pochemu sadovaya togda dvadtsat minus krupkin shook his head in weary irritation as he hung up the telephone the movement caused jason to turn toward the soviet my second commissar was not talkative on this occasion mr bourne haste and orders took precedent what do you mean we must leave immediately krupkin glanced at the bedroom to the left and raised his voice aleksei come out here quickly i tried to tell him that youd just this second arrived continued the kgb man turning back to jason but he was having none of it leven went so far as to say that one of you was already taking a shower and his only comment was tell him to get out and get dressed conklin limped through the bedroom door his shirt unbuttoned and blotting his wet face with a towel sorry aleksei we must go go where we just got here weve appropriated a flat on the sadovayathats moscows grand boulevard mr bourne its not the champselysées but neither is it inconsequential the czars knew how to build whats over there pressed conklin commissar number one replied krupkin well be using it as our shall we say our headquarters a smaller and rather delightful annex of dzerzhinsky squareonly nobody knows about it but the five of us somethings come up and were to go there immediately thats good enough for me said jason putting his drink down on the copper dry bar finish it said alex rushing awkwardly back into the bedroom ive got to get the soap out of my eyes and rest rap my lousy boot bourne picked up the glass his eyes straying to the soviet field officer who looked after conklin his brow lined his expression curiously sad you knew him before he lost his foot didnt you asked jason quietly oh yes mr bourne we go back twentyfive twentysix years istanbul athens rome amsterdam he was a remarkable adversary of course we were young then both slender and quick and so taken with ourselves wanting so desperately to live up to the images we envisioned for ourselves it was all so long ago we were both terribly good you know he was actually better than me but dont you ever tell him i said so he always saw the broader picture the longer road than i saw it was the russian in him of course why do you use the word adversary asked jason its so athletic as if youd been playing a game wasnt he your enemy krupkins large head snapped toward bourne his eyes glass not warm at all of course he was my enemy mr bourne and to clarify the picture for you he still is my enemy dont i beg you mistake my indulgences for what they are not a mans weaknesses may intrude on his faith but they do not diminish it i may not have the convenience of the roman confession to expiate my sins so as to go forth and sin again despite my belief but i do believe my grandfathers and grandmothers were hangedhanged sirfor stealing chickens from a romanov princes estate few if any of my ancestors were ever given the privilege of the most rudimentary schooling forget education the supreme soviet revolution of karl marx and vladimir lenin made possible the beginning of all things thousands upon thousands of mistakes have been mademany inexcusable many more brutalbut a beginning was made i myself am both the proof and the error of it im not sure i understand that because you and your feeble intellectuals have never understood what we have understood from the start das kapital mr bourne envisages stages toward a just society economic and political but it does not and never did state what specific form the nutsandbolts government will ultimately be only that it could not be as it was im not a scholar in that department one does not have to be in a hundred years you may be the socialists and with luck well be the capitalists da tell me something said jason hearing as krupkin also did the water faucets in conklins room being turned off could you kill alexaleksei as surely as he could kill mewith deep regretsif the value of the information called for it we are professionals we understand that often reluctantly i cant understand either one of you dont even try mr bourne youre not there yetyoure getting closer but youre not there would you explain that please youre at the cusp jasonmay i call you jason please do youre fifty years of age or thereabouts give or take a year or two correct correct ill be fiftyone in a few months so what aleksei and i are in our sixtieshave you any idea what a leap that is how could i let me tell you you still visualize yourself as the younger man the postadolescent man who sees himself doing the things you did only moments ago in your mind and in many ways you are right the motor controls are there the will is there you are still the master of your body then suddenly as strong as the will is and as strong as the body remains the mind slowly insidiously begins to reject the necessity to make an immediate decisionboth intellectually and physically simply put we care less are we to be condemned or congratulated on having survived i think you just said you couldnt kill alex dont count on it jason bourneor david whoever you are conklin came through the door his limp pronounced wincing in pain lets go he said did you strap it wrong again asked jason do you want me to forget it broke in alex irritably you have to be a contortionist to get the goddamned thing right all the time bourne understood he forgot about any attempt on his part to adjust the prosthesis krupkin again looked at alex with that strange admixture of sadness and curiosity then spoke rapidly the car is parked up the street in the sverdlov its less obvious over there ill have a lobby steward fetch it thanks said conklin gratitude in his glance the opulent apartment on the busy sadovaya was one among many in an aged stone building that like the metropole reflected the grand architectural excesses of the old russian empire the flats were primarily usedand buggedfor visiting dignitaries and the chambermaids doormen and concierges were all frequently questioned by the kgb when not directly employed by the komitet the walls were covered with red velour the sturdy furniture was reminiscent of the ancien régime however to the right of the gargantuan ornate livingroom fireplace was an item that stood out like a decorators nightmare a large jetblack television console complete with an assortment of tape decks compatible with the various sizes of video cassettes the second contradiction to the decor and undoubtedly an affront to the memory of the elegant romanovs was a heavyset man in a rumpled uniform open at the neck and stained with vestiges of recent meals his blunt face was full his grayish hair cut close to his skull and a missing tooth surrounded by discolored companions bespoke an aversion to dentistry it was the face of a peasant the narrow perpetually squinting eyes conveying a peasants shrewd intelligence he was krupkins commissar number one my english not good announced the uniformed man nodding at his visitors but is understanding also for you i have no name no official position call me colonel yes it is below my rank but all americans think all soviets in komitet are colonel da okay i speak russian replied alex if its easier for you use it and ill translate for my colleague hah roared the colonel laughing so krupkin cannot fool you yes yes he cant fool me no is good he talks too fast da even in russian his words come like stray bullets in french also colonel speaking of which intruded dimitri may we get to the issue at hand comrade our associate in the dzerzhinsky said we were to come over immediately da immediate the kgb officer walked to the huge ebony console picked up a remote control and turned to the others i will speak englishis good practice come watch everything is on one cartridge all material taken by men and women krupkin select to follow our people who speak the french people who could not be compromised by the jackal clarified krupkin watch insisted the peasantcolonel pressing a button on the remote control the screen came alive on the console the opening shots crude and choppy most had been taken with handheld video cameras from car windows one scene after another showed specific men walking in the moscow streets or getting into official vehicles driving or being driven throughout the city and in several cases outside the city over country roads in every case the subjects under surveillance met with other men and women whereupon the zoom lenses enlarged the faces a number of shots took place inside buildings the scenes murky and dark the result of insufficient light and awkwardly held concealed cameras that one is expensive whore laughed the colonel as a man in his late sixties escorted a much younger woman into an elevator it is the solnechy hotel on the varshavkoye i will personally check the generals vouchers and find a loyal ally da the choppy crosscutting tape continued as krupkin and the two americans grew weary of the seemingly endless and pointless visual record then suddenly there was an exterior shot of a huge cathedral crowds on the pavement the light indicating early evening st basils cathedral in red square said krupkin its a museum now and a very fine one but every now and then a zealotusually foreignholds a small service no one interferes which of course the zealots want us to do the screen became murky again the vibrating focus briefly and wildly swaying the camcorder had moved inside the cathedral as the agent operating it was jostled by the crowds then it became steady held perhaps against a pillar the focus now was on an elderly man his hair white in contrast to the lightweight black raincoat he was wearing he was walking down a side aisle pensively glancing at the succession of icons and the higher majestic stainedglass windows rodchenko said the peasantcolonel his voice guttural the great rodchenko the man on the screen proceeded into what appeared to be a large stone corner of the cathedral where two thick pedestaled candles threw moving shadows against the walls the video camera jerkily moved upward the agent again perhaps standing on a portable stool or a hastily obtained box the picture grew suddenly more detailed the figures larger as the zoom lens was activated thrusting through the crowds of tourists the whitehaired subject approached another man a priest in priestly garbbalding thin his complexion dark its him cried bourne its carlos then a third man appeared on the screen joining the other two and conklin shouted jesus he roared as all eyes were riveted on the television set hold it there the kgb commissar instantly complied with his remote the picture remained stationary shaky but constant the other one do you recognize him david i know him but i dont know him replied bourne in a low voice as images going back years began filling his inner screen there were explosions white blinding lights with blurred figures running in a jungle and then a man an oriental being shot repeatedly screaming as he was hammered into the trunk of a large tree by an automatic weapon the mists of confusion swelled dissolving into a barrackslike room with soldiers sitting behind a long table a wooden chair on the right a man sitting there fidgeting nervous and without warning jason suddenly knew that manit was himself a younger much younger self and there was another figure in uniform pacing like a caged ferret back and forth in front of the chair savagely berating the man then known as delta one bourne gasped his eyes frozen on the television screen as he realized he was staring at an older version of that angry pacing figure in his minds eye a courtroom in a base camp north of saigon he whispered its ogilvie said conklin his voice distant hollow bryce ogilvie my god they did link up medusa found the jackal it was a trial wasnt it alex said bourne bewildered the words floating hesitant a military trial yes it was agreed conklin but it wasnt your trial you werent the accused i wasnt no you were the one who brought charges a rare thing for any of your group to do then in or out of the field a number of the army people tried to stop you but they couldnt well go into it later discuss it later i want to discuss it now said jason firmly that man is with the jackal right there in front of our eyes i want to know who he is and what he is and why hes here in moscowwith the jackal later now your friend krupkin is helping us which means hes helping marie and me and im grateful for his help the colonel here is also on our side or we wouldnt be seeing whats on that screen at this moment i want to know what happened between that man and me and all of langleys security measures can go to hell the more i know about himnowthe better i know what to ask for what to expect bourne suddenly turned to the soviets for your information theres a period in my life i cant completely remember and thats all you have to know go on alex i have trouble remembering last night said the colonel tell him what he wants to know aleksei it can have no bearing on our interests the saigon chapter is closed as is kabul all right conklin lowered himself into a chair and massaged his right calf he tried to speak casually but the attempt was not wholly successful in december of one of your men was killed during a searchanddestroy patrol it was called an accident of friendly fire but you knew better you knew he was marked by some horseshit artists down south at headquarters they had it in for him he was a cambodian and no saint by any means but he knew all the contraband trails so he was your point just images interrupted bourne all i get are fragments i see but i cant remember the facts arent important anymore theyre buried along with several thousand other questionable events apparently a large narcotics deal went sour in the triangle and your scout was held responsible so a few hotshots in saigon thought a lesson should be taught their gook runners they flew up to your territory went into the grass and took him out like they were a vc advance unit but you saw them from a piece of high ground and blew all your gaskets you tracked them back to the helicopter pad and gave them a choice get in and youd storm the chopper leaving no survivors or they could come back with you to the base camp they came back under your mens guns and you forced field command to accept your multiple charges of murder thats when icecold ogilvie showed up looking after his saigon boys then something happened didnt it something crazyeverything got confused twisted it certainly did bryce got you on the stand and made you look like a maniac a sullen pathological liar and a killer who except for the war and your expertise would be in a maximum security prison he called you everything in the rotten black book and demanded that you reveal your real namewhich you wouldnt do couldnt do because your first wifes cambodian family would have been slaughtered he tried to tie you in verbal knots and failing that threatened the military court with exposing the whole bastard battalion which it also couldnt allow ogilvies thugs got off for lack of credible testimony and after the trial you had to be physically restrained in the barracks until ogilvie was airborne back to saigon his name was kwan soo said bourne dreamily his head moving back and forth as if rejecting a nightmare he was a kid maybe sixteen or seventeen sending the drug money back to three villages so they could eat there wasnt any other way oh shit what would any of us have done if our families were starving that wasnt anything you could say at the trial and you knew it you had to hold your tongue and take ogilvies vicious crap i came up and watched you and i never saw a man exercise such control over his hatred that isnt the way i seem to recall itwhat i can recall some of its coming back not much but some during that trial you adapted to the necessities of your immediate surroundingsyou might say like a chameleon their eyes locked and jason turned back to the television screen and there he is with carlos its a small rotten world isnt it does he know im jason bourne how could he asked conklin getting out of the chair there was no jason bourne then there wasnt even a david only a guerrilla they called delta one no names were used remember i keep forgetting what else is new jason pointed at the screen why is he in moscow why did you say medusa found the jackal why because hes the law firm in new york what bourne whipped his head toward conklin hes the the chairman of the board completed alex interrupting the agency closed in and he got out two days ago why the hell didnt you tell me cried jason angrily because i never thought for a moment wed be standing here looking at that picture on the screen i still cant understand it but i cant deny it either also i saw no reason to bring up a name you might or might not remember a personally very disturbing occurrence you might or might not remember why add an unnecessary complication theres enough stress all right aleksei said an agitated krupkin stepping forward ive heard words and names that evoke certain unpleasant memories for me at any rate and i think it behooves me to ask a question or twospecifically one just who is this ogilvie that concerns you so youve told us who he was in saigon but who is he now why not conklin asked himself quietly hes a new york attorney who heads up an organization thats spread throughout europe and the mediterranean initially by pushing the right buttons in washington they bought up companies through extortion and leveraged buyouts theyve cornered markets and set prices and in the bargain theyve moved into the killing game employing some of the best professionals in the business theres hard evidence that theyve contracted for the murder of various officials in the government and the military the most recent examplewith which youre no doubt familiaris general teagarten supreme commander of nato unbelievable whispered krupkin jeezchrize intoned the peasantcolonel his eyes bulging oh theyre very creative and ogilvies the most inventive of all hes superspider and hes spun a hell of a web from washington through every capital in europe unfortunately for him and thanks to my associate here he was caught like a fly in his own spinning he was about to be pounced on by people in washington he couldnt possibly corrupt but he was tipped off and got out the day before yesterday why he came to moscow i havent the vaguest idea i may be able to answer that for you said krupkin glancing at the kgb colonel and nodding as if to say its all right i know nothingabsolutely nothingabout any such killing as you speak of indeed of any killing whatsoever however you could be describing an american enterprise in europe thats been servicing our interests for years in what way asked alex with all manner of restricted american technology as well as armaments matériel spare parts for aircraft and weapons systemseven the aircraft and the weapons systems them selves on various occasions through the bloc countries i tell you this knowing that you know id vehemently deny ever having said it understood nodded conklin whats the name of this enterprise theres no single name instead there are fifty or sixty companies apparently under one umbrella but with so many different titles and origins its impossible to determine the specific relationships theres a name and ogilvie runs it said alex that crossed my mind said krupkin his eyes suddenly glasscold his expression that of an unrelenting zealot however what appears to disturb you so about your american attorney i can assure you is far far outweighed by our own concerns dimitri turned to the television set and the shakily stationary picture his eyes now filled with anger the soviet intelligence officer on that screen is general rodchenko second in command of the kgb and close adviser to the premier of the soviet union many things may be done in the name of russian interests and without the premiers knowledge but in this day and age not in the areas you describe my god the supreme commander of nato and neverneverusing the services of carlos the jackal these embarrassments are no less than dangerous and frightening catastrophes have you got any suggestions asked conklin a foolish question answered the colonel gruffly arrest then the lubyanka then silence theres a problem with that solution said alex the central intelligence agency knows ogilvies in moscow so where is the problem we rid us both of an unhealthy person and his crimes and go about our business it may seem strange to you but the problem isnt only with the unhealthy person and his crimes even where the soviet union is concerned its with the coverupwhere washingtons concerned the komitet officer looked at krupkin and spoke in russian what is this one talking about its difficult for us to understand answered dimitri in his native language still for them it is a problem let me try to explain whats he saying asked bourne annoyed i think hes about to give a civics lesson us style such lessons more often than not fall on deaf ears in washington interrupted krupkin in english then immediately resuming russian he addressed his kgb superior you see comrade no one in america would blame us for taking advantage of this ogilvies criminal activities they have a proverb they repeat so frequently that it covers oceans of guilt one does not look a gift horse in the mouth what has a horses mouth got to do with gifts from its tail comes manure for the farms from its mouth only spittle it loses something in the translation nevertheless this attorney ogilvie obviously had a great many government connections officials who overlooked his questionable practices for large sums of money practices that entailed millions upon millions of dollars laws were circumvented men killed lies accepted as the truth in essence there was considerable corruption and as we know the americans are obsessed with corruption they even label every progressive accommodation as potentially corrupt and theres nothing older more knowledgeable peoples can do about it they hang out their soiled linen for all the world to see like a badge of honor because it is broke in alex speaking english thats something a lot of people here wouldnt understand because you cover every accommodation you make every crime you commit every mouth you shut with a basket of roses however considering pots and kettles and odious comparisons ill dispense with a lecture im just telling you that ogilvie has to be sent back and all the accounts settled thats the progressive accommodation you have to make im sure well take it under advisement not good enough said conklin lets put it this way beyond accountability theres simply too much knownor will be in a matter of daysabout his enterprise including the connection to teagartens death for you to keep him here not only washington but the entire european community would dump on you talk of embarrassments this is a beaut to say nothing about the effects on trade or your imports and exports youve made your point aleksei interrupted krupkin assuming this accommodation can be made will it be clear that moscow cooperated fully in bringing this american criminal back to american justice we obviously couldnt do it without you as the temporary field officer of record ill swear to it before both intelligence committees of congress if need be and that we had nothingabsolutely nothing to do with the killings you mentioned specifically the assassination of the supreme commander of nato absolutely clear it was one of the major reasons for your cooperation your government was horrified by the assassination krupkin looked hard at alex his voice lower but stronger for it he turned slowly his eyes briefly on the television screen then back to conklin general rodchenko he said what shall we do with general rodchenko what you do with general rodchenko is your business replied alex quietly neither bourne nor i ever heard the name da said krupkin nodding again slowly and what you do with the jackal in soviet territory is your business aleksei however be assured we shall cooperate to the fullest degree how do we begin asked jason impatiently first things first dimitri looked over at the kgb commissar comrade have you understood what weve said enough so krupkin replied the heavyset peasantcolonel walking to a telephone on an inlaid marble table against the wall he picked up the phone and dialed his call was answered immediately it is i said the commissar in russian the third man in tape seven with rodchenko and the priest the one new york identified as the american named ogilvie as of now he is to be placed under our surveillance and he is not to leave moscow the colonel suddenly arched his thick brows his face growing red that order is countermanded he is no longer the responsibility of diplomatic relations he is now the sole property of the kgb a reason use your skull potato head tell them we are convinced he is an american double agent whom those fools did not uncover then the usual garbage harboring enemies of the state due to laxness their exalted positions once again protected by the komitetthat sort of thing also you might mention that they should not look a gift horse in the mouth i dont understand any more than you do comrade but those butterflies over there in their tightfitting suits probably will alert the airports the commissar hung up he did it said conklin turning to bourne ogilvie stays in moscow i dont give a goddamn about ogilvie exploded jason his voice intense his jaw pulsating im here for carlos the priest asked the colonel walking away from the table thats exactly who i mean is simple we put general rodchenko on a very long rope that he cannot see or feel you will be at the other end he will meet his jackal priest again thats all i ask said jason bourne general grigorie rodchenko sat at a window table in the lastochka restaurant by the krymsky bridge on the moskva river it was his favorite place for a midnight dinner the lights on the bridge and on the slowmoving boats in the water were relaxing to the eye and therefore to the metabolism he needed the calming atmosphere for during the past two days things had been so unsettling had he been right or had he been wrong had his instincts been correct or far off the mark he could not know at the moment but those same instincts had enabled him to survive the mad stalin as a youth the blustering khrushchev in middle age and the inept brezhnev a few years later now there was yet a new russia under gorbachev a new soviet union in fact and his old age welcomed it perhaps things would relax a bit and longstanding enmities fade into a once hostile horizon still horizons did not really change they were always horizons distant flat fired with color or darkness but still distant flat and unreachable he was a survivor rodchenko understood that and a survivor protected himself on as many points of the compass as he could read he also insinuated himself into as many degrees of that compass as possible therefore he had labored diligently to become a trusted mouth to the chairman he was an expert at gathering information for the komitet he was the initial conduit to the american enterprise known to him alone in moscow as medusa through which extraordinary shipments had been made throughout russia and the bloc nations on the other hand he was also a liaison to the monseigneur in paris carlos the jackal whom he had either persuaded or bought off from contracts that might point to the soviet union he had been the ultimate bureaucrat working behind the scenes on the international stage seeking neither applause nor celebrity merely survival then why had he done what he did was it mere impetuousness born of weariness and fear and the sense of a plagueonbothyourhouses no it was a logical extension of events consistent with the needs of his country and above all the absolute necessity that moscow disassociate itself from both medusa and the jackal according to the consul general in new york bryce ogilvie was finished in america the consuls suggestion was to find him asylum somewhere and in exchange gradually absorb his myriad assets in europe what worried the consul general in new york was not ogilvies financial manipulations that broke more laws than there were courts to prosecute but rather the killings which as far as the consul could determine were widespread and included the murder of high us government officials and unless he was grossly mistaken the assassination of the supreme commander of nato compounding this chain of horrors was new yorks opinion that in order to save a number of his companies from confiscation ogilvie might have ordered additional killings in europe primarily of those few powerful executives in various firms who understood the complex international linkages that led back to a great law firm and the unspoken code name medusa should those contracted murders take place while ogilvie was in moscow questions might arise that moscow could not tolerate therefore get him in and out of the soviet union as fast as possible a recommendation more easily made than accomplished suddenly rodchenko reflected into this danse macabre had come the paranoid monseigneur from paris it was imperative they meet immediately carlos had fairly screamed his demand over the arranged public telephone communication they employed but every precaution had to be taken the jackal as always demanded a public place with crowds and numerous available exits where he could circle like a hawk never showing himself until his professional eyes were satisfied two calls later from two different locations the rendezvous was set st basils cathedral in red square during the height of the early evenings summer tourist onslaught in a darkened corner to the right of the altar where there were outside exits through the curtained walkways to the sacristy done then during that third telephone call like a crack of thunder over the black sea grigorie rodchenko was struck by an idea so dramatically bold yet so patently obvious and simple that he had momentarily lost his breath it was the solution that would totally distance the soviet government from any involvement or complicity with either the jackal or medusas ogilvie should such distance be necessary in the eyes of the civilized world quite simply unknown to each other bring the jackal and ogilvie together if only for an instant just long enough to get photographic evidence of their being seen within the same frame it was all that was needed he had gone to diplomatic relations yesterday afternoon having requested a short routine meeting with ogilvie during the extremely innocuous and very friendly conference rodchenko had waited for his openingan opening he had engineered with precision having done his research you spend summers on cape cod da the general had said for me its weekends mainly my wife and the children are there for the season when i was posted in washington i had two great american friends on cape cod i spent several lovely as you say weekends with them perhaps you know my friends the frostshardleigh and carol frost of course i do like myself hes an attorney specializes in maritime law they live down the shore road in dennis a very attractive lady the frost woman very da did you ever attempt to recruit her husband for your firm no he has his own frost goldfarb and oshaunessy they cover the waterfront as it were in massachusetts i feel i almost know you mr ogilvie if only through mutual friends im sorry we never met at the cape well perhaps i can take advantage of our near meetingthrough mutual friendsand ask of you a favor far less than the convenience i understand my government willingly affords you ive been given to understand the convenience is mutual said ogilvie ahh i know nothing of such diplomatic matters but it is conceivable that i could intervene on your behalf if you would cooperate with uswith my small although not insignificant department what is it there is a priest a socially oriented militant priest who claims to be a marxist agitator well known to the courts of new york city he arrived only hours ago and demands a clandestine meeting only hours from now there is simply no time to verify his claims but as he insists he has a history of legal persecutions in the courts of new york as well as many photographs in the newspapers you might recognize him i probably could if he is who he says he is da and one way or another we will certainly let it be known how you cooperated with us it had been arranged ogilvie would be in the crowds at st basils cathedral close to the meeting ground when he saw rodchenko approach a priest in the far corner to the right of the altar he was to come across the kgb general casually as if surprised their greeting would be brief to the point of discourtesy so rapid and blurred as to be meaningless the sort of encounter civilized but hostile acquaintances cannot avoid when they run into one another in a public place close proximity was also required as the light was so dim and so cluttered with shadows that the attorney might not get a good look at the priest ogilvie had performed with the expertise of an accomplished trial lawyer verbally trapping a prosecutions witness with an objectionable inquiry and then shouting i withdraw the question leaving the prosecutor speechless the jackal had instantly turned away furiously but not before an obese elderly female using a miniature camera that was the handle of her purse had snapped a series of automatically advanced photographs with ultra highspeed film that evidence was now in a vault in rodchenkos office the file was titled surveillance of the american male b ogilvie on the page below the photograph showing the assassin and the american attorney together was the following subject with as yet unidentified contact during covert meeting at st basils cathedral meeting covered eleven minutes and thirtytwo seconds photographs sent to paris for any possible verification it is believed that the unidentified contact may be carlos the jackal needless to say paris was working up a reply that included several photographic composites from the deuxième bureau and the sûreté the answer confirmed definitely the jackal how shocking and on soviet soil the assassin on the other hand had proved to be less accommodating after the brief awkward confrontation with the american carlos had resumed his icecold inquisition his burning savage self just below the frozen surface theyre closing in on you said the jackal who is the komitet i am the komitet perhaps youre mistaken nothing goes on in the kgb without my knowledge where did you get this information paris krupkins the source krupkin will do anything to further himself including the spreading of false information even where i am concerned hes an enigmaone moment an efficient multilingual intelligence officer the next a gossiping clown in french feathers still again a pimp for traveling ministers he cant be taken seriously not where serious matters are concerned i hope youre right ill reach you tomorrow late in the evening will you be at home not for a phone call from you ill dine alone at the lastochka a late supper what will you be doing tomorrow making certain you are right the jackal had disappeared into the crowds of the cathedral that was over twentyfour hours ago and rodchenko had heard nothing to upset the schedule perhaps the psychopath had returned to paris somehow convinced that his paranoid suspicions were groundless his need to keep moving racing flying all over europe superseding his momentary panic who knew carlos too was an enigma part of him was a retarded sadist a savant perhaps in the darkest methods of cruelty and killing yet another part revealed a sick twisted romantic a braindamaged adolescent reaching for a vision that wanted nothing to do with him who knew the time was approaching when a bullet in his head was the answer rodchenko raised his hand for the waiter he would order coffee and brandythe decent french brandy reserved for the true heroes of the revolution especially the survivors instead of the waiter the manager of lastochka came rushing to the table carrying a telephone there is an urgent call for you general said the man in the loosefitting black suit placing the phone on the table and holding out the plastic knob of the extension cord that was to be placed into the walled receptacle thank you the manager left and rodchenko inserted the device yes youre being watched wherever you go said the voice of the jackal by whom your own people i dont believe you ive been watching all day would you like me to describe the places youve been for the past thirty hours starting with drinks at a café on the kalinin a kiosk in the arbat the slavyanky for lunch an afternoon walk along the luznekaya stop it where are you come outside the lastochka slowly casually ill prove it to you the line went dead rodchenko hung up and signaled the waiter for his check the aproned mans instant response was due less to the generals status than to the fact that he was the last diner in the restaurant leaving his money on top of the bill the old soldier said good night walked through the dimly lit foyer to the entrance and let himself out it was nearly in the morning and except for a few stragglers with too much vodka in them the street was deserted in moments an upright figure silhouetted in the wash of a streetlamp emerged from a storefront perhaps thirty meters away on the right it was the jackal still in the black cloth and the white collar of a priest he beckoned the general to join him as he walked slowly to a dark brown car parked directly across the street rodchenko caught up with the assassin now standing on the curb side of the vehicle which faced the direction of the lastochka restaurant suddenly the jackal snapped on a flashlight its powerful beam shooting through the open window of the car the old soldier momentarily stopped breathing his heavylidded eyes scanning the horrible scene in front of him across the seat the kgb agent behind the wheel was arched back his throat cut a river of blood drenching his clothes immediately beyond the window was the second surveillance his wrists and feet bound by wire a thick rope strapped around his face yanked taut against his gaping mouth gagging him permitting only a rattling gasping cough he was alive his eyes wide in terror the driver was trained at novgorod said the general no comment in his voice i know replied carlos i have his papers that trainings not what it was comrade this other one is krupkins liaison here in moscow the son of a good friend im told hes mine now what are you going to do asked rodchenko staring at the jackal correct a mistake answered carlos as he raised his gun the silencer in place and fired three bullets into the generals throat the night sky was angry the storm clouds over moscow swirling colliding promising rain and thunder and lightning the brown sedan sped down the country road racing past overgrown fields the driver maniacally gripping the wheel and sporadically glancing at his bound prisoner a young man who kept straining at his wirebound hands and feet his ropestrapped face causing him enormous pain attested to by his constant grimace and his bulging frightened eyes in the rear seat the upholstery covered with blood were the corpses of general grigorie rodchenko and the kgb novgorod graduate who headed the old soldiers surveillance team suddenly without slowing down the car or giving any indication of his action the jackal saw what he was looking for and swerved off the road tires shrieking in the sidewinding turn the sedan plunged into a field of tall grass and in seconds came to a shatteringly abrupt stop the bodies in the rear crashing into the back of the front seat carlos opened his door and lurched outside he proceeded to yank the blooddrenched corpses from their upholstered crypts and dragged them into the high grass leaving the general partially on top of the komitet officer their life fluids now mingling as they soiled the ground he returned to the car and brutally pulled the young kgb agent out of the front seat with one hand the glistening blade of a hunting knife in his other we have a lot to talk about you and i said the jackal in russian and you would be foolish to withhold anything you wont youre too soft too young carlos whipped the man to the ground the tall grass bending under the fall he withdrew his flashlight and knelt beside his captive the knife going toward the agents eyes the bloodied lifeless figure below had spoken his last words and they were words that reverberated like kettledrums in the ears of ilich ramirez sanchez jason bourne was in moscow it had to be bourne for the terrified youthful kgb surveillant had blurted out the information in a gushing panicked stream of phrases and half phrases saying anything and everything that might possibly save his life comrade krupkintwo americans one tall the other with a limp we took them to the hotel then to the sadovaya for a conference krupkin and the hated bourne had turned his people in parisin paris his impenetrable armed campand had traced him to moscow how who it did not matter now all that mattered was that the chameleon himself was at the metropole the traitors in paris could wait at the metropole his enemy of enemies was barely an hour away back in moscow no doubt sleeping the night away without any idea that carlos the jackal knew he was there the assassin felt the exhilaration of triumphover life and death the doctors said he was dying but doctors were as often wrong as they were right and at this moment they were wrong the death of jason bourne would renew his life however the hour was not right three oclock in the morning was not the time to be seen prowling the streets or the hotels in search of a kill in moscow a city in the grip of permanent suspicion darkness itself contributing to its wariness it was common knowledge that the nightfloor stewards in the major hotels were armed selected as much for their marksmanship as for their aptitude for service daylight brought a relaxation of the nights concerns the bustling activity of the early morning was the time to strikeand strike he would but the hour was right for another kind of strike at least the prelude to it the time had come to call together his disciples in the soviet government and let them know the monseigneur had arrived that their personal messiah was here to set them free before leaving paris he had collected the dossiers and the dossiers behind those dossiers all seemingly innocuous pages of blank paper in file folders until they were exposed to infrared light the heat waves bringing up the typewritten script he had selected a small deserted store in the vavilova for his meeting ground he would reach each of his people by public telephone and instruct them to be there by all taking back streets and alleyways to the rendezvous by his task would be finished each disciple armed with the information that would elevate himand herto the highest ranks of moscows elite it was one more invisible army far smaller than paris but equally effective and as dedicated to carlos the unseen monseigneur who made life infinitely more comfortable for his converts and by the mighty jackal would be in place at the metropole ready for the early movements of awakening guests the time for the rushing trays and tables of roomservice waiters and the hectic confusion of a lobby alive with chatter anxiety and bureaucracy it was at the metropole where he would be ready for jason bourne one by one like wary stragglers in the early light the five men and three women arrived at the rundown entrance of the abandoned store in the back street known only as the vavilova their caution was understandable it was a district to be avoided although not necessarily because of unsavory inhabitants for the moscow police were ruthlessly thorough in such areas but because of the stretch of decrepit buildings the area was in the process of renovation however like similar projects in urban blights the world over the progress had two speeds slow and stop the only constant which was at best a dangerous convenience was the existence of electricity and carlos used it to his advantage he stood at the far end of the bare concrete room a lamp on the floor behind him silhouetting him leaving his features undefined and further obscured by the upturned collar of his black suit to his right was a wreck of a low wooden table with file folders spread across the top and to his left under a pile of newspapers unseen by his disciples was a cutdown type ak assault weapon a fortyround magazine was inserted a second magazine in the jackals belt the only reason for the weapon was the normal custom of his trade he expected no difficulty whatsoever only adoration he surveyed his audience noting that all eight kept glancing furtively at one another no one talked the dank air in the eerily lit abandoned store was tense with apprehension carlos understood that he had to dispel that fear that furtiveness as rapidly as possible which was why he had gathered eight distressed chairs from the various deserted office rooms in the rear of the store seated people were less tense it was a truism however none of the chairs was being used thank you for coming here this morning said the jackal in russian raising his voice please each of you take a chair and sit down our discussion will not be long but will require the utmost concentration would the comrade nearest the door close it please everyone is here the old heavy door was creaked shut by a stiffly walking bureaucrat as the rest reached for chairs each distancing his and hers from others that were nearby carlos waited until the scraping sounds of wood against cement subsided and all were seated then like a practiced oratoractor the jackal paused before formally addressing his captive audience he looked briefly at each person with his penetrating dark eyes as if conveying to each that he or she was special to him there were short successive hand movements mostly female as those he gazed at in turn smoothed their respective garments the clothes they wore were characteristic of the ranks of upperlevel government officialsin the main drab and conservative but well pressed and spotless i am the monseigneur from paris began the assassin in priestly garb i am he who has spent several years seeking each of you outwith the assistance of comrades here in moscow and beyondand sent you large sums of money asking only that you silently await my arrival and render me the loyalty i have shown to you by your faces i can anticipate your questions so let me amplify years ago i was among the elite few selected to be trained at novgorod there was a quiet yet audible reaction from the chosen eight the myth of novgorod matched its reality it was indeed an advanced indoctrination center for the most gifted of comradesas they were given to understand yet none really understood for novgorod was rarely spoken about except in whispers with several nods carlos acknowledged the impact of his revelation and continued the years since have been spent in many foreign countries promoting the interests of the great soviet revolution an undercover commissar with a flexible portfolio that called for many trips back here to moscow and extensive research into the specific departments in which each of you holds a responsible position again the jackal paused then spoke suddenly sharply positions of responsibility but without the authority that should be yours your abilities are undervalued and underrewarded for there is deadwood above you the small crowds reaction was now somewhat more audible definitely less constrained compared to similar departments in the governments of our adversaries went on carlos we here in moscow have lagged far behind when we should be ahead and we are behind because your talents have been suppressed by entrenched officeholders who care more for their office privileges than they do for the functions of their departments the response was immediate even electric with the three women openly if softly applauding it is for that reason these reasons that i and my associate comrades here in moscow have sought you out further it is why i have sent you fundsto be used totally at your discretionfor the money youve received is the approximate value of the privileges your superiors enjoy why should you not receive them and enjoy them as they do the rumble of why not and hes right rippled through the audience now actually looking at one another eyes locked and heads nodding firmly the jackal then began to reel off the eight major departments in question and as each was named successively there was an enthusiastic nodding of heads the ministries of transport information finance importexport legal procedures military supply scientific research and hardly the least presidium appointments these are your domains but you have been cut out from all final decisions that is no longer acceptablechanges must be made the assembled listeners rose almost as one no longer strangers but instead people united in a cause then one the obviously cautious bureaucrat who had closed the door spoke you appear to know our situations well sir but what can change them these announced carlos gesturing dramatically at the file folders spread out across the low table slowly the small group sat down singly and in couples looking at one another when not staring at the folders on this table are secretly gathered confidential dossiers of your superiors in each of the departments represented here they contain such injurious information that when presented by you individually will guarantee your immediate promotions and in several cases your succession to those high offices your superiors will have no choice for these files are daggers aimed at their throatsexposure would result in disgrace and execution sir a middleaged woman in a neat but nondescript plain blue dress cautiously stood up her blondgray hair was swept back into a stern bun she touched it briefly selfconsciously as she spoke i evaluate personnel files on a daily basis and frequently discover errors how can you be certain these dossiers are accurate for if they are not accurate we could be placed in extremely dangerous situations is that not so that you should even question their accuracy is an affront madame replied the jackal coldly i am the monseigneur from paris i have accurately described your individual situations and accurately depicted the inferiority of your superiors further and at great expense and risk to myself and my associates here in moscow i have covertly funneled monies to you so as to make your lives more comfortable speaking for myself interrupted a gaunt man wearing glasses and a brown business suit i appreciate the moneyi assigned mine to our collective fund and expect a moderate returnbut does one have anything to do with the other i am with the ministry of finance of course and having admitted that i absolve myself of complicity for being clear about my status whatever that means accountant youre about as clear as your paralyzed ministry interrupted an obese man in a black suit too small for his girth you also cast doubt on your ability to recognize a decent return naturally im with military supply and you consistently shortchange us as you do constantly with scientific research exclaimed a short tweedy professorial member of the audience the irregularity of his clipped beard due no doubt to poor vision despite the thick spectacles bridging his nose returns indeed what about allocations more than sufficient for your gradeschool scientists the money is better spent stealing from the west stop it cried the priestassassin raising his arms like a messiah we are not here to discuss interdepartmental conflicts for they will all be resolved with the emergence of our new elite remember i am the monseigneur from paris and together we will bring about a new cleansed order for our great revolution complacency is over it is a thrilling concept sir said a second woman a female in her early thirties her skirt expensively pleated her compact features obviously recognized by the others as a popular newscaster on television however may we return to the issue of accuracy it is settled said the darkeyed carlos staring in turn at each person how else would i know all about you i do not doubt you sir continued the newscaster but as a journalist i must always seek a second source of verification unless the ministry determines otherwise since you are not with the ministry of information sir and knowing that whatever you say will remain confidential can you give us a secondary source am i to be hounded by manipulated journalists when i speak the truth the assassin caught his breath in anger everything ive told you is the truth and you know it so were the crimes of stalin sir and they were buried along with twenty million corpses for thirty years you want proof journalist ill give you proof i have the eyes and the ears of the leaders of the kgbnamely the great general grigorie rodchenko himself he is my eyes and my ears and if you care to know a harsher truth he is beholden to me for i am his monseigneur from paris as well there was a rustling among the captive audience a collective hesitancy a wave of quiet throat clearing the television newscaster spoke again now softly her wide brown eyes riveted on the man in priests clothes you may be whatever you say you are sir she began but you do not listen to radio moscows allnight station it was reported over an hour ago that general rodchenko was shot to death this morning by foreign criminals it was also reported that all high officers of the komitet have been called into an emergency session to evaluate the circumstances of the generals murder the speculation is that there had to be extraordinary reasons for a man of general rodchenkos experience to be lured into a trap by these foreign criminals they will tear apart his files added the cautious bureaucrat stiffly getting to his feet they will put everything under a kgb microscope searching for those extraordinary reasons the circumspect public official looked at the killer in priests clothes perhaps they will find you sir and your dossiers no said the jackal perspiration breaking out on his high forehead no that is impossible i have the only copies of these dossiersthere are no others if you believe that priest said the obese man from the ministry of military supply you do not know the komitet know it cried carlos a tremor developing in his left hand i have its soul no secrets are kept from me for i am the repository of all secrets i have volumes on governments everywhere on their leaders their generals their highest officialsi have sources all over the world you dont have rodchenko anymore continued the blacksuited man from military supply he too getting out of his chair and come to think of it you werent even surprised what for most of us perhaps all of us the first thing we do upon rising in the morning is to turn on our radios its always the same foolishness and i suppose theres comfort in that but id guess most of us knew about rodchenkos death but you didnt priest and when our television lady told you you werent astonished you werent shockedas i say you werent even surprised certainly i was shouted the jackal what you dont understand is that i have extraordinary control its why im trusted needed by the leaders of world marxism thats not even fashionable mumbled the middleaged grayishblond woman whose expertise was in personnel files she also stood up what are you saying carloss voice was now a harsh condemning whisper rising rapidly in intensity and volume i am the monseigneur from paris i have made your lives comfortable far beyond your miserable expectations and now you question me how would i know the things i knowhow could i have poured my concentration and my resources into you here in this room if i were not among the most privileged in moscow remember who i am but we dont know who you are said another man rising like the other males his clothes were neat somber and well pressed but there was a difference in that they were better tailored as though he took considerable pains with his appearance his face too was different it was paler than the others and his eyes were more intense more focused somehow giving the impression that when he spoke he weighed his words with great care beyond the clerical title youve appropriated we have no knowledge as to your identity and you obviously do not care to reveal it as to what you know youve recounted blatant weaknesses and subsequent injustices in our departmental systems but they are rampant throughout the ministries you might as well have picked a dozen others like us from a dozen other divisions and i dare say the complaints would have been the same nothing new there how dare you screamed carlos the jackal the veins in his neck pronounced who are you to say such things to me i am the monseigneur from paris a true son of the revolution and i am a judge advocate in the ministry of legal procedures comrade monseigneur and a much younger product of that revolution i may not know the heads of the kgb who you claim are your minions but i know the penalties for taking the legal processes in our own hands and personallysecretlyconfronting our superiors rather than reporting directly to the bureau of irregularities they are penalties id rather not face without far more thorough evidentiary materials than unsolicited dossiers from unknown sources conceivably invented by discontented officials below even our levels frankly i dont care to see them for i will not be compromised by gratuitous pretrial testimony that can be injurious to my position you are an insignificant lawyer roared the assassin in priests clothing now repeatedly clenching his hands into fists his eyes becoming bloodshot you are all twisters of the truth you are sworn companions of the prevailing winds of convenience nicely said said the attorney from legal procedures smiling except comrade you stole the phrase from the english blackstone i will not tolerate your insufferable insolence you dont have to comrade priest for i intend to leave and my legal advice to all here in this room is to do the same you dare i certainly do replied the soviet attorney granting himself a moment of humor as he looked around the gathering and grinned i might have to prosecute myself and im far too good at my job the money shrieked the jackal ive sent you all thousands where is it recorded asked the lawyer with an air of innocence you yourself made sure it was untraceable paper bags in our mail slots or in our office drawersnotes attached instructing us to burn them who among our citizens would admit to having placed them there that way lies the lubyanka goodbye comrade monseigneur said the attorney for the ministry of legal procedures scraping his chair in place and starting for the door one by one as they had arrived the assembled group followed the lawyer each looking back at the strange man who had so exotically so briefly interrupted their tedious lives all knowing instinctively that in his path were disgrace and execution death yet none was prepared for what followed the killer in priests clothing suddenly snapped visceral bolts of lightning electrified his madness his dark eyes burned with a raging fire that could be extinguished only by soulsatisfying violencerelentless brutal savage vengeance for all the wrongs done to his pure purpose to kill the unbelievers the jackal swept away the dossiers from the table and lurched down to the pile of newspapers he grabbed the deadly automatic weapon from beneath the scattered pages and roared stop all of you none did and the outer regions of psychopathic energy became the order of the moment the killer squeezed the trigger repeatedly and men and women died amid screams from the shattered bodies nearest the door the assassin raced outside leaping over the corpses his assault rifle on automatic fire cutting down the figures in the street screaming curses condemning the unbelievers to a hell only he could imagine traitors filth garbage screamed the crazed jackal as he leaped over the dead bodies racing to the car he had commandeered from the komitet and its inadequate surveillance unit the night had ended the morning had begun the metropoles telephone did not ring it erupted startled alex conklin snapped open his eyes instantly shaking the sleep from his head as he clawed for the strident instrument on the bedside table yes he announced wondering briefly if he was speaking into the conically shaped mouthpiece or into the receiver aleksei stay put admit no one into your rooms and have your weapons ready krupkin what the hell are you talking about a crazed dog is loose in moscow carlos hes gone completely mad he killed rodchenko and butchered the two agents who were following him a farmer found their bodies around four oclock this morningit seems the dogs woke him up with their barking downwind of the blood scents i imagine christ hes gone over the edge but why do you think one of our agents was tortured before being killed broke in the kgb officer fully anticipating alexs question he was our driver from the airport a protégé of mine and the son of a classmate i roomed with at the university a fine young man from a rational family but not trained for what he was put through youre saying you think he may have told carlos about us arent you yes theres more however approximately an hour ago in the vavilova eight people were cut down by automatic fire they were slaughtered it was a massacre one of the dying a woman with the ministry of information a direktor second class and a television journalist said the killer was a priest from paris who called himself the monseigneur jesus exploded conklin whipping his legs over the edge of the bed absently staring at the stump of flesh where once there had been a foot it was his cadre so called and past tense said krupkin if you remember i told you such recruits would abandon him at the first sign of peril ill get jason aleksei listen to me what conklin cupped the telephone under his chin as he reached down for the hollowedout prosthetic boot weve formed a tactical assault squad men and women in civilian clothestheyre being given instructions now and will be there shortly good move but we have purposely not alerted the hotel staff or the police youd be idiots if you did broke in alex well settle for taking the son of a bitch here wed never do it with uniforms prowling around or clerks in hysterics the jackal has eyes in his kneecaps do as i say ordered the soviet admit no one stay away from the windows and take all precautions naturally what do you mean the windows hell need time to find out where we are to question the maids the stewards forgive me old friend interrupted krupkin but an angelic priest inquiring at the desk about two americans one with a pronounced limp during the early morning rush in the lobby good point even if youre paranoid youre on a high floor and directly across the marx prospekt is the roof of an office building you also think pretty fast certainly faster than that fool in dzerzhinsky i would have reached you long before now but my commissar kartoshki over there didnt call me until two minutes ago ill wake up bourne be careful conklin did not hear the soviets final admonition instead he swiftly replaced the telephone and pulled on his boot carelessly lashing the velcro straps around his calf he then opened the bedside table drawer and took out the graz burya automatic a specially designed kgb weapon with three clips of ammunition the graz as it was commonly known was unique insofar as it was the only automatic known that would accept a silencer the cylindrical instrument had rolled to the front of the drawer he removed it and spun it into the short barrel unsteadily he got into his trousers shoved the weapon into his belt and crossed to the door he opened it and limped out only to find jason fully dressed standing in front of a window in the ornate victorian sitting room that had to be krupkin said bourne it was get away from the window carlos bourne instantly stepped back and turned to alex he knows were in moscow he asked then added he knows where we are the odds are yes to both questions in short concise statements conklin related krupkins information does all this tell you something asked alex when he had finished hes blown apart answered jason quietly it had to happen the time bomb in his head finally went off thats what i think his moscow cadre turned out to be a myth they probably told him to pound sand and he exploded i regret the loss of life and i mean that said bourne i wish it could have happened another way but i cant regret his state of mind whats happened to him is what he wanted for meto crack wide open kruppie said it added conklin hes got a psychopathic death wish to return to the people who first found out he was a maniac now if he knows youre here and we have to assume that he does the obsessions compounded your death replacing hisgiving him some kind of symbolic triumph maybe youve been talking to panov too much i wonder how mo is dont i called the hospital at three oclock this morningfive oclock paris time he may lose the use of his left arm and suffer partial paralysis of his right leg but they think hell make it now i dont give a goddamn about his arms or his legs what about his head apparently its intact the chief nurse on the floor said that for a doctor hes a terrible patient thank christ i thought you were an agnostic its a symbolic phrase check with mo bourne noticed the gun in alexs belt he gestured at the weapon thats a little obvious isnt it for whom room service replied jason i phoned for whatever gruel theyve got and a large pot of coffee no way krupkin said we dont let anyone in here and i gave him my word thats a crock of paranoia almost my words but this is his turf not ours just like the windows wait a minute exclaimed bourne suppose he is right unlikely but possible except that conklin could not finish his statement jason reached under the right rear flap of his jacket yanked out his own graz burya and started for the hallway door of the suite what are you doing cried alex probably giving your friend kruppie more credit than he deserves but its worth a try get over there ordered bourne pointing to the far left corner of the room ill leave the door unlocked and when the steward gets here tell him to come inin russian what about you theres an ice machine down the hall it doesnt work but its in a cubicle along with a pepsi machine that doesnt work either but ill slip inside thank god for capitalists no matter how misguided go on the medusan once known as delta unlatched the door opened it glanced up and down the metropoles corridor and rushed outside he raced down the hallway to the cutout alcove that housed the two convenience machines and crouched by the right interior wall he waited his knees and legs achingpains he never felt only years agoand then he heard the sounds of rolling wheels they grew louder and louder as the cart draped with a tablecloth passed and proceeded to the door of the suite he studied the floor steward he was a young man in his twenties blond short of stature and with the posture of an obsequious servant cautiously he knocked on the door no carlos he thought bourne getting painfully to his feet he could hear conklins muffled voice telling the steward to enter and as the young man opened the door shoving the table inside jason calmly inserted his weapon into its concealed place he bent over and massaged his right calf he could feel the swelling cluster of a muscle cramp it happened with the impact of a single furious wave against a shoal of rock a figure in black lurched out of an unseen recess in the corridor racing past the machines bourne spun back into the wall it was the jackal madness at full force carlos slammed his right shoulder into the blondhaired waiter propelling the young man across the hallway and crashing the roomservice table over on its side dishes and food splattered the walls and the carpeted floor suddenly the waiter lunged to his left spinning in midair as astonishingly he yanked a weapon from his belt the jackal either sensed or caught the movement in the corner of his eye he whipped around his automatic weapon on rapid fire savagely pinning the blond russian into the wall bullets puncturing the waiters head and torso at that prolonged horrible moment the enlarged sight line on the barrel of bournes graz burya caught in the waistline of his trousers he tore the fabric as the eyes of carlos swept up centering on his own fury and triumph in the assassins stare jason ripped the gun loose spinning crouching back into the wall of the small alcove as the jackals fusillade blew apart the gaudy paneling of the softdrink machine and tore into the sheets of heavy plastic that fronted the brokendown ice maker on his stomach bourne surged across the opening the graz burya raised and firing as fast as he could squeeze the trigger simultaneously there were other gunshots not those of a machine pistol alex was firing from inside the suite they had carlos in their cross fire it was possibleit could all end in a hotel corridor in moscow let it happen let it happen the jackal roared it was a defiant shriek at having been hit bourne lunged back across the opening pivoting once again into the wall momentarily distracted by the sounds of a now functioning ice machine again he crouched inching his face toward the corner of the archway when the murderous insanity in the hallway erupted into the fever pitch of close combat like an enraged caged animal the wounded carlos kept spinning around in place continuous bursts from his weapon exploding as if he were firing through unseen walls that were closing in on him two piercing hysterical screams came from the far end of the hallway one male one female a couple had been wounded or killed in the panicked fusillade of stray bullets get down conklins scream from across the corridor was an instant command for what jason could not know take cover grab the fucking walls bourne did as he was told under standing only that the order meant he was to shove himself into as small a place as possible protecting his head as much as possible the corner he lunged as the first explosion rocked the wallssomewhereand then a second this much nearer far more thunderous in the hallway itself grenades smoke mingled with falling plaster and shattered glass gunshots nine one after anothera graz burya automatic alex jason spun up and away from the corner of the recess and lurched for the opening conklin stood outside the door of their suite in front of the upturned roomservice table he snapped out his empty clip and furiously searched his trousers pockets i havent got one he shouted angrily referring to the extra clips of ammunition supplied by krupkin he ran around the corner into the other corridor and i dont have any goddamned shells i do and im a lot faster than you said jason removing his spent magazine and inserting a fresh clip from his pocket get back in there and call the lobby tell them to clear it krupkin said i dont give a damn what he said tell them to shut down the elevators barricade all staircase exits and stay the hell away from this floor i see what you mean do it bourne raced down the hallway wincing as he approached the couple who lay on the carpet each moved groaning their clothes were spotted with blood but they moved he turned and yelled to alex who was limping around the roomservice table get help up here he ordered pointing at an exit door directly down the corridor theyre alive use that exit and only that one the hunt began compounded and impeded by the fact that the word had been spread throughout these adjacent wings of the metropoles tenth floor it took no imagination to realize that behind the closed doors along both sides of the hallways panicked calls were being made to the front desk as the sound of nearby gunfire echoed throughout the corridors krupkins strategy for a kgb assault team in civilian clothes had been nullified by the first burst from the jackals weapon where was he there was another exit door at the far end of the long hallway jason had entered but there were perhaps fifteen to eighteen guestroom doors lining that hallway carlos was no fool and a wounded carlos would call upon every tactic he could summon from a long life of violence and survival to survive if only long enough to achieve the kill he wanted more than life itself bourne suddenly realized how accurate his analysis was for he was describing himself what had old fontaine said on tranquility isle in that faraway storeroom from which they had stared down at the procession of priests knowing that one had been bought by the jackal two aging lions stalking each other not caring whos killed in the cross firethose had been fontaines words a man who had sacrificed his life for another he barely knew because his own life was over for the woman he loved was gone as jason started cautiously silently down the hall toward the first door on the left he wondered if he could do the same he wanted desperately to livewith marie and their childrenbut if she was gone if they were gone would life really matter could he throw it away if he recognized something in another man that reflected something in himself no time meditate on your own time david webb i have no use for you you weak soft son of a bitch get away from me i have to flush out a bird of prey ive wanted for thirteen years his claws are razorsharp and hes killed too often too many and now he wants to kill my ownyour own get away from me bloodstains on the dull dark brown carpet wet driblets glistening in the dim overhead light bourne crouched and felt them they were wet they were redbloodred unbroken they passed the first door then the second remaining on the leftthen they crossed the hall the pattern now altered no longer steady instead zigzagging as if the wound had been located the bleeding partially stemmed the trail passed the sixth door on the right and the seventh then abruptly the shining red drops stoppedno not entirely there was a trickle heading left barely visible and again across the hallwaythere it was a faint smudge of red just above the knob on the eighth door on the left no more than twenty feet from the corridors exit staircase carlos was behind that door holding hostage whoever was inside precision was everything now every movement every sound concentrated on the capture or the kill breathing steadily while imposing a suspension of the muscular spasms he felt everywhere throughout his body bourne once more walked silently now retracing his steps up the hallway he reached a point roughly thirty paces away from the eighth door on the left and turned around suddenly aware of a muted chorus of sporadic sobs and cries that came from closed doorways along the hotel corridor orders had been given couched in language far removed from krupkins instructions stay inside your rooms please admit no one our people are investigating it was always our people never the police never the authorities with those names came panic and panic was precisely what medusas delta one had in mind panic and diversion eternal components for the human snare lifelong allies in the springing trap he raised the graz burya automatic aiming at one of the ornate hallway chandeliers and fired twice simultaneously shouting furiously as the earsplitting explosions accompanied the shattered glass that plummeted from the ceiling there he goes a black suit his feet pounding bourne ran with loud emphatic strides down the corridor to the eighth door on the left then past the door shouting once again the exit the exit he abruptly stopped firing a third shot into another chandelier the jarring cacophony covering the absent noise of his pounding feet as he spun around throwing his back against the opposing wall of the eighth door then pushing himself away hurling his body at the door and crashing into it smashing it off its hinges as he lurched inside plunging to the floor his weapon raised prepared for rapid fire he was wrong he knew it instantlya final reverse trap was in the making he heard another door opening somewhere outsidehe either heard it or he instinctively knew it he rolled furiously to his right over and over again his legs crashing into a floor lamp sending it toward the door his panicked darting eyes catching a glimpse of an elderly couple clutching each other crouching in a far corner the whitegowned figure burst into the room his automatic pistol spitting indiscriminately the staccato reports deafening bourne fired repeatedly into the mass of white as he sprang into the left wall knowing that if for only a split second he was positioned on the killers blind right flank it was enough the jackal was caught in his shoulderhis right shoulder the weapon literally snapped out of his grip as he jerked up his forearm his fingers spastically uncurled under the impact of the graz buryas penetration with no cessation of movement the jackal swung around the bloody long white robe separating billowing like a sail as he grabbed the massive flesh wound with his left hand and violently kicked the floor lamp into jasons face bourne fired again half blinded by the flying shade of the heavy lamp his weapon deflected by the thick stem the shot went wild steadying his hand he squeezed the trigger again only to hear the sickening finality of a sharp metallic clickthe guns magazine was empty struggling to a crouch he lunged for the blunt ugly automatic weapon as the whiterobed carlos raced through the shattered doorway into the corridor jason got to his feet but his knee collapsed it had buckled under his own weight oh christ he crawled to the edge of the bed and dived over the pulleddown sheets toward the bedside telephoneit had been demolished the jackal had shot it apart carloss demented mind was summoning up every tactic every counteraction he had ever used another sound this loud and abrupt the crash bar on the hallways stairway exit had been slammed into the opening position the heavy metal door smashed back into the concrete wall of the landing the jackal was heading down the flights of steps to the lobby if the front desk had listened to conklin he was trapped bourne looked at the elderly couple in the corner affected by the fact that the old man was covering the woman with his own body its all right he said trying to calm them by lowering his voice i know you probably dont understand mei dont speak russianbut youre safe now we dont speak russian either admitted the man an englishman in clipped guarded tones straining his neck as he looked at jason while trying to rise thirty years ago i would have been standing at that door eighth army with monty yknow rather grand at el alameinall of us of course to paraphrase age doth wither as they say id rather not hear it general no no merely a brigadier fine bourne crept over the bed testing his knee whatever it was had snapped back i have to get to a phone actually what outraged me was the goddamned robe went on the veteran of el alamein fucking disgraceful i sayforgive me darling what are you talking about the white robe lad it had to be binkysthe couple across the hall were traveling withhe must have copped it from that lovely beaurivage in lausanne the rotten theft is bad enough but to have given it to that swine is unforgivable in seconds jason had grabbed the jackals weapon and crashed his way into the room across the hall immediately knowing that binky deserved more admiration than the brigadier afforded him he lay on the floor bleeding from knife wounds across his stomach and throat i cant reach anyone screamed the woman with thinning gray hair she was on her knees above the victim weeping hysterically he fought like a madmansomehow he knew that priest wouldnt fire his gun hold the skin together wherever you can yelled bourne looking over at the telephone it was intact he ran to it and instead of calling the front desk or the operator he dialed the numbers for the suite krupkin cried alex no me first carlos is on the staircasethe hallway i went into second a mans cut up same hallway seventh door on the right hurry as fast as i can ive got a clear line to the office where the hell is the kgb team they just got here krupkin called only seconds ago from the lobbyits why i thought you were im going to the staircase for gods sake why because hes mine jason raced to the door offering no words of comfort for the hysterical wife he could not summon them he crashed his way through the exit door the jackals weapon in his hand he started down the staircase suddenly hearing the sound of his own shoes he stopped on the seventh step and removed both and then his anklelength socks the cool surface of the stone on his feet somehow reminded him of the jungles flesh against the cold morning underbrush for some abstract foolish memory he felt more in command of his fearsthe jungles were always the friend of delta one floor by floor he descended following the inevitable rivulets of blood larger now no longer to be stemmed for the last wound was too severe to stop by exerting pressure twice the jackal had applied such pressure once at the fifthfloor and again at the thirdfloor hallway doors only to be followed by streaks of dark red as he could not manipulate the exterior locks without the security keys the second floor then the first there were no more carlos was trapped somewhere in the shadows below was the death of the killer who would set him free silently bourne removed a book of metropole matches from his pocket he huddled against the concrete wall tore out a single match and cupping his hands fired the packet he threw it over the railing the weapon in his hand ready to explode with continuous rounds of bullets at anything that moved below there was nothingnothing the cement floor was emptythere was no one there impossible jason raced down the last flight of steps and pounded on the door to the lobby shto yelled a russian inside kto tam im an american im working with the kgb let me in shto i understand shouted another voice and please you understand that many guns are directed at you when i open the door it is understand understand shouted bourne at the last second remembering to drop carloss weapon on the concrete floor the door opened da said the soviet police officer instantly correcting himself as he spotted the machine pistol at jasons feet nyet he yelled nye za shto said a breathless krupkin urging his heavyset body forward pochemu komitet prekrasno the policeman nodded obsequiously but stayed in place what are you doing demanded krupkin the lobby is cleared and our assault squad is in place he was here whispered bourne as if his intense quiet voice further obscured his incomprehensible words the jackal asked krupkin astonished he came down this staircase he couldnt have gone out on any other floor every fire door is deadbolted from the insideonly the crash bars release them skazhi said the kgb official to the hotel guard speaking in russian has anyone come through this door within the past ten minutes since the orders were given to seal them off no sir replied the mititsiya only a hysterical woman in a soiled bathrobe in her panic she fell in the bathroom and cut herself we thought she might have a heart attack she was screaming so we escorted her immediately to the nurses office krupkin turned to jason switching back to english only a woman came through a woman in panic who had inured herself a woman is he certain what color was her hair dimitri asked the guard with the mans reply he again looked at bourne he says it was reddish and quite curly reddish an image came to jason a very unpleasant one a house phoneno the front desk come on i may need your help with krupkin following the barefooted bourne ran across the lobby to a clerk at the reception counter can you speak english certainly most good even many veniculars mister sir a room plan for the tenth floor quickly mister sir krupkin translated a large looseleaf notebook was placed on the counter the plasticenclosed page turned tothis room said jason pointing at a square and doing his best not to alarm the frightened clerk get it on the telephone if the lines busy knock off anybody on it again krupkin translated as a phone was placed in front of bourne he picked it up and spoke this is the man who came into your room a few minutes ago oh yes of course dear fellow thank you so much the doctors here and binkys i have to know something and i have to know it right now do you carry hairpieces or wigs with you when you travel id say thats rather impertinent lady i dont have time for amenities i have to know do you well yes i do its no secret actually all my friends know it and they forgive the artifice you see dear boy i have diabetes my gray hair is painfully thin is one of those wigs red as a matter of fact yes i rather fancy changing bourne slammed down the phone and looked over at krupkin the son of a bitch lucked out it was carlos come with me said krupkin as they both raced across the empty lobby to the complex of backroom offices of the metropole they reached the nurses infirmary door and went inside they both stopped both gasped and then winced at what they saw there were rolls of torn unwound gauze and reels of tape in various widths and broken syringes and tubes of antibiotics scattered about the examining table and the floor as if all were somehow administered in panic these however the two men barely noticed for their eyes were riveted on the woman who had tended to her crazed patient the metropoles nurse was arched back in her chair her throat surgically punctured and over her immaculate white uniform ran a thin stream of blood madness standing beside the living room table dimitri krupkin spoke on the phone as alex conklin sat on the brocaded couch massaging his bootless leg and bourne stood by the window staring out on the marx prospekt alex looked over at the kgb officer a thin smile on his gaunt face as krupkin nodded his eyes on conklin an acknowledgment was being transmitted between the two of them they were worthy adversaries in a neverending essentially futile war in which only battles were won the philosophical conflicts never resolved i have your assurance then comrade said krupkin in russian and frankly i will hold you to it of course im taping this conversation would you do otherwise good we understand each other as well as our respective responsibilities so let me recapitulate the man is seriously wounded therefore the city taxi service as well as all doctors and all hospitals in the moscow area have been alerted the description of the stolen automobile has been circulated and any sightings of man or vehicle are to be reported only to you the penalty for disregarding these instructions is the lubyanka that must be clear good we have a mutual understanding and i expect to hear from you the minute you have any information yes dont have a cardiac arrest comrade i am well aware that you are my superior but then this is a proletarian society yes simply follow the advice of an extremely experienced subordinate have a pleasant day no that is not a threat it is merely a phrase i picked up in parisamerican origin i believe krupkin hung up the phone and sighed theres something to be said for our vanished educated aristocracy im afraid dont say it out loud observed conklin nodding at the telephone i gather nothings coming down nothing to act upon immediately but something rather interesting even fascinating in a macabre sort of way by which you mean it concerns carlos i assume no one else krupkin shook his head as jason looked over at him from the window i stopped at my office to join the assault squad and on my desk were eight large manila envelopes only one of which had been opened the police found them in the vavilova and true to form having read the contents of only one wanted nothing to do with them what were they asked alex chuckling state secrets describing the entire politburo as gay youre probably not far off the mark interrupted bourne that was the jackals moscow cadre in the vavilova he was either showing them the dirt he had on them or giving them the dirt on others the latter in this case said krupkin a collection of the most preposterous allegations directed at the ranking heads of our major ministries hes got vaults of that garbage its standard operating procedure for carlos its how he buys his way into circles he shouldnt be able to penetrate then im not being clear jason continued the kgb officer when i say preposterous i mean exactly thatbeyond belief lunacy hes almost always on target dont take that judgment to the bank if there were such a bank i certainly would and id negotiate a sizable loan on its efficacy as collateral most of the information is the stuff of the lowestgrade tabloidsnothing unusual there of coursebut along with such nonsense are outright distortions of times places functions and even identities for example the ministry of transport is not where a particular file says but a block away and a certain comrade direktor is not married to the lady named but to someone elsethe woman mentioned is their daughter and is not in moscow but rather in cuba where shes been for six years also the man listed as head of radio moscow and accused of just about everything short of having intercourse with dogs died eleven months ago and was a known closet orthodox catholic who would have been far happier as a truly devout priest these blatant falsehoods i picked up in a matter of minutes time being at a premium but im sure there are dozens more youre saying that a scam was pulled on carlos said conklin one so garishalbeit compiled with extreme convictionit would be laughed out of our most rigidly doctrinaire courts whoever fed him these melodramatic exposés wanted builtin deniabilities rodchenko asked bourne i cant think of anyone else grigoriei say grigorie but i never called him that to his face it was always generalwas a consummate strategist the ultimate survivor as well as a deeply committed marxist control was his byword his addiction really and if he could control the infamous jackal for the motherlands interests what a profound exhilaration for the old man yet the jackal killed him with those symbolic bullets in his throat was it betrayal or was it carelessness on rodchenkos part at having been discovered which well never know the telephone rang and krupkins hand shot down picking it up da shifting to russian dimitri gestured for conklin to restrap the prosthetic boot as he spoke now listen to me very carefully comrade the police are to make no movesabove all they are to remain out of sight call in one of our unmarked vehicles to replace the patrol car am i clear good well use the moray frequency breakthrough asked bourne stepping away from the window as dimitri slammed down the phone maximum replied krupkin the car was spotted on the nemchinovka road heading toward odintsovo that doesnt mean anything to me whats in odintsovo or whatever its called i dont know specifically but i must assume he does remember he knows moscow and its environs odintsovo is what you might call an industrial suburb about thirtyfive minutes from the city goddamn it yelled alex struggling with the velcro straps of his boot let me do that said jason his tone of voice brooking no objection as he knelt down and swiftly manipulated the thick strips of coarse cloth why is carlos still using the dzerzhinsky car continued bourne addressing krupkin its not like him to take that kind of risk it is if he has no choice he has to know that all moscow taxis are a silent arm of the state and he is after all severely wounded and undoubtedly now without a gun or he would have used it on you hes in no condition to threaten a driver or steal an automobile besides he reached the nemchinovka road quickly that the car was even seen is pure chance the road is not well traveled which i assume he also knows lets get out of here cried conklin annoyed by both jasons attention and his own infirmity he stood up wavered angrily rejected krupkins hand and started for the door we can talk in the car were wasting time moray come in please said krupkin in russian sitting beside the assault squad driver in the front seat the microphone at his lips his hand on the frequency dial of the vehicles radio moray respond if im reaching you what the hells he talking about asked bourne in the backseat with alex hes trying to make contact with the unmarked kgb patrol following carlos he keeps switching from one ultrahigh frequency to another its the moray code the what its an eel jason replied krupkin glancing over the seat of the muraenidae family with porelike gills and capable of descending to great depths certain species can be quite deadly thank you peter lorre said bourne very good laughed the kgb man but youll admit its aptly descriptive very few radios can either send it or receive it when did you steal it from us oh not you not you at all from the british truthfully as usual london is very quiet about these things but theyre far ahead of you and the japanese in certain areas its that damned misix they dine in their clubs in knightsbridge smoke their odious pipes play the innocents and send us defectors trained at the old vic theyve had their gaps said conklin defensively more so in their highdudgeon revelations than in reality aleksei youve been away too long weve both lost more than they have in that department but they can cope with public embarrassmentwe havent learned that timehonored trait we bury our gaps as you put it we try too hard for that respectability which too often eludes us then i suppose were historically young by comparison krupkin again switched back into russian moray come in please im reaching the end of the spectrum where are you moray stop there comrade came the metallic voice over the loudspeaker were in contact can you hear me you sound like a castrato but i can hear you this must be comrade krupkin were you expecting the pope whos this orlov good you know what youre doing i hope you do dimitri why do you say that your insufferable orders to do nothing thats why were two kilometers away from the buildingi drove up through the grass on a small hilland we have the vehicle in sight its parked in the lot and the suspects inside what building what hill you tell me nothing the kubinka armory hearing this conklin bolted forward in the seat oh my god he cried what is it asked bourne he reached an armory alex saw the frown of confusion on jasons face over here armories are a hell of a lot more than enclosed parade grounds for legionnaires and reservists theyre serious training quarters and warehouses for weapons he wasnt heading for odintsovo broke in krupkin the armorys farther south on the outskirts of the town another four or five kilometers hes been there before those places must have tight security said bourne he cant just walk inside he already has corrected the kgb officer from paris i mean into restricted areaslike storerooms filled with weapons thats what concerns me went on krupkin fingering the microphone in his hand since hes been there beforeand he obviously haswhat does he know about the installation who does he know get on a radio patch call the place and have him stopped held insisted jason suppose i reach the wrong person or suppose he already has weapons and we set him off with one phone call one hostile confrontation or even the appearance of a strange automobile there could be wholesale slaughter of several dozen men and women we saw what he did at the metropole in the vavilova hes lost all control hes utterly mad dimitri came the metallic soviet voice over the radio speaking russian somethings happening the man just came out of a side door with a burlap sack and is heading for the car comrade im not sure its the same man it probably is but theres something different about him what do you mean the clothes no hes wearing a dark suit and his right arm is in a black sling as before yet hes moving more rapidly his pace firmer his posture erect youre saying he does not appear to be wounded yes i guess thats what im saying yes he could be faking it said conklin that son of a bitch could be taking his last breath and convince you hes ready for a marathon for what purpose aleksei why any pretense at all i dont know but if your man in that car can see him he can see the car maybe hes just in a hell of a hurry whats going on asked bourne angrily someones come outside with a bagful of goodies and going to the car said conklin in english for christs sake stop him were not sure its the jackal interrupted krupkin the clothes are the same even to the arm sling but there are physical differences then he wants you to think it isnt him said jason emphatically shto what hes putting himself in your place thinking like youre thinking now and by doing that outthinking you he may or may not know that hes been spotted the car picked up but he has to assume the worst and act accordingly how long before we get there the way my outrageously reckless young comrade is driving id say three or four minutes krupkin the voice burst from the radio speaker four other people have come outsidethree men and a woman theyre running to the car what did he say asked bourne alex translated and jason frowned hostages he said quietly as if to himself he just blew it medusas delta leaned forward and touched krupkins shoulder tell your man to get out of there the moment that car takes off and he knows where its heading tell him to be obvious to blow the hell out of his horn while he passes the armory which he must pass from one way or the other my dear fellow exploded the soviet intelligence officer would you mind telling me why i should issue such an order because your colleague was right and i was wrong the man in the sling isnt carlos the jackals inside waiting for the cavalry to pass the fort so he can get away in another carif there is a cavalry in the name of our revered karl marx do explain how you reached this contradictory conclusion simple he made a mistake even if you could you wouldnt shoot up that car on the road would you agreed there are four other people inside all no doubt innocent soviet citizens forced to appear otherwise hostages yes of course when was the last time you heard of people running like hell into a situation where they could become hostages even if they were under a gun from a doorway one or two if not all of them would try to race behind other cars for protection my word but you were right about one thing carlos has a contact inside that armorythe man in the sling he may only be an innocent russian with a brother or a sister living in paris but the jackal owns him dimitri shouted the metallic voice in russian the car is speeding out of the parking lot krupkin pressed the button on his microphone and gave his instructions essentially they were to follow that automobile to the borders of finland if necessary but to take it without violence calling in the police if they had to the last order was to pass the armory blowing his horn repeatedly in the russian vernacular the agent named orlov asked what the fuck for because ive had a vision from st nickolai the good also im your charitable superior do it youre not well dimitri do you wish a superb service report or one that will send you to tashkent im on my way comrade krupkin replaced the microphone in the dashboard receptacle everything proceeds he said haltingly partially over his shoulder if im to go down with either a crazed assassin or a convoluted lunatic who displays certain decencies i imagine its best to choose the latter contrary to the most enlightened skeptics there might be a god after all would you care to buy a house on the lake in geneva aleksei i might answered bourne if i live through the day and do what i have to do give me a price i wont quibble hey david interjected conklin marie made that money you didnt shell listen to me to him what now whoever you are asked krupkin give me all the firepower i need from this trunk of yours and let me off in the grass just before the armory give me a couple of minutes to get in place then pull into the parking lot and obviouslyvery obviouslysee that the car is missing and get out of there fast gunning your engine and leave you alone cried alex its the only way i can take him the only way he can be taken lunacy spat out krupkin his jowls vibrating no kruppie reality said jason bourne simply its the same as it was in the beginning one on one its the only way that is sophomoric heroics roared the russian slamming his hand down on the back of the seat worse its ridiculous strategy if youre right i can surround the armory with a thousand troops which is exactly what hed wantwhat id want if i were carlos dont you see he could get away in the confusion in the sheer numbersthats not a problem for either of us weve both done it too many times before crowds and anxiety are our protectiontheyre childs play a knife in a uniform the uniform ours toss a grenade into the troops and after the explosion were one of the staggering victimsthats amateur night for paid killers believe me i knowi became one in spite of myself so what do you think you can do by yourself batman asked conklin furiously massaging his useless leg stalk the killer who wants to kill meand ill take him youre a fucking megalomaniac youre absolutely right its the only way to be in the killing game its the only edge youve got insanity yelled krupkin so allow me im entitled to a little craziness if i thought the entire russian army would ensure my survival id scream for it but it wouldntit couldnt theres only this way stop the car and let me choose the weapons the dark green kgb sedan rounded the final curve in the sloping road cut out of the countryside the descent had been gradual the ground below was flat and summergreen with fields of wild grass bordering the approach to the massive brown building that was the kubinka armory it seemed to rise out of the earth a huge boxlike intrusion on the pastoral scene an ugly manmade interruption of heavy brown wood and miserly windows reaching three stories high and covering two acres of land like the structure itself the front entrance was large square and unadorned except for the dull basrelief profiles above the door of three soviet soldiers rushing into the deadly winds of battle their rifles at port arms about to blow one anothers heads off armed with an authentic russian ak and five standard thirtyround magazine clips bourne jumped out the far side of the silent coasting government car using the bulk of the rolling vehicle to conceal himself in the grass directly across the road from the entrance the armorys huge dirt parking area was to the right of the long building a single row of unkempt shrubbery fronted the entrance lawn in the center of which stood a tall white pole the soviet flag hanging limp in the breezeless morning air jason ran across the road his body low and crouched by the hedgerow he had only moments to peer through the bushes and ascertain the existence or nonexistence of the armorys security procedures at best they appeared lax to the point of being informal if not irrelevant there was a glass window in the right wall of the entrance similar to that of a theaters box office behind it sat a uniformed guard reading a magazine and alongside him less visible but seen clearly enough was another his head on the counter asleep two other soldiers emerged from the immense armory doordouble doorsboth casual unconcerned as one glanced at his watch and the other lighted a cigarette so much for kubinkas security no sudden assault was anticipated nor had one taken place at least none that had set off alarms reaching the front patrols usually the first to be alerted it was eerie unnatural beyond the unexpected the jackal was inside this military installation yet there was no sign that he had penetrated it no indication that somewhere within the complex he was controlling a minimum of five personnela man impersonating him three other men and a woman the parking area itself he had not understood the exchanges between alex krupkin and the voice over the radio but now it was clear to him that when they had spoken of people coming outside and running to the stolen car they were not referring to the front entrance there had to be an exit on the parking area christ he had only seconds before the driver of the komitet car started up the engine and roared into the huge dirt lot circling it and racing out both actions announcing the government vehicles arrival and swift calamitous departure if carlos was going to make his break it would be then after waiting for the standard radio backup every moment of distance he put between himself and the armory would make it more difficult to pick up his trail and he the efficient killing machine from medusa was in the wrong place further the sight of a civilian running across a lawn or down a road carrying an automatic weapon within a military compound was to invite disaster it was a small stupid omission three or four additional words translated and a less arrogant more probing listener would have avoided the error it was always the little things the seemingly insignificant that crippled gray to black operations goddamn it five hundred feet away the kgb sedan suddenly thundered as it swerved into the dirt parking area raising clouds of dry dust while crushing and spitting out pieces of rock from its spinning tires there was no time to think time only to act bourne held the ak against his right leg concealing it as much as possible as he rose to his feet his left hand skimming the top of the low hedgerowa gardener perhaps surveying an anticipated assignment or an indolent stroller aimlessly touching the roadside shrubbery nothing remotely threatening just a sign of the commonplace to the casual observer he might have been walking down that road for several minutes without being noticed he glanced over at the armorys entrance the two soldiers were laughing quietly the one without a cigarette again looking at his watch then the object of their minor conspiracy came out of the left front door an attractive darkhaired girl barely in her twenties she humorously clapped both her hands over her ears made a grotesque face and walked rapidly to the timeconscious man in uniform kissing him on the lips the threesome linked arms the woman in the center and started to their right away from the entrance a crash metal colliding with metal glass shattering glass the loud harsh sound coming from the distant parking area something had happened to the komitet car with alex and krupkin the young driver from the assault squad had either smashed or skidded into another vehicle in the dry dirt of the lot using the sound as an excuse jason started down the road the image of conklin coming instantly to his mind producing a limp in his own rapid strides the better to keep his weapon in minimum view he turned his head expecting to see the two soldiers and the woman running down the armory path toward the accident only to realize that the three of them were running the other way removing themselves from any involvement obviously precious breaks in a military schedule were jealously protected bourne abandoned the limp crashed through the hedgerow and raced to the concrete path that stretched to the corner of the huge building gathering speed and breathing heavily with increasing frequency jasons weapon was now in plain sight slashing the air as he gripped it in the hand of his swinging right arm he reached the end of the path his chest heaving the veins in his neck seemingly prepared to burst as the sweat ran down his skin drenching his face his collar and his shirt gasping he steadied the ak his back pressed against the wall of the building then spun around the corner into the parking area stunned by what he saw his pounding feet coupled with the anxiety that caused his hairsoaked temples to throb had blocked out all sound up ahead what he observed now what sickened him now he knew had to be the result of multiple gunshots muted by a weapon equipped with a silencer dispassionately medusas delta understood he had been there many times many years before there were circumstances under which kills had to be made quietlyutter silence was the unreachable goal but at least minimal noise was crucial the young kgb driver from the assault squad was sprawled on the ground by the trunk of the dark green sedan the wounds in his head certifying death the car had swerved into the side of a government bus the sort used to haul workers to and from their places of employment how or why the accident had happened bourne could not know neither could he know whether alex or krupkin had survived the cars windows had been pierced repeatedly and there was no sign of movement inside both facts suggesting the worst but nothing conclusive above all at this moment the chameleon also understood that he could not be affected by what he sawemotions were out if the worst had happened mourning the dead would come later vengeance and taking the killer came now think how quickly krupkin had said there were several dozen men and women working at the armory if so where the hell were they the jackal was not acting in a vacuum it was impossible yet a collision had occurred its violent crash heard over a hundred yards awaywell over the distance of a football fieldand a man had been shot dead at the site of that crash his lifeless body bleeding in the dirt yet no oneno onehad appeared either accidentally or intentionally with the exception of carlos and five unknown people was the entire armory operating in a vacuum nothing made sense and then he heard the muffled but emphatic strains of music from deep inside the building martial music drums and trumpets predominating swelling to crescendos that bourne could only imagine were deafening within the echoing confines of the huge structure the image of the young woman emerging from the front entrance returned she had playfully clapped her hands over her ears and grimaced and jason had not understood he did now she had come from the armorys inner staging area where the decibel level of the music was overpowering an event was taking place at the kubinka a decently attended affair which accounted for the profusion of automobiles small vans and buses in the vast parking areaprofusion at any rate in the soviet union where such vehicles were not in oversupply altogether there were perhaps twenty conveyances in the dirt lot parked in a semicircle the activity inside was both the jackals diversion and his protection he knew how to orchestrate both to his advantage so did his enemy checkmate why didnt carlos come out why hadnt he come out what was he waiting for the circumstances were optimal they couldnt be better had his wounds slowed him to the point that he had lost the advantages he had created it was possible but not likely the assassin had gotten this far and if escape was in the offing it was in him to go further much further then why irreversible logic a killers survival logic demanded that after taking out the backup the jackal had to race away as fast as humanly possible it was his only chance then why was he still inside why hadnt his escape car fled from the area speeding him to freedom his back once again pressed against the wall jason sidestepped to his left closely observing everything he could see like most armories the world over kubinka had no windows on the first floor at least not for the first fifteen feet from the ground he presumed it was because the occasional wildly galloping horses and glass did not go together he could see a window frame on what appeared to be the second floor but close enough to the slain driver to afford maximum accuracy for a silenced highpowered weapon another frame on ground level had a knob protruding it was the rear exit no one had bothered to mention the little things the insignificant things goddamn the muted music inside swelled again but now the swelling was different the drums louder the trumpets more sustained more piercing it was the unmistakable ending of a symphonic march martial music at its most intense that was it the end of the event inside was at hand and the jackal would use the emerging crowds to cover his escape he would mingle and when panic spread through the parking area with the sight of the dead man and the shotup sedan he would disappearwith whom and with what vehicle would take hours to determine bourne had to get inside he had to stop him take him krupkin had worried about the lives of several dozen men and womenhe had no idea that in reality there were several hundred carlos would use whatever firepower he had stolen including grenades to create mass hysteria so that he could escape lives meant nothing if further killing was required to save his own nothing abandoning caution delta raced to the door gripping his ak laterally in his arm the safety unlatched his index finger on the trigger he grabbed the knob and twisted itit would not turn he fired his weapon into the plated metal around the lock then a second fusillade into the opposing frame and as he reached for the smoking knob his personal world went mad out of the line of vehicles a heavy truck suddenly shot forward coming straight toward him wildly accelerating as it approached simultaneously successive bursts of automatic gunfire erupted the bullets thumping into the wood to his right he lunged to his left rolling on the ground the dust and dirt filling his eyes as he kept rolling his body a tube spinning away and then it happened the massive explosion tore apart the door blowing away a large section of the wall above and through the black smoke and settling debris he could see a figure lurching awkwardly toward the semicircle of vehicles his killer was getting away after all but he was alive and the reason for it was obviousthe jackal had made a mistake not in the trap that was extraordinary carlos knew his enemy was with krupkin and the kgb and so he had gone outside and waited for him instead his error was in the placement of the explosives he had wired the bomb or bombs to the top of the trucks engine not underneath explosive compounds seek release through the least resistant barriers the relatively thin hood of a vehicle is far less solid than the iron beneath it the bomb actually blew up it did not blow out on ground level sending deathinducing metal fragments along the surface no time bourne struggled to his feet and staggered to the komitet sedan a horrible fear coming into focus he looked through the shattered windows his eyes suddenly drawn to the front seat as a heavily fleshed hand was raised he yanked the door open and saw krupkin his large body squeezed below the seat under the dashboard his right shoulder half torn away bleeding flesh apparent through the fabric of his jacket we are hurt said the kgb officer weakly but calmly aleksei somewhat more seriously than i am so attend to him first if you please the crowds coming out of the armory here interrupted krupkin painfully reaching into his pocket and pulling out his plastic identification case get to the idiot in charge and bring him to me we must get a doctor for aleksei you damn fool hurry the two wounded men lay alongside each other on examining tables in the armorys infirmary as bourne stood across the room leaning against the wall watching but not understanding what was being said three doctors had been dispatched by helicopter from the roof of the peoples hospital on the serova prospekttwo surgeons and an anesthesiologist the last however proving unnecessary severe invasive procedures were not called for local anesthetics were sufficient for the cleansing and suturing followed by generous injections of antibiotics the foreign objects had passed through their bodies explained the chief doctor i presume you mean bullets when you speak so reverently of foreign objects said krupkin in high dudgeon he means bullets confirmed alex hoarsely in russian the retired cia station chief was unable to move his head because of his bandaged throat wide adhesive straps extended down across his collarbone and upper right shoulder thank you said the surgeon you were both fortunate especially you our american patient for whom we must compile confidential medical records incidentally give our people the name and address of your physician in the united states youll need attention for some weeks ahead right now hes in a hospital in paris i beg your pardon well whenever somethings wrong with me i tell him and he sends me to the doctor he thinks i should see thats not exactly socialized medicine for me it is ill give his name and address to a nurse with luck hell be back soon i repeat you were very fortunate i was very fast doctor and so was your comrade we saw that son of a bitch running out toward us so we locked the doors and kept moving in the seats and firing at him as he tried to get close enough to put us away which he damn near did im sorry about the driver he was a brave young man he was an angry young man as well aleksei broke in krupkin from the other table those first shots from the doorway sent him into that bus the door of the infirmary burst open which was to say it was not opened so much as it was invaded submitting to the august presence of the kgb commissar from the flat in slavyansky the bluntfeatured bluntspoken komitet officer in the disheveled uniform lived up to his appearance you he said to the doctor ive spoken to your associates outside you are finished here they say not entirely comrade there are minor items to attend to such as therapeutical later interrupted the commissar we talk privately alone the komitet speaks asked the surgeon his contempt minor but evident it speaks sometimes too often what you heard me replied the doctor heading for the door the kgb man shrugged and waited for the infirmary door to close he then walked to the foot of both examining tables his squinting fleshencased eyes darting between the two wounded men and spat out one word novgorod he said what what the responses were simultaneous even bourne snapped himself away from the wall you he added switching to his limited english understand i say if you said what i think you said i think i do but only the name i explain good enough we question the nine men women he locked in weapons storage he kill two guards who do not stop him okay he take automobile keys from four men but uses no automobiles okay i saw him head for the cars which three other people at kubinka shot dead automobile papers taken which for christs sake check with your vehicle bureau or whatever you call it take time also in moskva automobiles under different names different tag platesleningrad smolensk who knowsall to not look for automobile laws broken what the hell is he talking about shouted jason automobile ownership is regulated by the state explained krupkin weakly from the table each major center has its own registration and is frequently reluctant to cooperate with another center why individual ownership under different family nameseven nonfamily names its forbidden there are only so many vehicles available for purchase so local bribery is a fact of life no one in leningrad wants a finger pointed at him from a bureaucrat in moscow hes telling you that it could take several days to learn what automobile the jackals driving thats crazy you said it mr bourne i didnt im an upstanding citizen of the soviet union please remember that but whats it all got to do with novgorodthat is what he said isnt it novgorod shto eto znachit said krupkin to the kgb official in rapid clipped russian the peasant commissar gave the pertinent details to his colleague from paris krupkin turned his head on the table and translated in english try to follow this jason he said his voice intermittently fading his breathing becoming increasingly more labored apparently there is a walkaround gallery above the armorys arena he used it and saw you through a window on the road by the hedges and came back to the weapons room screaming like the maniac he is he shouted to his bound hostages that you were his and you were dead and there was only one last thing he had to accomplish novgorod interrupted conklin whispering his head rigid staring at the ceiling precisely said krupkin his eyes focused on alexs profile beside him hes going back to the place of his birth where ilich ramirez sanchez became carlos the jackal because he was disinherited marked for execution as a madman he held his gun against everyones throat quietly demanding to know the best roads to novgorod threatening to kill whoever gave him the wrong answer none did of course and all who knew told him it was five to six hundred kilometers away a full days drive drive interjected bourne he knows he cannot use any other means of transportation the railroads the airportseven the small airfieldsall will be watched he understands that what will he do in novgorod asked jason quickly dear god in heaven which of course there is neither who knows he intends to leave his mark a highly destructive memorial to himself no doubt in answer to those he believes betrayed him thirtyodd years ago as well as the poor souls who fell under his gun this morning in the vavilova he took the papers from our agent trained at novgorod he thinks theyll get him inside they wontwell stop him dont even try said bourne he may or may not use them depending upon what he sees what he senses he doesnt need papers to get in there any more than i do but if he senses something wrong and he will hell kill a number of good men and still get inside what are you driving at asked krupkin warily eyeing bourne the american with alternate identities and apparently conflicting lifestyles get me inside ahead of him with a detailed map of the whole complex and some kind of document that gives me free access to go wherever i want to go youve lost your senses cried dimitri a nondefecting american an assassin hunted by every nato country in europe inside novgorod nyet nyet nyet roared the komitet commissar i understand good okay you are lunatic okay do you want the jackal naturally but there are limits to the cost i havent the slightest interest in novgorod or in any of the compoundsyou should know that by now your little infiltrating operations and our little infiltrating operations can go on and on and it doesnt matter because none of it means a goddamned thing in the long run its all adolescent game playing we either live together on this planet or there is no planet my only concern is carlos i want him dead so i can go on living of course i personally agree with much of what you say although the adolescent games do keep some of us rather gracefully employed however theres no way i could convince my more rigid superiors starting with the one standing above me all right said conklin from his table his eyes still on the ceiling down and dirtywe deal you get him into novgorod and you keep ogilvie weve already got him aleksei not clean you havent washington knows hes here so so i can say you lost him and theyll believe me theyll take my word for it that he flew out of your nest and youre mad as hell but you cant get him back hes operating from points unknown or unreachable but obviously under the sovereign protection of a united nations country as a matter of conjecture i suspect thats how you got him over here in the first place youre cryptic my fine old enemy to what purpose should i entertain your suggestion no world court embarrassments no charges of harboring an american accused of international crimes you win the stakes in europe you take over the medusa operation with no complicationsin the person of one dimitri krupkin a proven sophisticate from the cosmopolitan world of paris who better to guide the enterprise the newest hero of the soviet a member of the inner economic council of the presidium forget the lousy house in geneva kruppie how about a mansion on the black sea it is a most intelligent and attractive offer i grant you said krupkin i know two or three men on the central committee whom i can reach in a matter of minuteseverything confidential of course nyet nyet shouted the kgb commissar slamming his fist down on dimitris table i understand someyou talk too fastbut all is lunatic oh for gods sake shut up roared krupkin were discussing things far beyond your grasp shto like a young child reprimanded by an adult the komitet officer his puffed eyes widened was both astonished and frightened by his subordinates incomprehensible rebuke give my friend his chance kruppie said alex hes the best there is and he may bring you the jackal he may also bring about his own death aleksei hes been there before i believe in him belief whispered krupkin his own eyes now on the ceiling such a luxury it is very well the order will be issued secretly its origins untraceable of course youll enter your own american compound its the one least understood how fast can i get there asked bourne theres a lot i have to put together we have an airport in vnokova under our control no more than an hour away first i must make arrangements hand me a telephone you my imbecilic commissar i will hear no more from you a telefone the once allpowerful now subdued superior who had really understood only such words as presidium and central committee moved with alacrity bringing an extension phone to krupkins table one more thing said bourne have tass put out an immediate bulletin with heavy coverage in the newspapers radio and television that the assassin known as jason bourne died of wounds here in moscow make the details sketchy but have them parallel what happened here this morning thats not difficult tass is an obedient instrument of the state i havent finished continued jason i want you to include in those sketchy details that among the personal effects found on bournes body was a road map of brussels and its environs the town of anderlecht was circled in redthat has to appear the assassination of the supreme commander of natovery good very convincing however mr bourne or webb or whatever your name may be you should know that this story will splash across the world like a giant tidal wave i understand that are you prepared for it yes i am what about your wife dont you think you should reach her first before the civilized world learns that jason bourne is dead no i dont even want the slightest risk of a leak jesus exploded alex coughing thats marie youre talking about shell fall apart its a risk ill accept said delta coldly you son of a bitch so be it agreed the chameleon john st jacques tears welling in his eyes walked into the bright sunlit room at the sterile house in the maryland countryside in his hand was a page of computer printout his sister was on the floor in front of the couch playing with an exuberant jamie she having put the infant alison back into the crib upstairs she looked worn and haggard her face pale with dark circles under her eyes she was exhausted from the tension and the jet lag of the long idiotically routed flights from paris to washington in spite of arriving late last night she had gotten up early to be with the childrenno amount of friendly persuasion on the part of the motherly mrs cooper could dissuade her from doing so the brother would have given years of his life not to do what had to be done during the next few minutes but he could not risk the alternatives he had to be with her when she found out jamie said st jacques gently go find mrs cooper will you please i think shes in the kitchen why uncle john i want to talk to your mother for a few minutes johnny please objected marie i have to sis what the child left and as children often do he obviously sensed something serious that was beyond his understanding he stared at his uncle before heading to the door marie got to her feet and looked hard at her brother at the tears that began to roll down his cheeks the terrible message was conveyed no she whispered her pallid face growing paler dear god no she cried her hands and then her shoulders starting to tremble no no she roared hes gone sis i wanted you to hear it from me not over a radio or a tv set i want to be with you youre wrong wrong screamed marie rushing toward him grabbing his shirt and clenching the fabric in her fists hes protected he promised me he was protected this just came from langley said the younger brother holding up the page of computer printout holland called me a few minutes ago and said it was on its way over he knew you had to see it it was picked up from radio moscow during the night and will be on all the broadcasts and in the morning papers give it to me she shouted defiantly he did so and gently held her shoulders prepared to take her in his arms and give what comfort he could she read the copy rapidly then shook off his hands frowning and walked back to the couch and sat down her concentration was absolute she placed the paper on the coffee table and studied it as though it were an archaeological find a scroll perhaps hes gone marie i dont know what to sayyou know how i felt about him yes i know johnny then to st jacquess astonishment his sister looked up at him a thin wan smile appearing on her lips but its a little early for our tears bro hes alive jason bournes alive and up to his tricks and that means davids alive too my god she cant accept it thought the brother walking to the couch and kneeling beside the coffee table in front of marie taking her hands in his sis honey i dont think you understand ill do everything possible to help you but youve got to understand bro youre very sweet but you havent read this closelyreally closely the impact of the message detracts from the subtext in economics we call it obfuscation with a cloud of smoke and a couple of mirrors huh st jacques released her hands and stood up what are you talking about marie picked up the langley communiqué and scanned it after several confused even contradictory accounts of what happened she said described by people on the scene at this armory or whatever it is the following is buried in the last paragraph among the personal effects found on the slain assassins body was a map of brussels and the surrounding area with the town of anderlecht circled in red then it goes on to make the obvious connection with teagartens assassination its a wash johnny from two points of view first david would never carry such a map second and far more telling the fact that the soviet media would give such prominence to the story is unbelievable enough but to include the assassination of general teagarten is simply too much what do you mean why because the presumed assassin was in russia and moscow wants no conceivable linkage to the killing of a nato commander no bro someone bent the rules and persuaded tass to put out the story and i suspect heads will roll i dont know where jason bourne is but i know hes not dead david made sure id know that peter holland picked up the phone and touched the buttons on his console for charles cassets private line yes charlie its peter im relieved to hear that why because all im getting on this phone is trouble and confusion i just got off with our source in dzerzhinsky square and he told me the kgbs after blood the tass release on bourne right tass and radio moscow assumed the story was officially sanctioned because it was faxed by the ministry of information using the proper immediaterelease codes when the shit hit the fan no one owned up and whoever programmed the codes cant be traced what do you make of it im not sure but from what ive learned about dimitri krupkin it could be his style hes now working with alex and if this isnt something out of the conklin textbook i dont know saint alex and i do that dovetails with what marie thinks marie bournes wife i just spoke to her and her arguments pretty strong she says moscows report is a wash for all the right reasons her husbands alive i agree is that what you called to tell me no answered the director taking a deep breath im adding to your trouble and confusion im not relieved to hear that what is it the paris telephone number the link to the jackal we got from henry sykes in montserrat that reached a café on the marais waterfront in paris where someone would answer a call for a blackbird i remember someone did and we followed him youre not going to like this alex conklin is about to earn the prickoftheyear award he put us on to sykes didnt he yes do tell the message was delivered to the home of the director of the deuxième bureau my god wed better turn that over to the sed branch of french intelligence with a restricted chronology im not turning anything over to anybody until we hear from conklin we owe him that muchi think what the hell are they doing shouted a frustrated casset over the phone putting out false death noticesfrom moscow no less what for jason bournes gone hunting said peter holland and when the hunt is overif its over and if the kill is madehes going to have to get out of the woods before anyone turns on him i want every station and listening post on the borders of the soviet union on full alert code name assassin get him back novgorod to say it was incredible was to obliquely recognize the existence of credibility and that was nearly impossible it was the ultimate fantasy its optical illusions seemingly more real than reality the phantasmagoria there to be touched felt used entered into and departed from it was a collective masterpiece of invention cut out of the immense forests along the volkhov river from the moment bourne emerged from the deep underground tunnel below the water with its guards gates and myriad cameras he was as close to being in a state of shock while still being able to keep walking observing absorbing thinking the american compound presumably like those of the different countries was broken up into sections built on areas anywhere from two to five acres each distinctly separate from the others one area erected on the banks of the river might be the heart of a maine waterfront village another farther inland a small southern town yet another a busy metropolitan city street each was completely authentic with the appropriate vehicular traffic police dress codes shops grocery and drug stores gas stations and mock structures of buildingsmany of which rose two stories high and were so real they had american hardware on the doors and windows obviously as vital as the physical appearances was languagenot merely the fluent use of english but the mastery of linguistic idiosyncrasies the dialects that were characteristic of specific locations as jason wandered from one section to another he heard all around him the distinctive sounds from new england down east with its eeahh to texass drawl and its familiar youalls from the gentle nasality of the midwest to the loud abrasiveness of the large eastern cities with the inevitable know what i mean tacked on to conversational sentences whether questions or statements it was all incredible it was not simply beyond belief it made the true suspension of disbelief frighteningly viable he had been briefed on the flight from vnokova by a latemiddleaged novgorod graduate who had been urgently summoned from his moscow apartment by krupkin the small bald man was not only garrulously instructive but in his own way mesmerizing if anyone had ever told jason bourne that he was going to be briefed in depth by a soviet espionage agent whose english was so laced with the deep south that it sonorously floated out of his mouth with the essence of magnolias he would have deemed the information preposterous good lawd ah do miss those barbecues especially the ribs you know who grilled em best that black fellow who i believed was such a good friend until he exposed me can you imagine i thought he was one of those radicals he turned out to be a boy from dartmouth workin for the fbi a lawyer no less hell the exchange was made at aeroflot in new york and we still write each other adolescent games had mumbled bourne games oh yes he was a mighty fine coach coach sure nuff a few of us started a little league in east point thats right outside atlanta incredible may we concentrate on novgorod please suttnly dimitri may have told you im semiretired but my pension requires that i spend five days a month there as a tak govoryaa trainer as you would say i didnt understand what he meant ahll explain the strange man whose voice belonged to the old confederacy had been thorough each compound at novgorod was divided into three classes of personnel the trainers the candidates and operations the last category included the kgb staff guards and maintenance the practical implementation of the novgorod process was simple in structure a compounds staff created the daily training schedules for each individual section and the trainers both permanent and parttime retirees commandeered all individual and group activities while the candidates carried them out using only the language of the compound and the dialects of the specific areas in which they were located no russian was permitted the rule was tested frequently by the trainers who would suddenly bark orders or insults in the native language which the candidates could not acknowledge understanding when you say assignments bourne had asked what do you mean situations mah friend jest about anything you might think of like ordering lunch or dinner or buying clothes or fillin the tank of your car requesting a specific gasoline leaded or unleaded and the degrees of octaneall of which we dont know a thing about here then of course there are the more dramatic events often unscheduled so as to test the candidates reactions say an automobile accident necessitating conversations with american police and the resulting insurance forms that must be filled outyou can give yourself away if you appear too ignorant the little things the insignificant thingsthey were vital a back door at the kubinka armory what else so many inconsequential things that a person might not consider significant but they can be say being mugged in a city street at nightwhat should you do what shouldnt you do remember many of our candidates and all of the younger ones are trained in selfdefense but depending upon the circumstances it may not be advisable to use those skills questions of background could be raised discretion always discretion for me as an experienced parttime tak govorya of course ive always preferred the more imaginative situations which we are permitted to implement whenever we care to as long as they fall within the guidelines of environmental penetration what does that mean learn always but never appear to be learning for example a favorite of mine is to approach several candidates say at a bar in some location near a military testing ground i pretend to be a disgruntled government worker or perhaps an inebriated defense contractorobviously someone with access to informationand start ladlin out classified material of recognized value just for curiosity bourne had interrupted under those circumstances how should candidates react listen carefully and be prepared to write down every salient fact all the while feigning total lack of interest and offering such remarks ashere the novgorod graduates southern dialect became so roughmountain south that the magnolias were replaced by sour mash who gives a barrel a hogshit bout that stuff and they got any of them whoors over there lak people say they got or dont understand a fuckin word youre talkin about assholeall ah knows is that youre borin the holy bejesus outta me that sort of thing then what later each man is called in and told to list everything he learnedfact by salient fact what about passing along the information are there training procedures for that jasons soviet instructor had stared at him in silence for several moments from the adjacent seat in the small plane im sorry you had to ask the question he said slowly ill have to report it i didnt have to ask it i was simply curious forget i asked it i cant do that i wont do that do you trust krupkin of course i do hes brilliant a multilingual phenomenon a true hero of the komitet you dont know the half of it thought bourne but he said with even a trace of reverence then report it only to him hell tell you it was just curiosity i owe absolutely nothing to my government instead it owes me very well speakin of yourself lets get to you with dimitris authority ive made arrangements for your visit to novgorodplease dont tell me your objective its not in my purview any more than the question you asked is in yours understood the arrangements you will make contact with a young trainer named benjamin in the manner i will describe in a few moments ill tell you this much about benjamin so youll perhaps understand his attitude his parents were komitet officers assigned to the consulate in los angeles for nearly twenty years hes basically americaneducated his freshman and sophomore years at ucla in fact until he and his father were hurriedly recalled to moscow four years ago he and his father yes his mother was caught in an fbi sting operation at the naval base in san diego she has three more years to serve in prison there is no clemency and no exchanges for a russian momma hey wait a minute then it cant be all our fault i didnt say it was ahm just relayin the facts understood i make contact with benjamin hes the only one who knows who you arenot by name of course youll use the name archieand hell furnish you with the necessary clearance to go from one compound to the other papers hell explain hell also watch you be with you at all times and frankly hes been in touch with comrade krupkin and knows far more than i dowhich is precisely the way this retired georgia cracker likes it good huntin polecat if its huntin youre after dont rape no wooden indians bourne followed the signseverything was in englishto the city of rockledge florida fifteen miles southwest of nasas cape canaveral he was to meet benjamin at a lunch counter in the local woolworth store looking for a man in his midtwenties wearing a redcheckered shirt with a budweiser baseball cap on the stool beside him saving it it was the hour within the time span of minutes in the afternoon he saw him the sandyhaired californiaeducated russian was seated at the far right end of the counter the baseball cap on the stool to his left there were half a dozen men and women along the row talking to one another and consuming soft drinks and snacks jason approached the empty seat glanced down at the cap and spoke politely is this taken he asked im waiting for someone replied the young kgb trainer his voice neutral his gray eyes straying up to bournes face ill find another place she may not get here for another five minutes hell im just having a quick vanilla coke ill be out of here by then sit down said benjamin removing the hat and casually putting it on his head a gumchewing counterman came by and jason ordered his drink arrived and the komitet trainer continued quietly his eyes now on the foam of his milk shake which he sipped through a straw so youre archie like in the comics and youre benjamin nice to know you well both find out if thats a fact wont we do we have a problem i want the ground rules clear so there wont be one said the west coastbred soviet i dont approve of your being permitted in here regardless of my former address and the way i may sound i havent much use for americans listen to me ben interrupted bourne his eyes forcing the trainer to look at him all things considered i dont approve of your mother still being in prison either but i didnt put her there we free the dissidents and the jews but you insist on keeping a fiftyeightyearold woman who was at best a simple courier whispered the russian spitting out the words i dont know the facts and i wouldnt be too quick to call moscow the mercy capital of the world but if you can help mereally help memaybe i can help your mother goddamned bullshit promises what the hell can you do to repeat what i said an hour ago to a baldheaded friend of yours in the plane i dont owe my government a thing but it sure as hell owes me help me benjamin i will because ive been ordered to not because of your con but if you try to learn things that have nothing to do with your purpose hereyou wont get out clear its not only clear its irrelevant and unnecessary beyond normal astonishment and curiosity both of which i will suppress to the best of my ability i havent the slightest interest in the objectives of novgorod ultimately in my opinion they lead nowhere although i grant you the whole complex beats the hell out of disneyland benjamins involuntary laugh through the straw caused the foam on his milk shake to swell and burst have you been to anaheim he asked mischievously i could never afford it we had diplomatic passes christ youre human after all come on lets take a walk and talk some turkey they crossed over a miniature bridge into new london connecticut home of americas submarine construction and strolled down to the volkhov river which in this area had been turned into a maximum security naval baseagain all in realistic miniature high fences and armed us marine guards were stationed at the gates and patrolled the grounds fronting the concrete slips that held enormous mockups of the stallions of americas nuclear undersea fleet we have all the stations all the schedules every device and every reduced inch of the piers said benjamin and weve yet to break the security procedures isnt that crazy not for a minute were pretty good yes but were better except for minor pockets of discontent we believe you merely accept what your crap notwithstanding white america was never in slavery we were thats not only longpast history young man but rather selective history isnt it you sound like a professor suppose i were id argue with you only if you were in a sufficiently broadminded environment that allowed you to argue with authority oh come on cut the bullshit man the academicfreedom bromide is history check out our campuses weve got rock and blue jeans and more grass than you can find the right paper to roll it in thats progress would you believe its a start ill have to think about it can you really help my mother can you really help me lets try okay this carlos the jackal ive heard of him but hes not large in my vocabulary direktor krupkin says hes one very bad dude i hear california checking in it comes back forget it im where i want to be and dont for a moment think otherwise i wouldnt dare what you keep protesting shakespeare said it better my minor at ucla was english lit what was your major american history what else grandpa thanks kid this jackal said benjamin leaning against the new london fence as several guards began to run toward him prosteetye he yelled no no i mean excuse me tak govorya im a trainer oh shit will you be reported asked jason as they quickly walked away no theyre too damned dumb theyre maintenance personnel in uniforms they walk their posts but they dont really know whats going on only who and what to stop pavlovs dogs who better animals dont rationalize they go for the throats and plug up the holes which brings us back to the jackal said bourne i dont understand you dont have to its symbolic how could he get in here he couldnt every guard in every tunnel up the line has the name and serial numbers of the novgorod papers he took from the agent he killed in moscow if he shows up theyll stop him and shoot him on sight i told krupkin not to do that for christs sake why because it wont be him and lives could be lost hell send in others maybe two or three or four into different compounds always testing confusing until he finds a way to get through youre nuts what happens to the men he sends in it wouldnt matter if theyre shot he watches and learns something youre really crazy where would he find people like that anyplace where there are people who think theyre making a months salary for a few minutes work he could call each one a routine security checkremember hes got the papers to prove hes official combined with money people are impressed with such documents and arent too skeptical and at the first gate he loses those papers insisted the trainer not at all hes driving over five hundred miles through a dozen towns and cities he could easily have copies made in any number of places your business centers have xerox machines theyre all over the place and touching up those papers to look like the real items is no sweat bourne stopped and looked at the americanized soviet youre talking details ben and take my word for it they dont count carlos is coming here to leave his mark and we have one advantage that blows away all his expertise if krupkin was able to get the news out properly the jackal thinks im dead the whole world thinks youre dead yes krupkin told me it wouldve been dumb not to in here youre a recruit named archie but i know who you are bourne even if id never heard of you before i sure as hell have now youre all radio moscows been talking about for hours then we can assume carlos has heard the news too no question every vehicle in russia is equipped with a radio its standard in case of an american attack incidentally thats good marketing did you really assassinate teagarten in brussels get off my case off limits okay whats your point krupkin should have left it to me left what the jackals penetration what the hell are you talking about use krupkin if necessary but send the word up to every tunnel every entrance to novgorod to let in anyone using those papers my guess is three or four maybe five theyre to watch them but theyre to let everyone come inside you just got awarded a room made of thick sponge rubber youre certifiable archie no im not i said that everyone should be watched followed that the guards maintain constant contact with us here in this compound so one of those men will disappear in a matter of minutes no one will know where he is or where he went that man will be carlos and hell convince himself hes invulnerable free to do whatever he wants to do because he thinks im dead that sets him free why because he knows and i know that were the only ones who can track each other whether its in the jungles or the cities or a combination of both hatred does that benjamin or desperation thats pretty emotional isnt it also abstract no way answered jason i have to think like he thinksi was trained to do that years ago lets examine the alternatives how far up the volkhov does novgorod extend thirty forty kilometers fortyseven to be exact and every meter is impenetrable there are magnesium pipes crisscrossing the water spaced above and below the surface to permit the free flow of underwater life but capable of setting off alarms on the east bank are interlocking ground grids all weightsensing anything over ninety pounds instantly sets off sirens and television monitors and spotlights zero in on any intruder over that weight and even if an eightyninepound wonder reached the fence hed be electrically rendered unconscious on the first touch that also goes for the magnesium pipes in the river of course falling trees or floating logs and the heavier animals keep our security forces on the run its good discipline i suppose then there are only the tunnels said bourne is that right you came through one what can i tell you that you didnt see except that iron gates literally crash down at the slightest irregularity and in emergencies all the tunnels can be flooded all of which carlos knows he was trained here many years ago krupkin told me many years agreed jason i wonder how much things have changed technologically you could probably fill a few volumes especially in communications and security but not the basics not the tunnels or the miles of grids in and out of the water theyre built for a couple of centuries as far as the compounds go therere always some minor adjustments but i dont think theyd tear up the streets or the buildings itd be easier to move a dozen cities so whatever the changes theyre essentially internal they reached a miniature intersection where an argumentative driver of an earlyseventies chevrolet was being given a ticket for a traffic violation by an equally disagreeable policeman whats that all about asked bourne the purpose of the assignment is to instill a degree of contentiousness on the part of the one driving the car in america a person will frequently often loudly argue with a police officer its not the case here like in questioning authority such as a student contradicting his professor i dont imagine thats too popular either thats also entirely different im glad you think so jason heard a distant hum and looked up at the sky a light singleengine seaplane was flying south following the volkhov river my god airborne he said as if to himself forget it countered benjamin its ours technology again one theres no place to land except patrolled helicopter pads and two were shielded by radar an unidentified plane coming within thirty miles of here the air base at belopol is alerted and its shot down across the street a small crowd had gathered watching the disagreeable policeman and the argumentative driver who had slammed his hand down on the roof of the chevrolet as the crowd vocally encouraged him americans can be very foolish mumbled the young trainer his embarrassment showing at least someones idea of americans can be said bourne smiling lets go said benjamin starting to walk away i personally pointed out that the assignment wasnt very realistic but it was explained to me that instilling the attitude was important like telling a student that he can actually argue with a professor or a citizen that he can publicly criticize a member of the politburo they are strange attitudes arent they pound sand archie relax young lenin said jason coming alongside the trainer wheres your la cool i left it in the la brea tar pits i want to study the maps all of them its been arranged also the other ground rules they sat in a conference room at staff headquarters the large rectangular table covered with maps of the entire novgorod complex bourne could not help himself even after nearly four hours of concentration he frequently shook his head in sheer astonishment the series of deepcover training grounds along the volkhov were more expansive and more intricate than he had thought possible benjamins remark that it would be easier to move a dozen cities rather than drastically alter novgorod was a simple statement of fact not too much of an exaggeration scaleddown replicas of towns and cities waterfronts and airports military and scientific installations from the mediterranean to the atlantic north to the baltic and up the gulf of bothnia were represented within its boundaries all in addition to the american acreage yet for all the massive detail suggestion and miniaturization made it possible to place everything within barely thirty miles of riverfront wilderness at a depth ranging from three to five miles egypt israel italy began jason circling the table staring down at the maps greece portugal spain france the uk he rounded the corner as benjamin interrupted leaning wearily back in a chair germany the netherlands and the scandinavian countries as i explained most of the compounds include two separate and distinct countries usually where there are common boundaries cultural similarities or just to conserve space there are basically nine major compounds representing all the major nationsmajor to our interestsand therefore nine tunnels approximately seven kilometers apart starting with the one here and heading north along the river then the first tunnel next to ours is the uk right yes followed by france then spainwhich includes portugalthen across the mediterranean beginning with egypt along with israel its clear broke in jason sitting down at the end of the table bringing his clasped hands together in thought did you get word up the line that theyre to admit anyone with those papers carlos has no matter what he looks like no what bourne snapped his head toward the young trainer i had comrade krupkin do that hes in a moscow hospital so they cant lock him up here for training fatigue how can i cross over into another compound quickly if necessary then youre ready for the rest of the ground rules im ready theres only so much these maps can tell me okay benjamin reached into his pocket and withdrew a small black object the size of a credit card but somewhat thicker he tossed it to jason who caught it in midair and studied it thats your passport continued the soviet only the senior staff has them and if ones lost or misplaced for even a few minutes its reported immediately theres no id no writing or marking at all its all inside computerized and coded each compound checkpoint has a clearing lock you insert it and the barriers are raised admitting you and telling the guards that youre cleared from headquartersand noted damned clever these backward marxists they had the same little dears for just about every hotel room in los angeles and that was four years ago now for the rest the ground rules krupkin calls them protective measuresfor us as well as you frankly he doesnt think youll get out of here alive and if you dont youre to be deepfried and lost how nicely realistic he likes you bourne archie go on as far as the senior staff is concerned youre undercover personnel from the inspector generals office in moscow an american specialist sent in to check on novgorod leaks to the west youre to be given whatever you need including weapons but no one is to talk to you unless you talk to him first considering my own background im your liaison anything you want you relay through me im grateful maybe not entirely said benjamin you dont go anywhere without me thats unacceptable thats the way it is no its not why not because i wont be impeded and if i do get out of here id like a certain benjamins mother to find him alive and well and commuting to moscow the young russian stared at bourne strength mingled with no little pain in his eyes you really think you can help my father and me i know i can so help me play by my rules benjamin youre a strange man im a hungry man can we get some food around here and maybe a little bandage i got hit a while back and after today my neck and shoulders are letting me know it jason removed his jacket his shirt was drenched in blood jesus christ ill call a doctor no you wont just a medic thats all my rules ben okayarchie were staying at the visiting commissars suite its on the top floor weve got room service and ill ring the infirmary for a nurse i said im hungry and uncomfortable but theyre not my major concerns not to worry said the soviet californian the instant anything unusual happens anywhere well be reached ill roll up the maps it happened at precisely am directly after the universal changing of the guard during the darkest darkness of the night the telephone in the commissars suite screamed propel ling benjamin off the couch he raced across the room to the jangling insistent instrument and yanked it off its cradle yes gdye kogda shto eto znachit da he slammed the phone down and turned to bourne at the dinner table the maps of novgorod having replaced the roomservice dishes its unbelievable at the spanish tunnelacross the river two guards are dead and on this side the officer of the watch was found fifty yards away from his post a bullet in his throat they ran the video tapes and all they saw was an unidentified man walking through carrying a duffel bag in a guards uniform there was something else wasnt there asked delta coldly yes and you may be right on the other side was a dead farmhand clutching torn papers in his hand he was lying between the two murdered guards one of them stripped to his shorts and shoes how did he do it he was the good guy i cant think of anything else mused bourne rising quickly and reaching pouncing on the map of the spanish compound he must have sent in his paid impostor with the rotten mockedup papers then ran in himself the wounded komitet officer at the last moment exposing the fraud and speaking the foreign language which his impostor couldnt do and couldnt understand i told you ben probe test agitate confuse and find a way in stealing a uniform is standard and in the confusion it got him through the tunnel but anyone using those papers was to be watched followed they were your instructions and krupkin sent the word up the line the kubinka said jason now pensive as he studied the map the armory the one mentioned in the news bulletins from moscow exactly just as he had done at the kubinka carlos has someone inside here someone with enough authority to order an expendable officer of the guard to bring anyone penetrating the tunnel to him before sending out alarms and raising headquarters thats possible agreed the young trainer rapidly firmly involving headquarters with false alarms can be embarrassing and as you say there must have been a lot of confusion in paris said bourne glancing up from the compound map i was told that embarrassment was the kgbs worst enemy true on a scale of one to ten at least eight replied benjamin but who would he have in here who could he have he hasnt been here in over thirty years if we had a couple of hours and a few computers programmed with the records of everyone in novgorod we might be able to feed in several hundred names and come up with possibilities but we dont have hours we dont even have minutes also if i know the jackal it wont matter i think it matters one whole hell of a lot cried the americanized soviet theres a traitor here and we should know who it is my guess is that youll find out soon enough details ben the point is hes here lets go and when we get outside we stop somewhere and you get me what i need okay everything i need im cleared for that and then you disappear i know what im talking about no way josé california checking in again you heard me then young benjamins mother may find a corpse for a son when she gets back to moscow so be it so be why did you have to say that i dont know it just seemed right shut up lets get out of here ilich ramirez sanchez snapped his fingers twice in the shadows as he climbed the short steps of the miniaturized entrance to a small church in madrids paseo del prado the duffel bag in his left hand from behind a fluted mock pillar a figure emerged a heavyset man in his early sixties who walked partially into the dim light of a distant streetlamp he was dressed in the uniform of a spanish army officer a lieutenant general with three rows of ribbons affixed to his tunic he was carrying a leather suitcase he raised it slightly and spoke in the compounds language come inside to the vestry you can change there that illfitting guards jacket is an invitation for sharpshooters its good to speak our language again said carlos following the man inside the tiny church and turning stiffly to close the heavy door im in your debt enrique he added glancing around at the empty rows of pews and the soft lights playing upon the altar the gold crucifix gleaming youve been in my debt for over thirty years ramirez and a lot of good it does me laughed the soldier quietly as they proceeded across to the right aisle and down toward the sacristy then perhaps youre out of touch with what remains of your family in baracoa fidels own brothers and sisters dont live half so well neither does crazy fidel but he doesnt care they say he bathes more frequently now and i suppose thats progress however youre talking about my family in baracoa what about me my fine international assassin no yachts no racing colors shame on you were it not for my warning you you would have been executed in this very compound thirtythree years ago come to think of it it was right outside this idiotic dollhouse church on the prado that you made your escapedressed as a priest a figure that perpetually bewilders the russian like most everyone else once i was established did you ever lack for anything they entered a small paneled room where supposed prelates prepared the sacraments did i ever refuse you carlos added placing the heavy duffel bag on the floor im joking with you of course objected enrique smiling goodnaturedly and looking at the jackal where is that lusty humor of yours my infamous old friend i have other things on my mind im sure you do and in truth you were never less than generous where my family in cuba was concerned and i thank you my father and mother lived out their lives in peace and comfort bewildered naturally but so much better off than anyone they knew it was all so insane revolutionaries thrown out by their own revolutions leaders you were threats to castro as was che its past a great deal has passed agreed enrique studying carlos youve aged poorly ramirez wheres that once full head of dark hair and the handsome strong face with the clear eyes we wont talk about it very well i grow fat you grow thin that tells me something how badly are you wounded i can function well enough for what i intend to dowhat i must do ramirez what else is there asked the costumed soldier suddenly hes dead moscow takes credit over the radio for his death but when you reached me i knew the credit was yours the kill yours jason bourne is dead your enemy is gone from this world youre not well go back to paris and heal yourself ill get you out the same way i got you in well head into france and ill clear the way you will be a courier from the commandant of spain and portugal whos sending a confidential message to dzerzhinsky square its done all the time no one trusts anyone here especially his own gates you wont even have to take the risk of killing a single guard no a lesson must be taught then let me phrase it another way when you called with your emergency codes i did what you demanded for by and large you have fulfilled your obligations to me obligations that go back thirtythree years but now there is another risk involvedrisks to be preciseand im not sure i care to take them you speak this way to me cried the jackal removing the dead guards jacket his clean white bandages taut holding his right shoulder firm with no evidence of blood stop your theatrics said enrique softly we go back long before that im speaking to a young revolutionary i followed out of cuba with a great athlete named santos how is he by the way he was the real threat to fidel hes well answered carlos his voice flat were moving le coeur du soldat does he still tend to his gardenshis english gardens yes he does he should have been a landscaper or a florist i think and i should have been a fine agricultural engineer an agronomist as they saythats how santos and i met you know melodramatic politics changed our lives didnt they political commitments changed them everywhere the fascists changed them and now we want to be like the fascists and they want to take whats not so terrible about us communists and spread a little money aroundwhich doesnt really work but its a nice thought what has this to do with meyour monseigneur horse droppings ramirez as you may or may not know my russian wife died a number of years ago and i have three children in the moscow university without my position they would not be there and i want them there they will be scientists doctors you see those are the risks you ask of me ive covered myself up until this momentand you deserve this momentbut perhaps no more in a few months i will retire and in recognition of my years of service in southern europe and the mediterranean i will share a fine dacha on the black sea where my children will come and visit me i will not unduly risk what life i have before me so be specific ramirez and ill tell you whether youre on your own or not i repeat your getting in here cannot be traced to me and as i say you deserved that much but this is where i may be forced to stop i see said carlos approaching the suitcase enrique had placed on the sacristy table i hope you do and further i hope you understand over the years youve been good to my family in ways that i could never be but then ive served you well in ways that i could i led you to rodchenko fed you names in ministries where rumors abounded rumors rodchenko himself investigated for you so my old revolutionary comrade ive not been idle on your behalf either however things are different now were not young firebrands in search of a cause any longer for weve lost our appetites for causesyou long before me of course my cause remains constant interrupted the jackal sharply it is myself and all those who serve me ive served you youve made that clear as well as my generosity to you and yours and now that im here you wonder if i deserve further assistance thats it isnt it i must protect myself why are you here i told you to teach a lesson to leave a message they are one and the same yes carlos opened the suitcase it held a coarse shirt a portuguese fishermans cap with the appropriate ropebelted trousers and a seamans shoulderstrapped canvas satchel why these asked the jackal theyre loosefitting and i havent seen you in yearsnot since málaga in the early seventies i think i couldnt very well have clothes tailored for you and im glad i didnt tryyou are not as i remembered you ramirez youre not much larger than i remember you countered the assassin a little thicker around the stomach perhaps but were still the same height the same basic frame so what does that mean in a moment have things changed a great deal since we were together here constantly photographs arrive and construction crews follow a day later the prado here in madrid has new shops new signs even a few new sewers as they are changed in that city also lisbon and the piers along the bay and tagus river have been altered to conform to the changes that have taken place we are nothing if not authentic the candidates who complete the training are literally at home wherever theyre initially sent sometimes i really believe its all excessive then i recall my first assignment at the naval base in barcelona and realize how comfortable i was i went right to work because the psychological orientation had already taken place there were no major surprises youre describing appearances broke in carlos of course what else is there more permanent structures that are not so apparent not so much in evidence such as warehouses fuel depots fire stations that are not part of the duplicated scenery are they still where they were by and large yes certainly the major warehouses and the fuel depots with their underground tanks most are still west of the san roque district the gibraltar access what about going from one compound to another now that has changed enrique withdrew a small flat object from the pocket of his tunic each border crossing has a computerized registration release that permits entry when this is inserted no questions are asked only at novgorods capital headquarters if there are any questions i dont understand if one of these is lost or stolen its reported instantly and the internal codes are nullified i see i dont why these questions again why are you here what is this lesson this message the san roque district said carlos as if remembering thats about three or four kilometers south of the tunnel isnt it a small waterfront village no the gibraltar access yes and the next compound is france of course and then england and finally the largest the united states yes its all clear to me everythings come back the jackal turned away his right hand awkwardly disappearing beneath his trousers yet nothing is clear to me said enrique his low voice threatening and it must be answer me ramirez why are you here how dare you question me like this continued carlos his back to his old associate how dare any of you question the monseigneur from paris you listen to me priest piss ant you answer me or i walk out of here and youre a dead monseigneur in a matter of minutes very well enrique answered ilich ramirez sanchez addressing the paneled wall of the sacristy my message will be triumphantly clear and will shake the very foundations of the kremlin not only did carlos the jackal kill the weak pretender jason bourne on soviet soil he left a reminder to all russia that the komitet made a colossal error in not utilizing my extraordinary talents really now said enrique laughing softly as if humoring a far less than extraordinary man more melodramatics ramirez and how will you convey this reminder this message this supreme statement of yours quite simply replied the jackal turning a gun in his hand the silencer intact we have to change places what im going to burn novgorod carlos fired a single shot into the upper throat of enrique he wanted as little blood as possible on the tunic dressed in combat fatigues with the insignias of an army major on the shoulders of his field jacket bourne blended in with the sporadic appearances of military personnel as they crisscrossed the american compound from one sector to another on their night patrols there were not many perhaps thirty men covering the entire acreage of the eight square miles according to benjamin in the metropolitan areas they were generally on foot in pairs in the rural districts they drove military vehicles the young trainer had requisitioned a jeep from the commissars suite at us headquarters they had been taken to a military warehouse west of the river where benjamins papers gained them entrance and the jeep inside the astonished interior guards watched as the silent bourne was outfitted with a field uniform complete with a carbine bayonet a standard automatic and five clips of live ammunition this last obtained only after an authorization call was placed to krupkins unknowing subordinates at capital hq once again outside jason complained what about the flares i wanted and at least three or four grenades you agreed to get me everything i needed not half of it theyre coming answered benjamin speeding out of the warehouse parking lot the flares are over at motor vehicles and grenades arent part of normal ordnance theyre in steel vaults down at the tunnelall the tunnelsunder emergency weapons the young trainer glanced at bourne a glimmering of humor seen on his face in the glow of the headlights washing over the roofless jeep in anticipation of a nato assault most likely thats stupid wed come in from the sky not with the air base ninety seconds flying time away hurry up i want those grenades will we have any trouble getting them not if krupkin keeps up the good work krupkin had with the flares in hand the tunnel was their last supply stop four russian army grenades were counted out and counter signed by benjamin where to he asked as the soldier in an american uniform returned to the concrete guardhouse these arent exactly us general issue said jason putting the grenades carefully one by one into the pockets of his field jacket theyre not for training either the compounds arent militaryoriented but basically civilian if those are ever used its not for indoctrination purposes where do we go now check with headquarters first see if anythings happened at any of the border checkpoints my beeper would have gone off i dont trust beepers i like words interrupted jason get on the radio benjamin did so switching to the russian language and using the codes that only senior staff were assigned the terse soviet reply came over the speaker the young trainer replaced the microphone and turned to bourne no activity at all he said just some intercompound fuel deliveries what are they petrol distribution mainly some compounds have larger tanks than others so logistics call for routine apportionments until the main supplies are shipped downriver they distribute at night its far better than those trucks clogging up the streets during the day remember everythings scaled down here also weve been driving through the back roads but theres a maintenance army in the central locations cleaning up stores and offices and restaurants getting ready for tomorrows assignments large trucks wouldnt help christ it is disneyland all right head for the spanish border pedro to get there we have to pass through england and france i dont suppose it matters much but i dont speak french or spanish do you french fluently spanish acceptably anything else maybe youd better drive the jackal braked the huge fuel truck at the west german border it was as far as he intended to go the remaining northernmost areas of scandinavia and the netherlands were the lesser satellites the impact of their destruction was not comparable to that of the lower compounds and the time element spared them everything was timing now and west germany would initiate the wholesale conflagrations he adjusted the coarse portuguese shirt that covered a spanish generals tunic beneath and as the guard came out of the gatehouse carlos spoke in russian using the same words he had used at every other crossing dont ask me to speak the stupid language you talk here i deliver petrol i dont spend time in classrooms heres my key i barely speak it myself comrade said the guard laughing as he accepted the small flat cardlike object and inserted it into the computerized machine the heavy iron barrier arced up into the vertical position the guard returned the key and the jackal sped through into a miniaturized west berlin he raced through the narrow replica of the kurfürstendamm to the budapesterstrasse where he slowed down and pulled out the petcock release the fuel flowed into the street he then reached into the open duffel bag on the seat beside him ripped out the small pretimed plastique explosives and as he had done throughout the southern compounds to the border of france hurled them through the lowered windows on both sides of the truck into the foundations of the wooden buildings he thought most flammable he sped into the munich sector then to the port of bremerhaven on the river and finally into bonn and the scaleddown versions of the embassies in bad godesberg flooding the streets distributing the explosives he looked at his watch it was time to head back he had barely fifteen minutes before the first detonations took place in all of west germany followed by the explosions in the combined compounds of italygreece israelegypt and spainportugal each spaced eight minutes apart timed to create maximum chaos there was no way the individual fire brigades could contain the flaming streets and buildings in the disparate sectors of their compounds north of france others would be ordered in from adjacent compounds only to be recalled when the fires erupted on their own grounds it was a simple formula for cosmic confusion the cosmos being the false universe of novgorod the border gates would be flagged open frantic traffic unimpeded and to complete the devastation the genius that was ilich ramirez sanchezbrought into the world of terror as carlos the jackal by the errors of that same novgorodhad to be in paris not his paris but the hated novgorods paris and he would burn it to the ground in ways the maniacs of the third reich never dreamed of then would come england and finally ultimately the largest compound in the despised isolated illusionist novgorod where he would leave his triumphant messagethe united states of america breeder of the apostate assassin jason bourne the statement would be as pure and as clear as alpine water washing over the blood of a destroyed false universe i alone have done this my enemies are dead and i live carlos checked his duffel bag what remained were the most lethal instruments of death found in the arsenal of kubinka four layered rows of shortpackaged heatseeking missiles twenty in all each capable of blowing up the entire base of the washington monument and once fused and unshielded each would seek the sources of fire and do its work satisfied the jackal shut off the fuel release turned around and sped back to the border gate the sleepy technician at capital headquarters blinked his eyes and stared at the green letters on the screen in front of him what he read did not really make sense but the clearances went unchallenged for the fifth time the commandant of the spanish compound had crossed and recrossed the north borders up into germany and was now heading back into france twice before when the codes were transmitted and in accord with the maximum alert that was in force the technician had phoned the gates of israel and italy and was told that only a fuel truck had passed through that was the information he had given to a codecleared trainer named benjamin but now he wondered why would such a highranking official be driving a fuel truck on the other hand why not novgorod was rife with corruption everyone suspected that so perhaps the commandant was either seeking out the corrupters or collecting his fees at night regardless since there was no report of a lost or stolen card and the computers raised no objections it was better to leave well enough alone one never knew who his next superior might be voici ma carte said bourne to the guard at the border crossing as he handed the man his computerized card vite sil vous plaît da oui replied the guard walking rapidly to the clearance machine as an enormous fuel truck heading the other way passed through into england dont press the french too much said benjamin in the front seat beside jason these cats do their best but theyre not linguists califfornia here i come sang bourne softly you sure you and your father dont want to join your mother in la shut up the guard returned saluted and the iron barrier was raised jason accelerated and saw in a matter of moments bathed in floodlights a threestory replica of the eiffel tower in the distance to the right was a miniature champselysées with a wooden reproduction of the arc de triomphe high enough to be unmistakable absently bournes mind wandered back to those fitful terrible hours when he and marie had raced all over paris trying desperately to find each other marie oh god marie i want to come back i want to be david again he and iwere so much older now he doesnt frighten me any longer and i dont anger him who which of us oh christ hold it said benjamin touching jasons arm slow down what is it stop cried the young trainer pull over and shut off the engine whats the matter with you im not sure benjamins neck was arched back his eyes on the clear night sky and the shimmering lights of the stars no clouds he said cryptically no storms its not raining either so what i want to get up to the spanish compound there it goes again what the hell are you talking about and then bourne heard it far away the sound of distant thunder yet the night was clear it happened againand again and again one deep rumble after another there shouted the young soviet from los angeles standing up in the jeep and pointing to the north what is it thats fire young man answered jason softly hesitantly as he also stood up and stared at the pulsating yellow glow that lit up the distant sky and my guess is that its the spanish compound he was initially trained there and thats what he came back to doto blow the place up its his revenge get down weve got to get up there no youre wrong broke in benjamin quickly lowering himself into the seat as bourne started the engine and yanked the jeep into gear spains no more than five or six miles from here those fires are a lot farther away just show me the fastest route said jason pressing the accelerator to the floor under the trainers swiftly roving eyes accompanied by sudden shouts of turn here and go right and straight down this road they raced through paris and north into successive sectors labeled marseilles montbéliard le havre strasbourg and so many others circling town squares and passing quaint streets and miniaturized city blocks until finally they were in sight of the spanish border the closer they came the louder were the booms in the distance the brighter the yellow night sky the guards at the gate were furiously manning their telephones and handheld radios the twonote blasts of sirens joined the shouting and the screaming as police cars and fire engines appeared seemingly out of nowhere racing into the streets of madrid on their way to the next northern border crossing whats happening yelled benjamin leaping from the jeep and dropping all pretense of novgorod training by speaking russian im senior staff he added slipping the card into the release equipment snapping the barrier up tell me insanity comrade shouted an officer from the gatehouse window unbelievable its as if the earth went crazy first germany all over there are explosions and fires in the streets and buildings going up in flames the ground trembles and we are told its some kind of massive earthquake then it happens in italyrome is torched and in the greek sector athens and the port of piraeus are filled with fires everywhere and still the explosions continue the streets in flames what does capital headquarters say they dont know what to say the earthquake nonsense was just thatnonsense everyones in panic issuing orders and then countermanding them another wall phone rang inside the gatehouse the officer of the guard picked it up and listened then instantly screamed at the top of his lungs madness its complete madness are you certain what is it roared benjamin rushing to the window egypt he screamed his ear pressed to the telephone israel cairo and tel avivfires everywhere bombs everywhere no one can keep up with the devastation the trucks crash into one another in the narrow streets the hydrants are blown up water flows in the gutters but the streets are still in flames and some idiot just got on the line and asked if the no smoking signs were properly placed while the wooden buildings are on their way to becoming rubble idiots they are all idiots get back here yelled bourne having made the jeep lurch through the gate hes in here somewhere you drive and ill jasons words were cut off by a deafening explosion up ahead in the center of madrids paseo del prado it was an enormous detonation lumber and stone arcing up into the flaming sky then as if the paseo itself were a living throbbing immense wall of fire the flames rolled forward swinging to the left out of the city into the road that was the approach to the border gate look shouted bourne reaching down out of the jeep his hand scraping the graveled surface beneath he brought his fingers to his face his nostrils christ he roared the whole goddamned roads soaked with gasoline a burst of fire imploded thirty yards in front of the jeep sending stones and dirt smashing into the metal grille and propelling the flames forward with increasing speed plastics said jason to himself then yelled at benjamin who was running to the jeep go back there get everyone out of here the son of a bitch has the place ringed with plastics head for the river im going with you shouted the young soviet grabbing the edge of the door sorry junior cried bourne gunning the engine and swerving the army vehicle back into the open gate sending benjamin sprawling onto the gravel this is for grownups what are you doing screamed benjamin his voice fading as the jeep sped across the border the fuel truck that lousy fuel truck whispered jason as he raced into strasbourg france it happened in pariswhere else but paris the huge duplicate of the eiffel tower blew up with such force that the earth shook rockets missiles the jackal had stolen missiles from the kubinka armory seconds later starting far behind him the explosions began as the streets burst into flames everywhere all france was being destroyed in a way that the madman adolf hitler could only have envisaged in his most twisted dreams panicked men and women ran through the alleyways and the streets screaming falling praying to gods their leaders had forsworn england he had to get into england and then ultimately into america where all his instincts told him the end would comeone way or another he had to find the truck that was being driven by the jackal and destroy both he could do ithe could do it carlos thought he was dead and that was the key for the jackal would do what he had to do what he jason bourne would do if he were carlos when the holocaust he had ignited was at its zenith the jackal would abandon the truck and put into play his means of escapehis escape to paris the real paris where his army of old men would spread the word of their monseigneurs triumph over the ubiquitous disbelieving soviets it would be somewhere near the tunnel that was a given the race through london coventry and portsmouth could only be likened to the newsreel footage from world war ii depicting the carnage hurled down on great britain by the luftwaffe compounded by first the screaming and then the silent terror of the v and v rockets but the residents of novgorod were not britishforbearance gave way to mass hysteria concern for all became survival for self alone as the impressive reproductions of big ben and the houses of parliament crashed down in flames and the aircraft factories of coventry were reduced to raging fires the streets swelled with screaming horrified crowds racing through the roads that led to the volkhov river and the shipyards of portsmouth there from the scaleddown piers and slips scores threw themselves into rushing waters only to be caught in the magnesium grids where sharp jagged bolts of electricity blazingly zigzagged through the air leaving limp bodies floating toward the next metal traps above and below the angry surface in paralyzed fragments the crowds watched and turned in panic fighting their way back into the miniaturized city of portsea the guards had abandoned their posts and chaos ruled the night snapping on the jeeps searchlight bourne drove in sudden spurts down alleyways and the less crowded narrow streetssouth always south he grabbed a flare from the army vehicles floor pulled the release string and proceeded to thrust the spitting hissing blinding burst of fire into the hands and faces of the hysterical racing stragglers who tried to climb on board the sight of the constantly pulsating flame so close to their eyes was enough each screamed and recoiled in terror no doubt thinking yet another explosive had detonated in his or her immediate vicinity a graveled road the gates to the american compound were less than a hundred yards away the graveled road soaked with fuel the plastic charges had not gone offbut they would in a matter of moments creating a wall of fire enveloping the jeep and its driver with the accelerator pressed to the floor jason raced to the gate it was desertedand the iron barrier was down he slammed on the brakes skidding to a stop hoping beyond reasonable hope that no sparks would fly out and ignite the gravel placing the spewing flare on the metal floor he swiftly removed two grenades from his pocketsgrenades he was loath to part withpulled the pins and hurled both toward the gate the massive explosions blew the barricade away and instantly set the graveled road on fire the leaping flames immediateenveloping him he had no choice he threw the hot flare away and sped through the tunnel of fire into novgorods final largest compound as he did so the concrete guardhouse at the english border exploded glass stone and shards of metal shot out and up everywhere he had been so filled with anxiety on their way to the crossing into spain that he barely recalled the diminutive replicas of the american cities and towns much less the fastest routes that led to the tunnel he had merely followed young benjamins harsh shouted commands but he did remember that the californiabred trainer kept referring to the coast roadlike route one man up to carmel it was of course those streets closest to the volkhov which in turn became in no order of geographical sequence a shoreline in maine the potomac river of washington and the northern waters of long island sound that housed the naval base at new london the madness had reached america police cars their sirens wailing sped through the streets men shouting into radios as people in various stages of dress and undress ran out of buildings and stores screaming about the terrible earthquake that had hit this leg of the volkhov one even more severe than the catastrophe in armenia even with the surest knowledge of devastating infiltration the leaders of novgorod could not reveal the truth it was as if the seismic geologists of the world were forgotten their discoveries unfounded the giant forces beneath the earth did not collide and erupt in terrible swift immediacy instead they worked in relays sending a series of crippling body blows from north to south who questions authority in the panic of survival everyone in america was being prepared primed for what they knew not they found out roughly ten minutes after the destruction of a large part of the diminutive great britain bourne reached the compressed miniaturized outlines of washington dc when the conflagration began the first to plunge into flames the sound of its detonation delayed only by milliseconds was the wooden duplicate of the capitol dome it blew into the yellowed sky like the thin hollow replica it was moments lateronly momentsthe washington monument centered in its patch of grassy park crumpled with a distant boom as if its false base had been shoveled away by a thunderous groundmoving machine in seconds the artificial set piece that was the white house collapsed in flames the explosions dulled both audibly and visibly for pennsylvania avenue was awash in fire bourne knew where he was now the tunnel was between washington and new london connecticut it was no more than five minutes away he drove the jeep down to the street paralleling the river and again there were frightened hysterical crowds the police were shouting through loudspeakers first in english and then in russian explaining the terrible consequences if anyone tried to swim across the water the searchlights swinging back and forth picking up the floating bodies of those who had tried in the northern compounds the tunnel the tunnel open the tunnel the screams from the excited crowds became a chant that could not physically be denied the underground pipeline was about to be assaulted jason leaped out of the surrounded jeep pocketing the remaining three flares and propelled his way arms and shoulders working furiously often fruitlessly through the crushing crashing bodies there was nothing else for it he pulled out a flare and ripped the release from its recess the spewing flame had its effect heat and fire were catalysts he ran through the crowd pummeling everyone in front of him shoving the blinding spitting flare into terrified faces until he reached the front and faced a cordon of guards in the uniforms of the united states army it was crazy insane the world had gone nuts no there in the fencedoff parking lot was the fuel truck he broke through the cordon of guards holding up his computerized release card and ran up to the soldier with the highestranking insignia on his uniform a colonel with an ak strapped to his waist who was as panicked as any officer of high rank he had ever seen since saigon my identification is with the name archie and you can clear it immediately even now i refuse to speak our language only english is that understood discipline is discipline togda yelled the officer questioning the moment then instantly returning to english in a maddeningly boston accent of course we know of you he cried but what can i do this is an uncontrollable riot has anyone passed through the tunnel in the last say half hour no one absolutely no one our orders are to keep the tunnel closed at all costs good get on the loudspeakers and disperse the crowds tell them the crisis has passed and the danger with it how can i the fires are everywhere the explosions everywhere theyll stop soon how do you know that i know do as i say do as he says roared a voice behind bourne it was benjamin his face and shirt drenched with sweat and i hope to hell you know what youre talking about where did you come from where you know how is another question try scaring the shit out of capital hq for a chopper ordered by an apoplectic krupkin from a hospital bed in moscow apoplecticnot bad for a russian who gives me such orders yelled the officer of the guard you are only a young man check me out buddy but do it quick answered benjamin holding out his card otherwise i think ill have you transferred to tashkent nice scenery but no private toilets move you asshole califfornia here i shut up hes here theres the fuel truck over there jason pointed to the huge vehicle that dwarfed the scattered cars and vans in the fenced parking area a fuel truck how did you figure it out asked the astonished benjamin that tanks got to hold close to a hundred thousand pounds combined with the plastics strategically placed its enough for the streets and those fake structures of old dried wood slushaytye blared the myriad loudspeakers around the tunnel demanding attention as indeed the explosions began to diminish the colonel climbed on top of the low concrete gate house a microphone in his hand his figure outlined in the harsh beams of powerful searchlights the earthquake has passed he cried in russian and although the damage is extensive and the fires will continue throughout the night the crisis has passed stay by the banks of the river and our comrades in the maintenance crews will do their best to provide for your needs these are orders from our superiors comrades do not give us reason to use force i plead with you what earthquake shouted a man in the front ranks of the panicked multitude you say its an earthquake and we are all told it is an earthquake but your brains are in your bowels ive lived through an earthquake and this is no earthquake it is an armed attack yes yes an attack we are being attacked invaded its an invasion open the tunnel and let us out or youll have to shoot us down open the tunnel the protesting chorus grew from all sections of the desperate crowd as the soldiers held firm their bayonets unsheathed and affixed to their rifles the colonel continued his features contorted his voice nearly matching the hysteria of his frenzied audience listen to me and ask yourselves a question he screamed im telling you as i have been told that this is an earthquake and i know its true further i will tell you how i know its true have you heard a single gunshot yes that is the question a single gunshot no you have not here as in all the compounds and in every sector of those compounds there are police and soldiers and trainers who carry weapons their orders are to repel by force any unwarranted displays of violence to say nothing of armed invaders yet nowhere has there been any gunfire whats he shouting about asked jason turning to benjamin hes trying to convince them it isor wasan earthquake they dont believe him they think its an invasion hes telling them it couldnt be because theres been no gunfire gunfire thats his proof nobodys shooting at anybody and they sure as hell would be if there was an armed attack no gunshots no attack gunshots bourne suddenly grabbed the young soviet and spun him around tell him to stop for gods sake stop him what hes giving the jackal the opening he wantshe needs now what are you talking about gunfire gunshots confusion nyet screamed a woman breaking through the crowd and shouting at the officer in the center of the searchlight beams the explosions are bombs they come from bombers above you are foolish cried the colonel replying in russian if it was an air raid our fighter planes from belopol would fill the sky the explosions come out of the earth the fires out of the earth from the gases below these false words were the last words the soviet officer would ever speak a staccato volley of automatic gunfire burst from the shadows of the tunnels parking area cutting the russian down his instantly limp punctured body collapsing and falling off the roof of the gatehouse plummeting to the ground out of sight at the rear the already frantic crowd went rabid the ranks of uniformed american soldiers broke and if chaos had ruled previously nihilistic mobocracy now reigned supreme the narrow fenced entrance to the tunnel was virtually stormed racing figures colliding pummeling climbing over one another rushing en masse toward the mouth of the underwater access jason pulled his young trainer to the side of the stampeding hordes never for an instant taking his eyes off the darkened parking area can you operate the tunnels machinery he shouted yes everyone on the senior staff can its part of the job the iron gates you told me about of course where are the mechanisms the guardhouse get in there yelled bourne taking one of the three remaining flares out of his field jacket pocket and handing it to benjamin ive got two more of these and two other grenades when you see one of my flares go over the crowd lower those gates on this sideonly this side understood what for my rules ben do it then ignite this flare and throw it out the window so ill know its done then what something you may not want to do but you have to take the fortyseven from the colonels body and force the crowd shoot it back into the street rapid fire into the ground in front of themor above themdo whatever you have to do even if it means wounding a few whatever the cost it must be done i have to find him isolate him above all cut him off from everyone else trying to get out youre a goddamned maniac broke in benjamin the veins pronounced in his forehead i could kill a fewmore than a few youre crazy at this moment im the most rational man youve ever met interrupted jason harshly rapidly as the panicked residents of novgorod kept rushing by theres not a sane general in the soviet armythe same army that retook stalingradwho wouldnt agree with me its called the calculated estimate of losses and theres a very good reason for that lousy verbiage it simply means youre paying a lot less for what youre getting now than youd pay later youre asking too much these people are my comrades my friends theyre russians would you fire into a crowd of americans one recoil of my handsan inch two inches with a fortysevenand i could maim or kill half a dozen people the risks too great you dont have a choice if the jackal gets by meand ill know it if he doesill throw in a grenade and kill twenty you son of a bitch believe it ben where carlos is concerned im a son of a bitch i cant afford him any longer the world cant afford him move the trainer named benjamin spat in bournes face then turned and began fighting his way to the guardhouse and the unseen corpse of the colonel beyond almost unconsciously jason wiped his face with the back of his hand his concentration solely on the fenced parking area his eyes darting from one pocket of shadows to another trying to center in on the origins of the automatic gunfire yet knowing it was pointless the jackal had changed position by then he counted the other vehicles in addition to the fuel truck there were nine parked by the fencetwo station wagons four sedans and three suburban vans all americanmade or simulated as such carlos was concealed beyond one of them or possibly the fuel truck the last unlikely as it was the farthest away from the open gate in the fence that permitted access to the guardhouse and thus to the tunnel jason crouched and crawled forward he reached the waisthigh fence the pandemonium behind him continuous deafening every muscle and joint in his legs and arms pounded with pain cramps were developing everywhere everywhere dont think about them dont acknowledge them youre too close david keep going jason bourne knows what to do trust him aaughh he spun his body over the fence the handle of his sheathed bayonet embedded itself in his kidney there is no pain youre too close davidjason listen to jason the searchlightssomeone had pressed something and they went crazy spinning around in circles abrupt blinding out of control where would carlos go where could he hide the beams were erratically piercing everywhere then from an opening that he could not see from across the fencedin area two police cars raced inside their sirens blaring uniformed men leaped out from every door and contrary to anything he expected to see each scrambled to the borders of the fence behind the cars and the vans one after another dashing from one vehicle to another to the open gate that led to the guardhouse and the tunnel there was a break in space in time in men the last four escapees from the second car were suddenly threeand only moments later did the fourth appearbut he was not the samethe uniform was not the same there were specks of orange and red and the visored officers cap was laced with gold ribbing the visor itself too prominent for the american army the crown of the cap too pointed what was it and suddenly bourne understood fragments of his memories spiraled back years to madrid or casavieja when he was tracing the jackals contracts with the falangists it was a spanish uniform that was it carlos had infiltrated through the spanish compound and as his russian was fluent he was using the highranking uniform to make his escape from novgorod jason lurched to his feet his automatic drawn and ran across the graveled lot his left hand reaching into his field jacket pocket for his secondtolast flare he pulled the release and hurled the fired stalk above the cars beyond the fence benjamin would not see it from the guardhouse and mistake it for the signal to close the gates of the tunnel that signal would come shortlyin seconds perhapsbut at the moment it was premature again perhaps by seconds eto srochno roared one of the escaping men spinning around and panicked at the sight of the hissing blinding flare skoryeye shouted another passing three companions and racing toward the open section of the fence as the whirling searchlights continued their maniacal spinning bourne counted the seven figures as one by one they dashed away from the last car and passed through the opening joining the excited crowds at the mouth of the tunnel the eighth man did not appear the highranking spanish uniform was nowhere in sight the jackal was trapped now jason whipped out his last flare yanked the release and threw it with all his strength over the stream of rushing men and women at the guardhouse do it ben he screamed in silence as he removed the nexttolast grenade from the pocket of his field jacket do it now as if in answer to his fevered plea a thunderous roar came from the tunnel round after round of hysterical protestations punctuated by screams and shrieks and wailing chaos two rapid deafening bursts of automatic gunfire preceded unintelligible commands over the speakers shouted in russian another burst and the same voice continued louder even more authoritative as the crowd momentarily but perceptibly quieted down only to suddenly resume screaming at full volume bourne glanced over astonished to see through the beams of the spinning searchlights the figure of benjamin now standing on the roof of the concrete guardhouse the young trainer was shouting into the microphone exhorting the crowd to follow his instructions whatever they were and whatever they were they were being obeyed the multitude gradually then gathering momentum began reversing directionthen as a single unit started racing back into the street benjamin ignited his flare and waved it pointing to the north he was sending jason his own signal not only was the tunnel shut down but the crowds were being dispersed without anyone being shot with the ak there had been a better way bourne dropped to the ground his eyes scanning the under sides of the stationary vehicles the spewing flame beyond lighting up the open spaces a pair of legsin boots behind the third automobile on the left no more than twenty yards from the break in the fence that led to the tunnel carlos was his the end was at last in sight no time do what you have to do and do it quickly he dropped his weapon on the gravel gripped the grenade in his right hand pulled the pin grabbed the with his left hand and lurched off the ground racing forward roughly thirty feet from the car he dived back down into the gravel turned sideways and heaved the grenade under the automobileonly at the last instant the small bomb having left his hand realizing that he had made a terrible error the legs behind the car did not movethe boots remained in place for they were just that boots he lunged to his right rolling furiously over the sharp stones shielding his face curling his body into the smallest mass he could manage the explosion was deafening the lethal debris joining the whirling beams of the searchlights in the night sky fragments of metal and glass stinging jasons back and legs move move screamed the voice in his minds ears as he lurched to his knees then to his feet in the smoke and fire of the burning automobile as he did so the gravel erupted all around him he zigzagged wildly toward the protection of the nearest vehicle a squareshaped van he was hit twice in his shoulder and thigh he spun around the wall of the van at the precise moment when the large windshield was blown away youre no match for me jason bourne screamed carlos the jackal his automatic weapon on rapid fire you never were you are a pretender a fraud so be it roared bourne then come and get me jason raced to the drivers door yanked it open then ran to the back of the vehicle where he crouched his face to the edge his colt angled straight up next to his cheek with a final hissing expulsion the flare beyond the fence burned itself out as the jackal stopped his continuous fire bourne understood carlos faced the open door unsure indecisive only seconds to go metal against metal a gun barrel was rammed against the door slamming it shut now jason spun around the edge of the van his weapon exploding firing into the spanish uniform blowing the gun out of the jackals hands one two three the shells flew in the airand then they stopped they stopped the explosions replaced by a sickening jamming click as the round in the chamber failed to eject carlos lurched to the ground for his weapon his left arm limp and bleeding but his right hand still strong clutching the gun like the claw of a crazed animal bourne whipped his bayonet out of its scabbard and sprang forward slicing the blade down toward the jackals forearm he was too late carlos held the weapon jason lunged up his left hand clasping the hot barrelhold on hold on you cant let it go twist it clockwise use the bayonetno dont drop it use both hands the conflicting commands clashed in his head madness he had no breath no strength his eyes could not focusthe shoulder like bourne himself the jackal was wounded in his right shoulder hold on reach the shoulder but hold on with a last gasping final surge bourne shot up and crashed carlos back into the side of the van pummeling the wounded area the jackal screamed dropping the weapon then kicked it under the vehicle where the blow came from jason at first did not know he only knew that the left side of his skull seemed suddenly split in two then he realized that he had done it to himself he had slipped on the bloodcovered gravel and had crashed into the metal grille of the van it did not matternothing mattered carlos the jackal was racing away with the rampant confusion everywhere there were a hundred ways he could get out of novgorod it had all been for nothing still there was his last grenade why not bourne removed it pulled the pin and threw it over the van into the center of the parking area the explosion followed and jason got to his feet perhaps the grenade would tell benjamin something warn him to keep his eyes on the area staggering and barely able to walk jason started for the break in the fence that led to the guardhouse and the tunnel oh god marie i failed im so sorry nothing it was for nothing and then as if all novgorod were having a final laugh at his expense he saw that someone had opened the iron gates to the tunnel giving the jackal his invitation to freedom archie benjamins astonished voice floated over the sounds of the river followed by the sight of the young soviet running out of the guardhouse toward bourne christ almighty i thought you were dead so you opened the gates and let my executioner walk away yelled jason weakly why didnt you send a limousine for him i suggest you look again professor replied a breathless benjamin as he stopped in front of bourne studying jasons battered face and bloodstained clothing old age has withered your eyesight what you want gates youll have gates the trainer shouted an order toward the guardhouse in russian seconds later the huge iron gates descended covering the mouth of the tunnel but something was strange bourne had not actually seen the lowered gates before yet these were not like anything he might have imagined they appeared to be swollen somehow distorted perhaps glass said benjamin glass asked a bewildered jason at each end of the tunnel fiveinchthick walls of glass locked and sealed what are you talking about it was not necessary for the young russian to explain suddenly like a series of gigantic waves crashing against the walls of a huge aquarium the tunnel was being filled with the waters of the volkhov river then within the violence of the growing swirling liquid mass there was an object a thing a form a body bourne stared in shock his eyes bulging his mouth gaped frozen in place unable to disgorge the cry that was in him he summoned what strength he had left running unsteadily twice falling to his knees but gathering speed with each stride and raced to the massive wall of glass that sealed the entrance beyond it breathlessly his chest heaving he placed his hands against the glass wall and leaned into it bearing witness to the macabre scene barely inches in front of him the grotesquely uniformed corpse of carlos the jackal kept crashing back and forth into the steel bars of the gate his dark features twisted in hate his eyes two glass orbs reviling death as it overtook him the cold eyes of jason bourne watched in satisfaction his mouth taut rigid the face of a killer a killer among killers who had won briefly however the softer eyes of david webb intruded his lips parted forming the face of a man for whom the weight of a world he loathed had been removed hes gone archie observed benjamin at jasons side that bastard cant come back you flooded the tunnel said bourne simply how did you know it was him you didnt have an automatic weapon but he did frankly i thought krupkins prophecy wasshall we sayborne out you were dead and the man who killed you would take the quickest way out this was it and the uniform confirmed it everything suddenly made sense from the spanish compound down how did you get that crowd away i told them barges were being sent to take them across the riverabout two miles north speaking of krupkin ive got to get you out of here now come on the helicopter pads about a half a mile away well use the jeep hurry up for gods sake krupkins instructions choked from his hospital bed in as much anger as in shock what do you mean you might as well know someone up in the rarefied circlekrupkin doesnt know whoissued the order that you werent to leave here under any conditions put plainly it was unthinkable but then no one ever thought that the whole goddamned novgorod would go up in flames either and thats our cover ours im not your executioner somebody else is the word never reached me and in this mess it wont now wait a minute wheres the chopper taking me cross your fingers professor and hope krupkin and your american friend know what theyre doing the helicopter takes you to yelsk and from there a plane to zomosc across the polish border where an ungrateful satellite has apparently permitted a cia listening post christ ill still be in soviet bloc territory the implication was that your people are ready for you good luck ben said jason studying the young man why are you doing this youre disobeying a direct order i received no order broke in the russian and even if i had im no unthinking robot you had an arrangement and you fulfilled your end also if theres a chance for my mother theres more than a chance interrupted bourne come on lets go were wasting time yelsk and zomosc are only the beginning for you you face a long and dangerous journey archie sundown and the out islands of montserrat were growing darker becoming patches of deep green surrounded by a shimmering blue sea and neverending sprays of white foam erupting from coral reefs off the shorelines all were bathed in the diaphanous orange of the caribbean horizon on tranquility isle lamps were gradually turned on inside the last four villas in the row above the beach at tranquility inn and figures could be seen by and large walking slowly between the rooms and out on the balconies where the rays from the setting sun washed over the terraces the soft breezes carried the scents of hibiscus and poinciana across the tropical foliage as a lone fishing boat weaved its way through the reefs with its lateafternoon catch for the inns kitchen brendan patrick pierre prefontaine carried his perrier out to the balcony of villa seventeen where johnny st jacques stood by the railing sipping a rum and tonic how long do you think it will take before you reopen asked the former judge of the boston court sitting down at the white wroughtiron table the structural damage can be repaired in a matter of weeks replied the owner of tranquility inn but the aftertaste of what happened here will take longer a lot longer again how long ill give it four or five months before i send out the initial brochuresitll be late for the seasons bookings but marie agrees to do anything earlier would not only be tasteless but the urgency would fuel all the gossip again terrorists drug runners corrupt island governmentwe dont need that and we dont deserve it well as i mentioned i can pay my freight said the once honorable justice of the federal district court in massachusetts perhaps not to the extent of your highest seasonal prices dear man but certainly sufficient to cover the costs of a villa plus a little for the inns kitty i told you forget it i owe you more than i can ever repay tranquilitys yours as long as you want to stay st jacques turned from the railing his eyes lingering on the fishing boat below and sat down opposite prefontaine i worry about the people down there in the boats and on the beach i used to have three or four boats bringing in the freshest fish now ive only got one coming in for us and whats left of the staff all of whom are on half salary then you need my money come on judge what money i dont want to appear intrusive but washington gave me a pretty complete rundown on you youve been living off the streets for years ah yes washington pronounced prefontaine raising his glass to the orangeandazure sky as usual it is twelve steps behind the crimetwenty steps where its own criminality is concerned what are you talking about randolph gates thats what im talking aboutwho im talking about that bastard from boston the one who put the jackal on davids trail the touchingly reformed randolph gates johnny reformed in all ways but monetary restitution i might add still nevertheless with the mind and the conscience that i knew at harvard years ago not the brightest not the best but with the literary and oratorical skills that camouflaged a brilliance that was never really there now what the hell are you talking about i visited him the other day at his rehabilitation center in minnesota or michigan i cant actually remember which for i flew first class and the drinks were delivered on request regardless we met and our arrangement was concluded hes changing sides johnny hes now going to fightlegallyfor the people not for the conglomerates who buy and sell on paper he told me hes going after the raiders and the merger brokers who make billions in the markets and cost thousands upon thousands in jobs how can he do that because he was there he did it all he knows all the tricks and is willing to commit his considerable talents to the cause why would he do it because hes got edith back who in gods name is edith his wife actually im still in love with her i was from the time we first met but in those days a distinguished judge with a wife and a child regardless of how repulsive both might be did not pursue such longings randy the grand never deserved her perhaps now hell make up for all the lost years thats very interesting but whats it got to do with your arrangement did i mention that lord randolph of gates made great sums of money during those lost but productive years several times so well in recognition of the services i rendered that undoubtedly contributed to the removal of a lifethreatening situation in which he found himself said threat emanating from paris he saw clearly the validity of compensating me especially in light of the knowledge i possess you know after a number of bloodletting courtroom battles i think hes going after a judgeship far higher than mine i think so so if i keep my own counsel get out of boston and for the sake of a loose tongue stay off the sauce his bank will forward me fifty thousand dollars a year for the rest of my life jesus christ thats what i said to myself when he agreed i even went to mass for the first time in thirtyodd years still you wont be able to go home again home prefontaine laughed softly was it really no matter i may have found another through a gentleman named peter holland at the central intelligence agency i was given an introduction to your friend sir henry sykes over in montserrat who in turn introduced me to a retired london barrister named jonathan lemuel originally a native islander were both getting on but neither of us is ready for a different sort of home we may open a consulting firm specialists in american and uk laws where export and import licensing is concerned of course well have to do some boning up but well manage i expect ill be here for years st jacques rose quickly from the table to replenish his drink his eyes warily on the former disbarred judge morris panov walked slowly cautiously out of his bedroom and into the sitting room of villa eighteen where alex conklin sat in a wheelchair the bandages across the psychiatrists chest were visible under the light fabric of his white guayabera they extended down his exposed left arm below the elbow it took me damn near twenty minutes to lift this useless appendage through the sleeve he complained angrily but without selfpity you should have called me said alex spinning himself around in the chair away from the telephone i can still roll this thing pretty damned fast of course i had a couple of years experience prior to my quasimodos boot thank you but i prefer to dress myselfas i believe you preferred to walk by yourself once the prosthesis was fitted thats the first lesson doctor i expect theres something about it in your head books there is its called dumb or if you like obstinate stupidity no its not countered the retired intelligence officer his eyes leveled with panovs as the psychiatrist lowered himself slowly into a chair no its not agreed mo returning conklins look the first lesson is independence take as much as you can handle and keep grabbing for more theres a good side too said alex smiling and adjusting the bandage around his throat it gets easier not harder you learn new tricks every day its surprising what our little gray cells come up with do tell i must explore that field one day i heard you on the phone who was it holland the wires have been burning on all the back channels between moscow and washington every covert phone on both sides damn near paralyzed thinking there could be a leak and theirs would be held responsible medusa you never heard that name i never heard that name and nobody we know has ever heard it theres been enough bloodletting in the international marketplaceto say nothing of a few buckets of real blood spilledto call into question the sanity of both governments controlling institutions which were obviously blind or just plain stupid how about just plain guilty asked panov too few at the top to warrant the destruction of the wholethats the verdict of langley and dzerzhinsky square the chief pinstripers at the state department in the kremlins council of ministers agree nothing can be served by pursuing or exposing the extent of the malfeasancehow do you like that malfeasance murder assassination kidnapping extortion and largescale corruption using organized crime on both sides of the atlantic are now conveniently slotted as malfeasance they say its better to salvage what we can as quietly and as expeditiously as possible thats obscene thats reality doctor youre about to witness one of the biggest coverups in modern history certainly among powerful sovereign nations and the real obscenity is that theyre probably right if medusa were exposed to the fullestand it would be fully exposed if it was exposed at allthe people in their righteous indignation would throw the bastards outmany of them the wrong bastards tainted only by association that sort of thing produces vacuums in high places and these are not the times for vacuums of any kind better the satans you know than the ones you dont who come later so whats going to happen trade off said conklin pensively the scope of medusas operations is so farranging geographically and structurally that its almost impossible to unravel moscows sending ogilvie back with a team of financial analysts and with our own people theyll start the process of dismantling eventually holland foresees a quiet unannounced economic minisummit calling together various financial ministers of the nato and eastern bloc countries wherever medusas assets can be selfsustaining or absorbed by their individual economies thatll be the case with restrictive covenants on all parties the main point is to prevent financial panics through mass factory closings and wholesale company collapses thus burying medusa offered panov its again history unwritten and unacknowledged the way it was from the beginning above all that conceded alex by omission and commission theres enough sleaze to go around for everybody what about men like burton on the joint chiefs and atkinson in london no more than messengers and fronts theyre out for reasons of health and believe me they understand panov winced as he adjusted his uncomfortable wounded body in the chair it hardly compensates for his crimes but the jackal served a purpose of sorts didnt he if you hadnt been hunting him you wouldnt have found medusa the coincidence of evil mo said conklin im not about to recommend a posthumous medal id say its more than coincidence interrupted panov shaking his head in the final analysis david was right whether forced or leaped upon a connection was there after all someone in medusa had a killer or killers using the name of jason bourne assassinate a highvisibility target in the jackals own backyard that someone knew what he was doing you mean teagarten of course yes since bourne was on medusas death list our pathetic turncoat desole had to tell them about the treadstone operation perhaps not by name but its essentials when they learned that jasondavidwas in paris they used the original scenario bourne against the jackal by killing teagarten the way they did they accurately assumed they were enlisting the most deadly partner they could find to hunt down and kill david we know that so dont you see alex when you think about it brussels was the beginning of the end and at the end david used that false accusation to tell marie he was still alive to tell peter holland that he was still alive the map circling anderlecht in red he gave hope thats all hope isnt something i put much trust in mo he did more than give hope that message made holland prepare every station in europe to expect jason bourne assassin and to use every extreme to get him back here it worked sometimes that kind of thing doesnt it worked because weeks ago a man called jason bourne knew that to catch carlos there had to be a link between himself and the jackal a longforgotten connection that had to be brought to the surface he did it you did it in a hell of a roundabout way admitted conklin we were reaching thats all possibilities probabilities abstractionsits all we had to work with abstractions asked panov gently thats such an erroneously passive term have you any idea what thunder in the mind abstractions provoke i dont even know what youre talking about those gray cells alex they go crazy spinning around like infinitesimal pingpong balls trying to find tiny tunnels to explode through drawn by their own inherent compulsions youve lost me you said it yourself the coincidence of evil but id suggest another conductorthe magnet of evil thats what you and david created and within that magnetic field was medusa conklin spun around in the chair and wheeled himself toward the balcony and the descending orange glow on the horizon beyond the deepgreen out islands of montserrat i wish everything was as simple as you put it mo he said rapidly im afraid its not youll have to be clearer krupkins a dead man what i mourn him as a friend and one hell of an enemy he made everything possible for us and when it was all over he did what was right not what was ordered he let david live and now hes paying for it what happened to him according to holland he disappeared from the hospital in moscow five days agohe simply took his clothes and walked out no one knows how he did it or where he went but an hour after he left the kgb came to arrest him and move him to the lubyanka then they havent caught him they will when the kremlin issues a black alert every road train station airport and border crossing is put under a microscope the incentives are irresistible whoever lets him out will spend ten years in a gulag its just a question of time goddamn it there was a knock on the front door and panov called out its open because its easier come in the beblazered immaculately dressed assistant manager mr pritchard entered preceded by a roomservice table that he was capable of pushing while standing completely erect he smiled broadly and announced his presence as well as his mission buckingham pritchard at your service gentlemen ive brought a few delicacies from the sea for your collegial gathering before the evening meal which i have personally attended to at the side of the chef who has been known to be prone to errors without expert guidance which i was all too happy to provide collegial said alex i got out of college damn near thirtyfive years ago it obviously didnt take where the nuances of english are concerned mumbled morris panov tell me mr pritchard arent you terribly hot in those clothes id be sweating like a pig no nuances there only an unproven cliché muttered conklin i do not perspire sir replied the assistant manager ill bet my pension you perspired when mr st jacques came back from washington offered alex christ almighty johnny a terrorist the incident has been forgotten sir said pritchard stoically mr saint jay and sir henry understand that my brilliant uncle and i had only the childrens interests at heart savvy very savvy observed conklin ill set up the canapés gentlemen and check the ice the others should be here in a matter of minutes thats very kind of you said panov david webb leaned against the balcony archway watching his wife as she read the last pages of a childrens story to their son the outstanding mrs cooper was dozing in a chair her magnificent black head crowned by a fleece of silver and gray kept nodding above her full chest as if she expected at any moment to hear sounds from the infant alison beyond the halfclosed door that was only feet from where she was sitting the inflections of maries quiet voice matched the words of the story confirmed by jamies wide eyes and parted lips but for an analytical mind that found music in figures his wife might have been an actress mused david she had the surface attributes of that precarious professionstriking features a commanding presence the sine qua non that forced both men and women to fall silent and pensively appraise her when she walked down a street or entered a room you can read to me tomorrow daddy the story was over attested to by his son jumping off the couch and mrs cooper flashing her eyes open i wanted to read that one tonight said webb defensively moving away from the arch well you still kind of smell said the boy frowning your father doesnt smell jamie explained marie smiling i told you its the medicine the doctor said he had to use on his injuries from the accident he still smells you cant argue with an analytical mind when its right can you asked david its too early to go to bed mommy i might wake up alison and shell start crying again i know dear but daddy and i have to go over and see all your uncles and my new grandfather cried the child exuberantly grandpa brendan said he was going to teach me how to be a judge someday god help the boy interjected mrs cooper that man dresses like a peacock flowering to mate you may go into our room and watch television overrode marie quickly but only for a half hour aww all right perhaps an hour but mrs cooper will select the channels thanks mommy cried the child racing into his parents bedroom as mrs cooper got out of the chair and followed him oh i can start him off said marie getting up from the couch no miss marie protested mrs cooper you stay with your husband that man hurts but he wont say anything she disappeared into the bedroom is that true my darling asked marie walking to david do you hurt i hate to dispel the myth of a great ladys incontestable perceptions but shes wrong why do you have to use a dozen words when one will suffice because im supposed to be a scholar we academicians never take a direct route because it doesnt leave us any offshoots to claim if were wrong what are you antiintellectual no answered marie you see thats a simple oneword declarative whats a declarative asked webb taking his wife in his arms and kissing her their lips enveloping so meaningful to each arousing to each its a shortcut to the truth said marie arching her head back and looking at him no offshoots no circumlocutions just fact as in five and five equals ten not nine or eleven but ten youre a ten thats banal but ill take it you are more relaxed i can feel you again jason bournes leaving you isnt he just about while you were with alison ed mcallister called me from the national security agency benjamins mother is on her way back to moscow hey thats wonderful david both mac and i laughed and as we laughed i thought to myself id never heard mcallister laugh before it was nice he wore his guilt on his sleeveno all over him he sent us both to hong kong and he never forgave himself now youre back and alive and free im not sure ill ever forgive him but at least i wont hang up on him when he calls hed like that as a matter of fact i told him to call i said you might even ask him to dinner someday i didnt go that far benjamins mother that kid saved my life maybe a quick brunch take your hands off me woman in another fifteen seconds im going to throw jamie and mrs cooper out of our bedroom and demand my connubials im tempted attila but i think bros counting on us two feisty individuals and an overimaginative disbarred judge are more than an ontario ranch boy can handle i love them all so do i lets go the caribbean sun had disappeared only faint sprays of orange barely illuminated the western horizon the flames of the glassencased candles were steady pointed sending streams of gray smoke through their funnels their glow producing warm light and comfortable shadows around the terraced balcony of villa eighteen the conversation too had been warm and comfortablesurvivors relishing their deliverance from a nightmare i emphatically explained to handy randy that the doctrine of stare decisis has to be challenged if the times have altered the perceptions that existed when the original decisions were rendered expounded prefontaine change changethe inevitable result of the calendar thats so obvious i cant imagine anyone debating it said alex oh floodthegates used it incessantly confusing juries with his erudition and confounding his peers with multiple decises mirrors and smoke added marie laughing we do the same in economics remember bro i told you that i didnt understand a word still dont no mirrors and no smoke where medicines involved said panov at least not where the labs are monitored and the pharmaceutical money boys are prohibited legitimate advances are validated every day in many ways its the purposely undefined core of our constitution continued the former judge its as though the founders had read nostradamus but didnt care to admit their frivolity or perhaps studied the drawings of da vinci who foresaw aircraft they understood that they could not legislate the future for they had no idea what it would hold or what society would demand for its future liberties they created brilliant omissions unaccepted as such by the brilliant randolph gates if memory serves said conklin oh hell change quickly now interrupted prefontaine chuckling he was always a sworn companion of the wind and hes smart enough to adjust his sails when he has to buck it i keep wondering whatever happened to the truck drivers wife the one in the diner who was married to the man they called bronk said the psychiatrist try to imagine a small house and a white picket fence et cetera offered alex its easier that way what truck drivers wife asked st jacques leave it alone bro id rather not find out or that sonofabitch army doctor who pumped me full of amytal pressed panov hes running a clinic in leavenworth replied conklin i forgot to tell you so many so crazy and krupkin crazy old kruppie elegance and all we owe him but we cant help him there was a moment of silence as each in his and her own way thought of a man who had selflessly opposed a monolithic system that demanded the death of david webb who stood by the railing staring out at the darkened sea somehow separated in mind and body from the others it would take time he understood that jason bourne had to vanish he had to leave him when not now out of the early night the madness began again from the sky the roar of multiple engines broke the silence like approaching sharp cracks of lightning three military helicopters swooped down toward the tranquility dock fusillades of gunfire chewing up the shoreline as a powerful bullet speedboat swung through the reefs toward the beach st jacques was on his intercom shore alarm he screamed grab your weapons christ the jackals dead yelled conklin his goddamned disciples arent shouted jason bourneno trace of david webbas he shoved marie to the floor and took a gun out of his belt a weapon his wife knew nothing about they were told he was here its insane thats carlos replied jason racing to the balcony railing he owns them theyre his for life shit roared alex as he wheeled his chair furiously and pushed panov away from the table and the lighted candles suddenly a deafening loudspeaker from the lead helicopter crackled with static followed by the words of the pilot you saw what we did to the beach mon well cut you in two if you dont stop your engine thats better mon drift into shoredrift no motor at all and both of you come on deck your hands on the gunwale leaning forward do it now the searchlight beams of the two circling helicopters centered on the boat as the lead aircraft dropped to the beach the rotors swirling up the sand producing an outline of a threshold for its landing four men leaped out their weapons trained on the drifting speedboat as the inhabitants of villa eighteen stood by the railing staring in astonishment at the unbelievable scene below pritchard yelled st jacques bring me the binoculars theyre in my hands mr saint jayoh there they are the assistant manager rushed out with the powerful magnifiers and handed them to his employer i managed to clean the lenses sir what do you see asked bourne sharply i dont know two men some army said conklin give them to me ordered jason grabbing the binoculars from his brotherinlaw what is it david shouted marie seeing the shock on her husbands face its krupkin he said dimitri krupkin sat at the white wroughtiron table his face paleand it was his full face as his chin beard had been removedand refused to speak to anyone until he had finished his third brandy like panov conklin and david webb he was clearly a hurt man a wounded man a man in considerable physical pain which like the others he did not care to dwell upon as what lay ahead was infinitely better than what he had left behind his decidedly inferior clothes seemed to annoy him whenever he glanced down at them but he shrugged continually in silence the shrugs conveying the fact that soon he would be back in sartorial splendor his first words were to the elderly brendan prefontaine as he appraised the former judges intricately laced peach guayabera above the royalblue trousers i like that outfit he said admiringly very tropical and in good taste for the climate thank you introductions were made and the instant they were over a barrage of questions was hurled at the soviet he held up both hands as a pope might from his balcony in st peters square and spoke i will not bore you or disturb you with the trivial details of my flight from mother russia other than to say im aghast at the high price of corruption and will neither forget nor forgive the filthy accommodations i was forced to endure for the exorbitant sums of money i spent that said thank god for credit suisse and those lovely green coupons they issue just tell us what happened said marie you dear lady are even lovelier than i had imagined had we met in paris i would have whisked you away from this dickensian ragamuffin you call a husband my look at your hairglorious he probably couldnt tell you what color it is said marie smiling youll be the threat i hold over his peasant head still for his age hes remarkably competent thats because i feed him a lot of pills all kinds of pills dimitri now tell us what happened what happened they found me out thats what happened they confiscated my lovely house in geneva its now an adjunct to the soviet embassy the loss is heartbreaking i think my wifes talking about the peasant me said webb you were in the hospital in moscow and you found out what someone intended for menamely my execution then you told benjamin to get me out of novgorod i have sources jason and errors are made in high places and ill incriminate no one by using names it was simply wrong if nuremberg taught us all nothing else it was that obscene commands should not be obeyed that lesson crosses borders and penetrates minds we in russia suffered far far more than anyone in america during the last war some of us remember that and we will not emulate that enemy well spoken said prefontaine raising his glass of perrier to the soviet when everythings said and done were all part of the same thinking feeling human race arent we well choked krupkin swallowing his fourth brandy beyond that very attractive if overused observation there are divisions of commitment judge not serious of course but nevertheless varied for instance although my house on the lake in geneva is no longer mine my accounts in the cayman islands remain intensely personal incidentally how far are those islands from here roughly twelve hundred miles due west replied st jacques a jet out of antigua will get you there in three hours plus thats what i thought said krupkin when we were in the hospital in moscow alex frequently spoke of tranquility isle and montserrat so i checked the map in the hospital library everything seems to be on course incidentally the man with the boat he wont be dealt with too harshly will he my outrageously expensive ersatz papers are very much in order his crime was in his appearance not in bringing you over here answered st jacques i was in a hurry it goes with running for your life ive already explained to government house that youre an old friend of my brotherinlaw good very good what will you do now dimitri asked marie my options are limited im afraid our russian bear not only has more claws than a centipede has legs shes also computerized with a global network i shall have to remain buried for quite some time while i construct another existence from birth of course krupkin turned to the owner of tranquility inn would it be possible to lease one of these lovely cottages mr st jacques after what you did for david and my sister dont give it a second thought this house is your house mr krupkin all of it how very kind first naturally therell be the trip to the caymans where im told there are excellent tailors then perhaps a clever little yacht and a small charter business that can be substantiated as having been moved from tierra del fuego or the malvinas some godforsaken place where a little money can produce an identity and a highly credible if obscure past after these are set in motion theres a doctor in buenos aires who does wonders with fingerprintsquite painlessly im toldand then minor cosmetic surgeryrio has the best you know far better than new yorkjust enough to alter the profile and perhaps remove a few years for the past five days and nights ive had nothing to do but think and plan enduring situations of passage i would not describe in front of the lovely mrs webb you certainly have been thinking agreed davids wife impressed and please call me marie how can i hold you over the peasants head if im mrs webb ah the adorable marie what about these adorable plans of yours asked conklin pointedly how long will they take to implement you of all people should ask that question krupkins eyes were wide in disbelief i think id better broke in alex you who were instrumental in building the dossier of the greatest impersonator the international world of terrorism has ever known the incomparable jason bourne if that includes me said webb im out im heavy into interior decorating how long kruppie for heavens sake man you were training a recruit for an assignment a single mission im altering a life how long you tell me alex its my life were talking about nowas worthless as that life may be in the geopolitical scheme of thingsits still my life whatever he needs interrupted david webb the unseen image of jason bourne looking over his wounded shoulder two years to do it well three years to do it better said dimitri krupkin theyre yours said marie pritchard said st jacques angling his head fix my drink if you please epilogue they walked along the moonlit beach alternately touching and not touching the embarrassment of intimacy intermittently intruding as if a world that had separated them had not let them escape its terrible orbit constantly pulling them into its fiery nucleus you carried a gun said marie softly i had no idea you had one i hate guns so do i im not sure i knew i had one either it was just there reflex compulsion both i guess it didnt matter i didnt use it but you wanted to didnt you again im not sure if you and the children were threatened of course i would but i dont think id fire indiscriminately are you sure david would the appearance of danger to us make you pick up a gun and shoot at shadows no i dont shoot at shadows footsteps in the sand waves lapping over the unmistakable intrusion of a human being breaks in the flow of the natural rhythmsounds jason bourne knew from a hundred beaches he spun around violently propelling marie off her feet sending her out of the line of fire as he crouched his weapon in his hand please dont kill me david said morris panov the beam of his flashlight illuminating the area it simply wouldnt make sense jesus mo cried webb what were you doing trying to find you thats all would you please help marie webb did so pulling his wife to her feet both half blinded by the flashlight my god youre the mole cried jason bourne raising his weapon you knew every move i was making im what roared the psychiatrist throwing down his flashlight if you believe that gun me down you son of a bitch i dont know mo i dont know anything anymore davids head arched back in pain then cry your heart out you bastard cry like youve never cried before jason bourne is dead cremated in moscow and thats the way it is you either accept that or i dont want a goddamned thing to do with you anymore have you got that you arrogant brilliant creation you did it and its over webb fell to his knees the tears welling in his eyes trembling and trying not to make a sound were going to be okay mo said marie kneeling beside her husband holding him i know that acknowledged panov nodding in the glow of the grounded flashlight two lives in one mind none of us can know what its like but its over now its really over
