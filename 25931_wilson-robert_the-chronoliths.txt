the chronoliths by robert charles wilson part one the coming of the chronoliths one it was hitch paley rolling his beatup daimler motorbike across the packed sand of the beach behind the haat thai dance pavilion who invited me to witness the end of an age mine and the worlds but i dont blame hitch nothing is coincidental i know that now he was grinning as he approached generally a bad omen with hitch he wore the americaninthailand uniform of that last good summer army shorts and john the baptist sandals oversized khaki tshirt and a flowered spandex headband he was a big man an exmarine gone native bearded and developing a paunch he looked formidable despite his clothes and worse he looked mischievous i knew for a fact that hitch had spent the night in the party tent eating the hashlaced spice cookies a german diplomaticcorps functionary had given him and feeding the same to her until she went out with him at high tide to better appreciate the moonlight on the water he shouldnt have been awake at this hour much less cheerful i shouldnt have been awake either after a few hours at the bonfire i had gone home to janice but we hadnt slept kaitlin had come down with a head cold and janice had spent the evening alternately soothing our daughter and battling an infestation of thumbsized cockroaches that had colonized the warm and greasy passages of the gas stove given that and the hot night and the tension that already existed between us it was probably inevitable that we had argued almost until dawn so neither hitch nor i was fresh or perhaps even thinking clearly though the morning sunlight coaxed a false alertness out of me the conviction that a world so brightly lit must also be safe and enduring sunlight glossed the heavy water of the bay picked out fishing sloops like dots on radar promised another cloudless afternoon the beach was as broad and flat as a highway a road toward some nameless and perfect destination so that sound last night hitch said beginning this conversation the way he began most without preamble as if we had been apart for no significant time like a navy jet you heard that i had id heard it about four am shortly after janice stomped off to bed kaitlin was asleep at last and i was alone at our burnscarred linoleum kitchen table with a cup of sour coffee the radio was linked to a us jazz station turned down to polite chatter the broadcast had turned brittle and strange for about thirty seconds there was a crack of thunder and a series of rolling echoes hitchs navy jet and a little after that an odd cold breeze rattled janices potted bougainvilleas against the window the window blinds lifted and fell in a soft salute kaitlins bedroom door opened by itself and she turned in her netted crib and made a soft unhappy sound but didnt wake not quite a navy jet but it might have been summer thunder a newborn or senescent storm mumbling to itself out over the bay of bengal not unusual this time of year party of caterers stopped by the duc this morning and bought all our ice hitch said heading for some rich mans dacha they said there was real action out by the hill road like fireworks or artillery a bunch of trees blew down want to go see scotty as well one thing as another i said what means yes it was a decision that would change my life beyond repair but i made it on a whim i blame frank edwards frank edwards was a pittsburgh radio broadcaster of the last century who compiled a volume of supposedly true miracle lore stranger than science featuring such durable folktales as the mystery of kaspar hauser and the spaceship that blew up over tunguska siberia in the book and its handful of sequels were big items in our household when i was naive enough to take such things seriously my father had given me stranger than science in a battered librarydiscard edition and i had finished it at the age of ten in three latenight sessions i suppose my father considered this the kind of material that might stimulate a boys imagination if so he was right tunguska was a world away from the gated baltimore compound where charles carter warden had planted his troubled wife and only child i outgrew the habit of believing this sort of thing but the word strange had become a personal talisman strange the shape of my life strange the decision to stay in thailand after the contracts evaporated strange these long days and drugged nights on the beaches at chumphon ko samui phuket strange as the coiled geometry of the ancient wats maybe hitch was right maybe some dark miracle had landed in the province more likely there had been a forest fire or a narcotics shootout but hitch said the caterers had told him it was something from outer space and who was i to argue i was restless and facing the prospect of another empty day fielding janices complaints and not relishing it so i hopped on the back of hitchs daimler fuck the consequences and we motored away from the coast in a cloud of blue exhaust i didnt stop to tell janice i was going i doubted she would be interested anyway id be home by nightfall lots of americans disappeared in chumphon and satun in those days kidnapped for ransom or murdered for pocket change or recruited as heroin mules i was young enough not to care we passed the phat duc the shack where hitch supposedly sold fishing tackle but in fact did a brisk trade in native marijuana to the party crowd and turned onto the new coast road traffic wasnt heavy just a few eighteenwheelers out of the cpro fish farms jitneys and songthaews decorated like carnival wagons tourist buses hitch drove with the verve and fearlessness of a native which made the journey an exercise in bladder control but the rush of humid air was cooling especially as we turned onto the feeder road toward the interior and the day was young and pregnant with miracles away from the coast chumphon is mountainous when we turned inland we had the road very nearly to ourselves until a phalanx of border police roared past us in a hail of gravel so something was definitely up we stopped long enough for hitch to relieve himself in a gas station hawng nam while i tuned my portable radio to the englishlanguage radio station out of bangkok lots of us and uk top forty no word of martians but just as hitch came ambling back from the urinal trough a brigade of royal thai soldiers roared past us three troop carriers and a handful of rattletrap humvees going the same direction the local police had been headed hitch looked at me i looked at him get the camera out of the saddlebag he said not smiling this time he wiped his hand on his shorts up ahead a bright column of fog or smoke spiked the tumbled hills what i did not know was that my daughter kaitlin five years old had awakened from her morning nap with a raging fever and that janice had wasted a good twenty minutes trying to locate me before she gave up and took kait to the charity clinic the clinic doctor was a canadian who had been in chumphon since and had established a fairly modern surgery with funds donated by some department of the world health organization doctor dexter the beach people called him the man to see for syphilis or intestinal parasites by the time he examined kaitlin her fever had peaked at degrees and she was only intermittently lucid janice of course was frantic she must have feared the worst the japanese encephalitis we all read about in the papers that year or the dengue that had killed so many people in myanmar doctor dexter diagnosed a common influenza it had been going around the phuket and ko samui crowd since march and pumped her full of antivirals janice settled down in the clinic waiting room still trying periodically to phone me but i had left my phone in a backpack on a shelf in the rental she would have tried hitch maybe but hitch didnt believe in unencrypted communication he carried a gps locator and a compass and figured that was more than enough for any truly rugged male when i first glimpsed the pillar through a scrim of forest i took it to be the chedi of a distant wat one of the buddhist temples scattered throughout southeast asia you can find a photograph of angkor wat for instance in any encyclopedia youd recognize it if you saw it stone reliquary towers that look weirdly organic as if some enormous troll had left its bones to fossilize in the jungle but this chedi and i saw more of it as we followed the switchback road up a long ridge was the wrong shape the wrong color we crested the ridge into a roadblock of royal thai police border patrol cars and assorted armed men in rustpocked suvs they were turning away all traffic four of the soldiers had trained their weapons on an ancient hyundai songthaew packed with squawking chickens the border police looked both very young and very hostile wearing khakis and aviator glasses and holding their rifles at a nervous angle i didnt want to challenge them and i told hitch so i dont know if he heard me his attention was on the monument ill use that word for now in the distance we could see it more clearly now it sat astride a higher terrace of the hill partially obscured by a ring of mist without any visible reference the size of it was difficult to judge but i guessed it must have been at least three hundred feet tall in our ignorance we might have mistaken it for a spaceship or a weapon but the truth is that i recognized it as a kind of monument as soon as i could see it clearly imagine a truncated washington monument made of skyblue glass and gently rounded at all corners i couldnt guess who had made it or how it had got here apparently in a single night but for all its strangeness it did look distinctly manmade and men make such things for a single purpose to announce themselves to declare their presence and display their power that it should be here at all was dazzlingly strange but there was no mistaking the solidity of it the weight the size the stunning incongruity then the mist rose up and obscured our view two uniformed men strode toward us looselimbed and surly by the look of it hitch said his muted southwestern drawl sounding a little too lazy given the circumstances well probably have us and un assholes all over us before long plus a lot more fucking bpp already an unmarked but obviously military helicopter was circling the ridge its downdraft stirring the ground haze so we go back i said he snapped a single photograph then tucked the camera away we dont have to theres a smugglers trail up around that hill it leaves the road about a half mile back not too many people know about it he grinned again i suppose i smiled back the second thoughts were coming thick and fast but i knew hitch and i knew he wouldnt be argued out of this i also knew i didnt want to be left at this checkpoint without a ride he wheeled the motorcycle around and we left the thai cops glaring at our tailpipe this was maybe two or three in the afternoon about the time kaitlin began to ooze bloody pus from her left ear we circled up the smugglers trail as far as the daimler would take us then concealed the bike in a thicket and hiked a quarter mile more the trail was rough designed for maximum concealment but not maximum comfort steep real estate hitch called it hitch carried hiking boots in the daimlers saddlebag but i had to make do with my hightops and i worried about snakes and insects had we followed the trail far enough we would no doubt have arrived at some hidden drug cache an extraction factory maybe even the burmese border but twenty minutes took us as close to the monument as we cared to get as close as we could get we came within a thousand yards of it we werent the first people to see it at that proximity it had blocked a road after all and it had been there for at least twelve hours assuming the sound of last nights navy jet had in fact marked the arrival of the artifact but we were among the first hitch stopped at the fallen trees the forest here pines mostly and some wild bamboo had collapsed in a radial pattern around the base of the monument and the wreckage obliterated the path the pines had obviously been toppled by some kind of pressure wave but they hadnt been burned quite the opposite the leaves of the uprooted bamboo were still green and only beginning to wither in the afternoon heat everything here the trees the trail the ground itself was crisply cool cold in fact if you put your hand down among the windfall hitch pointed this out i was reluctant to take my eyes off the monument itself if i had known what was to come my awe might have been tempered this was in light of what followed a relatively minor miracle but all i knew was that i had stumbled into an event immensely stranger than anything frank edwards had uncovered in the back numbers of the pittsburgh press and what i felt was partly fear partly a dizzy elation the monument it was not first of all a statue that is it was not a representation of a human or animal figure it was a foursided pillar planed to a smooth conical apex the material of which it was made suggested glass but on a ridiculous impossible scale it was blue the deep inscrutable blue of a mountain lake somehow peaceful and ominous at once it was not transparent but carried the suggestion of translucency from this side the northern side it was scabbed with patches of white ice i was astonished to realize slowly sublimating in the humid daylight the ruined forest at its base was moist with fog and the place where the monument met the earth was invisible under mounds of melting snow it was the ice and the waves of unnaturally cool air wafting out from the ruined forest that made the scene especially eerie i imagined the obelisk rising like an immense tourmaline crystal from some underground glacier but such things happen only in dreams i said so to hitch then we must be in dreamland scotty or maybe oz another helicopter came around the crown of the hill too low for comfort we knelt among the fallen pines the cool air earthy with their scent when the aircraft crested the hill and was gone hitch touched my shoulder seen enough i nodded it was clearly not wise to stay although some stubborn part of me wanted to linger until the monument made sense to retrieve a little sanity from the iceblue deeps of the thing hitch i said what down at the bottom of it does that look like writing to you he gave the obelisk one last hard squint snapped a final photograph letters maybe not english too far away to make out and were not getting closer we had stayed too long already what i learned later much later from janice was this by three pm the bangkok media had obtained video footage of the monument from an american tourist by four half the beachlizard population in chumphon province had taken off to see this prodigy for themselves and were turned away en masse at the roadblocks embassies were notified the international press began to sit up and take notice janice stayed with kaitlin in the clinic kaitlin by this time was screaming with pain despite the painkillers and antivirals doctor dexter had given her he examined her a second time and told janice our daughter had acquired a rapidly necrotizing bacterial ear infection possibly from swimming at the beach hed been reporting elevated levels of e coli and a dozen other microbes for almost a month but health officials had taken no action probably because the cpro fish farms were worried about their export license and had flexed their muscle with the authorities he administered a massive dose of fluoroquinolones and phoned the embassy in bangkok the embassy dispatched an ambulance helicopter and cleared space for kait at the american hospital janice didnt want to leave without me she phoned the rental shack repeatedly and when that failed left calls with our landlord and a few friends who expressed their sympathy but hadnt seen me lately doctor dexter sedated kaitlin while janice hurried to the shack to pack a few things when she got back to the clinic the evac helicopter was already waiting she told doctor dexter i would almost certainly be reachable by nightfall probably down at the party tent if i got in touch he would give me the hospitals number and i could make arrangements to drive up then the helicopter lifted off janice took a sedative of her own while a trio of paramedics pumped more broadspectrum antibiotics into kaits bloodstream they would have gained considerable altitude over the bay and janice must have seen the cause of all this from the air the crystalline pillar poised like an unanswerable question above the lush green foothills we came off the smugglers trail into a nest of thai military police hitch made a brave attempt to reverse the daimler and haul ass out of trouble but there was nowhere to go except back up that deadend trail when a bullet kicked up dust by the front wheel hitch braked and killed the engine the soldiers bade us kneel hands behind our necks one of them approached us and put the barrel of his pistol against hitchs temple then mine he said something i couldnt translate his comrades laughed a few minutes later we were inside a military wagon under the guard of four armed men who spoke no english or pretended not to i wondered how much contraband hitch was carrying and whether that made me an accomplice or an accessory to a capital offense but no one said anything about drugs no one said anything at all even when the truck lurched into motion i asked politely where we were going the nearest soldier a barrelribbed gaptoothed adolescent shrugged and waved the butt of his rifle at me in a desultory threat they took hitchs camera he never got it back nor his motorcycle come to that the army was economical in such matters we rode in that truck for almost eighteen hours and spent the next night in a bangkok prison in separate cells and without communication privileges i learned later that an american threatassessment team wanted to debrief ie interrogate us before we talked to the press so we sat in our isolation cells with buckets for toilets while across the world sundry welldressed men booked flights for don muang airport these things take time my wife and child were less than five miles away in the embassy hospital but i didnt know that and neither did janice kaitlin bled from her ear until dawn doctor dexters second diagnosis had been correct kaitlin had been infected with some ominously polydrugresistant bacteria that dissolved her tympanic membrane as neatly one doctor told me as if someone had poured a vial of acid into her ear the surrounding small bones and nervous tissue were also affected in the time it took for multiple doses of fluoroquinolones to battle back the infection by the following nightfall two things were clear one kaitlins life was no longer in danger two she would never hear with that ear again she would retain some hearing in her right ear but it would be impaired or maybe i should say three things became clear because it was plain to janice by the time the sun went down that my absence was inexcusable and that she wasnt prepared to forgive me for this latest lapse of adult judgment not this time not unless my corpse washed up on the beach and maybe not even then the interrogation went like this three polite men arrived at the prison and apologized contritely for the conditions in which we were being held they were in touch with the thai government on our behalf even as we speak and in the meantime would we answer a few questions for instance our names and addresses and stateside connections and how long had we been in thailand and what were we doing here this must have been fun for hitch i simply told the truth that i had been in bangkok doing software development for a usbased hotel chain and that i had stayed on for some eight months after my contract lapsed i didnt mention that i had planned to write a book about the rise and fall of expatriate beach culture in what the thai travel guides are pleased to call the land of smiles which had turned from a nonfiction work into a novel before it died aborning or that i had exhausted my personal savings six weeks ago i told them about janice but neglected to mention that without the money she had borrowed from her family we would have been destitute i told them about kaitlin too but i didnt know kaitlin had nearly died a mere fortyeight hours earlier and if the suits knew they didnt elect to share the information the rest of their questions were all about the chumphon object how we had heard about it when we had first seen it how close we had come our impressions of it a thai prison guard looked on glumly as a us medic took blood and urine samples for further analysis then the suits thanked us and promised to get us out of confinement asap the following day three different polite gentlemen with a fresh set of credentials asked us the same questions and made the same promises we were at last released some of the contents of our wallets were returned to us and we stepped out into the heat and stench of bangkok somewhere on the wrong side of the chao phrya abandoned and penniless we walked to the embassy and i badgered a functionary there into advancing us oneway bus fare to chumphon and a couple of free phone calls i tried to reach janice at our rental shack there was no answer but it was dinnertime and i imagined she was out with kait securing a meal i tried to contact our landlord a graying brit named bedford but i talked to his voicemail instead at which point a nice embassy staffer reminded us pointedly not to miss our bus i reached the shack long after dark still firmly convinced id find janice and kaitlin inside that janice would be angry until she heard what had happened that there would follow a tearful reconciliation and maybe even some passion in the wake of it in her hurry to reach the hospital janice had left the door ajar she had taken a suitcase for herself and kaitlin and local thieves had taken the rest what there was of it the food in the refrigerator my phone the laptop i ran up the road and woke my landlord who admitted he had seen janice lugging a suitcase past his window the other day and that kaitlin had been ill but in all the fuss about the monument the details had escaped him he let me use his phone i had become a phone beggar and i reached doctor dexter who filled me in on the details of kaitlins infection and her trip to bangkok bangkok and i couldnt call bangkok from colins phone that was a toll call he pointed out and wasnt i already behind on the rent i hiked to the phat duc hitchs alleged bait and tackle shop hitch had problems of his own he still harbored faint hopes of tracking down the lost daimler but he told me i could crash in the ducs back room on a bale of moist sinsemilla i imagined and use the shops phone all i wanted wed settle up later it took me until dawn to establish that janice and kaitlin had already left the country i dont blame her not that i wasnt angry i was angry for the next six months but when i tried to justify the anger to myself my own excuses seemed flimsy and inadequate i had after all brought her to thailand when her explicit preference had been to stay in the us and finish her postdoc i had kept her there when my own contracts lapsed and i had effectively forced her into a povertylevel existence as americans of those years understood poverty anyway while i played out a scenario of rebellion and retreat that had more to do with unresolved postadolescent angst than with anything substantial i had exposed kaitlin to the dangers of an expatriate lifestyle which i preferred to think of as broadening her horizons and in the end i had been absent and unavailable when my daughters life was threatened i did not doubt that janice blamed me for kaitlins partial deafness my only remaining hope was that kait herself would not blame me at least not permanently not forever in the meantime what i wanted was to go home janice had retreated to her parents house in minneapolis from which she was very firmly not returning my calls i was given to understand that a bill of divorcement was in the works all of this ten thousand miles away at the end of a frustrating month i told hitch i needed a ride back to the us but that my funds had bottomed out we sat on a drift log by the bay windsurfers rolled out on the long blue undeterred by the bacteria count funny how inviting the ocean can look even when its poisoned the beach was busy chumphon had become a mecca for photojournalists and the idly curious by day they competed for telephoto shots of the socalled chumphon object by night they bid up the prices of liquor and lodging all of them carried more money than i had seen for a year i didnt much care for the journalists and i already hated the monument i couldnt blame janice for what had happened and i was understandably reluctant to blame myself but i could without objection blame the mystery object that had come to fascinate much of the world the irony is that i hated the monument almost before anyone else did before very long the silhouette of that cool blue stone would become a symbol recognized and hated or perversely loved by the vast majority of the human race but for the time being i had the field to myself the moral i suppose is that history doesnt always put its finger on the nice folks and of course there is no such thing as a coincidence we both need a favor hitch said grinning that dangerous grin of his maybe we can do one for each other maybe i can get you back home scotty if you do something for me in return that kind of proposition worries me i said a little worry is a healthy thing that evening the englishlanguage papers printed the text of the writing that had been discovered on the base of the monument an open secret here in chumphon the inscription carved an inch deep into the substance of the pillar and written in a kind of pidgin mandarin and basic english was a simple declarative statement commemorating a battle in other words the pillar was a victory monument it celebrated the surrender of southern thailand and malaysia to the massed forces of someone or something called kuin and beneath the text was the date of this historic battle december twenty years in the future two i flew into the united states on a startup air carrier with legal berths at beijing dusseldorf gander and boston the long way around the planet with numbing layovers and arrived at logan airport with a set of knockoff designer luggage in the best bangkok tradition a fivethousanddollar grubstake and an unwelcome obligation all thanks to hitch paley i was home for better or for worse it was amazing how effortlessly wealthy boston seemed after a season on the beaches even before i left the terminal as if all these gleaming cafés and newsstands had sprung up after a hard rain bright disney mushrooms nothing here was older than five years not the terminal annex itself nor the atlantic landfill that supported it a facility younger than the great majority of its patrons i submitted to a noninvasive customs scan then crossed the cavernous arrivals complex to a taxi bay the mystery of the chumphon chronolith it had been given that name by a popscience journalist just last month had already faded from public attention it was still making news but mainly in the supermarket checkout papers totem of the devil or trump of the rapture and in countless conspiracychronicling webjournals incomprehensible as it may seem to a contemporary reader the world had passed on to more immediate concerns brazzaville the windsor weddings the attempted assassination of the diva lux ebone at the roma festival just last weekend it was as if we were all waiting for the event that would define the new century the thing or person or abstract cause that would strike us as indelibly new a twentyfirst century thing and of course we didnt recognize it when it nudged its way into the news for the first time the chronolith was a singular event intriguing but ultimately mystifying hence ultimately boring we set it aside unfinished like the new york times crossword puzzle in fact there was a lot of ongoing concern over the thai event but it was restricted to certain echelons of the intelligence and security communities both national and international the chronolith after all was an avowedly hostile military incursion conducted on a large scale and with ultimate stealth even if the only casualties had been a few thousand gnarled mountain pines chumphon province was under very close scrutiny these days but that was not my business and i imagined i could disentangle myself from it simply by flying a few thousand miles west we thought like that then unusually cold weather that autumn the sky was cast over with turbulent clouds a high wind tormenting the last of the years fishing fleet outside the street atrium of the ammag station a row of flags beat the air i paid the taxi driver crossed the lobby and bought a ticket for the northern tier express detroit chicago and across the prairies to seattle though i was only going as far as minneapolis boarding at seven pm the vending machine informed me i purchased a newspaper and read it on a coin monitor until the stations wall clock showed then i stood up surveyed the lobby for suspicious activity none and walked out onto washington street five blocks south of the magrail station was a tiny ancient mailbox service called easys packages and parcels it was a storefront business not prosperous with a flyblown mylar shade over the display window while i watched a man with a steel walker inched through the front door and emerged ten minutes later carrying a brown paper envelope i imagined this was the typical customer at an establishment like easys a goldenager perversely loyal to what remained of the us postal service unless the gentleman with the walker was a criminal in latex makeup or a cop did i have qualms about what i was doing many or at least second thoughts hitch had bankrolled my trip home and the favor he had asked in return had seemed simple enough when we were basking penniless on the sand i had known hitch for most of a year before the advent of the chumphon chronolith he was one of the few haat thai regulars whose conversation extended to anything more advanced than personal sexual conquests and designer drugs he was a master of unaudited deals and subterranean income but he was essentially honest and as i had often insisted to janice not a bad person whatever that meant i trusted him at least within the boundaries of his nature but as i stood watching easys packages for evidence of police surveillance fully aware that i wouldnt recognize professional surveillance unless the treasury department happened to rent a billboard to advertise its presence all those judgments seemed facile and naive hitch had asked me to show up at easys give his name and take delivery of a package which i was to hold until he contacted me no questions asked hitch was after all a drug dealer though his beach trade had been confined to cannabis exotic mushrooms and the milder phenylethylamines and thailand was indeed a source country and established commercial route for the narcotics trade since the days of marco polo i wasnt modest about intoxicants and i had sampled more than a few virtually every psychoactive substance was legal somewhere and almost all of it decriminalized in the liberal western nations but the us in general and massachusetts in particular were still heavily punitive when it came to the transportation of hard narcotics if hitch had somehow contrived to mail himself say a kilo of black tar heroin and if his sense of humor extended to giving me custody of it i might be paying for my ticket home with penitentiary time i might not see kaitlin without a sheet of wirereinforced glass between us at least until her thirtieth birthday rain came down in a sudden sheeting torrent i ran across the street to easys packages took a breath of damp air and stepped inside easy himself or someone like him a tall intricately wrinkled muscular black man who might have been sixty or eighty stood behind a hardwood counter guarding a row of aluminum mailboxes tarnished a foggy gray he looked at me briefly help you im here to pick up a package you and everybody else mailbox number hitch hadnt given me a number hitch paley said thered be a package waiting for me his eyes narrowed and his head seemed to rise a quarter inch in sudden indignation hitch paley from the tone of his voice this was already going badly but i nodded hitch fucking paley he thumped the counter with his fist i dont know who the fuck you are but if you happen to be talking to hitch paley you tell that asshole our scores are not settled he can keep his fuckin packages to himself too you dont have anything for me do i have anything for you do i have anything for you the toe of my fucking boot is what i have for you i managed to find the door thus the failed journalist failed husband and failed parent became a failed criminal riding the ammag coach out of massachusetts out of the urban corridor into shanty sprawl and dusky farmland i tried to put these mysteries out of my mind anything could have gone wrong between hitch paley and easys packages but i told myself it didnt really matter i had done what hitch had asked and i was frankly relieved not be carrying a butcherpaperwrapped bundle of incriminating evidence the only potential problem was that hitch might and in the near future want his money back midnight inched past in the rainy dark i reclined my seat and contemplated the future west of the mississippi the economy was booming the new covalent processor platforms had enabled oceans of complex new software and i was certain i could find at least an entrylevel gig with one of the silicon ring nasdaq candidates put my degree to use before it became obsolete in time i could pay hitch back and null the debt thus crime engenders virtue in time i imagined i would become respectable i would prove my worth to janice and be forgiven and kait would come toddling back into my arms but i couldnt help thinking of my father seeing him in my own reflection in the rainscored window failure is entropy this specter seemed to announce and entropy is a law of nature love becomes pain eventually you learn to ignore it you achieve the nirvana of indifference its not easy but nothing worth doing is easy hitch and i were among the first to witness the chumphon chronolith and in the great conflation of time and mind that followed well yes it has occurred to me to wonder how much of my own pessimism or my fathers i fed into that loop not to mention a touch of madness on the maternal side cold air filtered into the darkened coach and i remembered how fervently my mother had despised the cold she had taken it personally especially in her last years a personal affront she was an enemy of ice plagued by snow she told me once that snow was the fecal matter of angels it didnt stink being angelic in origin but it was an insult nevertheless so pure it burned like fire on mortal skin tucking away my ticket stub in a jacket pocket i noticed that the index number printed under the ammag logo was same as the due date inscribed on the kuin stone at the depot in minneapolisst paul i picked up the local news and a popscience magazine with an article about the chronolith the science magazine featured a number of photos of the thai site much changed from the day hitch and i had visited it a vast blankness had been bulldozed into the brown earth surrounding the pillar and the cleared perimeter was pockmarked with tents polygonal equipment sheds makeshift laboratories and an array of ochrepainted portapotties a multinational pool of scientific investigators had been installed by the pacific treaty powers mostly materials scientists who were at this point admittedly baffled the chronolith was spectacularly inert it seemed not to react with its environment at all could not be etched with acid or cut with lasers deep digging had not yet reached the roots of it its temperature at least since the icy blast of its arrival had never varied from ambient by so much as a fraction of a centigrade degree the tiling was spectacularly aloof spectral analysis of the pillar had proved especially unrewarding the chronolith passed and scattered light in the bluegreen portion of the visible spectrum and inexplicably at a few harmonic wavelengths both infrared and ultraviolet at other frequencies it was either purely reflective impossibly reflective or purely absorptive net inputoutput appeared to sum to zero but no one was certain of that and even that putative symmetry defied easy explanation the article went on to speculate about a wholly new state of matter which was less an explanation than a confession of ignorance phrased so as not to disturb the smooth flow of investigatory funding speculation about the legend inscribed on the chronolith was even gaudier and even less enlightening was time travel really a practical possibility most authorities dismissed the notion the inscription was then perhaps a form of stealthing a clue designed to mislead even the name kuin was spectacularly uninformative if it was a proper name it might have been chinese but was more commonly dutch the word also turned up in finnish and japanese there was even a tribe of indigenous peruvians called the huni kuin though they could hardly be held responsible the alternate possibility that some asian warlord a mere twenty years hence had created a monument to a minor victory and projected it into the recent past was simply too ridiculous to be true if this seems shortsighted now consider that the scientific community had already been forced to swallow a number of evident absurdities about the kuin stone and understandably balked at this ultimate impossibility people used the word impossible more freely then such was the consensus circa autumn of i had bought the local paper for a more practical purpose i searched its classified pages for rental properties close to the ring of suburban digital design consortia the search coughed up a list of possibilities and by wednesday i had bribed my way into a onebedroom walkup just west of the twin cities agricultural enclave the room was unfurnished i bought a chair a table and a bed anything more would have been a confession of permanency i decided i was in transition then i looked for a job i didnt call janice at least not right away because i wanted something to show her first some token of my credibility an income for example if there had been a merit badge for good citizenship i would have applied for that too of course none of this helped there is no retrieving the past a fact the reader almost surely understands the younger generation knows these things better than my peers ever did the knowledge has been forced on them three by february of janice and kaitlin had moved into a pleasant suburban coop far from janices work but close to good schools the divorce contract we had finalized in december included a custody agreement that gave me kaitlin for an average of one week per month janice had been reasonable about sharing kait and i had seen a fair amount of my daughter since the fall i was scheduled to have kait this saturday but a day together mandated by a divorce court isnt just a day together its something else strange awkward and uncomfortable i showed up at janices at a sunny but viciously cold saturday morning janice invited me into her home and told me kait was at a friends house watching morning cartoons until the appointed hour the coop apartment had a pleasant odor of fresh broadloom and recent breakfast janice in her weekendmorning blouse and denims poured me a cup of coffee it seemed to me that we had reached a sort of rapprochement that we might even have enjoyed seeing each other if not for the baggage of pain and recrimination each of us carried into the others presence not to mention bruised affection forlorn hope and muted grief janice sat down with the coffee table between us she had left a couple of her antiques on the table in a fauxcasual display she collected printedpaper magazines from the last century life and time and so on they lay in their stiff plastic wrappers like advertisements for a lost age ticket stubs from the titanic youre still at campionmiller she asked another sixmonth contract and a k reup bonus at this rate my net income might someday advance all the way from entry level to junior employee i had spent most of that bonus on a widescreen entertainment panel so kait and i could watch movies together before christmas id been relying on my portable station for both work and entertainment so its looking longterm as such things go i sipped from the cup she had given me the coffees lousy by the way oh you always made very bad coffee janice smiled and now you can bring yourself to tell me about it mmhm all those years you hated my coffee i didnt say i hated it i said it was bad you never turned down a cup no i never did kaitlin came in from the neighbors crashed through the front door in dripping plastic boots and a pleated winter jacket her glasses immediately frosted over with condensation the glasses were a new addition kaitlin was only modestly nearsighted but they dont do corrective surgery on children as young as kait she swiped her lenses with her fingers and gazed at me owlishly kait used to give me a big smile whenever she saw me coming she still smiled at me but not automatically janice said did you see your cartoons love no kaits eyes remained fixed on me mr levy wanted to see the news it didnt occur to me to ask why janices neighbor had insisted on seeing the news but then if i had asked i might have missed an afternoon with kait have fun with daddy today janice said do you need to go to the bathroom before you leave kaitlin was scandalized by this indelicacy no all right then janice straightened and looked at me eight oclock scott eight i promised we hummed along in my secondhand car neatly laced into heavy saturday traffic by proximity protocols i had promised kaitlin a trip to an amusement mall and she was already cycling through waves of elation and exhaustion jabbering for long stretches of the ride then lapsing against the upholstery with a forlorn arewethereyet expression on her face during her silences i examined my conscience cautiously the way you might handle a sedated but venomous snake i peeked at myself through janices eyes and saw yet again the man who had taken her and her daughter to a thirdworld country who had nearly stranded them there who had exposed them to an expatriate beach culture which though no doubt colorful and interesting was also drugraddled dangerous and hopelessly unproductive the kind word for that sort of behavior is thoughtless synonyms include selfish and reckless had i changed well maybe but i still owed hitch paley several thousand dollars though i hadnt heard from him in half a year and had begun to harbor hopes that i wouldnt ever and a life that includes such accessories as hitch paley is not by definition stable still here was kaitlin unharmed periodically bouncing against the upholstery like a harnessed capuchin monkey i had taught her to tie her shoes i had shown her the southern cross one cloudless night in chumphon i was her father and she suffered my presence gladly we spent three hours at the mall enough to tire her out kait was fascinated if a little intimidated by the clowns in their morphologically adaptive character suits and makeup she packed away an astonishing amount of mall food sat through two halfhour surround adventures and slept sitting up on the way back to my apartment home i turned up the lights and shut out the prairiewinter dusk for dinner i heated frozen chicken and string beans prole food but goodsmelling in the narrow kitchen we watched downloads while we ate kaitlin didnt say much but the atmosphere was cozy and when she looked to the right i was able to see her deaf ear cosseted in a nest of golden hair the ear was not grossly deformed merely puckered where the bacteria had chewed away notches of flesh pinkly scarred in her other ear she wore a hearing aid like a tiny polished seashell after dinner i washed the dishes then coaxed kaitlin away from cartoons and switched to a news broadcast the news was from bangkok that kaitlin said sourly as she emerged from the bathroom is what mr levy wanted to see this was as you will have guessed the first of the citybusting chronoliths in effect first notice that something more significant than a stranger than science anecdote was taking place in southeast asia i sat down next to kaitlin and let her curl up against my ribs while i watched kait was immediately bored children kaitlins age possess no context one video event is much like another and theyre ruthless with their attention she was impressed if confused by the helicopter shots of the riverfront neighborhoods destroyed and icecoated steaming in the sunlight but there were only a few of these segments available and the news networks ran them repeatedly over an aural haze of casualty estimates and meaningless interpretation the palpable atmosphere of confusion fear and denial evinced by the commentators kept her frowning a few minutes more but before long she closed her eyes and her breathing steadied into petite phlegmatic snores we were there kait you and i i thought ruined bangkok from the air looked like a misprinted road map i recognized the chao phrya bending through the city and the devastated rattanakosin district the old royal city where the khlong lawd fed the larger river a patch of green might have been lumphini park but the gridwork of roads had been reduced to an incomprehensible wasteland of brick and rebar tin and cardboard and frostheaved asphalt all glittering with ice and wound about with fog the ice had not prevented a number of broken gas mains from catching fire islands of flame in the glacial wreckage a great many people had died here as the commentators took pains to point out some of the baggy objects littering the streets were almost certainly human bodies the only intact structure closer than the suburbs was at the very center of the disaster the chronolith itself it was not much like the chumphon chronolith it was taller grander more intricately detailed and more finely sculpted but i immediately recognized the translucent blue surface visible where patches of frost had peeled away that distinct indifferent skin the monument had arrived explosively after dark bangkok time these clips were more recent a few from the chaotic night most fresh this morning as time passed the news networks relayed more aerial video it was possible to see the new chronolith in a kind of montage as it shed its cloak of condensed and frozen moisture changing from what it had seemed to be a monstrously large oddly bulky white pillar into what it really was the stylized form of a human figure it recalled more than anything else the public monuments of stalinist russia the winged victory at leningrad say or maybe the colossus of rhodes astride its harbor such structures are daunting not only because they are enormous but because they are so coldly stylized this was not an image but a schematic of a human being even the face contrived to suggest some generic eurasian perfection unattainable in the real world scabs of ice clung to the domes of the eyes the crevasses of the nostrils beyond its apparent masculinity the figure might have been anyone at least anyone in whom infinite confidence had colluded with absolute power kuin i supposed as he would have us see him his torso blended into the fundamental columnar structure of the chronolith the base of the monument maybe a quarter mile in diameter straddled the chao phrya and skins of ice had formed where it met the water these were breaking up in the sunlight and floating downstream ice floes in the tropics bumping the halfsunken hulls of tourist barges janice called at ten demanding to know what i had done with kait i looked at my watch gritted my teeth and apologized i explained to janice how we had spent the day and how i had become distracted by the bangkok chronolith that thing she said as if it were already old news and maybe for janice it was she had already processed the chronoliths into a generalized symbolic threat terrifying but distant she seemed unhappy that i had brought it up i can drive kaitlin back tonight i said or keep her until morning if thats more convenient shes asleep on the sofa right now get her a pillow and a blanket janice said as if that thought had not already crossed my mind i guess she might as well sleep through i did better than that i carried kaitlin to the bed and took the sofa for myself sat up nearly until dawn watching tv with the sound turned low the commentary was inaudible and probably better that way only the images remained growing more complex as news crews pushed deeper into the rubble by morning kuins vast head was wreathed in cloud and rain had begun to dampen the burning city in the summer of that year the summer kaitlin learned to ride the bicycle i bought her for her birthday a third chronolith cored the living heart out of pyongyang and the asian crisis began in earnest four time passed should i apologize for these lapses a year here a year there history isnt linear after all it runs in shallows and narrows and bayous and bays and treacherous undertows and hidden whirlpools and even a memoir is a kind of history but i suppose it depends on the audience im writing for and thats still unclear in my mind who am i addressing my own generation so many of whom have died or are now dying our heirs who may not have experienced these events but who can at least recite them from schoolbooks or some more distant generation of men and women who may have been allowed god willing and impossible as it seems to forget a little of what passed in this century in other words how much should i explain and how thoroughly but its a moot question really there are only two of us here me and you whoever you are nearly five years passed between my visit to the mall with kaitlin and the day arnie kunderson called me out of a batchsort test to his office which was perhaps the next significant turning point in my life if you believe in linear causality and the civilized deference of the future to the past but taste those years first imagine them if you dont remember them five summers warm ones when the news between kuin events was dominated by the ongoing depletion of the oglalla aquifer new mexico and texas had virtually lost the ability to irrigate their dry lands the oglalla aquifer a body of underground water as large as lake huron and a relic of the last ice age remained essential to agriculture in nebraska parts of wyoming and colorado kansas and oklahoma and it continued to decline sucked up from increasing depths by ruthlessly efficient centrifugal pumps the news feeds featured the farm exodus in repetitive blunt images families in battered cargo trucks stalled on the interstates their sullen children with web toys plugging their ears and masking their eyes men and women standing on labor lines in los angeles or detroit the dark underside of our blossoming economy because most of us had work we allowed ourselves the luxury of pity five winters our winters were dry and cold those years the welltodo wore thermally adaptive clothes for the first time which left the tonier shopping districts looking as if they had been invaded by aliens in polyester jogging suits and respirators while the rest of us beetled down the street in bulging parkas or stuck as close as possible to the skywalks domestic robots selfguided vacuum cleaners lawnmowers bright enough not to maim local children became commonplace the sony dogwalker was withdrawn from the market after a wellpublicized accident involving a malfunctioning streetlight and a brace of shi tzus in those years even the elderly stopped calling their entertainment panels tv sets lux ebone announced her retirement twice cletus king defeated incumbent marylin leahy giving the white house to the federal party though democrats continued to control congress catchphrases of the day now all but forgotten now give me mine brutal but nice like daylight in a drawer names and places we imagined were important doctor dan lesser the wheeling courthouse beckett and goldstein kwame finto events the second wave of lunar landings the zairian pandemic the european currency crisis and the storming of the hague and kuin of course like a swelling drumbeat pyongyang then ho chi minh city eventually macao sapporo the kanto plain yichang and all the early kuin mania and fascination the ten thousand websources with their peculiar and contradictory theories the endless simmering of the crackpot press the symposia and the committee reports the think tanks and the congressional inquiries the young man in los angeles who had his name legally changed to kuin and all his subsequent imitators kuin whoever or whatever he might be had already caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people perhaps more for that reason the name was treated with gravitas in respectable circles for the same reason it became popular with comedians and tshirt designers kuinist imagery was banned from certain schools until the aclu intervened because he stood for nothing discernible except destruction and conquest kuin became a slate on which the disaffected scrawled their manifestos none of this was taken terribly seriously in north america elsewhere the seismic rumbling was more ominous i followed it all closely for two years i worked at the campionmiller research facility outside of st paul writing patches into selfevolved commercialinterface code then i was transferred to the downtown offices where i joined a team doing much the same work on much more secure material campionmillers own tightlyheld source code the beating heart of our major products mostly i drove in from my onebedroom apartment but on the worst winter days i rode the new elevated train an aluminum chamber into which too many commuters shed their heat and moisture mingled body odors and aftershave the city a pale scrim on steaming white windows it was on one of those trips that i saw a young woman sitting halfway down the car wearing a hat with the words twenty and three printed on it twenty years and three months the nominal interval between the appearance of a chronolith and its predicted conquest she was reading a tattered copy of stranger than science which must have been out of print for at least sixty years i wanted to approach her to ask her what events had equipped her with these totems these echoes of my own past but i was too bashful and how could i have phrased such a question anyway i never saw her again i dated a few times for most of a year i went out with a woman from the qualitycontrol division of campionmiller annali kincaid who loved turquoise and new drama and took a lively interest in current events she dragged me to lectures and readings i would otherwise have ignored we broke up finally because she possessed deep and complex political convictions and i did not i was a kuinwatcher otherwise politically agnostic but i was able to impress her on at least one occasion she had used someones credentials at campionmiller to wangle us admission to an academic conference at the university the chronoliths scientific and cultural issues my idea as much as hers this time well mostly mine annali had already voiced her objection to the aerial and orbital photographs of chronoliths with which i had decorated my bedroom the kuinist downloads that littered the apartment we sat through the presentation of three papers and most of a pleasant saturday afternoon at which point annali decided the discourse was a little too abstract for her taste but on our way through the lobby i was hailed by an older woman in loose jeans and an oversized peagreen sweater beaming at me through monstrous eyeglasses her name was sulamith chopra i had known her at cornell her career had taken her deep into the fundamentalphysics end of the chronolith research i introduced sue to annali annali was floored ms chopra i know who you are i mean they always quote your name in the news stories well ive done some work im pleased to meet you likewise but sue hadnt taken her eyes off me strange i should run into you here scotty is it unexpected significant maybe or maybe not we need to catch up on our lives sometime i was flattered i wanted very much to talk to her pathetically i offered her my business card no need she said i can find you when i need you scotty never fear you can but she was gone in the crowd youre well connected annali told me on the ride home but that wasnt right sue didnt call me not that year and my attempts to reach her were rebuffed i was connected not well but not quite randomly either running into sue chopra was an omen like seeing the woman in the commuter car but the meaning of it was inscrutable a prophecy in an indecipherable language a signal buried in noise being called to arnie kundersons office was never a good sign he had been my supervisor since i joined campionmiller and i had learned this about arnie when the news was good he would bring it to you if he called you into his office prepare for the worst i had seen arnie angry most recently when the team i was leading botched an ordersortandmail protocol and nearly cost us a contract with a nationwide retailer but i knew this was something even more serious as soon as i walked into his office when he was angry arnie was ebulliently floridly angry today worse he sat behind his desk with the furtive look of a man entrusted with some repellent but necessary duty an undertaker say he wouldnt meet my eyes i pulled up a chair and waited we werent formal we had been to each others barbecues he folded his hands and said theres never a good way to do this what i have to tell you scott is that campionmiller isnt renewing your contract were canceling it this is official notice i know you havent had any warning and christ knows im incredibly fucking sorry to drop this on you youre entitled to full severance and a generous compensation package for the six months left to run i wasnt as surprised as arnie seemed to expect the asian economic collapse had cut deeply into campionmillers foreign markets just last year the firm had been acquired by a multinational corporation whose management team laid off a quarter of the staff and cashed in most of cms subsidiary holdings for their realestate value i did however feel somewhat blindsided unemployment was up that year the oglalla crisis and the collapse of the asian economies had dumped a lot of people onto the job market there was a tent city five blocks square down along the riverside i pictured myself there i said are you going to tell the team or do you want me to do it the team i led was working on predictive market software one of cms more lucrative lines in particular we were factoring genuine as versus perceived randomness into such applications as consumer trending and competitive pricing ask a computer to pick two random numbers between one and ten and the machine will cough up digits in a genuinely random sequence maybe maybe and so on ask a number of human beings plot their answers and youll get a distribution curve heavily weighted at and when people think random they tend to picture numbers you might call unobtrusive not too near the limits nor precisely in the middle not part of a presumed sequence etc in other words there is something you might call intuitive randomness which differs dramatically from the real thing was it possible to exploit this difference to our advantage in highvolume commercial apps such as stock portfolios or marketing or product priceplacement we thought so wed made a little progress the work had been going well enough that arnies news seemed at least oddly timed he cleared his throat you misunderstand the team isnt leaving excuse me its not my decision scott you said that okay its not your fault but if the project is going forward dont ask me to justify this frankly i cant he let that sink in five years i said fuck arnie five years nothings guaranteed not anymore you know that as well as i do it might help if i understood why this was happening he twisted in his chair im not at liberty to say your work has been excellent and ill put that in writing if you like what are you telling me i made an enemy in management he halfway nodded the work we do here is pretty tightly held people get nervous i dont know if you made an enemy exactly maybe you made the wrong friends but that wasnt likely i hadnt made very many friends people i could share lunch with catch a twins game with sure but no one i confided in somehow by some process of slow emotional attrition i had become the kind of guy who works hard and smiles amiably and goes home and spends the evening with the video panel and a couple of beers which is what i did the day arnie kunderson fired me the apartment hadnt changed much since i moved in barring the one wall of the bedroom i used as a sort of bulletin board news printouts and photos of chronolith sites plus my copious notes on the subject to the degree that the place had improved it was mostly kaitlins doing kait was ten now eager to criticize my fashion sense probably it made her feel grown up i had replaced the sofa because i had gotten tired of hearing how uncontemporary it was kaits favorite word of derision at any rate the old sofa had gone in its place was an austere blue padded bench that looked great until you tried to get comfortable on it i thought about calling janice but decided not to janice didnt appreciate spontaneous phone calls she preferred to hear from me on a regular and predictable schedule and as for kaitlin better not to bother her either if i did she might launch into a discourse on what she had done today with whit as she was encouraged to call her stepfather whit was a great guy in kaits opinion whit made her laugh maybe i should talk to whit i thought maybe whit would make me laugh so i did nothing that evening except nurse a few beers and surf the satellites even the cheap servers carried a number of scienceandnature feeds one of them was showing fresh video from thailand of a genuinely dangerous expedition up the chao phrya to the ruins of bangkok sponsored by the national geographic society and a halfdozen corporate donors whose logos were prominently featured in the startup credits i turned off the sound let the pictures speak for themselves not much of bangkoks urban core had been rebuilt in the years since no one wanted to live or work too close to the chronolith rumors of proximity sickness frightened people away though there was no such diagnosis in the legitimate clinical literature the bandits and the revolutionary militias however were quite real and omnipresent but despite all this there was still a brisk river trade along the chao phrya even in the shadow of kuin the program began with overflight footage of the city crude canted docks allowed access to rough warehouses a marketplace stocks of fresh fruits and vegetables order emerging from the wreckage streets reclaimed from the rubble and open to commerce from a great enough altitude it looked like a story of human perseverance in the face of disaster the view from the ground was less encouraging as the expedition approached the heart of the city the chronolith was present in every shot from a distance dominating the brown river or closer towering into a tropical noon the monument was conspicuously clean even birds and insects avoided it airborne dust had collected in the few protected crevices of the sculpted face faintly softening kuins abstracted gaze but nothing grew even in that protected soil the sterility of it was absolute where the base of the monument touched ground on one bank of the river a few lianas had attempted to scale the immense octagonal base but the mirrorsmooth surface was ungraspable unwelcoming the expedition anchored midriver and went ashore for more footage in one sequence a storm swirled over the ancient city rainwater cascaded from the chronolith in miniature torrents small waterfalls churning plumes of silt from the river bottom the dockside vendors covered their stalls with tarpaulins and sheet plastic and retreated beneath them cut to a shot of a wild monkey on a collapsed exxon billboard barking at the sky clouds parting around the promontory of kuins vast head the sun emerging near the green horizon the chronolith shadowing the city like the gnomon of a great bleak sundial there was more but nothing revelatory i turned off the monitor and went to bed we the englishspeaking world had by this time agreed on certain terms to describe the chronoliths what a chronolith did for instance was to appear or to arrive though some favored touched down as if it were a kind of stalled tornado the newest of the chronoliths had appeared arrived touched down more than eighteen months ago leveling the waterfront of macao only half a year earlier a similar monument had destroyed taipei both stones marked as usual military victories roughly twenty years in the future twenty and three hardly a lifetime but arguably long enough for kuin if he existed if he was more than a contrived symbol or an abstraction to mass forces for his putative asian conquests long enough for a young man to become a middleaged man long enough for a young girl to become a young woman but no chronolith had arrived anywhere in the world for more than a year now and some of us had chosen to believe that the crisis was if not exactly finished at least purely asian confined by geography bound by oceans our public discourse was aloof detached much of southern china was in a condition of political and military chaos a nomansland in which kuin was perhaps already gathering his nucleus of followers but an editorial in yesterdays paper had wondered whether kuin might not in the long term turn out to be a positive force a kuinist empire was hardly likely to be a benevolent dictatorship but it might restore stability to a dangerously destabilized region what was left of the tattered beijing bureaucracy had already detonated a tactical nuclear device in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy last years socalled kuin of yichang the result had been a breached dam and a flood that carried radioactive mud all the way to the east china sea and if crippled beijing was capable of that could a kuin regime be worse i had no opinion of my own we were all whistling through the graveyard in those years even those of us who paid attention analyzing the chronoliths by date time size implied conquest and such so that we could pretend to understand them but i preferred not to play that game the chronoliths had shadowed my life since things went bad with janice they were emblematic of every malign and unpredictable force in the world there were times when i was profoundly afraid of them and as often as not i admitted that fact to myself is this obsession annali had thought so i tried to sleep sleep that knits the raveled sleeve etc sleep that kills the awkward downtime between midnight and dawn but i didnt get even that an hour before sunrise my phone buzzed i should have let the server pick it up but i groped for the handset and flipped it open afraid as always when the phone rings late at night that something had happened to kait hello scott a coarse male voice said scotty i thought for one panicky moment of hitch paley hitch with whom i had not spoken since hitch paley riding out of the past like a pissedoff ghost but it wasnt hitch it was some other ghost i listened to the phlegmy breathing the compression and expansion of night air in a withered bellows dad scotty he said as if he couldnt get past the name dad have you been drinking i was courteous enough to refrain from adding again no he said angrily no i ah well fuck it then this is the kind of the kind of treatment well you know fuck it and he was gone i rolled out of bed i watched the sun come up over the agricultural coops to the east the great corporate collective farms our bulwark against famine a dusting of snow had collected in the fields sparkling white between empty cornrows later i drove to annalis apartment knocked on her door we hadnt dated for more than a year but we were still friendly when we met in the coffee room or the cafeteria she took a slightly maternal interest in me these days inquiring after my health as if she expected something to go terribly wrong sooner or later maybe that day had come though i was still healthy as a horse but she was startled when she opened the door and saw me startled and obviously dismayed she knew id been fired maybe she knew more than that which was why i had come here on the off chance that she could help make sense of what had happened scotty she said hey you should have called first youre busy she didnt look busy she was wearing loose culottes and a faded yellow shirt cleaning the kitchen maybe im going out in a few minutes id ask you in but i have to get dressed and all that what are you doing here she was i realized actually afraid of me or of being seen with me scott she looked up and down the corridor are you in trouble why would i be in trouble annali well i heard about you being fired how long ago what do you mean how long have you known i was going to be fired you mean was it general knowledge no scott god that would be humiliating no of course you hear rumors what kind of rumors she frowned and chewed her lip that was a new habit the kind of work campionmiller does they dont need trouble with the government the fuck does that have to do with me you know you dont have to shout annali trouble with the government the thing i heard is that some people were asking about you like government people police no are you in trouble with the police no just people in suits maybe irs i dont know that doesnt make sense its just people talking scott it could all be bullshit really i dont know why they fired you its just that cm they depend on keeping all their permits in order all that tech stuff they ship overseas if somebody comes in asking questions about you it could endanger everybody annali im not a security risk i know scott she knew nothing of the sort she wouldnt meet my eyes honestly im sure its all bullshit but i really do have to get dressed she began to ease the door shut next time phone me for gods sake she lived on the second floor of a little threestory brick building in the old part of edina apartment i stared at the number on the door for a while twenty and three i never saw annali kincaid again occasionally i wonder what sort of life she led how she fared during the long hard years i didnt tell janice that i had lost my job not that i was still trying to prove anything to janice to myself maybe to kaitlin almost certainly not that kait cared what i did for a living at ten kait still perceived adult business as opaque and uninteresting she knew only that i went to work and that i earned enough money to make me a respectable if not wealthy member of the grownup world and that was fine i liked that occasional reflection of myself in kaits eyes stable predictable even boring but not disappointing certainly not dangerous i didnt want kait or janice or even whit to know id been fired at least not immediately not until i had something to add to the story if not a happy ending then at least a second chapter a whatcomesnext it came in the form of another unexpected phone call not a happy ending no not an ending at all definitely not happy janice and whit invited me to dinner they did this on a quarterly basis the way you might contribute to a pension plan or a worthy charity janice was no longer a single mom in a rentcontrolled townhouse she had shed that stigma when she married her supervisor at the biochem lab where she worked whitman delahunt whit was an ambitious guy with serious managerial talent clarion pharmaceuticals had prospered despite the asian crisis feeding western markets suddenly deprived of cutrate chinese and taiwanese biochemical imports whit sometimes referred to the chronoliths as gods little tariff which made janice smile uneasily i dont think whit liked me much but he accepted me as a sort of country cousin attached to kaitlin by an unpleasant and unmentionable accident of paternity to be fair he tried to make me feel welcome at least this night he opened the door of his twostory house framing himself in warm yellow light he grinned whit was one of those big soft men teddybearshaped and about as hairy not handsome but the sort women call cute he was ten years older than janice balding but wearing it well his grin was expansive if inauthentic and his teeth were blazing white whit almost certainly had the best dentistry the best radial kariotomy and the best car on the block i wondered if it was hard on janice and kaitlin being the best wife and the best daughter come on in scott he exclaimed take off those boots warm yourself by the fire we ate in the spacious dining room where leaded windows of distinguished provenance rattled in their frames kait talked a little about school she was having trouble this year particularly in math whit talked with vastly greater enthusiasm about his work janice was still running fairly routine protein syntheses at clarion and talked about it not at all she seemed content to let whit do the bragging kait excused herself first dashing off to an adjacent room where the television had been mumbling counterpoint to the sound of the wind whit brought out a brandy decanter he served drinks awkwardly like a westerner attempting a japanese tea ceremony whit wasnt much of a drinker he said im afraid ive been doing all the talking how about you scott hows life treating you fortune presents gifts not according to the book scottys quoting poetry again janice explained what i mean is ive been offered a job youre thinking of leaving campionmiller i parted ways with campionmiller about two weeks ago oh gutsy decision scott thank you whit but it didnt seem that way at the time janice said out of what appeared to be a profounder understanding so who are you with now well its not for certain but you remember sue chopra janice frowned then her eyes widened yes cornell right the junior professor who taught that flaky firstyear course janice and i had met at university the first time i had seen her she had been walking through the chemistry lab with a bottle of lithium aluminum hydroxide in her hand if she had dropped it she might have killed us both first rule of a stable relationship dont drop the fucking bottle it was janice who had introduced me to sulamith chopra when sue was a ridiculously tall and chunky postdoc building a reputation in the physics department sue had been handed probably as punishment for some academic indiscretion a secondyear interdisciplinary course of the kind offered to english students as a science credit and to science students as an english credit for which she turned around and wrote a curriculum so intimidating that it scared off everybody but a few naive artsies and confused computer science types and me the pleasant surprise was that sue had no interest in failing anyone she had put together the course description to scare away parvenus all she wanted with the rest of us was an interesting conversation so metaphor and realitymodeling in literature and the physical sciences became a kind of weekly salon and the only requirement for a passing grade was that we demonstrate that wed read her syllabus and that she must not be bored with what we said about it for an easy mark all you had to do was ask sue about her pet research topics calabiyau geometry say or the difference between prior and contextual forces she would talk for twenty minutes and grade you on the plausibility of the rapt attention you displayed but sue was fun to bullshit with too so mostly her classes were extended bull sessions and by the end of the semester i had stopped seeing her as this sixfootfourinch bugeyed badlydressed oddity and had begun to perceive the funny fiercely intelligent woman she was i said sue chopra offered me a job janice turned to whit and said one of the cornell profs didnt i see her name in the paper recently probably so but that was awkward territory shes part of a federallyfunded research group she has enough clout to hire help so she got in touch with you whit said thats maybe not the kindest way to put it its okay whit what janice means is what would a highpowered academic like sulamith chopra want with a keyboard hack like myself its a fair question janice said and the answer is i guess they wanted one more keyboard hack you told her you needed work well you know we stay in touch i can find you when i need you scotty never fear uhhuh janice said which was her way of telling me she knew i was lying but she didnt press well thats great scott whit said these are tough times to be out of a job so thats great we said no more about it until the meal was finished and whit had excused himself janice waited until he was out of earshot something youre not mentioning several things i gave her one of them the job is in baltimore baltimore baltimore maryland you mean youre moving across the country if i get the job its not for sure yet but you havent told kaitlin no i havent told kaitlin i wanted to talk to you about it first uhhuh well i dont know what to say i mean this is really sudden the question is how upset kait will be but i cant answer that no offense but she doesnt talk about you as much as she used to its not like ill be out of her life we can visit visiting isnt parenting scott visiting is an uncle thing but i dont know maybe thats best she and whit are bonding pretty well even if im out of town im still her father insofar as you ever were yes thats true you sound angry im not just wondering whether i should be whit came back downstairs then and we chatted some more but the wind grew louder and hard snow ticked on the windows and janice fretted out loud over the condition of the streets so i said goodbye to whit and janice and waited at the door for kait to give me her customary farewell hug she came into the foyer but stopped a few feet away her eyes were stormy and her lower lip was trembling kaitybird i said please dont call me that im not a baby then i figured it out you were listening her hearing impairment didnt prevent her from eavesdropping if anything it had made her stealthier and more curious hey she said it doesnt matter youre moving away thats all right of all the things i could have said what i chose was you shouldnt listen in on other peoples conversations kaitlin dont tell me what to do she said and turned and ran to her room five janice called me a day before i was due to leave for baltimore and an interview with sue chopra i was surprised to hear her voice on the phone she seldom called except at our agreedon times nothing wrong janice said at once i just wanted to you know wish you luck the kind of luck that would keep me out of town but that was petty i said thanks i mean it ive been thinking this over and i wanted you to know yes kaitlins taking it pretty hard but shell come around if she didnt care about you she wouldnt be so upset well thank you for saying so thats not all she hesitated ah scott we fucked up pretty badly didnt we those days in thailand it was just too weird too strange ive apologized for that i didnt call you up for an apology do you hear what im saying maybe it was partly my fault too lets not play whose fault it was janice but i appreciate you saying so i couldnt help surveying my apartment as we spoke it seemed empty already under the stale blinds the windows were white with ice what i want to tell you is that i know youve been trying to make it up not to me im a lost cause right but to kaitlin i said nothing all the time you spent at campionmiller you know i was worried when you came back from thailand way back when i didnt know whether you were going to hang on my doorstep and harass me whether it would be good for kaitlin even to see you but i have to admit whatever it takes to be a divorced father you had the right stuff you brought kait through all that trauma as if you were walking her through a minefield taking all the chances yourself this was as intimate a conversation as we had had in years and i wasnt sure how to respond she went on it seemed like you were trying to prove something to yourself prove that you were capable of acting decently taking responsibility not proving it i said doing it doing it but punishing yourself too blaming yourself which is part of taking responsibility but past a certain point scott that becomes a problem in itself only monks get to lacerate themselves fulltime im not a monk janice so dont act like one if this job looks like a good choice take it take it scott kait wont stop loving you just because you cant see her on a weekly basis shes upset now but shes capable of understanding it was a long speech it was also janices best effort to date to grant me absolution give me full marks for owning up to the disaster i had made of our lives and that was good it was generous but it was also the sound of a closing door she was giving me permission to look for a better life because any lingering suspicion that we could recreate what was once between us was desperately misplaced well we both knew that but what the head admits isnt always what the heart allows i have to say goodbye scotty there was a little catch in her voice almost a hiccup okay janice give whit my best wishes call when you find work right kait still needs to hear from you whatever she may think times like this you know the world being what it is i understand and be careful on the way to the airport the roads are slippery since that last big snow i came into the baltimore airport expecting a hired driver with a name card but it was sulamith chopra herself who met me there was no mistaking her even after all these years she towered above the crowd even her head was tall a gawky brown peanut topped with black frazzle she wore balloonsized khaki pants and a blouse that might once have been white but appeared to have shared laundry rounds with a few noncolorfast items her look was so completely salvation army thrift shop that i wondered whether she was really in a position to offer anyone a job but then i thought academia and the sciences she grinned i grinned less energetically i put out my hand but sue was having none of it she grabbed me and bearhugged me breaking away about a tenth of a second before the grip became painful same old scotty she said same old sue i managed ive got my car here have you had lunch yet i havent had breakfast then its my treat she had called me two weeks ago waking me out of a dreamless afternoon sleep her first words were hi scotty i hear you lost your job note this was a woman i hadnt spoken with since our chance meeting in minneapolis a woman who hadnt returned any of my calls since it took me a few groggy seconds just to place the voice sorry i havent got back to you till now she went on there were reasons for that but i kept track of you you kept track of me its a long story i waited for her to tell it instead she reminisced for a while about cornell and gave me the highlights of her career since then her academic work with the chronoliths which interested me enormously and distracted me as im sure sue knew it would she talked about the physics in greater detail than i was able to follow calabiyau spaces something she called tau turbulence until at last i asked her so yeah i lost my job how did you know well thats part of why im calling i feel a certain amount of responsibility for that i recalled what arnie kunderson had said about enemies in management what annali had told me about men in suits i said whatever you need to tell me tell me okay but you have to be patient i assume you dont have anywhere to go no urgent bathroom calls ill keep you posted okay well where to begin did you ever notice scotty how hard it is to sort out cause and effect things get tangled up sue had published a number of papers on the subject of exotic forms of matter and cy transformations nonbaryonic matter and how to untie knots in string by the time the chumphon chronolith appeared many of these dealt with problems in temporal symmetry a concept she seemed determined to explain to me until i cut her short after chumphon when congress began to take seriously the potential threat of the chronoliths she had been invited to join an investigatory effort sponsored by a handful of security agencies and funded under an ongoing federal appropriation the work they told her would be basic research would be parttime would involve the collaboration of the cornell faculty and various elder colleagues and would look impressive on her curriculum vitae she said it was like los alamos you understand but a little more relaxed relaxed at least at first so i accepted it was in those first few months i came across your name it was all pretty wideopen back then i saw all kinds of security shit there was a master list of eyewitnesses people they had debriefed in thailand ah and of course your name was on it we were thinking of bringing all those people in anybody we could find for blood testing and whatever but we decided against it too much work too invasive not likely to produce any substantive results plus there were civilliberties problems but i remembered your name on that list i knew it was you because they had practically your entire life history down there including cornell including a hypertext link to me and again i thought of hitch paley his name would have been on that list too maybe they had looked a little more deeply into his business activities since then maybe hitch was in jail maybe that was why there had been no pickup that day at easys packages and no word from him since but of course i didnt say any of this to sue she went on well i made a kind of mental note of it but that was that at least until recently what you have to understand scotty is that the evolution of this crisis has made everyone a lot more paranoid maybe justifiably paranoid especially since yichang yichang just drove everybody completely bugfuck you know how many people were killed by floodwater alone not to mention that it was the first nuclear device detonated in a kindofsortof war since before the turn of the century she didnt have to tell me id been paying attention it was not even slightly surprising to learn that the nsa or cia or fbi was profoundly involved with sues research the chronoliths had become at bottom a defense issue the image lurking at the back of everyones mind seldom spoken seldom explicit was of a chronolith on american soil kuin towering over houston or new york or washington so when i saw your name again well it was on a different kind of list the fbi is looking into witnesses again i mean theyve been sort of keeping an eye on you since the word go not exactly surveillance but if you moved out of state or something like that it would be noted it would go in your file christ sue but all that was harmless busywork until lately your work at campionmiller came up on the radar i write business software i dont see thats way too coy scotty youve done some really sensitive work with marketing heuristics and collective anticipation ive looked at your code youve seen campionmiller source code campionmiller elected to share it with the authorities i began to put this together an interrogatory fbi visit at campionmiller could easily have alarmed management especially if it was core code that had come under scrutiny and it would explain arnie kundersons strange intransigence the dontaskdonttell atmosphere that had surrounded the firing youre telling me you got me fired it was nobodys intention for you to lose your job as it happens though thats kind of handy handy was about the last word i would have used see scotty how this hooks together youre on the spot when the chumphon chronolith arrives which marks you for life all by itself now five years later it turns out youre evolving algorithms that are deeply pertinent to the research were doing here are they trust me it flagged your file i put in a good word for you and that kept them off your tail a little bit but i have to be frank with you some very powerful people are getting way too excited its not just yichang its the economy the riots all that trouble during the last election the level of nervousness is indescribable so when i heard you got fired i had the brilliant idea of getting you placed here as what a prisoner hardly im serious about your work scotty in terms of code husbandry its absolutely fine and very very pertinent maybe it doesnt seem so but a great deal of what ive been looking at lately is modeling the effect of anticipation on mass behavior applying feedback and recursion theory to both physical events and human behavior im a keyboard hack sue ive grown algorithms i dont pretend to understand youre too modest this is key work and it would be much nicer frankly if you were doing it for us i dont understand is it my work youre interested in or the fact that i was at chumphon both i suspect its not coincidental but it is yes in the conventional sense but oh scotty this is too much to talk about over the phone you need to come see me sue youre going to tell me you feel like i put your head in a blender youre going to tell me you cant make a decision like this while youre standing in your pjs drinking bottled beer and feeling sorry for yourself i was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt otherwise she was on the mark so dont decide she said but do come see me come to baltimore my expense we can talk about it then ill make arrangements one of the salient facts about sulamith chopra is that when she says she means to do a thing she does it the recession had hit baltimore harder than it had hit minneapolisst paul the city had done all right in the young years of the century but the downtown core had lost that brief sheen of prosperity had faded into empty storefronts cracked plasma displays gaudy billboards turned pastel by sun and weather sue parked at the back of a small mexican restaurant and escorted me inside the restaurant staff recognized her and greeted her by name our waitress was dressed as if she had stepped out of a thcentury mission but recited the daily specials in a clipped new england accent she smiled at sue the way a tenant farmer might smile at a benevolent landlord i gathered sue was a generous tipper we talked for a while about nothing in particular current events the oglalla crisis the pemberton trial this was sues attempt to reestablish the tone of the relationship between us the familial intimacy she had established with all her students at cornell she had never liked being treated as a figure of authority she deferred to no one and hated being deferred to sue was oldfashioned enough to envision working scientists as equal plaintiffs before the absolute bar of truth since cornell she said the chronolith project had taken up more and more of her time had become in effect her career she had published important theoretical papers during this time but only after they had been vetted by national security and the most important work weve done cant be published at all for fear that wed be putting the weapon into kuins hands so you know more than you can say yes lots but not enough the waitress brought rice and beans sue tucked into her lunch frowning i know about you too scotty you divorced janice or vice versa your daughter lives with her mom now janice remarried you did five years of good but extremely circumscribed work at campionmiller which is a shame because youre one of the brightest people i know not geniusinawheelchair smart but bright you could do better thats what they always used to write on my report cards could do better did you ever get over janice sue asked intimate questions with the brusqueness of a census taker i dont think it even occurred to her that she might be giving offense hence no offense taken mostly i said and the girl kaitlin is it god i remember when janice was pregnant that big belly of hers like she was trying to shoplift a volkswagen kait and i get on all right you still love your daughter yes sue i still love my daughter of course you do how scotty of you she seemed genuinely pleased well how about you you have anything going well she said i live alone theres somebody i see once in a while but its not a relationship sue lowered her eyes and added shes a poet the kind of poet who works retail by daylight i cant bring myself to tell her the fbi already looked into her background shed go ballistic anyway she sees other people too were nonmonogamous polyamorous mostly were barely even together i raised a glass strange days strange days skol by the way i hear youre not speaking to your father i almost choked saw your phone records she explained he makes the calls they dont last more than thirty seconds its kind of a race i said see who hangs up first goddammit sue those are private calls hes sick scotty tell me about it no really you know about the emphysema i guess but hes been seeing an oncologist liver cancer nonresponsive metastatic i put down my fork oh scotty she said im sorry you realize i dont know you of course you know me i knew you a long time ago not intimately i knew a junior academic not a woman who gets me fired and bugs my fucking phone theres no such thing as privacy anymore not really hes what dying probably her face fell when she realized what shed said oh god forgive me scott i speak before i think its like im some kind of borderline autistic or something that at least i did know about her im sure sues defect has been named and genetically mapped some mild inability to read or predict the feelings of others and she loved to talk at least in those days none of my business she said youre right i dont need a surrogate parent im not even sure i need this job scotty im not the one who started logging your calls you can take this job or not but walking away wont give you a normal life you surrendered that in chumphon whether you knew it or not i thought my father is dying i wondered whether i cared back in the car sue remained apologetic is it wrong of me to point out that were both in a bind that both our lives have been shaped by the chronoliths in ways we cant control but im trying to do the best thing scotty i need you here and i think the work would be more satisfying than what you were doing at campionmiller she drove through a yellow light blinking at the reprimand that flashed on her headsup am i wrong to suspect that you want to get involved with what were doing no but i didnt give her the satisfaction of saying so also was she blushing frankly id enjoy your company you must have lots of company i have colleagues not company nobody real besides you know its not a bad offer not in the kind of world were living in she added almost coyly and you get to travel see foreign lands witness miracles stranger than science six in the grand tradition of federal employment i waited three weeks while nothing happened sulamith chopras employers put me up in a motel room and left me there my calls to sue were routed through a functionary named morris torrance who advised me to be patient room service was free but man was not meant to live by room service alone i didnt want to give up my minneapolis apartment until i had signed something permanent and every day i spent in maryland represented a net fiscal loss the motel terminal was almost certainly tapped and i presumed the fbi had found a way to read my portable panel even before its signal reached a satellite nevertheless i did what they probably expected me to do i continued to collect kuin data and looked a little more closely at some of sues publications she had published two important papers in the nature nexus and one on the science site all three were concerned with matters i wasnt competent to judge and which seemed only distantly related to the question of the chronoliths a hypothetical tauon unification energy nonhadronic material structures gravitation and temporal binding forces all i could discern from the text was that sue had been breeding some interesting solutions to fundamental physical problems the papers were focused and to me opaque not unlike sue herself i spent some of that time thinking about sue she had been of course more than a teacher to those of us who came to know her but she had never been very forthcoming about her own life born in madras she had immigrated with her parents at the age of three her childhood had been hermetic her attention divided between schoolwork and her burgeoning intellectual interests she was gay of course but seldom spoke about her partners who never seemed to stick around for long and she hadnt discussed what her coming out might have meant to her parents whom she described as fairly conservative somewhat religious she gave the impression that these were trivial issues unworthy of attention if she harbored old pain it was well concealed there was joy in her life but she expressed it in her work she worked with an enthusiasm that was unmistakably authentic her work or her capacity to do her work was the prize life had handed her and she considered it adequate compensation for whatever else she might lack her pleasures were deep but monkish surely there was more to sue than this but this was what she had been willing to share a hypothetical tauon unification energy what did that mean it meant she had looked closely at the clockwork of the universe it meant she felt at home with fundamental things i was lonely but too unsettled to do anything about it and bored enough that i had begun to scan the cars in the motel parking lot to see if i could spot the one with my fbi surveillance crew inside should there be such a vehicle but when i finally did interact with the fbi there was nothing subtle about the encounter morris torrance called to tell me i had an appointment at the federal building downtown and that i should expect to provide a blood sample and submit to a polygraph examination that it should be necessary to hurdle these obstacles in order to obtain gainful employment as sue chopras code herder was an indication of how seriously the government took her research or at least the congressional investment in it even so morris had underestimated what would be required of me at the federal building i submitted not only to the drawing of blood but to a chest xray and a cranial laser scan i was relieved of urine stool and hair samples i was fingerprinted i signed a release for chromosomal sequencing and i was escorted to the polygraph chamber in the hours since morris torrance mentioned the word polygraph on the telephone i had entertained but a single thought hitch paley the problem was that i knew things about hitch that could put him in prison assuming he wasnt there already hitch had never been my closest friend and i wasnt sure what degree of loyalty i owed him these many years later but i had decided over the course of a sleepless night that i would turn down sues job offer sooner than i would endanger his freedom yes hitch was a criminal and putting him in jail may have been what the letter of the law required but i didnt see the justice in caging a man for selling marijuana to affluent dilettantes who would otherwise have invested their cash in vodka coolers coke or methamphetamines not that hitch was particularly scrupulous about what he sold but i was scrupulous about who i sold the polygraph examiner looked more like a bouncer than a doctor despite his white coat and the unavoidable morris torrance joined us in the bare clinic room to oversee the test morris was plainly a federal employee maybe thirty pounds above his ideal weight and ten years past his prime his hair had receded in the way that makes some middleaged men look tonsured but his handshake was firm his manner relaxed and he didnt seem actively hostile i let the examiner fix the electrodes to my body and i answered the baseline questions without stammering morris then took over the dialogue and began to walk me detailbydetail through my initial experience with the chumphon chronolith pausing occasionally while the polygraph guru added written notations to a scrolling printout the machinery seemed antiquated and it was designed to specifications laid down in thcentury case law i told the story truthfully if carefully and i did not hesitate to mention hitch paleys name if not his occupation even adding a little fillip about the bait shop which was after all a legitimate business at least some of the time when i came to the part about the bangkok prison morris asked were you searched for drugs i was searched more than once maybe for drugs i dont know were any drugs or banned substances found on your person no have you carried banned substances across national or state borders no were you warned of the appearance of the chronolith before it arrived did you have any prior knowledge of the event no it came as a surprise to you yes do you know the name kuin only from the news have you seen the image carved into the contemporary monuments yes is the face familiar do you recognize the face no morris nodded and then conferred privately with the polygraph examiner after a few minutes of this i was cut loose from the machine morris walked me out of the building i said did i pass he just smiled not my department but i wouldnt worry if i was you sue called in the morning and told me to report for work the federal government for reasons probably best known to the senior senator from maryland operated this branch of its chronolith investigation out of a nondescript building in a suburban baltimore industrial park it was a lowslung suite of offices and a makeshift library nothing more the hard end of the research was performed by universities and federal laboratories sue explained what she ran here was more like a think tank collating results and acting as a consultancy and clearing house for congressional grant money essentially it was sues job to assess current knowledge and identify promising new lines of research her immediate superiors were agency people and congressional aides she represented the highest echelon in the chronolith research effort of what could plausibly be called science i wondered how someone as researchdriven as sue chopra could have ended up with a glorified management job i stopped wondering when she opened the door of her office and beckoned me in the large room contained a lacquered secondhand desk and too many filing cabinets to count the space around her work terminal was crowded with newspaper clippings journals hard copies of email missives and the walls were papered with photographs welcome to the sanctum sanctorum sue said brightly photographs of chronoliths they were all here crisp professional portraits side by side with tourist snapshots and cryptic falsecolor satellite photos here was chumphon in more detail than i had ever seen it the letters of its inscription picked out in a raking light here was bangkok and the first graven image of kuin himself probably not a true representation most experts felt the features were too generic almost as if a graphics processor had been asked to come up with an image of a world leader here were pyongyang and ho chi minh city here were taipei and macao and sapporo here was the kanto plain chronolith towering over a brace of blasted granaries here was yichang both before and after the futile nuclear strike the monument itself aloofly unchanged but the yellow river transformed into a gushing severed artery where the dam had been fractured by the blast here photographed from orbit was the brown outflow draining into the china sea throughout was kuins immaculately calm face observing all this as if from a throne of clouds sue watching me inspect the photographs said its almost a complete inversion of the idea of a monument when you think about it monuments are supposed to be messages to the future the dead talking to their heirs look upon my works ye mighty and despair exactly but the chronoliths have it exactly backward not i was here more like im coming im the future whether you like it or not look upon my works and be afraid you have to admire the sheer perversity of it do you i have to tell you scotty sometimes it takes my breath away me too not to mention my wife and daughter it had taken those away too i was disturbed to see my own obsession with the chronoliths recreated on sue chopras wall it was as if i had discovered we shared a common lung but this was of course the reason she had been seduced into the work she did here it gave her the chance to know virtually everything it was possible to know about the chronoliths handson research would have confined her to some far narrower angle counting refraction rings or hunting elusive bosons and she was still able to do the deep math better able with virtually every piece of highly classified research work crossing her desk on a daily basis this is it scotty she said i said show me where i work she took me to an outer office furnished with a desk a terminal the terminal in turn was connected to serried ranks of quantum organics workstations more and more sophisticated crunching power than campionmiller had ever been able to afford morris torrance was perched in one corner on a wooden chair tilted against the wall reading the print edition of golf is he part of the package i asked you can share space for a while morris needs to be close to me physically morris is a good friend morris is my bodyguard among other things morris smiled and dropped his magazine he scratched his head an awkward gesture probably meant to reveal the pistol he wore under his jacket im mostly harmless he said i shook hands with him again more cordially this time since he wasnt nagging me for a urine sample for now sue said you just want to acquaint yourself with the work im doing im not a code herder of your class so take notes end of the week well discuss how to proceed i spent the day doing that i was looking not at sues input or results but at the procedural layers the protocols by which problems were translated into limiting systems and solutions allowed to reproduce and die she had installed the best commercial genetic apps but these were frankly inappropriate or at least absurdly cumbersome for some of what she was attempting sliderule apps we used to call them good to a first approximation but primitive morris finished looking at golf and brought in lunch from the deli down the road along with a copy of fly fisherman to while away the shank of the afternoon sue emerged periodically to give us a happy glance we were her buffer zone a layer of insulation between the world and the mysteries of kuin it dawned on me driving home to another nearlyempty apartment after my first week with the project exactly how suddenly and irrevocably my life had changed maybe it was the tedium of the drive maybe it was the sight of the roadside tent colonies and abandoned rustribbed automobiles maybe it was just the prospect of a lonely weekend denial has a bad reputation but stoicism is supposed to be a virtue and the key act of stoicism is denial the firm refusal to capitulate to an awful truth lately i had been very stoic indeed but i changed lanes to pass a tanker truck and a yellow leica utility van crowded me from behind and then the truck began edging out of his lane and into mine the driver must have had his proximity overrides pulled a highly illegal act not uncommon among gypsy truckers i was in his blind spot and the leica refused to brake and for a good five seconds all i could see was a premonitory vision of myself pancaked behind the steering column then the trucker caught sight of me in his side mirror careened right and let me pass the leica zoomed on by as if nothing had happened and i was left in a cold sweat at the wheel untethered essentially lost hurrying down a gray road between oblivion and oblivion there was good news a week later janice called to tell me kait was getting a new ear its a complete fix scott or at least it ought to be given that she was born with normal hearing and probably retains all the neural pathways its called a mastoidcochlear prosthesis they can do that its a relatively new procedure but the success rate has been almost one hundred percent on patients with kaits kind of history is it dangerous not especially but it is a major surgery shell be hospitalized for at least a week when scheduled for six months from now how are you paying for it whit has good coverage his insurance cooperative is willing to take on at least a percentage of the cost i can get some help through my plan too and whits prepared to cover the remainder out of his own pocket it might mean a second mortgage on the house but it also means kaitlin can have a normal childhood let me help i know youre not exactly wealthy right now scott i have money in the bank and i thank you for that offer but frankly whit would be more comfortable taking care of it himself kait had adjusted well to her hearing loss unless you noticed the way she cocked her head the way she frowned when conversations grew quiet you might not know she was impaired but she was inevitably marked as different condemned to sit at the front of the classroom where too many teachers had addressed her by exaggerating their vowels and acting as if her hearing problem was an intellectual deficiency she was awkward in schoolyard games too easily surprised from behind all this plus her own natural shyness had left her a little netfocused selfabsorbed occasionally surly but that would change the damage would be undone apparently thanks to some recent advances in biomechanical engineering and thanks also to whitman delahunt and if his intervention on behalf of my daughter was a little egobruising well i thought fuck ego kaitlin would be whole again that was what mattered but i want to contribute to this janice this is something ive owed kaitlin for a long time not really scott the ear thing was never your fault i want to help make it better well whit would probably let you chip in if you insist it had been a frugal five years for me i chipped in half the cost of the operation so scotty sue chopra said are you rigged for travel i had already told her about kaitlins operation i said i wanted to be with kait when she was in recovery that was nonnegotiable thats half a year off sue said we wont be gone nearly that long cryptic but she seemed prepared finally to explain what she had lately been hinting about we sat in the spacious but largely empty cafeteria four of us at a table by the only window which overlooked the thruway me sue morris torrance and a young man by the name of raymond mosely ray mosely was a physics postgrad from mit who worked with sue on the hardscience inventories he was twentyfive potbellied badlygroomed and bright as a fresh dime he was also absurdly timid he had avoided me for weeks apparently because i was an unfamiliar face but gradually accepted me once he decided i wasnt a rival for sue chopras affections sue of course was at least a dozen years his senior and her sexual tastes didnt incline to men of any sort much less bashful young physicists who thought a lengthy chat on the subject of mumeson interactions was an invitation to physical intimacy sue had explained all this to him a couple of times ray supposedly had accepted the explanation but he still gave her mooncalf glances across the sticky cafeteria table and deferred to her opinion with a lovers loyalty whats amazing sue began is how much we havent learned about the chronoliths in the years since chumphon all we can do is characterize them a little bit we know for instance that you cant topple a kuin stone even if you dig out its foundations because it maintains a fixed distance from the earths center of gravity and a fixed orientation even if that means hovering in midair we know its spectacularly inert we know it has a certain index of refraction we know from inspection that the objects are more likely molded than sculpted and so on and so forth but none of this is genuine understanding we understand the chronoliths the way a medieval theologian might understand an automobile its heavy the upholstery gets hot in direct sunlight parts of it are sharp parts of it are smooth some of these details might be important most are probably not but you cant sort them out without an encompassing theory which is precisely what we lack the rest of us nodded sagely as we usually did when sue began to expound a thesis but some details are more interesting than others she continued for instance we have some evidence that theres a gradual stepwise increase in local background radiation in the weeks before a chronolith manifests itself not dangerous but definitely measurable the chinese did some work on this before they stopped sharing their research with us and the japanese had a lucky hit too they have a grid of radiation monitors routinely in use around their sapporotechnics fusion reactor tokyo was trying to pin down the source of all this stray radiation days before the chronolith appeared readings peaked with the arrival of the monument then fell very rapidly to normal ambient levels which means ray mosely said as if interpreting for the stupid although we cant stop the appearance of a chronolith we have a limited ability to predict it give people some warning sue said sounds promising i said if you know where to look aye sue admitted theres the rub but lots of places monitor for airborne radiation and washington has arranged with a number of friendly foreign governments to set up detectors around major urban sites from the civildefense point of view it means we can get people out of the way whereas we ray added have an interest in being there sue gave him a sharp look as if he had stepped on her punch line i said a little dangerous wouldnt that be but to be able to record the event get accurate measurements of the arrival burst see the process as it happens that could be priceless a view from a distance morris torrance put in i hope we can minimize any physical danger i said this is happening soon we leave in a couple of days scotty and that may be pushing it a little i know its short notice our outposts are already set up and we have specialists in place evidence suggests a big manifestation in just about fifteen days news of the evacuation should hit the papers this evening so where are we going jerusalem sue said she gave me a day to pack and get my business in order instead i went for a drive seven when i was ten years old i came home one day from school and found my mother scrubbing the kitchen which seemed normal enough until i watched her for a while i had already learned to watch her carefully my mother was not a beautiful woman and i think i knew that even then in the distant way children are aware of such things she had a hard narrow face and she seldom smiled which made her smiles a memorable event if she laughed i would lie in bed at night reliving the moment she was at the time just thirtyfive years old she never wore makeup and some days didnt even bother to brush her hair she could get away with it because her hair was dark and naturally lustrous she hated buying clothes she wore every item in her wardrobe until it was explicitly unwearable sometimes when she took me shopping i was embarrassed by her blue sweater which had a cigarette burn on the side through which i could see the strap of her brassiere or her yellow blouse with a bleach stain like a map of california running down the right shoulder if i mentioned these things to her she would gaze at me wordlessly go back into the house change into something vaguely more presentable but i hated saying anything because it made me feel priggish and effeminate the kind of little boy who cares about clothing and that wasnt it at all i just didnt want people looking sideways at her in the aisle of the food mart she was wearing bluejeans and one of my fathers oversized shirts when i came home that day yellow rubber gloves covered her arms up to the elbows disguising i failed to notice a number of deep and freely bleeding scratches this was her cleaning outfit and she had cleaned with a vengeance the kitchen reeked of lysol and ammonia and the halfdozen other cleansers and disinfectants she kept in the cupboard under the sink she had tied her hair back under a red bandana and her attention was focused on the tiled floor she didnt see me until i rattled my lunch box down on the counter keep out of the kitchen she said tonelessly this is your fault my fault hes your dog isnt he she was talking about chuffy our springer spaniel and i began to be afraid not because of what she said exactly but because of the way she said it it was like the way she said goodnight every night she would come into my room and lean over my bed straighten the cotton sheet and quilted blanket kiss her fingertips and brush them against my forehead and percent of the time that was exactly as comforting as it sounds but some nights some nights she might have been drinking a little and then she would loom over me with the feral stink of sweat and alcohol radiating from her like heat from a coal stove and although she said the same words the same goodnight scotty sleep well it sounded like an impersonation and her fingers against my skin were cold and abrasive those nights i pulled the covers over my head and counted the seconds oneonethousand twoonethousand until her footsteps faded down the hall she sounded that way now her eyes were too round and her mouth was clamped into a narrow line and i suspected that if i got close to her i would smell the same repulsive salty stench like a beach at low tide she went on cleaning and i crept into the living room and turned on the tv and stared at a syndicated rerun of seinfeld until i got to thinking about the remark shed made about chuffy my mother had never liked chuffy she tolerated him but he was my fathers dog and mine not hers if chuffy had peed on the kitchen floor say might that not explain her reaction and where was chuffy anyway usually this time of day he was up on the sofa wanting his ears scratched i called his name that animal is filthy my mother said from the kitchen leave that animal alone i found chuffy upstairs locked in the halfbath that adjoined my parents bedroom his hindquarters and his legs had been scrubbed raw probably with one of the steel brillo pads we kept for greasy cookware his skin where the fur had come away was bleeding in a dozen different places and when i tried to comfort him he sank his teeth into my forearm the years hadnt been kind to the maryland suburb where my father lived the once semirural neighborhood had become a nest of strip malls erotica retailers and highrise worker housing the gated community still existed but its gatehouse was untended and covered with arabic graffiti the house on provender lane the house where i had grown up was almost unrecognizable behind lumpy hedges of snow one of the eavestroughs had worked loose from the roof and the shingles behind it sagged alarmingly it was not the house as i remembered it but it seemed very much the kind of house my father would or maybe ought to inhabit unkempt inhospitable i parked turned off the engine sat in the car of course it was stupid to have come here it was one of those reckless impulses all drama and no content i had decided i ought to see my father before i left the country implicitly before he died but what did that mean exactly what did i have to say to him and what could he possibly say to me i was reaching for the ignition key when he came out onto the creaking wooden porch to pick up his evening paper the porch light in a blue dusk turned his skin jaundiced yellow he looked at the car bent to pick up the paper then looked again finally he walked out to the curb wearing his house slippers and a white strap undershirt the unaccustomed exercise left him panting i rolled down the window he said i thought it was you the sound of his voice set loose a regiment of unpleasant memories i said nothing at all so come on in he said cold out here i locked the car behind me and set the security protocols down the street three blankfaced asiatic youths watched me follow my dying father to the door chuffy recovered from his injuries though he never went near my mother again it was my mother whose injuries were permanent and disabling i was told at some point during her decline that she was the victim of a neurological disease called adultonset schizophrenia that it was a medical condition a failure somewhere in the mysterious but natural processes of the brain i didnt believe it because i knew by direct experience that the problem was both simpler and more frightening a good mother and a bad mother had begun to cohabit the same body and because i loved the good mother it became possible even necessary to hate the bad one alas they bled into each other the good mother might kiss me goodbye in the morning but when i came home late reluctantly from school the crazed usurper would have taken control i had no close friends beyond the age of ten because when you have friends you have to let them into your house and the last time i had tried that when i brought home a timid redhaired boy named richard who had befriended me in geography class she lectured him for twenty minutes on the danger posed by video monitors to his future fertility the language she actually used was considerably more graphic the next day richard was aloof and unresponsive as if i done something unspeakable it wasnt my fault i wanted to tell him and it wasnt even my mothers we were the victims of a haunting because she disbelieved in her own illness she saw this as my weakness not hers and i cannot count the number of times during my teenage years when she demanded that i stop looking at her like that that is with obvious wincing dread one of the ironies of paranoid schizophrenia is that it fulfills its own darkest expectations with almost mathematical rigor she thought we were conspiring to drive her mad none of this brought my father and me closer together the opposite he resisted the diagnosis almost as fiercely as my mother did but his form of denial was more direct i think he always felt that he had married beneath him that he had done a favor to my mothers family in nashua new hampshire by taking this moody and reclusive daughter off their hands maybe he had imagined that marriage would improve her it hadnt she had disappointed him and perhaps viceversa but he continued to hold her to a high standard he blamed her for every one of her irrational acts just as if she were capable of moral and ethical judgment which she was but only sporadically thus the good mother suffered for the sins of the bad mother the bad mother might be bitter and obscene but the good mother could be cowed and bullied the good mother could be reduced to a state of craven apology and he performed this alchemy on her on a regular basis he shouted at her occasionally struck her regularly humiliated her while i hid in my room trying to imagine a world in which the good mother and i could abandon both him and the invading pseudomom we would live contentedly i told myself in the kind of loving home she had once at least attempted to create while my father continued battling his irrational faux wife in some distant isolated place a jail cell say a madhouse later after i had turned sixteen and learned to drive but before she was committed to the residential home in connecticut where she spent her final years my father took us all on a trip to new york city i think he believed and he must have been desperate to have grasped at such a fragile straw that a vacation would be good for her would clear her head as he was fond of saying so we packed up the car had the oil changed and the gas tank filled and set out like dour pilgrims my mother insisted on having the back seat to herself i sat up front the navigator occasionally turning back to beg her to stop picking at the skin of her lip which had begun to bleed i have only two vivid memories of the weekend in new york city we visited the statue of liberty on saturday and in my minds eye i can practically count the burnished stairs we climbed on the way to the top i remember the simultaneous sense of smallness and largeness when we arrived there the smell of perspiration and hot copper on the windless july air my mother shrank away from the view of manhattan keening quietly to herself while i watched with rapt attention the seagulls diving toward the sea i brought home from that journey a hollow brass model of liberty as tall as my hand and i remember sunday morning the same weekend when my mother wandered out of the hotel room while my father was showering and i was down the hallway pumping quarters into a softdrink machine when i came back and found the room empty i panicked but i couldnt bring myself to interrupt my fathers bath probably because he would have blamed me or i imagined he would have for misplacing her instead i walked the redcarpeted hallway up and down past roomservice trays and carts of snowy linen and then rode the elevator to the lobby i saw my mothers dark hair disappearing through the rotunda out the revolving doors i did not call her name because that would alarm strangers and provoke a public embarrassment but i ran after her almost tripping over the newspaper rack outside the gift shop but by the time i pushed through the glass door onto the sidewalk she was invisible the redsuited doorman was blowing his whistle i didnt know why and then i saw my mother lying sprawled across the curb and moaning to herself while the driver of the floral delivery van that had just broken her legs jumped out of his truck and stood trembling above her his eyes wide as two full moons and all i felt was brutally icily cold my mother was committed to the longterm care facility after the new york trip after her legs had mended and after the doctors at central mercy had been forced to pump her full of haldol until the casts came off the living room where i sat with my father had changed remarkably little since that time it was not that he had made an effort to keep the house as a shrine to her he simply hadnt changed anything it hadnt occurred to him i was getting all kinds of phone calls about you he said thought for a while youd robbed a bank the curtains were closed it was the kind of house where not much light gets inside no matter what nor did the ancient floor lamp do much to dispel the gloom he sat in his tired green easy chair breathing shallowly waiting for me to speak it was about a job i said they were doing a background check some job if you got the fbi making house calls the undershirt exposed his skinny frame he had been a big man once big and easily angered not the kind of man you trifled with now his arms were skeletal the flesh sagging his barrel chest had shrunk back to the ribs and his belt was at least five notches in the loose end flapping against his high hip joints i told him im going out of the country for a while how long tell you the truth i dont know did the fbi tell you i was sick i heard maybe im not as sick as they think i dont feel good but he shrugged these doctors know fuckall but they charge like moses you want a cup of coffee i can get it i guess the coffee makers still where it was you think im too fragile to make coffee i didnt say that i can still make coffee for christs sake dont let me stop you he went to the kitchen i got up to follow but stopped at the doorway when i saw him sneaking a big dollop of jack daniels into his own cup his hands shook i waited in the living room looking at the bookshelves most of the books had been my mothers her tastes had run to nora roberts the bridges of madison county and endless volumes of tim lahaye my father contributed the ancient tom clancy novels and stranger than science i had owned a lot of books when i lived here i was a straighta student probably because i dreaded leaving school and going home but i had kept my mystery novels segregated on a shelf in my room primly unwilling to let conan doyle or james lee burke mingle with the likes of vc andrews and catherine coulter my father came back with two mugs of coffee he handed me the one with coriolis shipping the name of his last employer still faintly legible on the side he had managed the coriolis distribution network for twentythree years and still collected a pension check every month the coffee was both bitter and weak i dont have any regular milk or cream he said i know you like it white i used powdered milk its fine i said he settled back into his chair there was a remote control on the coffee table in front of him presumably for his video panel he looked at it wistfully but didnt reach for it he said that must be some job you applied for because those fbi people asked some peculiar questions like what well there was i guess the usual where you went to school and what kind of grades you got and where did you work and all that but they wanted lots of details did you go out for sports what did you do in your spare time did you talk about politics or history much did you have lots of friends or did you keep to yourself who was your family doctor did you have any unusual childhood diseases did you ever see a shrink a lot about elaine too they knew shed been sick in that area i mainly told them to fuck off but they knew a lot already obviously they asked about mom didnt i just say that what kind of questions her you know symptoms when did they come on and how did she behave how you took it things that arent anybodys business but family frankly christ scotty they wanted into everything they wanted to look at your old stuff that was in the garage they took samples of the tap water if you can believe that youre telling me they came to the house uhhuh did they take anything besides tap water not as i noticed but there was a bunch of em and i couldnt keep an eye on everybody if you want to check your old stuff the box is still there back of the buick curious and unsettled i excused myself long enough to step into the unheated garage the box he was talking about contained unsorted detritus from my highschool years yearbooks a couple of academic awards old novels and dvds a few toys and keepsakes including i noticed the brass statue of liberty i had brought home from new york the green felt base was frayed the hollow brass body tarnished i picked it up and tucked it into my jacket pocket if there was anything missing from this assortment i couldnt place it but the idea of anonymous fbi agents rummaging through boxes in the garage was chilling beneath this at the bottom of the box was a layer of my schoolboy drawings art was never my best subject but my mother had liked these well enough to preserve them flaking waterbased paints on stiff brown paper the consistency of fallen leaves snow scenes mostly bent pines crude snowbound cabins lonely things in a large landscape back in the house my father was nodding in his chair the coffee cup teetered on the padded arm i moved it onto the table he stirred when the telephone rang an old handsetstyle telephone with a digital adapter where the cord joined the wall he picked it up blinked said yeah a couple of times then offered the receiver its for you for me you see anybody else here the call was sue chopra her voice thin over the old lowbandwidth line you had us worried scotty she said its mutual youre wondering how we found you you should be glad we did you caused us a lot of anxiety running away like that sue i didnt run away im spending the afternoon with my father i understand its just that we could have used some warning up front before you left town morris had you followed morris can fuck himself are you telling me i have to ask permission to leave town its not a written rule but it would have been nice scotty i know how angry you must feel i went through the same thing myself i cant justify it to you but times change life is more dangerous than it used to be when are you coming back tonight good i think we need to talk i told her i thought so too i sat with my father a few more minutes then told him i had to leave the faint daylight beyond the window had faded altogether the house was drafty and smelled of dust and dry heat he stirred in his chair and said you came a long way just to drink coffee and mumble look i know why youre here ill tell you im not especially afraid of dying or even of talking about it you wake up you read the mail you say to yourself well it wont be today but thats not the same as not knowing i understand no you dont but im glad you came it was an astonishing thing for him to say i couldnt muster a response he stood up his pants rode low on his bony hips i didnt always treat your mother the way i should have but i was there scotty remember that even when she was at the hospital even when she was raving i didnt take you mere unless i knew she was having a good day some of the things she said would peel your skin and then you were off at college she had died of complications of pneumonia the year before i graduated you could have called me when she got sick why so you could carry away the memory of your own mother cursing you from her deathbed whats the point i loved her too it was easy for you maybe i loved her and maybe i didnt i dont remember anymore but i was with her scotty all the time i wasnt necessarily nice to her but i was with her i went to the door he followed a few paces then stopped breathless remember that about me he said eight when we came into ben gurion the airport was chaotic crowded with fleeing tourists the inbound el al flight delayed for four hours by weather after a threeday diplomatic delay sue refused to talk about had been nearly empty it would be filled to capacity on the way out however the evacuation of jerusalem continued i left the aircraft in a core group with sue chopra ray mosley and morris torrance surrounded by a cordon of fbi agents with enhancedvision eyetacts and concealed weapons escorted in turn by five israeli defense force conscripts in jeans and white tshirts uzis slung over their shoulders who met us at the foot of the ramp we were conducted quickly through israeli customs and out of ben gurion to what looked like a sheruti a private taxi van commandeered for the emergency sue scooted into the seat beside me still dazed by travel morris and ray climbed in behind us and the power plant hummed softly as the van pulled away a monotonous rain slicked highway one the long line of cars crawling toward tel aviv glistened dully under a rack of clouds but the jerusalembound lanes were utterly empty ahead of us vast publicservice roadside screens announced the evacuation behind us they marked the evacuation routes makes you a little nervous sue said going someplace everybody else is leaving the ddf man he looked like a teenager in the seat behind us snickered morris said theres a lot of skepticism about this a lot of resentment too the likkud could lose the next election but only if nothing happens sue said is there a chance of that slim to none the idf man snorted again a gust of rain rattled down on the sheruti january and february are the rainy season in israel i turned my head to the window and watched a grove of olive trees bend to the wind i was still thinking about what sue had told me on the plane she had been inaccessible for days after i drove back from my fathers house smoothing over whatever diplomatic difficulty it was that had kept us in baltimore until very nearly the last minute i spent the week revising code and wasted a couple of evenings at a local bar with morris and ray they were more pleasant company than i would have guessed i was angry with morris for tracking me down to my fathers house but morris torrance was one of those men who make an art of affability an art or maybe a tool he rebuffed anger like superman bouncing bullets off his chest he wasnt dogmatic about the chronoliths nursed no particular convictions about the significance of kuin but his interest obviously ran deep what this meant was that we could bullshit with him float ideas some wild without fear of tripping over a religious or political fixation was this genuine he did after all represent the fbi likely as not everything we said to him found its way into a file folder but morriss genius was that he made it seem not to matter even ray mosely opened up in morriss company i had pegged ray as one of those bright but sociallychallenged types his sexual radar locked hopelessly and inappropriately on sue there was some truth in this but when he relaxed he revealed a passion for american league baseball that gave us some common ground ray liked the expansion team from his native tucson and managed to piss off a guy at the neighboring table with some remarks about the orioles from which he did not back down when challenged ray was not a coward he was lonely but much of this was sheer intellectual loneliness his conversation tended to trail off when he realized he had progressed to a level we couldnt follow he wasnt condescending about it at least not very often only visibly sad that he couldnt share his thoughts it was this loneliness i think that sue satisfied for him no matter that she reserved her physical affection for brief contacts carefully segregated from her work i think in some sense when ray talked physics with her he was making love of sue we saw very little this is what it was like at cornell i told morris and ray for her students i mean she brought us together but we did some of our best talking after class without her must have been kind of like a dress rehearsal morris mused for what for this the chronoliths oh she couldnt have known anything about that of course but dont you once in a while get that feeling that your life has been one big rehearsal for some critical event maybe sometimes like she had the wrong cast back there at cornell morris said and the script still needed work but you must have been good scott he smiled you made the final cut so whats the event i asked this thing in jerusalem this thing in jerusalem or whatever comes after sue and i didnt have a chance to talk privately until we were well over the atlantic when she beckoned me to the back of the deserted economy section and said im sorry about keeping you in the dark scotty and im sorry about the thing with your dad i thought we could make this a day job for you not house arrest i offered right house arrest because i guess thats what it is in a sense but not just for you im in the same situation they want to keep us together and under observation sue had a head cold and was bulling through it with her usual determination she sat with her hands in her lap twisting a handkerchief in a beam of sunlight as apparently contrite and as fundamentally immovable as mahatma gandhi up front an el al steward was delivering scrambled eggs and toast in plastic trays i said why me sue thats the question no one wants to answer you could have hired a better code herder i was at chumphon but that doesnt explain anything dont underestimate your talent she said but i know what youre asking the fbi surveillance the agents at your fathers house scotty i made the mistake a few years ago of attempting to publish a paper about a phenomenon i called tau turbulence some influential people read it an answer that veered into abstract theory promised to be no answer at all i waited frowning while she blew her nose loudly excuse me she said the paper was about causality i suppose you could say with regard to questions of temporal symmetry and the chronoliths mostly math and most of that dealing with some contentious aspects of quantum behavior but i also speculated about how the chronoliths might reconfigure our conventional understanding of macroscopic cause and effect basically i said that in a localized tau event the creation of a chronolith hypothetically effect naturally precedes cause but it also creates a kind of fractal space in which the most significant connectors between events become not deterministic but correlative i dont know what that means think of a chronolith as a local event in spacetime theres an interface a border between the conventional flow of time and the negativetau anomaly its not just the future talking to the present there are ripples eddies currents the future transforms the past which in turn transforms the future you follow more or less so what you get is a kind of turbulence marked not so much by cause and effect or even paradox as by a froth of correlation and coincidence you cant look for the cause of the bangkok manifestation because it doesnt exist yet but you can look for clues in the turbulence in the unexpected correlatives like what when i wrote the paper i didnt offer examples but somebody took me seriously enough to work out the implications the fbi went back and looked at all the people who had been interviewed after chumphon which was the smallest and most complete statistical sample at hand then they compiled a database with the names and histories of anyone who had ever expressed a public opinion about the chronoliths at least in the early days everyone who did science at the chumphon site including the guys who ran the tractors and installed the johns everybody they interrogated after the touchdown then they looked for connections and found some i presume some strange ones but one of the strangest was you and i what because of cornell partly but put it all together scotty heres a woman whos been talking about tau anomalies and exotic matter since well before chumphon who has since become a highlyregarded expert on the chronoliths and heres an exstudent of hers an old friend who just happened to be on the beach at chumphon and who was arrested a mile or so from the first recorded chronolith a few hours after it appeared sue i said it doesnt mean anything you know that it has no causal significance youre right but thats not the point the point is it marks us trying to figure out the genesis of a chronolith is like trying to unravel a sweater before its been knitted you cant at best you can find certain threads that are the appropriate length or similarly colored and make certain guesses about how they might be looped together thats why the fbi investigated my father theyre looking at absolutely everything because we dont know what might be significant thats the logic of paranoia well yeah thats exactly what were dealing with the logic of paranoia thats why were both under surveillance were not suspected of anything criminal certainly not in the conventional sense but theyre worried about what we might become maybe were the bad guys is that what you mean she peered out the airliners window at the intermittent cumulus cloud at the ocean down below us like a burnished blue mirror remember scotty whatever kuin is he probably didnt originate this technology conquerors and kings tend not to be physics majors they use what they can take kuin could be anyone anywhere but in all likelihood hell steal this technology and whos to say he wont steal it from us or maybe were the good guys maybe were the ones who solve the puzzle thats possible too a different kind of connection were not just prisoners or wed be in jail now theyre watching us but theyre also protecting us i checked the aisle to see if anyone was listening but morris was up front chatting with a flight attendant and ray had lost himself in a book i can go along with this up to a point i said im reasonably well paid when a lot of people arent getting paid at all and im seeing things i never thought id see feeding my own obsession with the chronoliths i did not add but only up to a point i cant promise to stick with it indefinitely i meant to say to become an acolyte like ray mosely not when the world was going to hell and i had a daughter to protect sue interrupted with a pensive smile dont worry scotty nobodys promising anything not anymore because nobodys sure of anything certainty is one of the luxuries well have to learn to live without i had learned to do without certainty a long time ago one of the rules of living with a schizophrenic parent is that weirdness is tolerable you can endure it at least as i had told sue up to a point past that point madness spills all over everything it gets inside you and makes itself at home until theres no one you can trust not even yourself the first highway one checkpoint was the hardest to get through this was where the idf turned away wouldbe pilgrims attracted perversely by the evacuation jerusalem syndrome had been named as a psychiatric condition decades ago visitors are occasionally overwhelmed by the citys cultural and mythological significance they identify too deeply dress in bedsheets and sandals proclaim sermons from the mount of olives attempt to sacrifice animals on the temple mount the phenomenon has kept the kfar shaul psychiatric hospital in business since well before the turn of the century the wave of global uncertainty generated by the chronoliths had already triggered a new wave of pilgrimages and the evacuation had turned it up to a fever pitch jerusalem was being evacuated for the safety of its inhabitants but when had that ever mattered to a fanatic we wormed our way through a line of vehicles some abandoned at the checkpoint when the drivers refused to turn away there was a steady transit of police cars ambulances tow trucks we cleared this obstacle at dusk and arrived at a major hotel on mt scopus just as the last light was fading from the sky observation posts had been established all over the city not just ours but military stations a un post delegations from a couple of israeli universities and a site for the international press on the haas promenade mt scopus har hatsofim in hebrew which also happens to mean looking over was something of a choice spot however this was where the romans had camped in ad shortly before they moved to crush the jewish rebellion the crusaders had been here too for similar reasons the view of the old city was spectacular but dismaying the evacuation especially of the palestinian zones hadnt gone easily the fires were still burning i followed sue through the vacant hotel lobby to a suite of adjoining rooms on the top floor this was the heart of the operation the curtains had been taken down and a crew of technicians had set up photographic and monitoring devices and more ominously a bank of powerful heaters most of these people were part of sues research project but only a few of them had met her personally a number of them hurried to shake her hand sue was gracious about it but obviously tired morris showed us our private rooms then suggested we meet in the lobby restaurant once wed had a chance to shower and change sue wondered aloud how the restaurant had managed to stay open for business during the evacuation the hotels outside the primary exclusion zone morris said theres a skeleton staff to look after us all volunteers and a heated bunker for them in back of the kitchen i took a few minutes in my room just to look at the city folded like a stony blanket across the judean hills the nearby streets were empty except for security patrols and occasional ambulances out of hadassah mt sinai a few streets away stoplights twitched in the wind like palsied angels the idf man in the car had said something interesting as we passed the checkpoint in the old days he said the fanatics who came to jerusalem usually imagined they were jesus come again or john the baptist or the first and only true original messiah lately he said they tended to claim to be kuin a city that had seen far too much history was about to see some more i found sue morris and ray waiting for me in the hotels immense atrium morris gestured at the five stories of hanging plants and said check it out scotty its the garden of babylon babylons considerably east of here sue said but yeah in the lobby restaurant we seated ourselves at a table across the room from the only other patrons a group of idf men and women crowded into a red vinyl booth our waitress the only waitress was an older woman with an american accent she claimed not to be troubled by the evacuation even though it meant she had to sleep at the hotel i dont like the idea of driving around these empty streets anyway much as i used to complain about the traffic the entree for tonight was chicken almondine she said and thats about it unless youre allergic or anything in which case we can ask the chef to make an adjustment chicken all around and morris ordered us a bottle of white wine i asked about the agenda for tomorrow morris said apart from the scientific work we have the israeli defense minister visiting in the afternoon plus photographers and video people he added theres no substance to it we wouldnt be here if the israeli government didnt already have all the information we can give them its a dogandpony show for the news pools but ray and sue get to do some interpretation for the laypeople ray asked are we giving him minkowski ice or feedback morris and i looked blank sue said dont leave people out of the conversation ray its bad manners morris scotty you must have picked up some of this from the congressional briefs slow reading morris said we spend a lot of time translating math into english hunting metaphors ray said its important to make people understand at least as much as we understand which is not very much minkowski ice ray persisted or positive feedback feedback i think morris said i still feel left out sue frowned and collected her thoughts morris scotty do you savvy feedback half of what i did with sues code involved recursion and selfamplification but she was talking far more generally i said its what happens when you stand up in the high school auditorium to give the valedictory address and the pa starts to squeal like a pig in a slaughterhouse she grinned thats a good example describe the process scotty you have an amplifier between the mike and the speakers worst case they talk to each other whatever goes into the microphone comes out of the speakers louder if theres any noise in the system it makes a loop exactly any little sound the microphone picks up the speaker plays it louder and the microphone hears that and multiplies it again and so on until the system starts ringing like a bell or squealing like a pig and this is relevant to the chronoliths morris said because because time itself is a kind of amplifier you know the old saw about how a butterfly flapping in china can eventually brew up a storm over ohio its a phenomenon called sensitive dependence a large event is often a small event amplified through time like all those movies where a guy travels into the past and ends up changing his own present either way sue said what you have is an example of amplification but when kuin sends us a monument commemorating a victory twenty years from now thats like pointing the microphone at the speaker its a feedback loop a deliberate feedback loop it amplifies itself we think that may be why the chronoliths are expanding their territory so quickly by marking his victories kuin creates the expectation that hell be victorious which makes the victory that much more likely even inevitable and the next and so on this was not new territory for me i had inferred this much from sues work and from speculation in the popular press i said couple of questions okay i guess the first is how does this look to kuin how does it play out that first time he sends us the chumphon stone wouldnt he be changing his own past are there two kuins now or what your guess is as good as mine youre asking me whether we understand this better on the theoretical level well yes and no wed like to avoid a manyworlds model if possible why if thats the easiest answer because we have reason to believe its not true and if it is true it limits what we can do about the problem however the alternative the alternative ray supplied is that kuin is committing a kind of suicide every time he does this the waitress brought us our meals on a cart covered with linen then rolled the emptied cart back toward the kitchen across the room the idf people had finished dinner and were working on dessert i wondered if this was their first time in a fourstar hotel restaurant they were eating that way with great attention and a few remarks about what this would have cost them if theyd had to pay for it changing what hes been sue said between mouthfuls erasing it replacing it but thats not exactly suicide is it imagine a hypothetical kuin some backcountry warlord who somehow gets hold of this technology he pulls the switch and suddenly hes not just kuin hes the kuin the one everyone was waiting for hes the fucking messiah for all practical purposes and for him it was never any different at least some part of his personal history is gone but its a painless loss hes glorified he has lots of troops now lots of credibility a bright future either that or the original kuins place has been taken by some more ambitious individual who grew up wanting to be kuin at worst its a kind of death but its also a potential ticket to glory and you cant mourn what you never had can you i wondered about that it still seems like a big risk once youve done it why push the button a second time who knows ideology delusions of grandeur blind ambition a selfdestructive impulse or just because he has to as a last resort in the face of military reversals maybe its a different reason every time anyway you look at it hes right in the middle of the feedback loop hes the signal that generates the noise so a small noise becomes a loud noise morris said a fart becomes a thunderclap sue nodded eagerly but the amplification factor isnt just time its human expectation and human interaction the rocks dont care about kuin the trees dont give a shit its us we act on what we anticipate and it gets easier and easier to anticipate the allconquering kuin kuin the godking the temptation is to give in to collaborate to idealize the conqueror to be part of the process so you dont get ground under youre saying were creating kuin not us specifically but people yeah people in general morris said thats how it was with my wife before we broke up she hated the idea of disappointment so much it was always on her mind it didnt matter what i did how much i reassured her what i earned whether i went to church every week i was on permanent probation youll leave me one day she used to say but if you say something like that often enough it has a way of coming true morris thought about what hed said pushed away his glass of wine reddened expectation sue said yes feedback exactly suddenly kuin embodies everything we fear or secretly want slouching toward jerusalem i said to be born it was an idea that seemed to cast a chill across the room even the rowdy idf teenagers were quieter now well i said thats not especially reassuring but i can follow the logic whats minkowski ice a metaphor of a different color but thats enough of this talk for tonight wait till tomorrow scotty rays explaining it to the defense minister she smiled forlornly as ray puffed up we broke up after coffee and i went to my room alone i thought about calling janice and kaitlin but the desk manager interrupted my dialout to tell me the bandwidth was at capacity and i would have to wait at least an hour so i took a beer from the courtesy cooler and put my feet up on the windowsill and watched a car race down the dark streets of the exclusion zone the floodlights on the dome of the rock made that structure look as venerable and solid as history itself but in less than fortyeight hours there would be a taller and more dramatic monument a scant few miles away i woke at seven in the morning restless but not hungry i showered and dressed and wondered how far the security people would let me go if i tried to do a little sightseeing a walk around the hotel say i decided to find out i was stopped at the elevator by one of two natty fbi men who looked at me blankly whereabouts you headed chief breakfast i said well need to see your badge first badge nobody gets on or off this floor without a badge i dont need no stinkin badge but i did apparently whos handing out badges you need to talk to the people who brought you chief which didnt take long because morris torrance came hurtling up behind me bade me a cheerful good morning and pinned a plastic id tag to the lapel of my shirt ill come down with you he said the two men parted like the elevator doors they were guarding they nodded to morris and the less aggressive of the two told me to have a nice day will do i said chief its just a precaution morris said as we rode down like harassing my father like reading my medical records he shrugged didnt sue explain any of this to you a little youre not just her bodyguard are you but that too youre the warden shes not in prison she can go anywhere she wants as long as you know about it as long as shes watched its a kind of deal we made morris said so where do you want to go scotty breakfast i need some air you want to do the tourist thing you realize what a bad idea that is call me curious well i can get us an idf car with the right tags i suppose even get us into the exclusion zone if thats really what you want i didnt answer otherwise he said youre pretty much stuck in the hotel the situation being what it is do you enjoy this kind of work let me tell you about that morris said he borrowed a blue unmarked automobile with allpass stickers pasted to the windshield and an elaborate gps system sprawling onto the passenger side of the dash he drove down lehi street while i stared yet again out the window it was another rainy day date palms drooping along the boulevards by daylight the streets were far from empty there were civildefense wardens at the major intersections cops and idf patrols everywhere and only the exclusion zone around the anticipated touchdown site had been wholly evacuated morris drove into the new city and turned onto king david street the heart of the exclusion zone the evacuation of a major urban area is more than just peoplemoving though its that certainly on an almost unmanageably large scale some of it is engineering most of the damage a chronolith causes is a result of the initial cold shock the socalled thermal pulse close enough to the arrival any container with liquid water in it will burst property owners in jerusalem had been encouraged to drain their pipes before leaving and the municipal authorities were trying to preserve the waterworks by depressurizing the core zone though that would make firefighting difficult and inevitably there would be fires when volatile liquids and gases escaped containers ruptured or weakened by the cold the gas mains had already been shut off theoretically every toilet tank should have been emptied every gas tank drained every propane bottle removed in reality without an exhaustive doortodoor search no such outcome could be guaranteed and close to the arrival point the thermal pulse would turn even a bottle of milk into a potentially lethal explosive device i didnt speak as we drove past the shuttered businesses windows striped with duct tape the darkened skyscrapers the king david hotel as lifeless as a corpse an empty city is an unnatural thing morris said unholy if you know what i mean he slowed for a checkpoint waved at the soldiers as they spotted his stickers you know scotty i really dont take any pleasure in dogging you and sue am i supposed to be reassured by that im just making conversation the thing is though you have to admit it makes sense theres a logic to it is there youve had the lecture the thing about coincidence what sue calls tau turbulence im not sure how much of that to believe that morris said but also how it looks to congress and the administration two true facts about the chronoliths scotty first nobody knows how to make one second that knowledge is being brewed up somewhere even as we speak so we give sue and people like sue the means to figure out how to build such a thing and maybe thats precisely the wrong thing to do the knowledge is set loose maybe it gets into the wrong hands and maybe none of this would have happened if we hadnt opened the whole pandoras box in the first place thats circular logic does that make it wrong in the situation were in are you going to rule out a possibility because it doesnt make a nice tight syllogism i shrugged he said im not going to apologize for the way we looked into your past its one of those things you do in a national emergency like drafting people or holding food drives i didnt know id been drafted try thinking of it that way because i went to school with sue chopra because i happened to be on the beach at chumphon more like because were all tied together by some rope we cant quite see thats poetic morris drove silently for a time the sun came through gaps in the cloud pillars of light roaming the judean hills scotty im a reasonable person i like to think so anyhow i still go to church every sunday working for the fbi doesnt make a person a monster you know what the modern fbi is it isnt cops and robbers and trench coats and all that shit i did twenty years of desk work at quantico im qualified on the firing range and all but ive never discharged a weapon in a police situation were not so different you and i you dont know what i am morris okay youre right im assuming but for the sake of the argument lets say were both normal people personally i dont believe in anything more supernatural than what you read about in the bible and i only believe that one day out of seven people call me levelheaded boring even do i strike you as boring i let that one go he said but i have dreams scotty the first time i saw the chumphon thing was on a tv set in dc but the amazing thing is i recognized it because id seen it before seen it in dreams nothing specific nothing like prophecy nothing i could prove to anybody but i knew as soon as i saw it that this was something that would be part of my life he stared straight ahead itll be good if these clouds pass by tomorrow night he said good for observation morris i said is any of this the truth i wouldnt shit you why not why not well maybe because i recognized you too scotty from my dreams i mean first time i saw you you and sue both nine looking back at these pages it seems to me ive said too much about myself and not enough about sue chopra but i can only tell my own story as i experienced it sue i thought was preoccupied with her work and blind to the forces that had infantilized her made her a ward of the state her acceptance of her condition bothered me probably because i was chafing under the same restraints and reaping the same rewards i had access to the best and newest processor platforms the sleekest code incubators but i was at the same time an object of scrutiny paid to donate dna and urine samples to the infant science of tau turbulence i had promised myself that i would endure this until i had financed at least the lions share of kaitlins surgery then all bets were off if the march of the chronoliths continued i wanted to be home and near kaitlin as the crisis worsened as for kait the most i could be for kait right now was emotional backup a refuge if things went bad with whit a secondstring parent but i had a feeling maybe as powerful and specific as morriss dream that sooner or later she would need me we were in jerusalem because the chronolith had announced itself with murmurs of ambient radioactivity like the premonitory rumbling of a volcano was there also i wondered a premonitory tau turbulence whatever that might mean a trace of strangeness in the air a fractal cascade of coincidence and if so was it perceptible meaningful we were less than fifteen hours from the estimated time of touchdown when i woke thursday morning today the entire floor was in lockdown nobody allowed in or out except for technicians transiting between the indoor monitors and the antenna array on the roof there had been threats apparently from unnamed radical cadres meals were delivered from the hotel kitchen on a strict schedule the city itself was still and calm under a dusty turquoise sky the israeli minister of defense arrived for his photoop that afternoon two presspool photographers three junior military advisors and a couple of cabinet ministers followed him into the tech suite the press guys wore cameras clamped to their shoulders on gymbal mounts the minister of defense a bald man in khaki listened to sues description of the reconnaissance equipment and paid dutiful attention to ray mosleys stumbling account of minkowski ice a clumsy metaphor in my opinion minkowski was a twentiethcentury physicist who asserted that the universe could be understood as a fourdimensional cube any event can be described as a point in fourspace the sum of these points is the universe past present and future try to imagine that minkowski cube ray said as a block of liquid water freezing as contrary as this seems from the bottom up the progression of the freeze represents at least our human experience of the march of time what is frozen is past immutable changeless what is liquid is future indeterminate uncertain we live on the crystallizing boundary to travel into the past you would have to uncreate or i suppose thaw an entire universe clearly absurd what power could rewind the planets wake dead stars dissolve babies into the womb but that wasnt what kuin had done though what he had done was marvelous enough a chronolith ray said was like a hot needle driven into minkowski ice the effects were striking but strictly local in chumphon in thailand in asia perhaps ultimately in all the world the consequences were strange and paradoxical but the moon didnt care the comets were unmoved in their orbits the stars looked blindly on the minkowski ice crystallizes once more around the cooling needle and time flows as before subtly wounded perhaps but substantially unchanged the defense minister accepted this with the obvious private skepticism of a moslem cleric touring the vatican he asked a few questions he admired the blastproof glass that had replaced the hotel windows and commented approvingly on the dedication of the men and women operating the machinery he hoped we would all learn something useful in the next several hours if god forbid the predicted tragedy actually took place then he was escorted upstairs for a look at the antenna arrays the photographers trailing after gulping coffee from paper cups all this of course would be edited for public consumption a display of governmental calm in the face of crisis invisibly inevitably the minkowski ice was melting the hotels links were overwhelmed by our extremely broadband datasharing but i took one call that day janice letting me know my father had died in his sleep it had snowed over most of maryland that day about six inches of fine powder my father wore a medical tag which had issued an alert when he entered cardiac distress but by the time the ambulance arrived he was beyond resuscitation janice offered to make the necessary arrangements while i was overseas there was no other surviving family i agreed and thanked her im sorry scott she said i know he was a difficult man but im sorry i tried to feel the loss in a meaningful way nevertheless i caught myself wondering how much trauma he had avoided by ducking out of history at this juncture what tithes he would not be obliged to pay morris knocked at my door as dusk was falling and escorted me back to the tech suite monitors radiating blue light into the room as observers morris and i were relegated to the line of chairs along the rear wall where we wouldnt be underfoot the room was hot and dry ranks of portable heaters already glowing ferociously the techs seemed overdressed and were sweating at their consoles outside the cloudless sky faded to ink the city was preternaturally still not long now morris whispered this was the first time the arrival of a chronolith had been predicted with any accuracy but the calculations were still approximate the countdown tentative sue passing said keep your eyes open morris said what if nothing happens then the likkud loses the election and we lose our credibility the minutes drained away quilted jackets were handed out to those of us who hadnt donned protective clothing morris leaned out of the shadows again sweating and obviously restless best guess for touchdown point is in the business district its an interesting choice avoids the old city the temple mount kuin as caesar i said worship whatever gods you like as long as you bow to the conqueror not the first time for jerusalem but maybe the last the chronoliths had reignited all the apocalyptic fears the th century had focused on nuclear weapons the sense that a new technology had raised the stakes of conflict that the long parade of empires rising and empires falling might have reached its final cycle which was just now all too easy to believe the valley of megiddo after all was only a few miles from here we were reminded to keep our jackets zipped despite the heat sue wanted the room as hot as we could tolerate a buffer against thermal shock intense analysis of previous arrivals had given us an idea of what to expect a chronolith doesnt displace the air and bedrock where it appears it transforms these materials and incorporates them into its own structure the shockwave is a result of what sue had dubbed radiant cooling within a few yards of the kuin stone the air itself would condense solidify and fall to the ground for some part of a second air rushing to replace it would be acted upon similarly within a slightly broader area the atmosphere would freeze in fractions of its constituent gases oxygen nitrogen and carbon dioxide water vapor is precipitated over a much wider perimeter the presence of groundwater causes a similar phenomenon in soil and bedrock cracking stone and radiating a groundborne shockwave all this cooled and moving air creates convection cells thus severe wind at ground zero and unpredictable and pervasive fogs for miles around which was why no one objected to the dry heat the sealed room the whitegarbed technicians most of them graduate students out on loan manned the row of terminals facing the windows their telemetry came from the roof arrays or from remote sensors placed closer to the touchdown zone periodically they sang out numbers none of which meant anything to me but the level of tension was clearly rising sue paced among these eager young people like a fretful parent she paused before us crisp in fresh blue jeans and a white blouse background counts are way up she said on extremely steep curves thats like a twominute warning guys morris said should we have goggles or something its not an hbomb morris it wont blind you and then she turned away one of the monitoring technicians a young blond woman who looked not much older than kaitlin had risen from her chair and approached sue with a supplicating smile the idf security contingent looked sharply at her so did morris the girl seemed dazed maybe a little out of control she hesitated then in a gesture almost touchingly childlike she reached for sues hand and took it in her own sue said cassie what is it i wanted to say thank you cassies voice was timid but fervent sue frowned youre welcome but for what but cassie just ducked her head and backed away as if the thought had gone out of her head as quickly as it had entered she covered her mouth with her hand oh im sorry i just i guess i just felt like i should say it i dont know what i was thinking she blushed best stay in your chair sue said gently we were deep in the tau turbulence now the room smelled hot and electric beyond the window the city core quivered under a sudden auroral glow it all happened in a matter of seconds but time was elastic we inhabited seconds as if they were minutes i will admit that i was afraid the incidental light created by the arrival was a curtain of quickly shifting color bluegreen deepening to red and violet hovering over the city and filling the room in which we sat with eerie shadow nineteen hundred and seven minutes sue said checking her watch mark its already cold morris said to me you notice it felt as if the temperature in the room had dropped by several degrees i nodded one of the idf men stood up nervously fingering his weapon as quickly as it had come the light began to fade and then then the chronolith was simply and suddenly present it flashed into existence beyond the dome of the rock taller than the hills grotesquely large white with ice under a brittle moon touchdown someone at the consoles announced ambient radiation dropping external temps way way down hold on sue said the shockwave flexed the window glass and roared like thunder almost immediately the chronolith vanished in a white whirlwind moisture gigged out of the atmosphere by thermal shock a few miles away temperature differentials cracked concrete split timbers and surely destroyed the living tissue of any creature unfortunate enough to have strayed into the exclusion zone there were a few cats dogs pilgrims skeptics a wave of whiteness rayed out from the central storm frost climbing the judean hills like fire and a host of urban lights dimmed as powergrid transformers shorted in fountains of sparks cloud engulfed the hotel a hard fast wind rattled the windows suddenly the room was dark console lights quivering like stars reflected in a pond cold as a son of a bitch morris muttered i wrapped my arms around myself and saw sue chopra do likewise as she turned away from the window the idf man who had stood up moments ago raised his automatic rifle he shouted something that was incomprehensible in the noise of the storm then he began to fire into the darkened room the name of the shooter was aaron weiszack what i know about him is what i read in the next days newspapers and wouldnt it save a world of grief if we could read tomorrows headlines before they happened or maybe not aaron weiszack had been born in cleveland ohio and immigrated to israel with his family in he spent his teenage years in suburban tel aviv and had already flirted with a number of radical political organizations before he was drafted in weiszack had been briefly detained but not charged during the temple mount riots of his idf record however was impeccable and he had been careful to conceal from his superiors his ongoing association with a fringe kuinist cell called embrace the future he was if not deranged at least unbalanced his motives remain unclear he had not fired more than a couple of rounds before another of the idf soldiers a woman named leah agnon cut him down with a brief burst from her own weapon weiszack died almost instantly of his wounds but he wasnt the only casualty in the room i have often thought aaron weiszacks act was at least as portentous as the arrival of the kuin of jerusalem in its way a far more precise imaging of the shape of things to come weiszacks last rifle burst cracked one of the allegedly blastproof but apparently not bulletproof windows which collapsed in a shower of silvery nuggets cold wind and dense fog swept into the room i stood up deafened by the gunshots blinking stupidly morris leaped out of his chair toward sue chopra who had fallen to the floor and covered her with his body none of us knew whether the attack had finished or had just begun i couldnt see sue under morriss bulk didnt know whether she was seriously injured but there was blood everywhere weiszacks blood all over the wallpaper and the blood of the young technicians speckled across their consoles i took a breath and began to hear sounds again the scream of human voices the scream of the wind fine grains of ice flew through the room like shrapnel propelled by the impossibly steep thermoclines sweeping the city the idf force surrounded the fallen weiszack rifles aimed at his inert body the fbi contingent spread out to secure the scene and some of sues postdocs hovered over their fallen companions attempting first aid voices and i thought i heard morriss among them shouted for help we had a paramedic in the room but he was surely overwhelmed if he hadnt been injured i ducked and crawled across the floor to morris he had rolled off sue and was cradling her head in his arms she was hurt there was blood on the carpet here a smattering of red droplets steaming in the brutal cold morris glanced at me its not serious he said mouthing the words broadly over the roar of the wind help me drag her into the hallway no sue surged up against him and i saw the bloody gash where her jeans had been torn by a bullet or shrapnel a freelybleeding divot along the fleshy part of her right thigh but if this was her only wound then morris was right she was in no immediate danger let us take care of it morris told her firmly people are hurt her eyes darted toward the row of terminals where her students and technicians were variously paralyzed with terror or slumped in their chairs oh god cassie cassie the winsome postgraduate student had lost part of her skull to the gunfire sue closed her eyes and we dragged her out of the cold and morris spoke intently into his pocket phone as i pressed my palm against her bloody leg by this time the ambulances from hadassah mt sinai were already on their way skidding over the crusts of ice still clinging to lehi street the paramedics set up triage in the lobby of the hotel where they covered broken windows with thermal blankets and ran heaters from the hotels generator one of them put a pressure bandage on sues injury and directed arriving aid to the more critically injured some of whom had been carried to the lobby some of whom remained immobilized upstairs idf and civilian police cordoned the building while sirens wailed from all points of the compass she died sue said bleakly cassie of course she died scotty you saw her twenty years old mit diploma program a sweet nice child she thanked me and then she was killed what does that mean does that mean something outside ice fell from the cornices and rooftops of the hotel and shattered on the sidewalks moonlight penetrated the glassy white ruins and limned the emerging contours of the kuin of jerusalem the kuin of jerusalem a foursided pillar rising to form a throne on which the figure of kuin is seated kuin gazes placidly past the fractured dome of the rock scrutinizing the judean desert he is clothed in peasant trousers and shirt on his head is a band which might be a modest crown worked with images of halfmoons and laurel leaves his face is formal and regal the features unspecific the immense base of the monument meets the earth deep in the rains of zion square the peak achieves an altitude of fourteen hundred feet part two lost children ten what strikes me now if you can forgive an old man secondguessing the text of his own memoirs is how strange the advent of the chronoliths must have seemed to the generation that came of age after the fall of the soviet union my fathers generation though he didnt live to see the worst of it they were a generation that had looked on thirdworld dictatorships less with outrage than with impatience a generation to whom grandiose palaces and monuments were the embarrassments of an earlier age haunted houses ready to topple in the stiff winds blowing from the nikkei and the nasdaq the rise of kuin caught them utterly off guard they were serious about the threat but deaf to its appeal they could imagine a million underfed asians paying fealty to the name of kuin that was at least distantly plausible but when they were scorned by their own children and grandchildren their confidence evaporated they escaped by and large into the shelter of arms kuins monuments might seem magical but they predicted and were ultimately derived from military conquests and a welldefended nation could not be conquered or so the reasoning went the jerusalem arrival provoked a second surge of federal investment in research detector satellite arrays a new generation of missilehunting drones smart mines battlefield and supply robots the draft was reintroduced in and the standing army increased by half a million inductees which helped to disguise the decline in the civilian economy that followed the aquifer crisis the battered condition of asian trade and the beginning of the yearslong atchafalaya basin disaster we would have bombed kuin in his infancy if anyone had been able to find him but southern china and most of southeast asia were in a state of ungoverned barbarism a place where warlords in armored atvs terrorized starving peasants any or all of these petty tyrants might have been kuin most of them claimed to be probably none of them was it was far from certain that kuin was even chinese he could have been anywhere what seems obvious now but wasnt then is that kuin was dangerous precisely because he hadnt declared himself he possessed no platform but conquest no ideology but ultimate victory promising nothing he promised everything the dispossessed the disenfranchised and the merely unhappy were all drawn toward an identification with kuin kuin who would level the mountains and make the valleys high kuin who must speak with their voice since no one else did for the generation that followed mine kuin represented the radically new the overthrow of antiquated structures of authority and the ascension of powers as cold and ruthlessly modern as the chronoliths themselves in brief he took our children from us when i got the call about kait from janice her video window blanked to hide her tears i understood that i would have to leave baltimore and that i would have to do so without morris torrance tailing me across seven states which wouldnt be easy but might be easier than it would have been before jerusalem before jerusalem sue chopra had been overseeing chronolith research under a generous federal dispensation that preeminence had been compromised by her devotion to the purely theoretical aspects of chronolith theory her obsession with the mathematics of tau turbulence as opposed to practical questions of detection and defense and by her disastrous congressional appearance in june of in public questioning she had refused to accommodate senator lazars theory that the jerusalem chronolith might be a signal of the end times she called the senator poorly educated and the notion of impending apocalypse an absurd mythology that abets the very process were struggling to contain lazar a former republican turned federal party hatchetman called sue an ivorytower atheist who needed to be weaned from the public teat she was of course too valuable to cut loose entirely but she ceased to be the central figure in the effort to coordinate chronolith research she was instead kept away from public scrutiny she remained the nations foremost expert on the esoterica of tau turbulence but had ceased to be its poster child the upside of this was that the fbi took a less direct interest in such small fish as myself even if my files still languished in the digital catacombs of the hoover building morris torrance had resigned from the bureau rather than accept reassignment morris was a believer he believed in the divinity of jesus christ the goodness of sulamith chopra and the veracity of his own dreams the age of the chronoliths had made such conversions possible i think too he was a little in love with sue though unlike ray mosely he had never harbored any illusions about her sexuality he remained as her bodyguard and chief of security drawing a salary that could only have been a fraction of his government income both sue and morris wanted to keep me close to the project sue because i figured into her evolving pattern of meaningful coincidence morris because he believed i was important to sue whether they could use legal leverage to keep me there had become debatable morris was a civilian now but i didnt doubt he would pursue me if i announced i was leaving maybe even pull a few strings to keep me in my place morris liked me in his cautious style but his first loyalty was to sue sue was meanwhile trying to reconstruct her fragmented chronolith project as an internet circle sharing any data the defense department left unclassified deepening and expanding the mathematics of tau turbulence in february of she lost her department of energy bursary and was reduced to another round of fundraising while money flowed copiously into the glamor projects the gammaray laser collider at stanford the exotic matter group working out of chicago i spent the morning cleaning up some code i had grown for her a little routine that would go out into the world and search media nodes for relevant synchronicities according to a nounsorting algorithm sue herself had cooked up morris passed in and out of the office a couple of times looking leaner than he used to older too but still obstinately cheerful sue was in her own office and i stopped and knocked to tell her i was leaving for lunch i meant but she must have heard something in my voice long lunch how far are you planning to go scotty not far were not done you know she might have been talking about the code wed been evolving but i doubted it sues leg wound had healed years ago but the jerusalem experience had left other scars jerusalem she told me once had made clear to her how dangerous her work was that by placing herself near the center of the tau turbulence she had put at risk not only herself but the people around her but i suppose its inevitable she had said sadly thats the worst of it you stand on the train tracks long enough sooner or later you meet a train i told her id finish the debugging that afternoon she gave me a long skeptical glare anything else you want to tell me not at the moment well talk again she said like most of her prophecies this one would come true too morris offered to join me for lunch but i told him no i had some errands to do and id probably just grab a sandwich on the run if he found this suspicious he didnt show it i closed out my account at zurich american transferred most of the funds to a transit card and took the rest in oldfashioned folding green i drove around a while longer to make sure morris wasnt tailing me unlikely as that was more probably he had tapped the locator in my car so i traded in the chrysler at a downtown dealership told the salesperson there was nothing i liked on the lot and would she mind if i shopped the other franchises no she said and shed be happy to walk me through the virtual inventory in the back room i tentatively selected a snubnosed volks edison in dusty blue possibly the most anonymouslooking automobile ever manufactured left my chrysler at the lot and accepted a courtesy ride halfway across the city up close the volks looked a little more battered than it had in the virts but its power plant was sturdy and clean as near as i could judge all of this amateur espionage bullshit left an etrail as wide as the missouri of course but while morris torrance could surely make a few connections and hunt me down he couldnt do it fast enough to keep me in baltimore i was two hundred miles west by nightfall driving into a warm june evening with the windows open popping antacids to calm the churning in my stomach there was a big ration camp where the highway crossed the ohio maybe a thousand threadbare canvas tents flapping in the spring breeze dozens of barrel fires burning fitfully most of these people would have been refugees from the louisiana bottomlands unemployed refinery and petrochemical workers farmers flooded out of their property the consolidating clay of the atchafalaya basin had at last begun to draw the mississippi river out of its own silted birdfoot deltas despite the best efforts of the us army corps of engineers more than a million families had been displaced by this springs floods not to mention the chaos that resulted from collapsed bridges and navigational locks and mudchoked roads men lined the breakdown lane begging rides in both directions hitchhiking had been illegal here for fifty years and rides were scarce but these men almost all men had ceased caring they stood stiff as scarecrows blinking into the glare of the headlights i hoped kait had found a safe place to sleep tonight when i reached the outskirts of minneapolis i registered at a motel the desk clerk an ancient turtle of a man opened his eyes wide when i took cash out of my wallet ill have to go to the bank with that he said so i added fifty dollars for his trouble and he was kind enough not to process my id the room he gave me was a cubicle containing a bed and a courtesy terminal and a window that overlooked the parking lot i desperately needed sleep but before that i needed to talk to janice it was whit who answered the phone scott he said cordially but not happily he looked like he needed some sleep himself i assume youre calling about kaitlin im sorry to say theres been no further information the police seem to think shes still in the city so were cautiously optimistic obviously were doing all we can thank you whit but i need to talk to janice right now its late i hate to disturb her ill be quick well whit said and wandered away from the terminal janice showed up a few moments later wearing her nightgown but obviously wide awake scotty she said i tried to call you but there was nobody home thats all right im in town can we get together tomorrow and talk this over youre in town you didnt have to come all this way i think i did janice can you make an hour for me i can drop by the house or no she said ill meet you where are you staying id as soon not meet here what about that little steak house on dukane you know the one i think its still in business meet you at noon make it one try to get some sleep i said you too she hesitated its been four days no scotty four nights i think about her all the time well talk tomorrow i said eleven theres a difference between seeing someone in a phone window and seeing the same person in the flesh i had phoned janice half a dozen times in the last couple of months but i almost failed to recognize her when she walked through the door of the steak house what had changed her i think was the combination of prosperity and dread whit had done well despite the economic downturn janice wore a visibly expensive blue tweed suit and day jacket but she wore it as if she had reached into her closet and yanked it off the hanger collar bent pockets unbuttoned her eyes were red the skin under them swollen and gray we hugged cordially but neutrally and she took the chair opposite mine no news she said she fingered her handbag where her phone undoubtedly was the police said they would call if anything turned up she ordered a salad she didnt touch and a margarita she drank too eagerly it might have been nice to talk about something else but we both knew why we were there i said im going to have to walk you through this whole thing one more time can you deal with that yes she said i think i can but scott you have to tell me what you intend to do what i intend to do about all this because its in the hands of the police now and you could create a problem if you get too involved im her father i think i have a right to know to know yes certainly but not to interfere im not planning to interfere she offered a wan smile why do i find that less than convincing i began a question but janice said no wait a minute i want you to have this she took a manila envelope from her handbag and passed it to me i opened it and found a recent photograph of kaitlin janice had printed it on slick stock the image was crisp and defined kait at sixteen was tall for her age and undeniably pretty fate had spared her the curse of adolescent acne and judging by the poise in her expression adolescent awkwardness as well she looked somber but healthy for a moment i didnt recognize what was unusual about the picture then i thought her hair kait had tied back her long dirtyblond hair in a braid showing off her ears both of them thats what you gave her scott i wanted to thank you for that the innerear prosthesis was of course invisible but the cosmetic work was flawless as it should be the ear wasnt false genetically it was hers grown from kaitlins own stem cells there were no scars except for a faded suture line but she had been selfconscious for years after the operation when the bandages came off it was all still pink you know but perfect just like a new rose i had been there for the surgery but not for the unveiling that had happened during the crisis provoked by the damascus arrival and id been with sue janice went on i told her she was beautiful right there in the hospital in front of the doctor and the nurses she cocked her head as if she wasnt sure where my voice was coming from it takes time to you know adjust you know what she said to me what a single tear tracked down janices cheek she said you dont have to shout the trouble started janice said when kaitlin failed to come home from a youth group meeting what kind of youth group its just a well janice faltered theres no point doing this if were not honest i said its a youth division of this organization whit belongs to you have to understand scott its not a prokuin thing its just people who want to talk about alternatives to armed conflict jesus christ i said janice whit is a copperhead lately the newspapers had revived the civil war term copperhead as a blanket insult for the various kuinist movements janice lowered her eyes and said we dont use that term by which i gathered she meant whit didnt like it im not into politics you know that even whit he only got involved because some of the people in upper management were joining preparing for a war we probably wont even have to fight thats just not good economic sense whit says this was a standard copperhead argument and it was disturbing to hear it from janices lips not that it didnt contain a mote of truth but beating under it was the kuinist disdain for democratic process the notion that kuin might bring order to a planet divided along too many economic religious and ecological fracture lines i had followed the rise of the copperhead movement on the web inevitably since sue considered it significant and morris considered it a potential threat what i had seen i disliked and he dragged kaitlin into this kait wanted to go at first he took her to the grownup meetings but then she got interested in the youth arm so you let her join just like that she looked at me pleadingly honestly scotty i didnt see anything wrong with it they werent making pipe bombs for gods sake it was just a social thing i mean they played baseball they put on plays teenagers scott she was making all these new friends she had real friends for the first time in her life what was i supposed to do lock her in the house im not here to judge right just tell me what happened she sighed well i guess there were some radicals in the membership its hard to get away from it you know the young people are especially vulnerable its in the news the net she used to talk about it sometimes about she lowered her voice about kuin and how you shouldnt condemn what you dont understand that kind of thing she was more serious about it than i imagined she went to a meeting and didnt come back no nor did ten others most of them older than kait apparently they had been talking for weeks about the idea of a pilgrimage what they call a haj i closed my eyes but the police say theyre probably still in town janice hurried on probably squatting in an empty building with a bunch of other wouldbe radicals talking big and shoplifting food i hope thats true but its bad enough have you looked for her yourself the police said not to how about whit whit says we should cooperate with the police and that goes for you too scott can you give me the name of somebody on the police force i can talk to she took out her address book copied a name and phone address onto a paper napkin but she did it grudgingly giving me long sour looks i said also the name of this copperhead club whit belongs to at that she balked i dont want you making trouble thats not why im here bullshit you come to town with all this this moral outrage my daughters missing thats why im here what part of that are you afraid of she paused then she said kaits been away less than a week she could come home tomorrow i have to believe that i have to believe the police are doing all they can but i can see that look in your eyes and i hate it what look like youre getting ready to grieve janice she slapped the table with her open hand no scott im sorry im grateful for all youve done for kait i know how hard you tried but i cant tell you what organizations whit belongs to thats his private life we discussed all this with the police and thats it for now anyway so dont look at me with those those fucking funeral eyes i was hurt but i didnt blame janice even when she stood up and stalked out into the sunbleached street i knew how she felt kaitlin was in danger and janice was asking herself what she could have done better how she had dropped the ball how things had gone so bad so fast i had been asking myself those same questions for ten years now but it was a new experience for janice after lunch i drove to clarion pharmaceuticals a big industrial compound out where the suburbs met the wheat fields and told the gate guard i wanted to see mr delahunt the guard stuck a card under the left front wiper and reminded me to pick up a visitors pass at the main entrance but clarions security was lax i parked and walked through an open door near the loading bays and took an elevator up to what the directory said was whits office and walked past his secretary as if i belonged there into a warren of doorless rooms where men and women in crisp suits held phone conferences until i found whitman delahunt himself draining filtered spring water from a cooler in the narrow hall his eyes went wide when he saw me whit was as impeccable as ever a little grayer at the temples and wider at the waist but he carried it well he had even been smiling faintly to himself though the smile vanished when he spotted me he threw his paper cup into the trash scott he said jesus you could have called i thought we should talk in person we should and i dont want to seem callous i know what youre going through but this isnt a good time for me id rather not wait scott be reasonable maybe tonight i dont think im being unreasonable my daughter has been godknowswhere for five days sleeping in the streets for all i know so im sorry whit if it interferes with your work and all but we really do need to have a talk he hesitated then puffed himself up i would hate to have to call security while youre thinking it over tell me about that copperhead club you joined his eyes widened watch what you say or we could discuss this in private fuck scotty all right jesus follow me he took me to the executive cafeteria the steam tables were empty the food service finished for the day the room was deserted we sat at a lacquered wooden table like civilized people whit loosened his tie janice told me this might happen that youd come into town and complicate everything you really should talk to the police scott because i sure as hell intend to let them know what youre up to you mentioned the copperhead club no you mentioned it and will you please stop using that obscene word its no such thing its a citizens committee for christs sake yes we talk about disarmament from time to time but we talk about civil defense too were just average churchgoing people dont judge us by the fringe element you read about in the papers what should i call it then were he had the grace to look embarrassed were the twin cities peace with honor committee you have to understand theres a lot at stake here the kids have a point scott the military buildup is distorting the economy and theres no evidence at all that guns and bombs are useful against kuin assuming he constitutes a threat to the united states which is far from proven were challenging the widespread belief that i dont need the manifesto whit what kind of people belong to this committee prominent people how many he blushed again roughly thirty and you initiated kait into the childrens auxiliary far from it the young people take these issues more seriously than we do than our generation i mean theyre not cynical about it kaitlin is a perfect example shed come home from youth group talking about all the things a leader like kuin could do if we werent fighting him at every turn as if you could fight a man who controls time itself instead of finding a way to make the future a functional place you ever discuss this with her i didnt indoctrinate her if mats what youre insinuating i respect kaitlins ideas but she fell in with radicals is that right whit shifted in his seat i wouldnt necessarily categorize them as radicals i know some of those kids they can be a little over the top but its enthusiasm not fanaticism none of them has been seen since saturday my feeling is that theyre all right things like this happen sometimes kids dump their gps tags take an automobile and go off somewhere for a few days its not good but its hardly unique im sorry if kaitlin was misled by a few bad apples scott but adolescence is never an easy time did they ever talk about a haj pardon me a haj janice used the word she shouldnt have we discourage that word too a haj is a pilgrimage to mecca but thats not how the kids use it they mean a trip to see a kuin stone or a place where one is supposed to arrive you think thats what they had in mind i dont know what they might have had in mind but i doubt it was a haj you cant drive a daimler to madras or tokyo so youre not worried he drew back and looked like he wanted to spit thats a vicious thing to say of course im worried the world is a dangerous place more dangerous than its ever been in my opinion i dread what might happen to kaitlin thats why i intend to let the police do their work without interference i would suggest you do the same thank you whit i said dont make it worse for janice than it already is i dont see how i could do that talk to the police i mean it or ill talk to them on your behalf he had recovered his poise i stood up i didnt want to hear any more homilies about kait not from this man he sat in his chair like a wounded princeling and watched me leave i called janice again from the car i wanted to speak to her once more before whitman did hard times had changed the city i drove past barred or boarded windows discount retailers where decent shops used to be storefront churches of obscure denomination the trash collectors strike had filled the sidewalks with garbage i told janice over the phone that id talked to whit you had to do that didnt you just when i thought things couldnt get worse there was a note in her voice i didnt like janice are you afraid of him of course not not physically but what if he loses his job what then you dont understand scotty a lot of what whit does is just he has to go along to get along you know what i mean my concern is with kaitlin right now im not sure youre doing kait any good either she sighed theres a parents group the police told me about you might want to look into it parents group parents whose kids ran off usually kids with kuinist ideas haj parents if you know what i mean the last thing im looking for is a support group you could compare notes see what other people are doing i doubted it but she zipped me the address and i copied it into my directory meanwhile she said ill apologize to whit for you has he apologized for letting kait get mixed up in this thats none of your business scott twelve a month or so after the jerusalem arrival i had taken myself to a doctor and had a long talk about genetics and madness it had occurred to me that sues logic of correlation might have a personal side to it she was saying in effect that our expectations shape the future and that those of us exposed to extreme tau turbulence might influence it more than most and if what was happening to the world was madness could i have factored in some of it from my own deepest psychic vaults had i inherited from my mother a faulty genetic sequence and was it my own latent insanity that had filled a hotel suite on mt scopus with bullets and glass the physician i talked to drew a blood sample and agreed to look at my genes for any markers that might suggest lateonset schizophrenia but it wasnt as simple as that he said schizophrenia isnt a purely heritable disorder although susceptibility has a genetic aspect thats why they dont genepatch for it there are complex environmental triggers the most he could tell me was whether i might have inherited a tendency toward adultonset schizophrenia an almost meaningless factoid and utterly without predictive value i thought of it again when i used the motel terminal to call up a map of the world marked with chronolith sites if this was madness here were its tangible symptoms asia was a red zone dissolving into feverish anarchy though fragile national governments continued to exist in japan where the ruling coalition had survived a plebiscite barely and in beijing though not in the chinese countryside or far from the coast the indian subcontinent was pockmarked with arrivals and so was the middle east not only jerusalem and damascus but baghdad tehran istanbul europe was free of the physical manifestation of kuinism which had so far stalled at the bosporus but not its political counterpart there had been massive street riots in both paris and brussels staged by rival kuinist factions northern africa had endured five disastrous arrivals a small chronolith had cored the equatorial city of kinshasa just last month the planet was sick sick unto death i dumped the map window and called one of the numbers janice had given me a police lieutenant by the name of ramone dudley his interface told me he was unavailable but that my call had been logged for return while i waited i entered the other number janice had pressed on me the support group which turned out to be the home terminal of a middleaged woman named regina lee sadler she wore a bathrobe when she answered and her hair was dripping i apologized for calling her out of the shower makes no mind she said her voice a southern contralto as dark as her complexion unless youre calling from that goddamned collection agency pardon my french i explained about kaitlin yes she said in fact i know about that we have a couple other parents from that incident just joined us mostly moms of course the dads tend to resist the kind of help we offer god knows why you seem not be a member of that stiffnecked clan however i wasnt here when kait disappeared i told her about janice and whit so youre an absentee father she said not by choice mrs sadler can i ask you a frank question i would prefer that to the other kind and most people call me regina lee do i have anything to gain by meeting these folks will it help me get my daughter home no no i cant promise you that our group exists for our own purposes we save ourselves a lot of parents in this situation they are very vulnerable to despair it helps some people to be able to share thenfeelings with others in similar straits and i suspect you are tuning me out right now saying to yourself well i dont need that touchyfeely crap and maybe you dont but some of us do and we are not ashamed of it i see not to say there isnt a certain amount of networking a lot of our people have hired private investigators freelance skiptracers deprogrammers and so on and they do compare notes and share information but i will tell you frankly that i have very little faith in such activity and the results ive seen bear that out i told her those were the people id like to talk to if only to learn from their failures well if you come to our gathering tonight she gave me the address of a church hall if you show up youll certainly be able to have a conversation of that nature but may i ask something of you in return dont come as a skeptic bring an open mind about yourself i mean you seem all calm and collected but i know from personal experience what youre going through how easy it is to grasp at straws when a loved one is in danger and make no mistake your kaitlin is in danger i do know that mrs sadler theres knowing it and theres knowing it she looked over her shoulder perhaps at a clock i ought to be getting fixed up but may i say i hope to see you this evening thank you i pray you find a positive outcome mr warden whatever you do i thanked her again the meeting took place in the assembly hall of a presbyterian church in what had been a workingclass neighborhood before it slipped into outright poverty some few years ago regina lee sadler strutting across the stage in a flowered dress and with an oldfashioned handless mike bobbing in front of her head looked both more robust and about twenty pounds heavier than she had looked in the video window i wondered if regina lee was vain enough to have installed a slimming ap in her interface i didnt introduce myself just lurked in the back of the hall it wasnt exactly a twelvestep meeting but it wasnt far off five new members introduced themselves and their problems four had lost children to kuinist or haj cells within the last month one had been missing her daughter for more than a year and wanted a place where she could share her grief not that she had given up hope she insisted not at all but she was just very very tired and thought she might be able to sleep through the night for a change if only she had someone to talk to there was muted sympathetic applause then regina lee stood up again and read from a printed sheet of news and updates children recovered rumors of new kuinist movements in the west and south a truckload of underage pilgrims intercepted at the mexican border i took notes at that point the meeting became more personal as attendees divided up into workshops to discuss coping strategies and i slipped quietly out the door i would have gone directly back to the motel if not for the woman sitting on the church steps smoking a cigarette she was about my age her expression careworn but thoughtful and focused her hair was short and lustrous in the street light her eyes were shadowed as she glanced up at me sorry she said automatically stubbing out the cigarette i told her it was all right under a recent statute tobacco preparations were illegal for trade without an addicts certificate and a prescription but i considered myself broadminded i had grown up in the days of legal tobacco had enough she asked waving a hand at the church door for now i said she nodded regina lee is good for a lot of people and god knows shes unstoppable but i dont need what shes handing out i dont think so anyhow we introduced ourselves she was ashlee mills and her son was adam adam was eighteen years old deeply involved in the local kuinist network he had been missing for six days now just like kaitlin so we compared notes adam had been involved with whit delahunts junior auxiliary as well as a handful of other radical organizations so they probably would have known each other thats a coincidence ashlee said i told her no there was no such thing we were still talking when regina lees meeting began to break up crowding us off the church steps i offered to buy her coffee somewhere nearby she lived in the neighborhood ashlee gave me a thoughtful look frank and a little intimidating she struck me as a woman who harbored no illusions about men then she said okay theres an allnight coffee shop next to the drugstore just around the corner we walked there ashlee was conspicuously not wealthy her skirt and blouse looked like goodwill purchases caredfor but a long way from new but she wore them with a dignity that was innate not practiced at the restaurant she counted out dollar coins to pay for her coffee i told her not to bother and pushed my card across the counter she gave me another long look then nodded we found a quiet corner table away from the jabbering video panels she said youll want to know about my son i nodded but this isnt one of regina lees workshops what i really want to know is how i can help my daughter i cant promise you anything to that effect mr warden thats what everybody tells me everybody is right im sorry to say at least in my experience ashlee had been born and educated in southern california had come to minneapolis to work as a medical receptionist for her uncle a podiatrist who had since died of an aneurysm at the reception desk she had met tucker kellog a tool and dye programmer and married him at the age of twenty tucker left home when their son adam was five years old he had been unavailable since ashlee filed for divorce and could have sued for child support but chose not to she was better off without tucker in her life she said even peripherally she had reverted to her maiden name ten years ago she loved her son adam but he had been a trial parent to parent mr warden there were times when i was in despair even when he was little it was hard keeping adam in school nobody likes school i guess but whatever it is that made the rest of us show up every day sense of duty or fear of the consequences whatever it is adam didnt feel it he couldnt be bullied into it and he couldnt be shamed into it he had been in and out of psychiatric programs apprenticeship programs special learning facilities and occasionally juvenile hall not that adam wasnt bright he reads constantly not just storybooks either and frankly it takes a certain amount of smarts to survive the way he has on the street half the time adam is actually very clever when ashlee talked about her son her expression was a mixture of pride guilt and apprehension sometimes all three at once her large eyes darted from side to side as if she expected to be overheard she played with her napkin folding it and refolding it finally tearing it into long strips that lay on the tabletop like aborted acts of origami he ran away once when he was twelve but that had nothing to do with this copperhead thing i swear i dont know what adam imagines this kuin is all about apart from the business of destroying cities and making peoples lives miserable but it fascinates him the way he watches the news nets is almost frightening she dipped her head im reluctant to say it but i think what adam likes is basically just this crushing of things i think he puts himself in kuins place he wants to lift his foot and obliterate everything he hates the talk about a new kind of world government is just setdressing in my opinion did he ever talk to you about kaitlin or her group ashlee smiled sadly thats a question and a half did your kaitlin ever talk to you about this stuff we talked but no she never mentioned anything political that still puts you a step up from me adam has never confided in me about anything anything at all everything i know about my own son i learned from observation excuse me i think i need another coffee what she needed i imagined was another smoke she paused at the counter asked the clerk for a doubledouble then ducked into the restroom for a while she came out looking calmer i think the counterman smelled tobacco when she picked up her coffee he gave her a hard look then rolled his eyes she sat down again sighing no adam never talked about his meetings adam is seventeen but like i said hes not naive he conducts his business pretty carefully but you know i would overhear things once in a while i knew hed hooked up with one of the suburban copperhead clubs but for a while it seemed like that was almost a good thing he was with people who had some you know background prospects i guess in the back of my head was the idea that he would make friends and maybe that would lead to something some opportunities after all this timetravel shit blows over excuse me i thought he might meet a girl or maybe somebodys dad would offer him a job i thought of janices plaintive what was i supposed to do lock her in the house janice had clearly not imagined her daughter in the company of an adam mills i changed my mind when i walked in on one of his phone calls he was talking about those people i guess including your kait im sorry to say and he was just vicious contemptuous he said the group was full of she lowered her head ashamed full of whitebread virgins she must have seen my reaction ashlee put her chin up and her manner hardened i love my son mr warden i dont have any illusions about the kind of person adam is or will be unless he turns himself around adam has serious serious problems but hes my son and i love him i respect that i said i hope so theyre both missing thats what we have to worry about now she frowned then maybe reluctant to be included in the pronoun ashlee was accustomed to dealing with her own troubles in her own way that was why she had bailed out of regina lees meeting but then so had i she said i would be very frankly pissed if you were trying to pick me up mr warden thats not what this is about because i want to ask you for your phone number so we can keep in touch about adam and kaitlin i dont have any hard information but my guess is that their whole little group is attempting some kind of halfassed pilgrimage christ only knows where so theyre probably together so we should keep in touch i just dont want to be misunderstood i gave her my portable address she gave me her home terminal she finished her coffee and said this is pretty much all bad news for you not all i said she stood up well it was good meeting you she turned and walked through the door into the street i watched her through the window as she strode a half block between islands of lamplight to a doorway adjoining a chinese restaurant where she fumbled with a key an apartment over a restaurant i pictured a threadbare sofa maybe a cat a rose in a wine bottle or a framed poster on the wall the echoing absence of her son ramone dudley the police lieutenant in charge of local missing persons agreed to see me in his office the following afternoon the meeting was brief dudley was an obviously overworked desk cop who had delivered the same bad news too many times these kids he said clearly a homogenous mass in dudleys mind these kids they have no future and they know it the thing is its true the economy sucks thats no secret and what else do we have to offer them everything they hear about the future is all kuin kuin kuin fucking kuin according to the fundies kuin is the antichrist all you can do is say your prayers and wait for the rapture washington is drafting kids for some war we may never fight and the copperheads are saying maybe kuin wont hurt us so bad if we bend over politely thats not a real bouquet of options when you think about it plus all that shit they hear in the music or learn in those encrypted chatrooms plainly lieutenant dudley blamed most of this on my generation he must have met some inadequate parents in the course of his work by the way he looked at me he was pretty sure i was one of them i said about kaitlin he took a file from his desktop and read me the contents there were no surprises a total of eight youths all involved in the junior arm of whitmans social club had failed to return home from a meeting friends and parents of the missing children had been extensively interviewed with the exception of yourself mr warden and i was expecting you to turn up whit delahunt told you about me i guessed he mentioned you briefly when we interviewed him but no not exactly the call i got was from a retired fed named morris torrance fast work but then morris had always been diligent what did he tell you he asked me to give you as much cooperation as possible this is it as far as im concerned i dont have a whole lot more to tell you unless you have some specific questions oh and he asked me one other thing whats that he asked me to tell you to get in touch with him he said he was sorry to hear about kaitlin and he said he might be able to help you out thirteen maybe i should have taken advantage of regina lees communal therapy and admitted my fear for kaitlin fear and the premonition of grief that drifted into consciousness whenever i closed my eyes but that wasnt my style i had learned at an early age to fake calm in the face of disaster to keep my anxiety to myself like a dirty secret but i thought about kait constantly in my mind she was still the kaitlin of chumphon five years old and as fearless as she was curious children wear their natures like brightlycolored clothes mats why they lie so transparently adulthood is the art of deceit because i had known kaitlin as a child i had never lost sight of the vulnerable heart of her which made it all the more painful to imagine or struggle not to imagine where kaitlin might be now with whom the most fundamental parental urge is the urge to nurture and protect to grieve for a child is to admit ultimate impotence you cant protect what goes into the ground you cant tuck a blanket around a grave i spent much of every night awake staring out the motel window and drinking alternately beer and diet cola and peeing every half hour until sleep broke over me like a glutinous wave what dreams i had were chaotic and futile waking up to the brutal irony of spring of sunlight in a bottomless blue sky was like waking from a dream into a dream i had figured my contact with ashlee mills was a oneshot but she called me on my pocket phone ten days after kaitlins disappearance her voice was businesslike and she came to the point quickly i arranged to meet someone she said a man who might know something about adam and kaitlin but i dont want to meet him alone im free this afternoon i said he works nights if you call what he does work this might not be pretty what is he a pimp uhuh she said hes a sort of a drug dealer i had spent much of the last week on the net researching the phenomenon of haj youth and the kuinist movement tunneling into their hidden chatrooms there was of course no unified kuinist movement lacking a fleshandblood kuin the movement was a patchwork of utopian ideologies and quasireligious cults each competing for the title what they had in common was simply the act of veneration the worship of the chronoliths for the hajists any chronolith was a holy object hajists attributed all sorts of powers to the physical proximity of a kuin stone enlightenment healing psychological transformation epiphanies great and small but unlike the pilgrims at lourdes for instance the vast majority of hajists were young it was in the twentieth century term a youth movement like most such movements it was as much style as substance very few americans ever made a physical pilgrimage to a chronolith site but it was not uncommon to see a teenager with a kuinist logo on his hat or shirt most often the ubiquitous k in a red or orange circle or any of the subtler and supposedly secret signs scarred nipples or earlobes silver ankle bracelets white headbands the k symbol abounded in ashlees neighborhood chalked or painted on walls and sidewalks i pulled up outside the chinese restaurant at the appointed time and ashlee scurried out of her apartment door and into the passenger seat its good you have a cheap car she said it wont attract attention where are we going she gave me an address five blocks farther into the city where the only surviving businesses were stockhouses windowservice fastfood outlets and liquor stores the guys name ashlee said without preamble is cheever cox and hes tied into pretty much all the trade you cant report on your irs form i know him because i used to buy tobacco from him she said this in a carefully neutral tone but glanced at me for signs of disapproval before i got my addicts license i mean what does he know about kait and adam maybe nothing but when i called him yesterday he said hed heard about a cutrate haj and some new rumor about kuin and he didnt want to talk about it over an unencrypted line cheevers kind of paranoid that way you think this is legitimate tell you the truth i dont really know she rolled down the window and lit a cigarette almost defiantly waiting for my reaction minnesota had some of the harshest tobacco laws in the country but i was from outofstate and old enough not to be shocked i said ashlee did you ever consider quitting oh please im not passing judgment im making conversation i dont especially want to talk about it she exhaled noisily there hasnt been a whole lot holding me together the last few years mr warden scott scott then its not that im a weak person but did you ever smoke no i had been spared the antiabuse vaccines that were pushed on so many young people in those days and the resultant risk of adult antibody disorders but tobacco simply wasnt my vice its probably killing me but i dont have much else she seemed to struggle after a thought then let it go it calms me down im not condemning you for it actually i always liked the smell of burning tobacco at least from a distance she smiled wryly uhhuh youre a real degenerate i can tell that about you you miss california do i miss california she rolled her eyes is this a real conversation or are you just nervous about meeting cheever because you dont have to be hes a little shady but hes not a bad person thats reassuring i said youll see the address was a rundown semidetached woodframe house the porch light was out probably permanently the stairs sagged ashlee pulled open the rusty fly screen and rapped at the door cheever cox opened up when ashlee identified herself cox was a bald man of about thirtyfive wearing levis and a pale blue shirt with what looked like marinara sauce dribbled down the collar hey ashlee he barked hugging her he gave me a brief glance ashlee introduced me and said its about what we talked about on the phone the front room contained a faded sofa two wooden folding chairs and a coffee table with ashtray down the dim hallway i could see a corner of the kitchen if cox made a lot of money in the illicit drug trade he wasnt spending it on decor but maybe he had a country house he spotted the pack of cigarettes sticking out of ashlees shirt pocket shit ashlee he said you on a script too fucking governments taking away my business with those little pussy prescription sticks ill lose my script next year ashlee said if im not on a patch or a program worse ill lose my health insurance he grinned so maybe ill see more of you then not a chance she glanced at me ill get my teeth whitened and find a good job be a citizen cox said damn right marry your boyfriend too hes not my boyfriend okay ash im sorry dont mind me you want something a little more than the druggist is willing to sell you i want to ask you some questions about adam yeah but that cant be all you want cox made it obvious that he would have nothing to say unless ashlee bought something from him business is business he said its about my son cheever i know and i love you and adam both but ashlee its business so she paid him for a carton of what she called loose smokes which cox fetched from the basement she held the box in her lap the box reeked cox settled into his chair what it is he told ashlee is i go into the squatters buildings a lot especially down on franklin or lowertown or the old cargill warehouses so i see these kids and you know adam hung with that crowd too its not a big market for me because these kids dont have any money basically theyre shoplifting food but every once in a while one of em comes by some cash i dont ask how and they want a carton two cartons smokes and drinks and chemicals and so forth a lot of times it was adam who would come to me because i knew him from when you and i did business on a more regular basis ashlee lowered her eyes at this assertion but said nothing also frankly adam has a little more on the ball than most of those people they call themselves hajists or kuinists but theyre about as political as bricks you know who does the real haj thing rich kids rich kids and celebs they go to israel or egypt and burn their scented candles or whatever downtown its different most of these kids wouldnt go out of their way for kuin if he was holding a coronation ball in their back yard well adam figured that out thats why he was fooling around with the copperhead clubs in wayzata edina looking for people who think the way he does but are maybe a little more gullible and a little more flush than the downtown crowd cheever ashlee said can you tell me if hes still in town i cant tell you a firm yes or no but i doubt it if he is i havent seen him i talk to people you know i follow the links i keep my ear to ground there are always rumors you remember kirkwell last summer a clinically paranoid retired butcher in kirkwell new mexico had announced that he was measuring increased background radiation at a dry spring outside the city limits his own property by coincidence probably he hoped to make the site a tourist attraction he succeeded by september ten thousand destitute young hajists had camped there the national guard dropped food and water rations and exhorted the pilgrims to go home but it was an outbreak of cholera that finally succeeded in clearing the property the retired butcher promptly disappeared leaving a number of classaction and public nuisance lawsuits in his wake these rumors come and go cox said but the big one right now is mexico ciudad portillo adam was in this room three weeks ago and he was talking about it then not that anybody paid much attention to him thats why he hooked up with the suburban copperheads i think because he wanted to go to mexico and he thought that crowd could supply at least a little money some transportation ashlee said he went to mexico cox held up his hands i cant tell you that for sure but if i had to bet id say he was on the road and bound for the border if he hasnt already crossed it ashlee said nothing she looked pensive and pale almost beaten cox made a sympathetic sound thats the trouble he said stupid people do stupid things but adam is smart enough to do something really stupid we talked it around a little more but cox had said all he had to say finally ashlee stood up and stepped toward the door cox hugged her again come see me when your script runs out he said i asked her on the drive back how she had known adam was missing she said what do you mean it sounds like adam was connected with squatter circles if he wasnt living at home how did you know he was missing we pulled up at the curb ashlee said ill show you she unlocked the street door and walked me up a narrow flight of stairs to her apartment the apartment was laid out like any other railway flat a big front room facing the street two tiny bedrooms off a corridor a square kitchen with a window over the rear alley the apartment was stuffy ashlee said she preferred to keep the windows shut during the garbage strike but it was neatly and sensibly furnished it was the home of someone possessing taste and common sense if not much capital this door ashlee told me is adams room he doesnt like people going in there but hes not around to object in a sense my first real contact with adam was this glimpse of his room i suppose i expected the worst pornography graffiti maybe a shotgun buried in the laundry hamper but adams room was nothing like that it was more than orderly it was icily neat the bed was made the closet door was open and the number of bare hangers suggested that adam had packed for a long trip but what remained of his wardrobe was neatly arrayed the bookshelves were makeshift brickandboard arrangements but the books were upright and in alphabetical order not by author but by title books tell you a lot about the people who choose and read them adam clearly leaned toward the more technical sort of nonfiction electronics manuals textbooks including organic chemistry and american history fundamentals of computation plus random biographies picasso lincoln mao zedong famous trials of the twentieth century how to repair almost anything ten steps to a more efficient fuel cell a childs astronomy book and a spotters guide to manned satellite orbits ice and fire the untold story of the lunar base tragedy and of course books about kuin some of these were mainstream works including mcneil and cassels asia under siege most were gaudy fringe publications with titles like end of days and fifth horseman there were no photographs of living human beings visible but the walls were papered with magazine shots of various chronoliths briefly and uncomfortably i was reminded of sue chopras office in baltimore ashlee said does it look like he never comes home this is adams ground zero maybe he didnt sleep here every night but he was here for a good eight or ten hours out of every twentyfour always she closed the door funny she said i always thought of myself as making a home for adam but thats not how it worked he made his own home it just happened to be inside mine she fixed coffee and we talked a while longer sitting on ashlees long sofa with the sound of street traffic coming through the closed but singleglazed windows there was something deeply comforting about the moment ashlee moving in the kitchen absentmindedly smoothing her bristly hair with her hand something almost viscerally comforting a shadow of the kind of domesticity i had misplaced more than a decade ago i was grateful to her for that but the moment couldnt last she asked me about kaitlin and i told her something not everything about chumphon and the way i had spent the last ten years she was impressed that i had seen the jerusalem arrival not because she felt any reverence for kuin but because it meant i had moved if only peripherally among the kind of people she imagined were relatively rich and vaguely famous at least you were doing something she said not just spinning your wheels i told her she had obviously done more than spin her wheels it couldnt have been easy for a single woman to raise a child during the economic crisis they call it spinning your wheels she said when you cant get traction and i guess thats how i feel about adam i tried to help him but i couldnt get traction she paused and then turned to face me her expression less guarded than it had been suppose they did go to mexico adam and kaitlin and all that group what do we do i dont know i said i have to talk to some people would you follow kaitlin all the way to portillo if i thought i could help her if i thought it would do any good but youre not sure no im not sure my pocket phone rang it was set to take messages but i checked the display to see who was calling it might have been janice saying kait had come home that the whole thing was a stupid misunderstanding or it might have been ramone dudley calling to tell me the police had found kaits body it was neither according to the text display the call was from sue chopra she had tracked down my private terminal address despite the fact that i had changed it when i left baltimore and she wanted me to reply as soon as possible i should take this in private i told ashlee she walked me down the stairs and out to the car i took her hand it was late and the street was empty the streetlights were the oldfashioned mercury vapor kind and they put amber highlights in ashlees short blond hair her hand was warm if you find out something she said you have to tell me promise me that i promised call me scott i believe she genuinely wanted me to call her i believe she doubted that i would first of all sue said leaning into the lens so that her face filled the motel terminals phone window like a myopic brown moon i want you to know im not pissed about the way you left town i understand what that was all about and if you chose not to confide in me i guess i have myself to blame although i dont know why it is scotty you always expect the worst of people did it even occur to you we might want to help you know about kait i said we looked into the situation yeah you talked to the police i know youre going to do what you have to do but i want to make sure you dont feel like a fugitive she added more plaintively i would still like to talk to you once in a while as far as im concerned you still work here ray is a good foil for the math work and morris tries hard to understand what were doing but i need someone whos bright enough to pay attention but doesnt have any preconceived ideas she lowered her eyes and added or maybe thats just an excuse maybe i just need somebody to talk to this was among other things her way of apologizing for all the invasive prodding of the last few years but i had never blamed sue for that it might have been her ideas about tau turbulence that put me in a vulnerable position but she had been careful to build a wall between me and the federal juggernaut the juggernaut had lately turned its attention elsewhere sue still wanted to be my friend she said im so unhappy about what happened with kaitlin the only thing i can tell you about kait is that she hasnt come home yet id as soon not dwell on it so distract me gossip has ray found a girlfriend have you are you drinking scotty yes but not enough to justify the question she smiled sadly all right ray is still wandering in the wilderness me im seeing this woman i met at a bar shes very sweet she has red hair and collects dresden china and tropical fish but its not serious of course not sue conducted her love affairs almost at a distance deferentially and with the expectation of disappointment her real romance was with her work which was what she preferred to talk about the thing is scotty weve had a little bit of a breakthrough thats whats obsessing everybody right now most of this is classified but since there are rumors all over the net i can tell you at least a little bit about it she told me probably more than she should have but much of it went over my head the gist was that someone at mit had succeeded in conjuring negativetau particles out of the vacuum which is in any case a seething cauldron of what physicists call virtual particles and stabilizing them long enough to demonstrate the effect these were hadrons with essentially negative duration they carved holes if you like into the past about a millisecond of the past not kuins ponderous twenty years and three months but in principle it was the same phenomenon were very close sue said to understanding exactly what it is kuin is doing and even kuin might not have figured all the angles given enough time we can create whole new technologies i mean star travel scotty thats a real possibility does it matter of course it matters were talking about a potential new era in the history of the fucking species yes it matters kuin has already put his fingerprints on half the world sue i would hate to see him extend his reach beyond the surface of the planet well but this is the key to that too if we can figure out how a chronolith works we can interfere with it with the right application we might be able to make a chronolith simply go away and achieve what the last few days had pumped up my cynicism its a little late for that dont you think no she said i dont remember it isnt kuin we have to be afraid of its not even the chronoliths feedback scotty thats the key the real problem here is the perception of kuins invincibility which rests on the invincibility of his monuments destroy one and you destroy the myth suddenly hes not a godlike force anymore hes just another wouldbe hitler or stalin still i suggested it might be too late for that not if we can demonstrate his weakness can you she paused her smile faltered well maybe maybe soon she said but not soon enough for kait who was probably in mexico imbued with her own notions of kuins invincibility and promise i reminded sue that i had things to do she said im sorry if i kept you up scotty but i really do think its important for us to keep in touch because of course she had not abandoned her own fauxjungian idea that our futures were intertwined that kuin among other things had imposed on us a fate anyway thats the real reason i called she said i told somebody about your problem and he wants to help you not morris i said i like morris well enough but even morris will tell you hes not an experienced field agent no not morris although hed love to help no this is someone with a whole different kind of experience i should have seen it coming it was sue after all who had looked most deeply into my past particularly the time at chumphon but i was blindsided all the same maybe you remember him she said his name is hitch paley fourteen sometime during that week before hitch arrived before events began to tumble out of control ashlee said in the middle of a phone conversation you know the charles dickens story a christmas carol what about it i was thinking about kuin and the chronoliths and all that you know in dickens where scrooge goes into the future and sees his own funeral and he says to the ghost are these the shades of things that must be or things that may be or something like that right i said so the chronoliths scott are they must be or may be i told her no one was certain about that but if i understood sue correctly the events marked by the already existing chronoliths were mustbes in one form or another there was no bright alternative future in which we stopped kuin before his conquests and made the chronoliths into harmless freefloating paradoxes kuin would conquer chumphon thailand vietnam southeast asia time might be fluid but the monuments themselves were immutable and fundamental then why not despair i suppose sues answer would be that the battle wasnt finished much of the civilized world was still free of chronoliths which suggested that kuins conquests were a steplike process with gains and reversals there had not yet been a chronolith on north american soil maybe there never would be if we did the right thing whatever the right thing was sue had broached to me the idea of negative feedback if what kuin was doing with the chronoliths represented a kind of positive feedback a signal reinforced and amplified through time and human expectation then the solution might be the opposite a chronolith that appeared and was subsequently destroyed would cast doubt on the process the cancerous impression of kuins invincibility would be if not shattered at least weakened he might take half the earth but not our half that was sue chopras faith i hoped she was right i was prepared to act on that assumption in all honesty however i cannot say that i believed it well then here was hitch paley stepping out of a battered sony compact which by all rights should have been a motorbike into the motel parking lot we had agreed to meet at nine this morning he was fifteen minutes late in a sense ten years late he hadnt changed much i recognized him immediately even from a dozen yards away under the shade of the coffee shop awning i was delighted and i was afraid he wore a full beard and a dunggreen leather jacket he had put on a little weight which only served to emphasize his broad nose his high cheekbones the neanderthal slope of his skull he spotted me walked bandylegged across the sunny space between us and put out his huge right hand hey buddy he said you got that package i asked you to pick up i muttered something about the package he grinned and slapped me on the back and said im just shitting you scotty well talk about that later we went into the coffee shop and occupied a booth of course sue chopra had known about hitch all my efforts on his behalf to avoid implicating him during the polygraph interview for instance had been obvious and futile hitch was one of sues socalled primary observers and he must have figured in her connectthedots project from the very beginning hitch had been deep into the tau turbulence certainly as deep as i had been i had assumed hitch would also be unfindable but he had probably hung around chumphon a little longer than he might have had he understood just how closely witnesses were being scrutinized long enough for the fbi to target his internet signature or even plant a locator on him in any case they had found him they had found him and sue had offered him the alternative of prompt arrest or a job hitch had made the wise choice its not exactly an office job he said good pay travel no strings supposedly a clean criminal record at the end of it though the end is nowhere in sight first thing they did was send me around the pacific rim hunting rumors about kuin not that anything substantial came of it but i been busy scotty scouting touchdown sites in you know ankara istanbul doing little unofficial things here and there talking to kuinists lately talking to the homegrown kind copperheads and hajists youre a spy he gave me a sour look right im a spy i drink martinis and play a lot of baccarat but you know about the haj thing i know more about the haj thing than most people ive been inside it and i will do whatever i can to help you find kait i sat back in the booth wondering if this was what i wanted if this was wise you know hitch said when i think of kaitlin i still think of her at chumphon the way shed run down the tide line in that pink onepiece janice liked to dress her in leaving these footprints in the sand like little bitty bird footprints heelandtoe we should have taken better care of her scotty he said we to be friendly he was talking about me hitch did not reminisce much nor did he waste time he had already gotten the details of the situation from ramone dudley and i added what little i had personally learned while we stared at the coffee shop menus he said mexico is a good bet but we have to know more than we do before we come to any conclusions he suggested another talk with whit delahunt i agreed on the condition that we not alarm janice unduly and we should talk to ashlee mills too if shes home we could pick her up on the way to see whit not good hitch said to get too many people involved here ashlees as involved as i am shes been more helpful than the police actually you vouch for her scotty yes okay he looked at me critically you havent been eating or sleeping much it looks like it shows maybe you ought to try the steak and eggs im not hungry steak and eggs scotty for kaits sake lets say i didnt want the food but it looked good when the waitress delivered it i had surprisingly little trouble emptying the plate feel better hitch asked what i feel is the hardening of my arteries bullshit you need the protein we have some work ahead of us and not just today i heard myself say can we really get her back well get her back count on it ashlee did a double take when she saw hitch paley for the first time then shot me a look you have friends like this which was fair enough hitch still looked like a smalltime criminal he could have passed for a drug dealer à la cheever cox or maybe the kind of bulky individual who collects on bad debts i sketched out some of our past and repeated some of what hitch had told me ashlee nodded but clearly continued to suspect that hitch was something more than sue chopras ears on the underworld she took me aside and said can he help us find kait and adam thats all i really need to know i think he can then lets go see this whitman delahunt i drove the afternoon air was gently breezy the sky raked with high cloud hitch was silent in the car ashlee hummed a tune i recognized as an old lux ebone song something sad something from the time when songs still mattered when everyone knew the same songs this years popular songs all sounded like marching music to me drums and cymbals and trumpet notes drowning in their own echoes but i suppose every decade gets the music it deserves hitch had spotted the nicotine stains on ashlees fingers you can go ahead and smoke he said i dont give a fuck the house where whit and janice lived had not aged especially gracefully nor had the neighborhood it inhabited but both were still well above the national average people here could afford to have their trash hauled away even during the collectors strike the lawns were green here and there rustspeckled landscape robots crawled among the hedges like sluggish armadillos if you squinted a little it looked like the last ten years hadnt happened whitman answered the door and recoiled when he saw me he didnt like the looks of hitch or ashlee either his expression turned blank and he said janice is upstairs scott do you want me to call her we just want to ask you a couple of questions i said janice doesnt need to be involved he clearly didnt want to invite us in but he may also have been reluctant to discuss his copperhead politics in front of any passing neighbors we stepped into the cool shade of the house i introduced hitch and ashlee without being specific about why i had brought them when we were away from the door hitch took the initiative he said scotty told me about the club you belong to mr delahunt what we need now is a list of the other adult members i already gave that to the police yeah but we need it too you have no right to make such a demand no hitch said and youre not obliged to give it to us but it will help us find kaitlin i doubt that whit turned to me i could have talked to the police about you scott i wish i had its okay i said i talked to them myself youll be talking to them again if you persist in in what hitch interrupted trying to save your daughter from this mess she got herself into whit looked like he wanted to stamp his foot i dont even know you what do you have to do with kaitlin hitch smiled faintly she used to have a scar under her left knee where she fell on a broken bottle outside the haat thai does she still have that scar mr delahunt whit opened his mouth to answer but he was interrupted yes janices voice it came from the stairway she had been listening she came the rest of the way down regal in her grief its still there but its mostly faded hi hitch this time hitchs smile was genuine janice he said youre helping scott look for kaitlin he said he was thats good then whit would you give these people the information they want thats absurd they cant come here and make this kind of demand it sounded more like a request but they might help kait and thats what matters isnt it whit choked back a protest there was a ferocity hidden in janices voice an old and potent anger maybe hitch and ashlee didnt hear it but i did and so did whit it took a while but he gave us a mostlylegible handwritten list of names addresses terminal numbers just keep my name out of it he muttered hitch gave janice a big hug and janice returned it she had never much cared for hitch paley probably for good reason but the fact that he was here and searching for kait must have redeemed him in her eyes she took my hand as we were leaving and said thank you scott i mean it im sorry about what i said a few days ago dont be the police are still telling us kaits in town but shes not is she probably not god scott its just so she couldnt find a word for it she put her hand to her mouth be careful she said i mean find her but you be careful i promised her i would when we left the house hitch said does janice know shes married to an asshole shes beginning to suspect i said we went to ashlees for an evening meal and to plot strategy i helped ash in the kitchen while hitch used his pocket terminal to make a few calls ashlee put together a rice and chicken dish she called poverty pilaf cubing the raw chicken neatly with a cheap steel cleaver she asked me how long id been married to janice about five years i said we were both very young so youve been divorced a long time it doesnt seem so long sometimes she strikes me as a very together person together if not always very flexible this has been hard on her shes pretty lucky living the life she does she ought to appreciate that i dont think she feels very lucky right now no i didnt mean i understand ashlee putting my fucking foot in it again she brushed her hair out of her eyes can i chop those carrots for you she seasoned the pilaf meticulously and sensibly we rejoined hitch while it baked hitch had rested his big booted feet on ashlees coffee table heres what we have he said this is from whitman and a couple of other sources including the cop ramone dudley whits bullshit copperhead club has twentyeight regular duespaying members and ten of them are upper management from the company he works at so maybe hes right about joining for career reasons twentyeight adults of whom eighteen are single or childless couples ten members have kids of various ages but only nine actually introduced their offspring to the youth group including a pair of sibs thats ten kids plus six outsiders like adam who applied independently but there was a core group of eight who were deeply involved including kait and adam theyre the ones who disappeared okay i said so lets assume they left town they would have been too conspicuous on a plane or a bus given that theyre traveling together i doubt the suburban contingent would have agreed to hitchhike considering the number of fuckedup adults already on the road so that leaves private transportation and probably something fairly big you can stuff eight people into a landau but not without attracting attention and making everybody grouchy this is pretty conjectural i said okay but follow me for a minute if theyre driving what are they driving ashlee said some of these kids must own cars right and ramone dudley looked into that four of the eight do have vehicles registered to their names but the vehicles are all accounted for none of the parents reported a stolen car and in fact pretty much every auto theft in the city during the time these kids took off was either clearly professional or a joyride that ended with the vehicle trashed or burned stealing a car isnt as easy as it used to be even if you get past the personalized locks every car assembled or imported in the last ten years routinely broadcasts its serial number and gps coordinates mostly people use it to find their car in a parking lot but it also complicates auto theft considerably a modern car thief is a technician with a lot of different cracking skills not a kid out of high school so they didnt use one of their own cars and they didnt steal one ashlee said great that leaves nothing maybe they are still in town thats what ramone dudley thinks but it doesnt make any sense these kids are pretty obviously on a haj so i asked dudley to check the four cars they own a second time so he did ah he found something nope nothings changed three of the vehicles are still exactly where theyve been parked for the last week only ones been moved at all and only for round trips to the local grocery pickup not more than twenty miles on the odometer since the disappearance the kid left a set of keys with his mom so were no farther ahead except for one thing this mom whos driving her kids car to the store on whits list shes eleanor helvig member in good standing of the copperhead club along with her husband jeffrey jeffrey is a junior vp at clarion pharmaceuticals a couple of levels above whit jeffs making pretty good money these days and there are three vehicles registered to the family his his wifes and his kids nice cars too a couple of daimlers and a secondhand edison for jeff jr so so why is the wife driving the edison for groceries when her daimlers a big utility vehicle with lots of room in the back ashlee said could be all kinds of reasons could be but i think we should ask her dont you dinner was excellent i told ashlee so but we couldnt stay to savor it ashlee elected to stay home while hitch and i did the leg work on the condition that we would call her as soon as we learned anything in the car i said about that package right the package forget about it scotty im not going to forget an old debt you fronted me the cash to leave thailand all i owed you was a favor and it didnt happen yeah but you tried right i went to the place you told me about easys hitch was grinning now the kind of grin that used to make me deeply uncomfortable and was having that effect again i said i went to easys but you mentioned my name to the guy there yeah old guy grayhaired kinda tall coffeecolored sounds like the man but there was no package hitch what he told you that uhhuh did he tell you that in a gentle way far from it got a little irritated did he practically reached for a gun hitch was nodding good good good so the package was late or what no scotty there never was any package the one you told me to pick up for you no such object sorry i said but the money you gave me mainly no offense but i thought youd be safer back in minneapolis i mean there you were stuck on the beach janice and kaitlin gone and you were starting to drink pretty heavy and chumphon wasnt a good place to be a drunk american especially with all the press guys getting rolled on a regular basis so i took pity on you i gave you the money i had it to spare business was good but i didnt think youd take it as a gift and i didnt want to call it a loan because i didnt want you trying to find me and pay it back like a good scout which admit it you would have so i made up this package thing you made it up im sorry scotty i guess you thought you were a drag mule or something but that kinda appealed to my sense of humor too knowing your whole collegeeducated cleancut image of yourself i mean i thought a little moral dilemma might put some variety into your life no i said this is bullshit the guy at easys recognized your name and you just described him to me i was driving into the sunset and the lights on the dash were just starting to brighten the air coming in the window was cool and relatively sweet hitch took his time answering then he said let me tell you a little story scotty when i was a kid i lived in roxbury with my mom and my little sister we were poor but that was back when the relief money was enough to get you by if you were careful about things it wasnt especially bad for me or at least i didnt know any better than to be happy with what i had plus maybe a little shoplifting on the side but my mom was a lonely woman and when i was sixteen she married this tough old piece of shit named easy g tobin easy ran a mail pickup and sold coke and meth out the back door i will say for easy that he never actually hit her or me or my sister either he wasnt a monster he kept his drug business away from the house too but he was mean he talked mean he was smart enough that he never had to raise his voice he could cut you down with just a few words because he had the talent for knowing what you hated about yourself he did that to me and he did that to my sister but we were the minor leagues mainly he did it to my mom and by the time i was ready to leave home a couple years later i had seen more of her tears than i cared to she wanted to get rid of him but she didnt know how and easy had a couple of other ladies on the side so me and a few of my friends we followed easy to one of his ladyfriends houses and we went in there and punished him a little bit we didnt you know beat him senseless but we made him scared and we kicked him around some and we told him to get his ass out of my moms house or wed do worse than that he said that was okay with him he was sick of me and my sister and he had used up my mom his words and he meant to leave anyhow and i said that was fine as long he did it and i would be keeping my eye on him he said ill forget your name in a week you little shit and i said hed hear from me now and then and hed better not forget my name because i wouldnt forget his well we left it at that but i made it a point for some years to see that he did come across my name at least now and then every once in a while a card a phone call like a negative hallmark moment just to keep him on his toes i guess he remembered me huh scotty i said he could have killed me yeah but i didnt think it was likely besides that was a fair piece of change i gave you i figured you understood it might entail a little bit of risk god damn i said faintly and see this way you dont have to thank me we were lucky enough to find mrs jeffrey helvig home alone she came to the door in casual clothes wary as soon as she saw us in the porch light we told her it was about her son jeff jr she told us she had already talked to the police and we certainly didnt look like police to her so who were we and what did we really want i showed her enough id to establish that i was kaitlins father she knew janice and whit though not very well and had met kait on more than one occasion when i made it clear that i wanted to talk about kaitlin she relented and asked us in though she was clearly not happy about it the house was meticulously clean eleanor helvig was fond of cork coasters and lace antimacassars a dust precipitator hummed in one corner of the living room she stood conspicuously next to the home security panel where a touch of her finger would narrowcast an alarm and a camera view to the local police we were probably already being recorded she was not afraid of us i thought but she was deeply wary she said i know what youre going through mr warden im going through it myself you understand if im not anxious to talk about jeffs disappearance yet again she was defending herself against some accusation not yet made i thought about that her husband was a copperhead a true believer according to whit she had accompanied him to most but not all of the meetings she would probably echo his opinions but she might not be deeply or genuinely convinced of them i hoped not i said would it surprise you mrs helvig if i told you it looks like your son and his friends are on a haj she blinked it would offend me certainly using that word in that way is an insult to the muslim faith not to mention a great many sincere young people sincere young people like jeff i hope jeff is sincere but i wont accept a facile explanation of whats happened to him i should tell you honestly that im skeptical of absentee fathers who rediscover their children in times of crisis but thats the kind of society we live in isnt it people who think of parenthood as a genetic merger not a sacred bond hitch said you think kuin will make that better she stared back at him defiantly i believe he could hardly make it worse do you know what a haj is mrs helvig i told you i dont like that word but a lot of people use it including a lot of idealistic children ive seen a few youre right its a rough world we live in and its hard on the children in particular ive seen them ive seen haj kids butchered by the side of the road children mrs helvig raped and killed theyre young and they may be idealistic but theyre also very naive about what it takes to survive outside of suburban minneapolis eleanor helvig blanched i believe i did too she said to hitch who are you a friend of kaitlin did you ever meet kait mrs helvig she came by the house once or twice i think im sure your jeff is a strong young man but what about kaitlin how do you think shell do out there mrs helvig i dont out there on the road i mean with all the homeless men and soldiers because if these kids did go off on a haj theyd be safer in a car even jeff jeff can take care of himself eleanor helvig whispered you wouldnt want him hitchhiking would you of course not wheres your husbands car mrs helvig he took it to work hes not home yet but and jeffs car in the garage and yours she hesitated just long enough to confirm hitchs suspicions in for repairs at what garage exactly she didnt answer we dont have to discuss this hitch said with the police hes safer in the car you said so yourself she was whispering now im sure youre right jeff jr didnt talk about the pilgrimage but when he asked for the car i guess i should have suspected his father said we ought not to tell the police it would only make jeff a criminal or us for abetting him hell be back though i know he will you could help us hitch began you see how upsidedown everything is can you blame the children give us your license and the cars gps signature we wont bring the police into it she reached absently for her purse then hesitated if you do find them will you be nice to jeff we promised we would hitch talked to morris torrance who traced the car to el paso the gps package was sitting in a local recyclers yard the rest of the car was missing probably sold or bartered for safe passage across the border theyre bound for portillo hitch said almost certainly so we go there i said he nodded morris is arranging the flight we need to leave as soon as possible i thought about that its not just a rumor is it portillo i mean the chronolith no he said flatly its not just a rumor we need to be there soon fifteen at the exit into portillo we were turned away by soldiers who told us the town was already uninhabitable full of americans squatting like dogs on the street a disgrace as if to confirm this they waved through a convoy of red cross relief trucks while we waited hitch didnt argue with the soldiers but drove a couple of miles farther south along the cracked and potholed highway he said there was another way into portillo not much more than a goat track but passable enough in the battered van we had rented at the airport the back roads are safer anyway he said long as we dont stop hitch had always preferred back roads why here ashlee wondered looking out the window into a blank sonoran landscape agaves and yellow scrub grass and the occasional struggling cattle ranch the kuin recession had been hard on mexico rolling back the gains of the gonsalvez administration and restoring the venerable and corrupt partido revolucionario institucional to power rural poverty had reached premillennial levels mexico city was simultaneously the most densely populated city on the continent and the most polluted and crimeridden portillo contrarily was a minor town without any known strategic or military significance one more dusty village drained of prosperity and left to die there are more chronoliths outside urban centers than in them i told ashlee touchdown points seem almost random excepting the largescale markers like bangkok or jerusalem nobody knows why maybe its easier to build a chronolith out where theres some free space or maybe the smaller monuments are erected before the cities fall to the kuinists we had a cooler full of bottled water and a couple of boxes of camp food more than enough to last us sue chopra back in baltimore was still correlating data from her unofficial network of informants and from the latest generation of surveillance satellites the news about portillo hadnt been made public officials feared it would only attract more pilgrims but internet rumors had done that quite efficiently despite the official veil of silence we had food and water for five days at least which was more than enough because according to sues best estimate we were less than fifty hours away from touchdown the goat track was a rut through rocky chaparral crowned by the endless turquoise sky we were still a dozen miles outside of town when we saw the first corpse ashlee insisted on stopping though it was obvious there was nothing we could do she wanted to be sure the body she said was about adams size but this young man dressed in a dirty white hemp shirt and yellow kevlar pants had been dead quite a while his shoes had been stolen plus his watch and terminal and surely his wallet though we didnt check his skull had been fractured by some blunt instrument the body was swollen with decomposition and had evidently attracted a number of predators though only the ants were currently visible commuting lazily up his sundried right arm most likely well see more of this kind of thing hitch said looking from the corpse to the horizon there are more thieves than flies in this part of the country at least since the pri canceled the last election a couple thousand obviously gullible americans in one place is a magnet for every homicidal asshole south of juarez and theyre way too hungry to be scrupulous i suppose he could have said this more gently but what would be the point the evidence lay on the sandy margin of the road stinking i looked at ashlee ashlee regarded the dead young american her face was pale and her eyes glittered with dismay ashlee had argued that she ought to come with us and in the end i had agreed i might be able to rescue kaitlin from this debacle but i had no leverage with adam mills even if i could find him ashlee said i wouldnt be able to argue him out of the haj maybe no one could including herself but she needed to try of course it was dangerous brutally dangerous but ashlee was determined enough to attempt the trip with or without us and i understood the way she felt sometimes the conscience makes demands that are nonnegotiable courage has nothing to do with it we werent here because we were brave we were here because we had to be here but the dead american was a demonstration of every truth we would have preferred to evade the truth that our children had come to a place where things like this happened that it might as easily have been adam or kaitlin discarded by the side of the road that not every child in jeopardy can be saved hitch climbed behind the wheel of the van i sat in the back with ash she put her head against my shoulder showing fatigue for the first time since wed left the united states there was more evidence that we werent the only americans to have taken this route into portillo we passed a sedan that had ridden up an embankment and broken an axle and been abandoned in place a rusteaten edison with oregon plates scooted recklessly around us billowing clouds of alkaline dust into the afternoon air and then at last we topped a rise and the village of portillo lay before us dome tents clustered on the access roads like insect eggs the main road through portillo was lined with adobe garages trash heaps generated by the haj poverty housing and a nearly impassable maze of american cars the town itself at least from this distance was a smudge of colonial architecture bookended by a couple of franchise motels and service stations all of it belonged now by default to the kuinists haj youth of all kinds had gathered here most with inadequate supplies and survival skills the towns permanent residents had largely abandoned their homes and left for the city hitch said those who remained were the infirm or the elderly thieves or watersellers opportunists or overwhelmed members of the local constabulary there was very little food outside of the supply tents set up by international relief agencies the army blockade was turning away vendors hoping hunger would disperse the pilgrimage ashlee gazed at this dustbleached mecca with obvious despair even if theyre here she said how do we find them you let me do some leg work hitch said thats how but first we have to get a little closer we drove across rocky soil to a stretch of cracked tarmac the stench of the haj came through the windows with the subtlety of a clenched fist and ashlee lit a cigarette mostly to cover the smell hitch parked us behind a fireblackened adobe shack roughly half a mile out of town the van was hidden from the main road by a stand of dry jacarandas and stacks of excrementencrusted chicken coops hitch had bought weapons after we crossed the border and he insisted on showing ashlee and me how to use them not that we resisted i had never discharged a weapon in my life i had grown up in a gunshy decade and had learned a civilized loathing of handguns but hitch left me a pistol with a full clip and made sure i knew how to disengage the safety mechanism and hold the weapon so that i wouldnt break my wrist if i fired it the idea was that ashlee and i would stay with the van guarding our food water and transportation while hitch went into portillo to locate adams haj group and broker a meeting ashlee wanted to head directly into town and i understood the need but hitch was adamant the van was our major asset and needed protection we would be useless to kaitlin or adam without the vehicle hitch took a weapon of his own and walked toward town i watched him vanish into the dusk then i locked the vans doors and joined ashlee in the front seat where she had fixed us a meal of trail bars and apples and tepid instant coffee from a thermos we ate silently while the light drained from the sky stars came out bright and sharp even through the smoke haze and the dusty windshield ashlee put her head against me neither of us had bathed since we entered the country and that fact was conspicuously obvious but it didnt matter the warmth mattered the contact mattered i said well need to sleep in shifts you think its that dangerous here yes i do i dont believe i can sleep but she was fighting a yawn as she said it crawl into the back i said cover up with the blanket and close your eyes for a while she nodded and stretched out on one of the rear benches i sat at the wheel with the pistol next to me feeling lonely and futile and foolish as the days heat leached away it was possible even at this distance to hear the night sounds of portillo it was one sound really a white rush of noise compounded of human voices reproduced music crackling fires laughter screams it occurred to me that this was the millenarian madness we had escaped at the turn of the century hundreds of hajists cashing in on the moral carte blanche of a guaranteed endoftheworld redeemer or destroyer kuin owned tomorrow and the day after tomorrow all the tomorrows at least in the minds of the hajists and at least on this occasion they wouldnt be disappointed the chronolith would arrive as predicted kuin would put his mark on north american soil probably a great number of these same hajists would be killed by the cold shock or the concussion but if they knew that and in all likelihood they did they didnt care it was a lottery after all great prizes grave risks kuin would reward the faithful or at least the survivors among them i couldnt help wondering how much of this madness kait had bought into kaitlin was imaginative and she had been a solitary child imaginative and naive not a good combination not in this world did kait genuinely believe in kuin in some version of kuin she had conjured out of her own longing and insecurity or was this all just an adventure a melodramatic lunge out of the cloistered household of whitman delahunt the fact was she might not be glad to see me but i would take her out of this nightmarish place if i had to do it by main force i couldnt make kaitlin love me but i could save her life and that for now would be enough the night dragged the roar of portillo ebbed and rose in an elusive stochastic rhythm like waves on a beach there was a cricket in the wild sage east of the van adding his own distinct voice to the cacophony i drank more of ashlees coffee and left the van briefly to relieve myself stepping around a rusted axle and drivetrain that lurked in the high weeds like an animal trap ashlee stirred and muttered in her sleep when i closed the door again there was a little traffic on the road mainly hajists joyriding hooting from the windows of their cars nobody spotted us nobody stopped i was beginning to doze in place when ashlee tapped me on the shoulder the dash clock said my turn she said i didnt argue i showed her where id left the pistol and i stretched out on the back bench the blanket was warm with her body heat i slept as soon as i closed my eyes scott she shook me gently but urgently scott i sat up to find ashlee leaning over the drivers seat rocking my shoulder with her hand she whispered there are people outside listen she turned forward and slumped down keeping her head out of sight the darkness was not absolute a half moon had risen there was for a long moment utter silence then not very far away a womans terrified moan followed by stifled laughter i said ashlee they came by a minute ago a car on the road they pulled up and stopped and there was a little uh yelling and then i couldnt really see this until i turned the side mirror and even then the tree was in the way but it looked like somebody fell out of the car and ran into the field i think a woman and two guys ran out after her i thought about this what time is it just four give me the pistol ash she seemed reluctant to hand it over what should we do what well do is ill take the pistol and get out of the van when i signal you turn on the high beams and start the engine ill try to stay in sight what if something happens to you then you pull out of here fast as you can if something happens to me that means theyve got the gun dont hang around ash all right so where would i go it was a reasonable question into portillo back toward the relief camps the roadblock i wasnt sure what to tell her but then the woman outside screamed again and i couldnt help thinking that it might be kaitlin out there it didnt sound like kaitlins voice but i hadnt heard kait scream since she was a toddler i told ashlee id be careful but if anything happened the important thing was for her to get away maybe hide the van closer to town and keep an eye out for hitch come morning i left the vehicle and eased the door shut behind me when i was a few feet away i signaled for her to hit the lights the vans high beams sprang out of the starry night like military searchlights and in the stillness the engine roared like some throaty wild animal the woman and her two assailants froze in the glare not more than ten yards distant all three were young possibly adams age the men were engaged in an act of forcible intercourse the woman was on her back in the weeds one man pinning her shoulders while the other parted her legs she had turned her face away from the light while the men had raised their heads like prairie dogs sensing a predator they seemed not to be armed which made me feel a little giddy with the weight of the pistol in my hand i raised the weapon toward their dumbfounded faces i would have ordered them to get away from her that was the plan but i was nervous and my finger twitched on the trigger and the pistol went off unexpectedly i nearly dropped it i dont know where the bullet went it didnt hit anyone but it scared them very effectively i was still halfblind from the muzzle flash but i tracked the wouldbe rapists as they ran for their car i wondered if i should fire again but i was afraid that might happen whether i wanted it to or not hitch told me later the gun had been modified for low trigger resistance and had probably been used for criminal purposes before we got hold of it the two men leaped into their automobile with a startling economy of motion if there had been weapons in the car i might have been in trouble that occurred to me belatedly but if they had them they didnt use them the car came alive and roared off toward town spraying gravel against the stacked chicken coops which left only the girl i turned back to her remembering to keep the muzzle of the gun toward the ground this time my right wrist still ached with the shock of the unexpected recoil the girl had stood up in the blaze of the headlights and was already buttoning a pair of torn levis she looked at me with an expression i could not quite fathom mostly fear i think partly shame she was young her face was smudged and tearstained she was so thin she looked almost anorexic and there was a long clotting scratch across her left breast i cleared my throat and said theyre gone youre safe now maybe she didnt speak english more likely she didnt believe me she turned and ran into the high weeds parallel to the road exactly like a frightened animal i took a few steps but didnt follow her the night was too dark and i didnt want to leave ashlee alone i hoped the girl would be safe unlikely as that seemed sleep after that was out of the question i joined ashlee up front and we sat together vigilant and pumped with adrenaline ash put a cigarette between her lips and ignited the tip with a tiny propane lighter we didnt talk about the assault we had both witnessed but a short time later when the eastern sky began to show a faint blue ashlee said this you have to not ask her kaitlin i mean ask her what but it was a stupid question probably you dont need this advice its not like im a model parent or anything but when you get kaitlin back dont interrogate her maybe shell talk to you or maybe she wont but let her make that decision for herself i said if she needs help if she needs help shell ask for it i left that alone i didnt want to speculate about what might or might not have happened to kait ashlee had said what she meant to say and she turned back to the window leaving me to wonder what had prompted her advice what she herself might once have endured and refused to confess we dozed while the sun began to make the world warm hitch tapped on the window glass a little later startling us out of sleep ashlee reached for the pistol but i caught her wrist i rolled the window down impressive guarding hitch said i could have killed both of you did you find them kaitlins there adam too you want to feed me we have a good deal of work ahead of us sixteen we entered the village of portillo slowly crawling the van through foot traffic down a single lane between parked or abandoned hajist vehicles by morning light the main road was as crowded as a carnival midway and resembled one though the crowds were subdued in the aftermath of the night pilgrims walked dazedly and aimlessly or slept on bedrolls under the towns tattered awnings safer in the daylight than in the dark watersellers trawled the crowd with plastic gallon jugs slung over their shoulders kuinist flags and symbols had been draped from the upper windows of buildings local sanitary facilities had been overwhelmed and the smell of the trench latrines was pervasive and awful most of these people had arrived within the last three days but there were already cases of dysentery hitch said showing up at the relief tents adam and company were camped west of the main drag during the night hitch had spoken briefly to adam and not at all to kait though he had confirmed her presence adam had agreed to speak to ashlee but had been reluctant to grant permission for kait to see me adam was clearly in charge and speaking on behalf of the others this information made ashlee hang her head and mutter to herself also present at least on the outskirts of portillo were members of the press riding bulletresistant uplinked recording trucks with polarized windows i had mixed feelings about that in sues interpretation of the chronoliths and their metacausality the press acted as an important amplifier in the feedback loop it was precisely the globally broadcast image of these objects that served to burn the impression of kuins invincibility into the collective imagination but what was the alternative repression denial that was the genius of kuins monuments they were grotesquely obvious impossible to ignore we get there hitch said you let me do a little talking then well see what happens not much of a plan i said as much of a plan as weve got we parked the van as close as possible to the cluster of tents where adam and his friends had camped alongside dozens of others the tents were almost ridiculously gaudy in this dry place blue and red and yellow nylon mushrooming out of the packed earth of a masonry yard parking lot ashlee began to crane her head anxiously looking for adam of kaitlin there was no sign stay here hitch said ill negotiate us in negotiate ash asked faintly indignant hitch gave her a cautionary look and closed the door behind him he walked a few paces to an octagonal shelter of photosensitive silver mylar and called out something inaudible within moments the flap opened and adam mills stepped out i knew it was adam by the sound of ashlees indrawn breath he was dressed in dustcaked khakis but seemed essentially healthy he was skinny but tall almost as tall as hitch a black backpack looped over his shoulders he didnt even glance at the van just waited for hitch to speak his piece i couldnt see his face in any great detail at this distance but he was evidently relaxed not frightened ashlee reached for the door but i pulled her hand away give it a minute hitch talked adam talked finally hitch pulled a roll of bills out of his back pocket and counted them into adams palm ashlee said whats that a bribe hes bribing adam i said it looked that way for what for you to see kait me to see him i dont know ash god thats so she lacked a word for her contempt its strange times i said strange things happen she slumped back in her seat humiliated and was silent until hitch beckoned us out i set the vans security protocols unlikely as that was to afford us any real protection outside the air was dry and the stench was overwhelming a few yards away a young man in oncewhite trousers was shoveling loose earth into a ditch latrine ashlee approached adam tentatively i dont know but i suspect that she was reluctant to face him now that the longedfor moment had finally arrived reluctant to face the futility of the meeting the fact of his resistance she put her hand on his shoulder and looked into his eyes adam gazed back impassively he was young but he wasnt a child he gave no ground only waited for ashlee to speak which i suppose was what he had been paid to do the two of them walked a few paces away down a trail between the tents hitch said to me its a fucking lost cause she just doesnt know it what about kait he gestured at a small sunyellow tent i found myself thinking of the cairo arrival of three years ago sue chopra had obtained video recordings of the event from a dozen different angles in all its phases the calm before the manifestation the cold shock and the thermal winds a column of ice and dust boiling into a dry blue sky and finally the chronolith itself glaringly bright embedded in the sprawl of suburban cairo like a sword driven into a rock and who will pull this sword from the stone the pure of heart perhaps absent parents and failed husbands need not apply i suppose it was the incongruity i had found so striking about cairo the tremulous waves of desert heat the ice the layers of mismatched history office towers erected over the rubble of a thousandyear autarchy and this newest of monuments kuin ponderous and remote as a pharaoh on his frigid throne i dont know why the image came to me so vividly perhaps because this dry sonoran village was about to receive its own throne of ice and maybe there was already the faintest chill in the air a shiver of premonition the bitter smell of the future kaitlin i said a vagrant wind lifted the flap of the tent i squatted and put my head inside kait was alone uncurling from a nest of dirty blankets she blinked in the yellow nimbus of sun through nylon her face was thin her eyes were banded with fatigue she looked older than i remembered her and i told myself that was because of what she must have endured on this haj the hunger and the anxiety but the fact was that she had slipped away from me grown out of my mental image of her well before she left minneapolis she looked at me a long time her expression evolving through incredulity suspicion gratitude relief guilt she said daddy it was all i could manage just to say her name which was probably for the best it was all i needed to say she came out of the blankets and into my arms i saw the bruises on her wrists the deep cut that ran from her shoulder almost to her elbow in a track of clotted brown blood but i did not ask her about these things and i understood the wisdom of ashlees advice i couldnt unwound her i could only hold her im here to take you home i said she wouldnt meet my eyes but she said almost inaudibly thank you another breeze kicked up the flap of the tent and kaitlin shivered i told her to get dressed quick as she could she pulled on a pair of ragged denims and a cheap serape and i shivered myself and it occurred to me that the air was a little too cold for this sunhammered morning unnaturally cold outside hitch was calling my name get her into the van he told me and you best be quick about it this wasnt part of the deal i bargained for you to talk not to take her away he turned his face into the wind i get the feeling things are happening a little faster than we planned kaitlin tumbled onto one of the vans back benches and wrapped a loose blanket around herself i told her to keep her head down just a little while hitch locked the door and went to corral ashlee kait sniffled and not just because she was close to tears she had caught something she said a flu or possibly one of the intestinal diseases that were circulating through portillo as the crowds grew thirstier and the water sellers less scrupulous her eyes were filmed and a little vague she coughed into her fist outside tents and canvas shelters clapped in the stiffening wind hajists began to crawl out evicted by the noisy weather dozens of bewildered pilgrims in kuinist gear and torn clothing shading their eyes and wondering beginning to wonder whether this gale might mark the beginning of a sacred event a chronolith announcing itself in the dropping temperature and the peaking breeze and maybe it was the kuin of jerusalem had appeared more decisively than this and with less warning but it was a fact that chronolith arrivals varied from place to place and time to time in their intensity duration and destructiveness sue chopras calculations were based on somewhat problematic satellite data and could have been skewed by several hours or more in other words we might be in mortal danger a gust rocked the van and provoked kaitlins attention she pressed her face against the side window gaped at scalloped clouds of sonoran dust suddenly billowing inward from the desert daddy is this i said i dont know i looked for ash but she was hidden by the increasingly anxious crowd of hajists i wondered how far west of central portillo we were but that was impossible to estimate a mile say at best and there was no telling precisely where the chronolith would appear no way of calculating the perimeter of the danger zone i told kait to stay under the blanket the crowd began to move then almost as if the hajists had reached an unspoken consensus out of this dirtpack lot toward the connecting streets toward town i caught sight of hitchs coiled black beard then hitch himself and ashlee and adam hitch appeared to be arguing with ashlee and ash was arguing with her son her hands on adams arms as if she were begging him adam stood resolutely still enduring the embrace while the wind whipped his blond hair in front of his eyes if the haj had been hard on him he didnt show it he looked impassively from his mothers face to the darkening sky he retrieved what looked like a rolled thermal jacket from his backpack i dont know what ashlee said to adam she has never discussed this with me but it was obvious even at this distance that adam wouldnt be coming back with us a lifetime of frustration was written into the body language of that encounter what ashlee couldnt admit tugging at her son pleading with him was that adam simply didnt care what she wanted that he hadnt cared for a long time that he might have been born unable to care she was simply a distraction from the deeply interesting event that had apparently begun the physical manifestation of kuin of the idea or the mythology in which he had invested all his loyalty now hitch was pulling at ashlee trying to bring her back to the van his face screwed up against the abrasive wind but his gestures nearly frantic ashlee ignored him as long she could until adam broke away from her and only hitchs support kept her from falling to her knees she looked up at her son and said one more thing i think it was his name just as i had called kaitlins name im not sure since the roar of the wind and the noise of the crowd had grown much louder very quickly but i believe it was ashlees keening of her sons name that cut through the thickening air i got behind the wheel of the van kaitlin moaned into her blanket hitch dragged ashlee to the vehicle and pushed her inside then climbed into the shotgun seat i found i had already started the engine just fucking drive hitch said but it was almost impossible to make rapid progress against the tide of hajists if adam had camped any closer to portillo we would have been locked in as it was we were able to crawl toward the margin of the road and make slow but steady progress westward the press of pilgrims thinning as we retreated but the sky had grown very dark and it was cold now and dust scored the windshield and cut visibility to a few feet i had no idea where this road might lead this wasnt the direction we had come i asked hitch but he said he didnt know the map was stashed in back somewhere and anyway it didnt matter our options had come down to one the duststorm glazed the windshield into opacity and was by the sound of it also fouling the engine i closed the windows and cranked up the vehicles heater until we were all sweating our dirt track deadended at a wooden bridge over a shallow dry creek bed the bridge was splintered rocking in the intensifying wind and would clearly not support the weight of the van hitch said drive down that embankment scotty at least put a little dirt between us and portillo pretty steep grade you have a better idea so i turned off the road drove over brittle scrub grasses and down the berm the van braked itself sporadically and the dash lit up with function alarms and i believe we would have overbalanced if not for my iron grip on the steering wheel which was a matter of instinct not skill hitch and ashlee were silent but kaitlin let out a little sound about the same pitch as the wind we had just reached the flat and stony basin when an uprooted acacia flew overhead like a stiff black bird even hitch gasped when he saw that cold kaitlin moaned ashlee unfolded the last of the blankets gave two of them to kait and tossed one up to us the air inside reeked of hot heater coils but the temperature had risen only marginally i had seen the thermal shock in jerusalem from a distance but i hadnt guessed just how painful it would be a sudden numbing cold that radiated inward from the extremities to the heart stolen energy drained from the immediate environment by whatever force it was that could unwind a massive object through time a fresh wind howled above the arroyo and the sky turned the color of fish scales we had packed thermallyadaptive body gear and we broke this out ashlee helped kait into a jacket a size too big for her a dire thought occurred to me and i reached for the handle of the door scotty hitch inquired i need to drain the radiator i said if that water freezes we lose our transportation we had been wise enough to carry our drinking water in flexible bags which would expand as necessary we had also dumped antifreeze into the vans radiator but we hadnt anticipated being this close to the arrival a serious flashfreeze would probably demolish the engines coolant system and strand us here may not be time so wish me luck and hand me the tool box i let myself out into the gale wind slammed the door behind me the wind came up the arroyo from the south feeding the steep thermoclines of the arriving chronolith the air was choked with dust and sand i had to shield my eyes with my hand in order to open them even a slit i navigated to the front of the van by touch the vehicle had come down at a steep angle into a sandy ridge and the front of it was entrenched up to the bumper there was a burst of auroral light overhead as i scooped out a space with my hands the thermal jacket was keeping my core temperature up at least so far but my breath turned to frost with every exhalation and my fingers were clumsy and fierynumb too late to go back for gloves i managed to open the tool box and fumble out a wrench the radiator system was designed to be drained from beneath by loosening a valve nut i clasped the nut with the wrench but it refused to turn leverage i thought bracing my feet against the tire leaning into the angle of the wrench like a sculler leaning into an oar the noise of the wind was overpowering but under it there was another sound the thunderclap of the arrival then the shockwave through the ground a hard mulekick from below the valve nut popped and i sprawled into the sand a trickle of water ran out and instantly froze against the ground enough to relieve the pressure inside the radiator though stray ice could still crack any number of vital systems if we were unlucky i tried to stand and found that i couldnt instead i rolled into the meager shelter created by the angle of the van against the earth my head was suddenly too heavy to hold erect and i put my numbed hands between my thighs and curled into the meager warmth of my thermal jacket and promptly lost consciousness when i opened my eyes again the air was still and i was back inside the van sunlight burned on the scrim of ice that had formed on the windshield the heater was pumping out steamy warm air i sat up shivering ashlee was already awake chafing kaitlins hands between her own and that sight worried me but ashlee said at once shes all right shes breathing hitch paley had dragged me inside after the worst of the thermal shock had passed currently he was outside replacing the valve nut i had loosened he stood peered in through the fogged window and gave me a thumbsup when he saw that i was awake i think well be okay ashlee said her voice was raw and i realized that my own throat was sore when i swallowed no doubt from the briefly supercooled air we had all inhaled lungs a little achy too and fingers and toes still bereft at their tips of sensation some crusted blood on the palm of my right hand where the freezing wrench had taken away a layer of skin but ashlee was right we had survived kait moaned again well keep her covered up ash said but shes already sick scott we need to worry about pneumonia we need to get her back to civilization and up that embankment again to begin with not a sure thing when i felt able i opened the driversside door and climbed out the air was relatively warm again and surprisingly fresh save for a haze of dust that was settling everywhere like fine snow prevailing winds had carried the ice fog off to the east frost steamed off the rocks and sand of the creek bed i climbed to the top of the embankment and looked back at the town what remained of it the kuin of portillo was still shrouded in ice but it was clearly a large monument the figure of kuin was standing one arm upraised in a beckoning gesture the town of portillo lay at his immense feet dim in the mist but obviously devastated the radius of the thermal shock was enormous all but a few of the hajists must have died it seemed to me though i did see some vehicles moving at the perimeter of the town probably red cross mobile stations ashlee came up the slope behind me panting her breath halted briefly when she saw the scope of the destruction her lips trembled her face was brown with dust rivered with tears but he might have got away she whispered meaning of course adam i said that was possible privately i doubted it seventeen by means of a connecting series of dirt roads and cattle tracks we managed to skirt the steaming ruins of portillo and connect at last with the main road the dead no doubt massive numbers of them remained in town but we passed clusters of refugees along the highway many were limping crippled by frostbite some had been blinded by ice crystals some had sustained injuries from falling masonry or other shockwave events all sense of threat had vanished from them and ashlee twice insisted on stopping to distribute our few blankets and a little food and to ask about adam but none of these young people had heard of him and they had more pressing concerns they begged us to relay messages call parents or spouses or family in la in dallas in seattle the parade of misery was overwhelming and at length even ashlee had to turn away from it though she continued to scan the refugees for any sign of adam until we were farther north than even a healthy hajist could had walked the sight of relief trucks and military ambulances streaming toward portillo eased her conscience but not her fears she lapsed into her seat stirring only to tend to kaitlin now and then my fears for kait deepened during the drive she was sicker than i had realized and her exposure to the thermal shock had made matters worse ashlee took kaits temperature with the thermometer from the firstaid kit then frowned and fed her a couple of antipyretic capsules and a long drink of water we were forced to stop several times for kaitlin to lope away from the van and relieve her bowels and each time she stumbled back she was visibly weaker and unspeakably humiliated we needed to get her into a reputable hospital hitch placed a call to sue chopra and reassured her that we had survived though kait was ill sue recommended crossing the border if possible before admitting kait for medical care since young americans incountry without papers were currently being jailed the nogales border crossing was swamped there had been a rumor this one false of an impending arrival in that city but sue said she would arrange for someone from the consulate to escort us through a hospital room would be waiting in tucson ashlee administered a broadspectrum antibiotic from our medical kit and kait slept fitfully through the hot afternoon hitch and i exchanged driving duties i thought about ashlee ashlee had just lost her son or believed she had it was remarkable that she was able to care for kaitlin at all moving under the weight of her grief with great deliberation and kait responded to this kindness instinctively she was at ease with her head in ashlees lap it occurred to me that i loved them both i obeyed ashlees injunction i did not then or later ask kaitlin what had happened to her during the haj maybe i should qualify that there was a time as i sat with kait in her hospital room in tucson waiting for the doctor to come back with her bloodwork when i couldnt restrain myself i didnt ask her directly what had happened in portillo only why she had gone there what had made her leave home and ally herself with the likes of adam mills she turned her head away from me in acute embarrassment her hair fell across the crisp white pillow and i saw the suture line of her longhealed cochlear surgery a very faint pale seam along the descending line of her throat i just wanted things to be different she said ashlee stayed with me in tucson while kait recovered we rented a motel room and lived together chastely for a week ashlees grief was intensely private often almost invisible there were days when she seemed almost herself days when she would smile when i came in the door with a bag of takeout mexican or chinese food in some part she may have harbored the hope that adam had survived though she refused to discuss the possibility or tolerate the mention of adams name but she was subdued quiet she slept during the sweltering afternoons and was restless at night often sitting in front of the ancient cablelinked video panel long after i had gone to bed nevertheless we had come together in an important way our futures had commingled we didnt talk about any of this all our conversation was pointedly trivial except once when i was leaving the room for a run to the allnight convenience store down the block i asked her if she wanted anything i want a cigarette she said tightly i want my son back kait remained in the hospital for most of another week regaining her strength and enduring a fresh set of tests i visited daily though i kept the visits brief she seemed to prefer it that way during my last visit before her release kaitlin and her doctor shared some bad news with me i didnt want to trouble ashlee with this at least not yet when i came back to the hotel room i found ash somewhat recovered more talkative i took her out to dinner though not very far out the motel restaurant it served us sirloin tips and coffee the framed fauxnavajo prints and cattleskull decor were reassuringly classless ashlee talked suddenly she seemed to need to talk about her childhood the time before she married tucker kellog memories consisting not of narratives but of snapshots she had fixed in her mind a dry windy day in san diego shopping with her mother for linens a school trip to a petting zoo her first year in minneapolis how astonished she had been by the winter storms her commute to work blockaded by snowdrifts and windrows old shows she used to watch some of which i had also seen someday blue horizon next weeks family over dessert she said i talked to the red cross theyre still down in portillo taking names counting the dead if adam survived he didnt register with any of the relief agencies on the other hand if hes dead she said this with a studied nonchalance obviously fake well they havent identified his body and theyre very good at that i let them call up his genome profile from his medical records no match so i dont know if hes alive or dead but i realized something else her eyes glittered i said we dont have to talk about this no scott its okay what i realized is that alive or dead ive lost him maybe ill see him again maybe i wont but thats up to him if hes alive i mean thats what he tried to tell me in portillo not that he hates me but that hes not mine in any meaningful way anymore he belongs to himself i think he always did she was silent for a while then she drank the last of her coffee and turned away the waitress who offered more he gave me something i said adam did yes in portillo he said i could remember him by it here look she had folded the gift into a handkerchief inside her purse she unwrapped it and pushed it across the table it was a necklace a cheap chain with a pendant the pendant looked like a lump of pitted black plastic drilled to take an eyelet it was almost defiantly ugly he said he got it from a vendor in portillo its a kind of sacred object the stone isnt a stone its an arrival relic yes thats what adam called it the arrival of a chronolith creates odd debris the steep temperature and pressure gradients near the touchdown site will freeze crack warp and otherwise mangle ordinary materials souvenirhunters sell such items to the gullible and they are seldom authentic its from jerusalem ashlee added supposedly if that was true this misshapen lump might once have been something useful a doorknob a paperweight a pen a comb i said i hope it isnt ashlee looked crestfallen i thought youd be interested you were there in jerusalem when it happened sort of a coincidence i dont like those kinds of coincidences i told her about sues notion of tau turbulence i said i had been in the turbulence too often that it had affected my life if affected is the word for an acausal connection in ways i didnt like ashlee was dismayed she mouthed the words tau turbulence can you catch it she asked from a thing like this i doubt it its not a disease ash its not contagious i just dont care to be reminded she folded the necklace into its handkerchief and put the bundle into her purse again we went back to the room ashlee turned on the video panel but ignored it i read a book after a while she came to the bed and kissed me not for the first time but harder than shed kissed me for a while it was good to have her back in my arms good to fold myself around her small lithe body later on i drew open the curtains and we lay invisible in the dark watching cars pass on the highway headlights like parade torches taillights like floating embers ashlee asked me how the visit with kait had gone shes better i said janice is flying in tomorrow to take her home has she talked about the haj very little shes been through a lot there was some scarring i said ill bet no i mean i talked to her doctor too there was a secondary infection a uterine infection something she picked up in portillo its cured but there was scarring kait cant have children not naturally not without hiring a host shes infertile ashlee pulled away from me and stared out at the darkness and the highway she groped at the side table for a cigarette im sorry she said there was a strained note in her voice shes alive thats what matters in fact kait had been silent while the doctor gave me the bad news she had watched me from her bed unblinking no doubt trying to divine my reaction from my face wanting to know whether i would withdraw my sympathy and leave her stranded under those blank white hospital sheets i know how she feels ashlee said youre trembling i know how she feels scott because they told me the same thing after adam was born there were complications i cant have any more babies more traffic came down the highway rolling bars of light over the textured ceiling of the room we sat in shadow looking at each other like lost children and then we came into each others arms again in the morning we packed for the trip back to minneapolis ashlee left the room briefly while i was shaving she didnt think i saw her when she stepped out the door i watched from the window as she crossed the parking lot dodged the rear bumper of a floral delivery van fished a folded handkerchief out of her purse kissed the crumpled package and then tossed it into an open dumpster i returned the favor later that day i called sue chopra and told her i didnt work for her anymore part three turbulence eighteen time has an arrow sue chopra once told me it flies in one direction combine fire and firewood you get ashes combine fire and ashes you dont get firewood morality has an arrow too for example run a film of the second world war backward and you invert its moral logic the allies sign a peace agreement with japan and promptly bomb hiroshima and nagasaki nazis extract bullets from the heads of emaciated jews and nurse them back to health the problem with tau turbulence sue said is that it mingles these paradoxes into daily experience in the vicinity of a chronolith a saint might be a very dangerous man a sinner is probably more useful seven years after portillo with the military monopolizing the output of the communication and computation industries a secondhand processor substrate of decent consumer quality would draw as much as two hundred dollars on the open market a marquis instruments strat board of vintage outperformed its modern consumer equivalents in both speed and reliability ounce for ounce it was worth more than gold bullion i had five of them in the trunk of my car i drove myself and my strat boards and my collection of surplus connectors screens dishes codems and outboard accessories to the open market at nicollet mall it was a bright and pleasant summer morning and even the empty windows of the halprin tower abandoned in midconstruction when its financial backing collapsed last january seemed cheerful up there in the relatively clean air a homeless man had unrolled his blanket in the spot by the fountain that was my customary location but he didnt object when i asked him to move along he understood the drill market niches were jealously guarded vendor seniority scrupulously respected many of the nicollet vendors had been here since the beginning of the economic contraction when local police had been known to enforce the antipeddling laws at gunpoint that kind of hardship breeds solidarity we all knew one another and though conflicts were hardly unusual vendors as a rule honored and would protect one anothers spaces veterans of long standing held the best spots newcomers took the dregs and often had to wait months or years for a vacancy to come up i was somewhere between the veterans and the newbies the fountain spot was away from the prime aisles but spacious enough that i could park the car and unload my folding table and stock without having to use a handcart as long as i got there early and set up before the crowds began to gather this morning i was a little late the vendor next to me a man named duplessy who sold and tailored used clothing had already set up shop he strolled over as i was unpacking my goods he eyed the fresh merchandise whoa strat boards he said are they authentic yup looks like quality are you hooked up with a supplier just got lucky in fact i had bought the boards from an amateur officefurniture and lightingfixture liquidator who had no idea of their resale value it was a oneshot deal alas you want to trade something for one of those i could put you in a nice formal suit what would i want with a suit dupe he shrugged just asking hope we get some customers today in spite of the parade i frowned another parade i should have paid attention to the news another a p parade all flags and assholes no confetti no clowns in the narrow sense of the word adapt and prosper was a hardcore kuinist faction despite their occasional conciliatory rhetoric and every time they carried their blueandred banner through the twin cities there were bound to be counterdemonstrations and some photogenic headknocking on parade days noncombatants tended to stay out of the streets i guessed the copperheads still had a right to voice their opinions nobody had repealed the constitution but it was a pity they had to pick a day like this blue sky and a cool breeze perfect shopping weather i watched dupes goods for him while he ran off to grab breakfast from a cart by the time he got back i had sold one of my boards to another vendor and by lunch though crowds were light two more had gone all at premium prices i had made a decent profit on the day and as the streets emptied around one oclock i packed up again afraid of a little old street fight dupe called out from his heaped mounds of cotton and denim afraid of the traffic police roadblocks were sure to be going up all over the urban core already as the crowds thinned i had seen grim young men with a p armbands or k tattoos gathering on the sidewalks what worried me though was not the traffic or the threat of violence so much as the lean and bearded man who had twice cruised past my table and was still hovering nearby looking away with patently fake indifference whenever i glanced in his direction i had met my share of shy or undecided customers but this gentleman had given the goods a cursory and superficial look and seemed more interested in repeatedly checking his watch he was probably an innocent twitch but he made me nervous i had learned to trust these instincts i managed to get out of the downtown core before any serious trouble started prok and antik scuffles had become almost routine lately and the police had learned how to manage them but the residue of the pacification gas which smells like a combination of moist cat litter and fermented garlic would linger for days and it cost the city a small fortune to scrape the oxidizing lumps of barrier foam off the streets a lot of things had changed in the seven years since the arrival of the portillo chronolith count those years seven of them the nervous prewar years pessimistic years years when nothing seemed to go right for the country even setting aside the economic crisis the kuinist youth movement the bad news from abroad the mississippiatchafalaya disaster dragged on past baton rouge the mississippi had settled in its new course to the sea industry and shipping had been devastated whole towns drowned or left without drinking water there was nothing sinister about this only nature winning a round over the corps of engineers sedimentation changes river gradients and gravity does the rest but it seemed in those days oddly symbolic the contrast was inescapable kuin had mastered time itself while we were crippled by water seven years ago i couldnt have pictured myself as a glorified scrap dealer today i felt fortunate to be in that position i usually cleared enough money in any given month to pay the rent and put food on the table a great many people werent so lucky many had been forced into the dole lines and the soup kitchens ripe recruiting grounds for the pk and ak street armies i tried to phone janice from the car after a few false starts i got a connection at some ridiculously diminished baud rate that made her sound as if she was shouting through a toiletpaper roll i told her i wanted to take kait and david out for dinner its davids last night janice said i know thats why we want to see them i know its short notice but i wasnt sure id be finished downtown in time or whether i would have the cash to fund even a homecooked meal for four but i didnt say that to janice the marquis boards had subsidized this little luxury all right she said but dont bring them back too late david gets an early start tomorrow david had received his draft notice in june and was off to basic training at a uniforces camp in arkansas he and kaitlin had been married for just six months but the draft board didnt care the chinese intervention was eating up ground troops by the boatload tell kait ill be there by five i said as the phone link crackled and then evaporated then i called ashlee and told her wed have guests for dinner i volunteered to do the shopping i wish we could afford meat she said wistfully we can youre kidding what the strat boards yup she paused there are a lot of places we could put that money scott yes there were but i elected to put it on the counter of a butcher shop in exchange for four small sirloin steaks and at the grocer i picked up basmati rice and fresh asparagus spears and real butter theres no point living if you cant at least occasionally live kait and david made their home in a converted storage space over janice and whits garage as awful as that sounds they had managed to turn a chilly peakedroof attic into a relatively warm and comfortable nest furnished with whits castoff sofa and a big wroughtiron bed david had inherited from his parents the attic also afforded them a little distance from whit himself whose charity they were in no position to refuse whit was a dignified copperhead and disapproved of street fighting but he took his politics seriously and could be counted on for a little accommodationist lecture whenever the conversation lagged i picked up kait and david and drove them to the small apartment i shared with ashlee kait was quiet in the car putting on a brave face but obviously worried for her husband david compensated by chattering about the news the ousting of the federal party the fighting in san salvador but by his voice and gestures he was also nervous reasonably so none of us mentioned china even in passing david courtney hadnt impressed me when kait first introduced him last year but i had come to like him very much he was just twenty years old and displayed that emotional blandness psychologists call it lack of affect that is the style of this generation raised in the shadow of kuin underneath it however david proved to be a warm and thoughtful young man whose affection for kait was unmistakable he was not especially handsome he had picked up a facial scar in the lowertown fires of and he was certainly not rich or wellconnected but he was employed or had been until the draft notice arrived driving a loader at the airport and he was bright and adaptable vital qualities in these dark days of a dark century their wedding had been a tiny affair subsidized by whit and held in a church in whits parish where half the deacons were probably closet copperheads kait had worn janices old wedding dress which revived some awkward memories but it was a fine event by modern standards and both janice and ashlee had been moved to tears by the ceremony kaitlin went on up to the apartment as david and i set the cars alarms and security protocols i asked him how kait was dealing with his impending departure she cries sometimes she doesnt like it i think shell be okay though how about you he brushed his hair away from his eyes revealing for a moment the scar tissue that marred his forehead he shrugged all right so far he said i offered to broil the steaks but ashlee wouldnt have it we hadnt seen steak for the better part of a year and she wasnt about to entrust these to my care i could chop the onions she suggested or better keep kait and david company and stay the hell out of the kitchen maybe the steaks were a bad idea they were celebration food but there was nothing to celebrate tonight kait and david exchanged troubled glances and were clearly making an effort to rise above their anxiety an effort not even briefly successful by the time ash served dinner we were all clearly playing a game of mutual denial ashlee and i had rented this fifthfloor apartment shortly after we were married six years ago in july rent was controlled under the stoppard act but building maintenance was casual to the point of sloppy the upstairs neighbors water pipes had leaked through our kitchen cupboards until ash and i went up there with plumbing tools and pvc and patched up the problem ourselves but our livingroom windows looked southwest across low suburbs shingles solar cells treetops and tonight there was a big moon riding the horizon almost bright enough to read by hard to believe kait said also entranced by the moon people used to live up there a lot of things about the past had become hard to believe last year i had watched through this same window when the abandoned corninggentell orbital factory burned its way through the atmosphere shedding molten metal like a fourth of july sparkler a decade ago there had been seventyfive human beings living in earth orbit or beyond today there were none i stood up to open the curtains a little wider that was when i noticed the old gm efficiency vehicle parked in front of the barred door of the mukerjee dollar bargain store and the bearded mans face in the automobile window illuminated until he looked away by the glare of a sulfurdot streetlight i couldnt say for sure that this was the same twitch who had been haunting my table at the nicollet mall but i would have been willing to bet on it i didnt mention this to the family just sat back down and made myself smile all our smiles were fabricated tonight david talked a little more over coffee about what he might be facing with the uniforces over the term of his conscription unless he was lucky enough to land a clerical or tech position he would probably end up in china with the infantry but the fighting couldnt go on much longer he told kait so that was okay and we all pretended to believe this absurd untruth david would have been deferred of course had kaitlin been pregnant but that was not a possibility the infection she had picked up in portillo had scarred her uterus and left her infertile she and david could still have children but they would have to be conceived in vitro a process none of us could afford to my knowledge david had never even raised that subject the impossibility of a childbirth deferral with kait he loved her i believe very genuinely deferral marriages were common enough in those days but it was never an issue for david and kaitlin ashlee served coffee and made cheerful conversation while i tried not to think about the man outside i found myself watching kait as she quietly watched david and i felt very proud of her kait had not led a simple life none of us had deep as we were in the age of the chronoliths but she had come to possess an immense personal dignity that at times seemed to shine through her skin like a bright light it was the miracle of our brief time together that janice and i had produced all unaware this powerfully alive human soul we had propagated goodness in spite of ourselves kait and david needed their last few hours together however i asked ashlee to drive them back home ash was surprised by the request and gave me a sharp inquisitive look but agreed i shook davids hand warmly and wished him the best i gave kait a long hug and when the three of them were gone i went into the bedroom and fetched my pistol from the top shelf of the linen cupboard and unlocked and removed the trigger guard i already mentioned i think that i had grown up in the antigun revulsion of the early decades of the century this century which hovers as i write these words on the brink of its last quarter but i dont mean to get ahead of myself handguns had come back into vogue during the troubles i did not like owning one among other things it made me feel like a hypocrite but i had become convinced that it was prudent so i had taken the required courses filled out all the forms registered both the weapon and my genome with atf and purchased a smallcaliber handgun that recognized my fingerprints and no one elses when i picked it up i had owned this device for some three years now and i had never fired it outside of the training range i put it in my pocket and walked down four flights of stairs to the lobby of the building and then across the street toward the parked car the bearded man in the drivers seat showed no sign of alarm he smiled at me smirked in fact as i approached when i was close enough to make myself heard i said you need to explain to me what youre doing here his grin widened you really dont recognize me do you you dont have the faintest idea which was not what i had expected the voice did sound familiar but i couldnt place it he stuck his hand out of the car window its me scott ray mosely i used to be about fifty pounds heavier the beard is new ray mosely sue chopras understudy and hopeless courtier i hadnt seen him since before kaits adventure in portillo since i retired from all that business to make a new life with ashlee well damn was all i managed you look about the same he said that made it easier to find you without the body fat he looked almost gaunt even with the beard almost a ghost of himself you didnt have to stalk me ray you could have come up to the table and said hello well people change for all i know you could be a firebreathing copperhead by now fuck you too because its important we kind of need your help whos we sue for one she could use a place to stay for a little while i was still trying to cope with that information when the rear window rolled down and sue herself poked her big ungainly peanutshaped head out of the darkness she grinned hey there scotty she said we meet again nineteen in the past seven years i had told ashlee a great deal about sue chopra and her friends that didnt mean ash was pleased to come home and find two of these worthies occupying her livingroom sofa it had seemed obvious to me after portillo that i would have to choose between my life with ashlee and my work for sue sue persisted in her belief that the advance of the chronoliths could be turned back given the right technology or even the appropriate degree of understanding privately i doubted it consider the word itself chronolith an ugly portmanteau word coined by some tonedeaf journalist shortly after chumphon a word i had never liked but which i had come to appreciate for its aptness chronos time and lithos stone and wasnt that the heart of the matter time made solid as rock a zone of absolute determinacy surrounded by a froth of ephemera human lives for instance which deformed to fit its contours i did not wish to be deformed the life i wanted with ashlee was the life the chronoliths had stolen from me we had come back from tucson ash and i to lick our wounds and to take from each other what strength we were able to give i could not have given ashlee much if i had gone on working for sulamith chopra if i had continued to dip into the tau turbulence if i persisted in making myself an instrument of fate not that we had lost contact entirely sue still called on me occasionally for consultation though there was little i could do professionally without access to her milspec code incubators more often she called to keep me up to date share her optimistic or pessimistic moods gossip she took i think a vicarious pleasure in the life i had made for myself as if it were somehow exotic as if there werent a million families like mine making do in hard times certainly i had not expected her to arrive at my doorstep in this cloakanddagger fashion ash had exchanged a few words with sue on the phone but they had never been formally introduced and ray was a stranger to her i made the introductions with a gusto that was perhaps too obviously insincere ashlee nodded and shook hands and retreated to the kitchen to make coffee ie to work out her concerns about their presence here it was only a visit ray insisted sue still maintained her network of connections with the remaining chronolith researchers and she had been doing some connecting during this trip west the vascular ebb and flow of federal funding had turned her way once again though she still had detractors in congress these days she said all her work was stealthy halfhidden concealed by one agency from another embedded in bureaucratic rivalries she barely understood yes she was in minneapolis on business but basically she just wanted a friendly place to stay for a couple of evenings you could have called ahead i suppose so scotty but you never know whos listening between the closet copperheads in congress and the crazies on the street she shrugged if its inconvenient well take a hotel room youll stay here i said im just curious plainly there was more to this than a friendly reunion but neither she nor ray would volunteer details and i guessed that was all right with me at least for tonight sue and all her furor and obsession seemed a long time gone many things had changed since portillo oh i still watched the news of kuins advances when the bandwidth allowed and i still occasionally wondered what tau turbulence might mean and how it might have affected me but these were night fears the kind of thing you think about when you cant sleep and rain taps on the window like an unwelcome visitor i had given up attempting to understand any of this in sues terms her conversations with ray always veered too quickly into cy geometry and dark quarks and such esoteric matters and as for the chronoliths themselves should i be ashamed to admit that i had achieved a private separate peace with them that i was resigned to my own inability to influence these vast and mysterious events maybe it was a small treason but it felt like sanity it was disturbing then to be back in the presence of sue whose obsessions still burned very brightly she was polite when we talked about old times or familiar faces but her eyes brightened and her voice gained a decibel as soon as talk turned to the recent advent of the freetown chronolith or the advance of the kuinist armies into nigeria i watched her while she talked that gloriously uncontrollable crown of coiled hair had grayed at the fringes when she smiled the skin at the corners of her eyes wrinkled complexly she was skinny and looked a little careworn whenever the glow of her fervency ebbed and ray mosely incredibly was still in love with her he did not of course say this i suspect ray experienced his love for sulamith chopra as a private humiliation forever invisible to outsiders but it wasnt invisible and maybe he had made his own bargain with it better to nurse a futile affection than to concede to lovelessness bearded as he was thin now almost to the point of anorexia his hair receding like a childhood memory ray still gave sue those deferential glances still smiled when she smiled laughed when she laughed rose to her defense at the first hint of criticism and when sue nodded at ashlee in the kitchen and said i envy you scotty i always wanted to settle down with a good woman ray chuckled obediently and winced all at once before i went to bed i turned out the sofabed and shook out a set of spare blankets this could only have been torture for ray sleeping next to sue in absolute and unquestioned chastity listening to the sound of her breath but it was the only accommodation i had to offer apart from the floor before i went to bed myself i took sue aside its good to see you i told her i mean it but if you want more from me than a couple of nights on a foldout i want to know well talk about that later she said calmly night scotty ashlee in bed was less sanguine it was great to meet these people who had once meant so much to me she said it made all those stories i had told her come to life but she was afraid of them too afraid the way kaits afraid of the draft for the same reason they want something from you scott dont let it worry you but i have to worry theyre smart people and they wouldnt be here if they didnt think they could talk you into whatever it is they want you to do im not so easy to convince ash she rolled on her side sighing in seven years kuin had still not planted a chronolith on american soil at least not north of the mexican border we remained part of an archipelago of sanity in a world besieged by madness along with northern europe southern africa brazil canada the caribbean islands and sundry other holdouts kuins impact in the americas had been broadly economic not political global chaos especially in asia had dried up foreign demand for finished goods money drained out of the consumergoods industries and was tunneled into defense it made for relatively low unemployment apart from the louisiana refugees but lots of spot shortages and some rationing copperheads claimed that the economy was being gradually sovietized and in this at least they may have had a point there was still no real prokuin sentiment in congress or the white house our kuinists and their radical ak counterparts were street fighters not organizers at least so far respectable copperheads like whit delahunt were another matter they were everywhere but they walked very softly i had read some of the copperhead literature both the academic writers daudier pressinger the paris group and the populist hacks forrestalls clothing the emperor when it hit the bestseller list i had even sampled the works of the musicians and novelists who were the public face of the kuinist underground impressive as some of this was prima facie it nevertheless struck me as wishful at best at worst as an attempt to ingratiate either the nation or more likely the writer to some inevitable kuinist autarchy and still there was no direct evidence of the existence of kuin himself no doubt he did exist perhaps somewhere on the southern chinese mainland but most of asia was closed to media and telecommunications its infrastructure in a state of radical collapse and millions dead in the famine and unrest the chaos that helped create kuin also served to shield him from premature exposure and was the technology necessary to create a chronolith already in kuins hands yes probably sue told me this was sunday morning ashlee still nervous had gone off to visit her cousin alathea in st paul alathea eked out a living selling decorative copper pots door to door visiting alathea on sundays was an expression of familial piety on ashlees part since alathea was a disagreeable woman with eccentric religious beliefs and no talent for housekeeping i sat with sue at the kitchen table picking at breakfast and generally savoring my day off while ray went out to hunt for a source of fresh coffee we had used up the house supply there were sue told me only a handful of people in the world who understood contemporary chronolith theory well enough to envision the means to create one she happened to be one of them that was why the federal government had taken such an ambivalent interest in her alternately helping and hindering her work but that wasnt the big problem right now the big problem she said was that the increasingly desperate chinese government had years ago established its own intensive research programs into the practicality of taubending technology and had isolated these facilities from the international community and why was that a problem because the fragmented chinese government had finally collapsed under the weight of its own insolvency and those same research facilities were presumably under the direct control of kuinist insurgents so it all fits into place she said somewhere in asia theres a kuin and he has the technology in his hands were only a couple of years away from the chumphon conquest and that looks like an entirely plausible event we cant do anything about it either all of southeast asia is in the hands of various kuinist insurgent movements it would take a huge army to occupy the hills above chumphon and that would mean recommitting troops and supplies from china which nobody is willing to do so it comes together very very neatly you might say inevitably these are the shades of things that must be yes and were helpless to stop it well i dont know scotty i think maybe there is something i can do her smile was both mischievous and sad but the whole subject made me uneasy and i tried to divert her by asking whether she had heard from hitch paley lately i hadnt not since portillo were still in contact she said hell be passing through town in a couple of days i suppose its evidence of sues innate if awkward charm that by the following evening ashlee was sitting beside her on the sofa listening raptly to sues interpretation of the age of chronoliths as i joined them ash was saying i still dont understand why you think its so important to destroy one sue pondering her response looked as intensely thoughtful as a religious zealot which perhaps she was at least on her own terms in her popphysics seminar at cornell she had been fond of comparing the particle zoo hadrons fermions and all the varieties of their constituent quarks to the deities of the hindu pantheon all distinct yet all aspects of a single encompassing godhead sue was not conventionally religious and she had never even visited her parents native madras she used the metaphor loosely and often comically but i recalled her description of twofaced shiva the destroyer and bringer of life the ascetic youth and the lingamwielding impregnator sue had detected the presence of shiva in every duality every quantum symmetry she put the tips of her fingers together ashlee tell me how you define the word monument well ash said tentatively its a thing a structure like a building its you know architecture so how is it different from a house or a temple i guess you dont use a monument the way you use a house or a church it just sort of stands there announcing itself but it does have a purpose right the way a house has a purpose i dont know if i would say its useful but i guess it serves a purpose just not a very practical one exactly its a structure with a purpose but the purpose isnt practical its spiritual or at least symbolic it announces power and preeminence or it commemorates some communal event its a physical structure but all its meaning all its utility is invested in it by the human mind including the chronoliths thats the point as a destructive weapon a chronolith is relatively trivial by itself it achieves nothing in particular its an inert object all its significance lies in the realm of meaning and interpretation and thats where the battle is ashlee she tapped her forehead all the strangest architecture is right up here nothing in the physical world compares to the monuments and the cathedrals we build inside our own skulls some of that architecture is simple and true and some of it is baroque and some of it is beautiful and some of it is ugly and perilously unsound but that architecture matters more than any other kind because we make the future out of it history is just a fossil record of what men and women construct out of the contents of their minds you understand and the genius of kuin has nothing to do with the chronoliths the chronoliths are just technology just people making nature jump through hoops the genius of kuin is that hes using them to colonize the world of the mind to build his own architecture directly into our heads he makes people believe in him in him in his power in his glory in his benevolence but above all in his inevitability and thats what i want to change because nothing about kuin is inevitable absolutely nothing we build kuin every day we manufacture him out of our hopes and fears he belongs to us hes a shadow were all casting this in itself was nothing new the politics of expectation had even been debated in the press but something about this speech made the hairs on my arms stand erect the degree of her conviction her casual eloquence but i think it was more i think i understood for the first time that sue had declared a private and very personal war on kuin more that she believed she was at the very center of the conflict now anointed by the tau turbulence promoted directly into the godhead i met kaitlin for a sunday dinner out strictly fast food this representing the last of the weekends windfall money kait came down from the apartment over whits garage looking brave but inconsolable she had passed her first couple of nights without david and it showed her eyes were shadowed her complexion sallow for lack of sleep the smile she gave me was almost furtive as if she had no business smiling while david was at war we shared beanpaste sandwiches at a oncebrightlycolored but lately scabrous peoples kitchen kait knew that sue chopra and ray mosley were in town and we talked a while about that but kait was plainly not much interested in what she called the old days she had been troubled by nightmares she said in her dreams she was back in portillo but this time with david and david was in some mortal danger from which kait could not rescue him she was kneedeep in sand in the dream the kuin of portillo looming over her nearly alive gnarled and malevolent i listened patiently and let her wind down the dream wasnt difficult to interpret finally i said have you heard from david a phone call after his bus got into little rock nothing since then but i guess boot camp keeps you busy i guessed it did then i asked how her mother and whit were dealing with it mom is a help as for whit she fluttered her hand you know how he is he doesnt approve of the war and sometimes he acts like david is personally responsible for it as if he had a choice about the draft notice with whit its all big issues theres no people involved except as obstacles or bad examples im not sure the war is doing any good either kait if david had wanted to duck the draft i would have helped him dig a hole she smiled sadly i know david knew that too the odd thing is that whit wouldnt hear of it he doesnt like the war but he couldnt sanction breaking the law putting the family in legal jeopardy and all that crap the thing is david figured whit would probably inform on him if he tried to evade the conscription drive you think thats true she hesitated i dont hate whit i know but yes i think he might be capable of that it was perhaps not surprising that she suffered from nightmares i said janice must be around the house more since her job evaporated she is and its a help i know she misses david too but she doesnt talk about the war or kuin or whits opinions thats strictly forbidden territory janices loyalty to her second husband was remarkable and probably admirable though i had a hard time seeing it that way when does loyalty become martyrdom and just how dangerous was whitman delahunt but i couldnt ask kait these questions kait couldnt answer them any more than i could by the time i got home ashlee had already gone to bed sue and ray were awake at the kitchen table talking in low tones over a map of the western states ray clammed up when i passed through but sue invited me to sit down and join them i declined politely much to rays relief and instead joined ashlee who was curled up on her left side with the sheet tangled at her feet and a night breeze raising goosebumps on the slope of her thigh should i feel guilty because in the end i hadnt sought or achieved a private martyrdom like janice bound to whit by her sense of duty like david aimed at china like a bullet and about as disposable or like my father for that matter who had justified his life as a martyrdom i was with her scotty when i rolled into bed ashlee stirred and mumbled and pressed herself against me warm in the cool of the night i tried to imagine martyrdom running backward like a broken clock how sweet to abdicate divinity to climb down from the cross to travel from transfiguration to simple wisdom and arrive at last at innocence twenty hitch came into town missing two fingers from his left hand and walking with a limp it seemed to me he didnt smile as readily as he used to either though he smiled at sue and gave me an appraising look that was friendly enough certainly he did not make ashlee smile ashlee worked at the city watertreatment plant writing the status reports required by state and federal regulations and staffing an accounts receivable desk for the financial manager she came home tired and she nearly fainted at the sight of hitch paley even though hitch was dressed in a respectable suit and had even attempted a necktie hitch remained a bad memory for ashlee hitch had been with her when she lost adam she did not of course recognize former fbi desk man morris torrance now even balder than ray mosely who had also arrived in the big utility van parked out front i attempted an introduction but ashlee said in a flat tone we cant sleep all these people scott not even for a night the catch in her voice reflected a little fear a lot of resentment no need for that hitch said hastily i just rented a couple of rooms at the marriott good to see you ashlee you too i guess she said and thank you for accommodating us in the meantime sue chopra put in i know its been an inconvenience ashlee nodded mollified perhaps by the sight of sue with her duffel packed the marriott our fortunes sue said have changed i walked out to the van with hitch while sue and ray finished packing hitch tucked sues duffel into the cargo bin then he put his hand on my shoulder i could use some help tomorrow scotty if you think you can make the time help with what spending money on heavy machinery diesel generators and like that i dont know much about machinery hitch mainly i want your company tomorrows a working day running that flea market table take the day off i cant afford to yeah you can were budgeted for that he named an hourly wage for an eighthour day a princely sum for the simple act of riding shotgun with him particularly from a man whose friends had been begging me for sofa space just a few days ago hitch had obviously come into town with money and the offer was tempting but i was reluctant to accept it figure it out he said we have a department of defense charge account at least for the time being the cash is available and i know you cant afford to take time off on short notice and we really need to discuss a few things hitch and what can it hurt that was the pertinent question im sensing theres more here than meets the eye well yeah there is we can talk about it tomorrow ill call from the hotel well make plans i said why me because theres an arrow pointed at you my friend he hoisted himself into the drivers seat grimacing as he pulled his lame leg after him or at least thats what sue thinks and so in the sunny morning light i drove with hitch paley into the shabby industrial parks west of the river the vans air conditioning was broken which was only to be expected spare parts were at a premium most of them going to the military the air outside was dry and climbing toward oven heat and hitch drove with the tinted windows up but the vents wide open by the time we reached our destination the interior reeked of hot vinyl and motor oil and sweat hitch had made an appointment with the sales manager of a machine and machineparts distributor called tyson brothers i followed hitch through reception and sat in the mans office examining his wilted ficus and his generic wall art while hitch negotiated the outright purchase of two small earthmovers and enough portable generators to power a small town plus copious spare parts the sales guy was obviously curious he asked twice whether we were independent contractors and seemed vexed when hitch deflected the question but he was just as obviously delighted to write up the order for all i know hitch may have saved tyson brothers from bankruptcy or at least postponed that inevitable hour in any case he debited more money in a couple of hours than i had earned over the course of the last year he left a contact number with the distributor and told him someone would be in touch to arrange delivery waved his good right hand at the receptionist and sauntered back out into the heat in the van i said youre doing what exactly digging a hole and lighting it up were a little more ambitious than that scotty were going to bring down one of those kuin stones with a handful of earthmovers thats just filling in the shortfall weve got very nearly a battalion of military engineers and gear ready to roll when sue says the word you seriously mean to demolish a chronolith sue says we can she thinks which one were you planning to take down the one in wyoming there is no chronolith in wyoming not yet there isnt hitch explained all this as he understood it sue filled in the details later it had been a busy few years for sulamith chopra you dropped out of it hitch said made a little life for yourself with ashlee and more power to you scotty but the rest of us didnt exactly stand still just because you stopped breeding our code i did not then and do not now understand the physics of the chronoliths except in the popscience sense i know the technology involves the manipulation of calabiyau spaces which are the smallest constituent parts of both matter and energy and that it uses a technique called slow fermionic decohesion to do this at practical energy levels as to what really happens down there in the tangled origami of spacetime i remain as ignorant as a newborn infant they say ninedimensional geometry is a language unto itself i dont happen to speak it but sue did and i think the depth of her understanding was unappreciated the federal government had both cultivated her as an ally and pursued her as a liability but they had also consistently underestimated her she was so completely at ease with calabiyau geometry that i came to believe a part of her lived in that world she had inhabited these abstractions the way an astronaut might inhabit a strange and distant planet there is no such thing as a paradox sue once said to me a paradox she said is just the illusion created when you look at an ndimensional problem through a threedimensional window all the parts connect scotty even if we cant see the loops and knots past and future good and evil here and there its all one thing in more particular terms sues collaborators had already succeeded in producing tauturbulent events on a small scale grains of sand to kuins chronoliths of course but in principle the same now sue believed she could disrupt the arrival of a chronolith by performing this same manipulation in the physical space where the chronolith was about to manifest she had been urging this action for most of a year but the global systems that monitored and predicted arrivals were either highly classified or in disarray or both and it had taken time for the military bureaucracy to examine her proposals and approve them wyoming was the first real opportunity hitch said and maybe the last and even wyoming wasnt without its dangers it had become a mecca for copperhead militias of various often incompatible political stripes the good news was a generous threeweek arrivalwarning window plus full military support the effort was not being publicized for fear of attracting yet more kuinists it would be stealthy but it would not be halfhearted that was all well and good i told hitch but it didnt explain why i was sitting in his truck listening to what sounded increasingly like a sales pitch hitch became solemn scotty he said this isnt anything like a pitch at least not from me i like you as a person but im not convinced youd be an asset to this particular expedition i respect all that you achieved here and god knows its hard enough keeping a family together in this day and age but what we need are technicians and engineers and guys who can handle heavy equipment not somebody who sells secondhand crap at a flea market gee thanks no offense i mean am i wrong no youre not wrong its sue who wants you with us for reasons she just sort of hints at you mentioned an arrow well its more like a game of connectthedots can i tell you a story if you keep your eyes on the road half the streets in minneapolis had reverted to their unmonitored status nothing to prevent a collision but a vehicles own builtins hitch had come close enough to a peddlers cart to set the proximity alarms shrilling i hate traffic he said he had been in el paso six months ago doing his thing on sues behalf tracking down death threats she had been receiving at her home terminal an address no one but a few close associates should have had morris torrance was theoretically in charge of sues security but it was always hitch who did the legwork he was wellconnected in kuinist circles and he possessed enough street credibility to impress any number of thugs he was good in a fight and no doubt handy with weapons of all kinds though i didnt ask morris had traced the threats to one of the big kuinist cells operating out of texas and hitch went to el paso to ingratiate himself with the local street armies but i made the obvious mistake he told me i asked too many questions too soon you can get away with that if the mood is right but those texans are fucking paranoid somewhere down the road somebody decided i was a bad risk in the end five kuinist shock troops had dragged him into the back lot of an autorepair shop and questioned him with the aid of a sawtoothed machete hitch held up his left hand and showed me the stumps of his first and second fingers both had been severed below the knuckle both had been carefully sutured but the cut had obviously been rough i thought about that i thought about the pain dont flinch he said it could have been worse i managed to get away you acquired that limp at the same time a smallcaliber bullet in the muscle tissue as i was leaving the scene they had this ancient pistol some twentiethcentury junk piece with the stock half rusted off but the thing is scotty i recognized the one who shot me you recognized him and i think he knew me too or at least knew i seemed familiar if he hadnt been a little shook up he might have been a better shot it was adam mills i scooted away from him almost instinctively pushed myself up against the passenger door feeling cold despite the summer heat cant be i said fuck me if it wasnt he didnt die in portillo he must have got out with the refugees and you ran into him in el paso just like that its not a coincidence sue says its tau turbulence its a meaningful synchronicity and we connect to adam right through you scotty adam mills is the arrow and hes pointed straight at you i dont accept that you dont have to far as im concerned i didnt want to accept that bullet in my leg either if it matters i had to kill a couple of people to get this information to sue what she makes of it what you make of it thats not my business you killed a couple of people what exactly do you think i do scotty travel around the country using moral suasion ive killed people yeah he shook his head this is exactly what makes me nervous you look at me and you see this big colorful friend you used to hang out with in chumphon but i had killed a man before i ever met you scotty sue knows that i was dealing drugs back there you know not retailing swimwear you get in situations sometimes then and since i dont have your kind of conscience i know you think youre some kind of moral leper because you fucked up with janice and kait but deep down scotty youre a family man thats all so what does sue want with me i wish i knew twentyone the marriott didnt attract many guests in these diminished days sue was alone in the pool and sauna room though morris torrance stood watch outside the entrance she looked up at me from the roiling waters of the whirlpool bath she wore a fireenginered singlepiece bathing suit and a yellow elastic hair cap neither item flattering to her but sue had always been indifferent to fashion even in the whirlpool she wore her huge archaic eyeglasses framed in what looked like scuffed black bakelite she said you should try this scotty its very relaxing im not in the mood hitch has been talking to you i gather yes she sighed well give me a minute she lifted her pearshaped body out of the jacuzzi and peeled off the headgear her hair springing out like a caged animal i like the deck chairs by the window she said if youre not too warm in those clothes im all right i said though the air was tropical and reeked of chlorine the discomfort seemed somehow appropriate she stretched out a bath towel and seated herself regally hitch told you about adam mills yes he did i havent told ashlee yet dont scotty dont tell ashlee why are you planning to tell her yourself certainly not and i hope you wont either she thinks he may be dead she has a right to know if thats not true adam is alive no doubt about it but you have to ask yourself what purpose would it serve to tell ashlee is it really better for ash to know that adam is alive and that hes a murderer a murderer is he yes we established that fact beyond any doubt adam mills is a devoted hardcore kuinist and a multiple murderer a hatchetman for one of the most vicious pk gangs in the country do you think ashlee needs to know that do you want to tell her her son is leading the kind of life that will likely get him killed or imprisoned in the very near future and if that happens do you want to watch her grieve all over again i hesitated i had been putting myself in ashlees position if i had been wondering for seven years whether kait had survived portillo any information would have been welcome but adam was not kaitlin look at what shes gained since portillo a job a family a real life equilibrium scotty in a world where thats a rare commodity obviously you know her better than i do but think about it before you take all that away from her again i decided to shelve the question it wasnt what had brought me here not primarily id be taking all that away from her just as surely if i went out west with you which is what hitch claims you want yes but only for a little while scotty will you please sit down i hate talking up it makes me nervous i pulled a second deck chair in front of hers beyond the steamhazed window the city baked in afternoon sunlight sunlight glittered off windows rooftop arrays micastudded sidewalks now listen to me she said this is important and i want you to keep an open mind hard as that may be under the circumstances i know there are a lot of things weve kept from you but please understand we had to be careful we had to make sure you hadnt changed your mind about kuin no dont act insulted stranger things have happened or that you werent caught up in copperhead circles like janices husband whatsisname whitman morris keeps insisting we cant trust anyone though i told him youd be all right because i know you scotty youve been in the tau turbulence almost from the beginning both of us have we have a sacred kinship bullshit sue its not bullshit its not just conjectural either admittedly im interpreting but the math suggests i really dont care what the math suggests then just listen to me and ill tell you what i think is the truth she looked away her eyes distantly focused i didnt like the expression on her face it was earnest and aloof almost inhuman scotty she said i dont believe in destiny its an archaic concept peoples lives are an incredibly complex phenomenon far less predictable than the lives of stars but i also know that tau turbulence splashes causality up and down the timeline is it really a coincidence that you and hitch both ended up working for me or that adam mills shared the turbulence with us in portillo in either case you can construct a logical sequence of events thats almost but not quite satisfying as an explanation i connected with hitch paley through the events at chumphon not quite at random you met ashlee because both of you had children caught up in the same haj fine but scotty step back and take a longer look it knits together way too neatly the antecedent causes are insufficient there has to be a postcedent cause hitch tangling with adam for that matter more than coincidence but also uninterpretable thats an item of faith i said softly then look at me scotty look at the power i hold in these two hands she turned her pale palms up the power to bring down a fucking chronolith that makes me important it makes me a player in the resolution of these events scotty i am a postcedent cause there is such a thing i said as megalomania except i didnt make this up any of this its not a fantasy that i happen to understand chronolith physics as well as anyone on the planet and im not being vain either its not a fantasy that you and hitch were at chumphon and portillo or that you and i were at jerusalem those are facts scotty and they demand an interpretation that goes beyond happenstance and blind chance why do you want me in wyoming she blinked but i dont i dont want you there youre probably safer here but i cant ignore the facts either i believe and yes this is intuition probably unscientific but i dont care i believe you have a role to play in the endgame of the chronoliths for good or ill i dont really know though im sure you wouldnt do anything to hurt me or to further the interests of kuin i think it would be better if you came with us because you carry something special with you the fact of adam mills is like a billboard chumphon jerusalem portillo wyoming you you may not like it scotty but you matter she shrugged thats what i believe and i believe it very fervently but if i cant convince you to come you wont come and maybe thats what our destiny is maybe thats how were tied together by your refusal you cant put that weight on me no scotty i cant she blinked sadly but i cant take it away either none of this sounded quite sane to me no doubt because of my mother i had developed a sensitive ear for the irrational even as a child i had known at once when my mother began to veer into madness i recognized the grandiose assertions the inflated selfimportance the hints of imminent threat and it always provoked the same reaction in me a withdrawal verging on disgust a rapid emotional deepfreeze do you remember jerusalem sue asked remember those young people the ones who were killed i think of them often scotty i think of that young girl who came to me just when the chronolith was arriving when the tau turbulence was peaking her name was cassie do you remember what cassie said she thanked you she thanked me for something i hadnt done and then she died i think its possible she was as deep in the tau turbulence as anyone can be that the fact of her death had spilled over into the last minutes of her life i dont know exactly why she thanked me scotty and im not sure she knew either but she must have sensed something momentous sue turned her eyes away from me almost sheepishly an expression that returned us to the scale of the merely human i need to live up to that she said at least i need to try every two people who have ever fallen in love have a special place a beach a back yard a park bench by a library for ashlee and me it was a landscaped park a few blocks east of our apartment an ordinary suburban park with a concreterimmed duck pond and a playground and a cutgrass softball field we had come here often in the days after portillo when ash was recovering from the loss of adam and after i had severed my contacts with sue and company i had proposed marriage to her here we had brought food for a picnic but storm clouds came careening over the horizon and rain began to fall suddenly and copiously we ran as far as the softball field and sheltered on the roofed bleachers the air grew colder and the wet wind prompted ashlee to curl against my shoulder the parks huge elms reared back from the storm branches laced like fingers together and i chose that moment to ask ashlee whether she would consent to be my wife and she kissed me and said yes it was as simple and as perfect as that i took her there again the city had created perhaps too many of these parks in the urbanupgrade mania of the early century several had been rezoned for poverty housing or had deteriorated beyond all utility this one was an exception still stubbornly claimed by local families defended by a host of local ordinances patrolled after dark by community volunteers we arrived in the late afternoon of a day cooler than the scorching day before the kind of summer day so fine you want to fold it up and put it in your pocket there were picnickers by the pond toddlers swarming over the recently repainted swing sets and climbing gear we sat down on the untenanted softball bleachers we had bought takeout food on the way to the park stringy little chicken pieces fried in batter ashlee picked at hers listlessly her unease was obvious in every gesture i suppose mine was too i had originally planned at least perhaps to tell her about adam today lately i had understood that i wouldnt it was a decision by default arguably a failure of courage i still believed ash deserved to know adam was alive but sue was right too the news would hurt more than it would heal i couldnt bring myself to hurt ash that badly much as my conscience protested its out of decisions like this i suppose that fate is constructed board and nails like a gallows you remember the boy ashlee asked dabbing her lips with a napkin the little boy in the ball game we had come here one saturday not long after our wedding there had been a little league practice game in progress two coaches and a few parents sharing the bleachers with us the batter was a kid who looked like hed been raised on steak and steroids the kind of elevenyearold who has to shave before school the pitcher contrarily was a fairhaired waif with a talent for sinker balls unfortunately he left one up and over the plate the ball came off the bat and back to the mound before the elfin pitcher had time to get a glove up something off toward first base had distracted him and as he turned his head he was struck squarely in the temple silence then gasps and a couple of screams the pitcher blinked at the ground and fell fell looselimbed and suddenly and lay motionless on the bare dirt patch that served as a mound heres the odd part we werent parents or participants just casual observers on a lazy day off but i was on the phone to emergency services before anyone else in the bleachers had thought to reach into his pocket and ashlee who had some rn training reached the mound before the coach the injury wasnt serious ash kept the boy still and calmed the terrified mother until the paramedics arrived nothing unusual about the incident except that ash and i had both been so quick off the mark i remember i told her i learned something that day ashlee said i learned were both ready for the worst always maybe on some level expecting it me i guess its because of my dad ashlees father had been an alcoholic which often enough forces a child into premature adulthood and he had died of liver cancer when ashlee was just fifteen you because of your mom expecting the worst well yes of course and her voice rang briefly in my head scotty stop looking at me like that what that tells me ashlee said choosing her words carefully not meeting my eyes is that were pretty strong people weve faced up to some difficult things difficult as a murderous child resurrected from the dead so its all right ashlee said i trust you scott to do what you think is right you dont have to break it to me gently youre going away with them arent you just for a little while i said twentytwo we crossed the state border into wyoming on the day the governor abdicated one of the socalled omega militias had occupied the legislature for most of a week holding governor atherton among the sixty hostages the national guard finally cleared the building but atherton resigned as soon as he was released citing health reasons good ones he had been shot through the groin and the wound had been allowed to grow septic emotions ran high in other words out here in big sky country but all that political ferment was invisible from the road where we crossed into the state the highway was potholed and the vast ranchlands on either side had gone feral and dry in the wake of the retreating oglalla aquifer flocks of starlings populated the rusted ribs of irrigation piping part of the problem sue was saying is that people see the chronoliths as a kind of magic but theyre not theyre technology and they act like technology she had been talking about the chronoliths for at least five hours though not exclusively to me sue insisted on driving the last van in the convoy which contained our personal effects and her notes and plans we hitch or ray or i tended to rotate through the passenger seat sue had added a kind of nervous loquaciousness to her customary obsessive behavior she had to be reminded to eat magic is unlimited she said or limited only by allegedly the skill of the practitioner or the whims of the supernatural world but the limits on the chronoliths are imposed by nature and theyre very strict and perfectly calculable kuin broadcasts his monuments roughly twenty years into the past because thats the point at which the practical barriers become insurmountable any farther back and the energy requirements go logarithmic shoot up toward infinity for even a very tiny mass our convoy consisted of eight large enclosed military cargo trucks and twice that number of vans and personnel carriers sue had put together over the years a small army of likeminded individuals in particular the academics and grad students who had assembled the tauintervention gear and they were bookended in this expedition by the military posse all these vehicles had been painted uniforces blue so that we would resemble any number of other military convoys a commonenough sight even on these underpopulated western highways some miles past the border we pulled over to the margin of the road on a cue from the lead truck lining up for gas at a lonely little sunshine volatiles station sue switched off the forcedair cooler and i rolled down a side window the sky was boundless blue marked here and there with wisps of high cloud the sun was near zenith across a brown meadow more sparrows swirled over an ancient rustbrown oil derrick the air smelled of heat and dust there are all kinds of limits on the chronoliths sue went on her voice a sleepy drone mass for instance or more precisely massequivalency given that the stuff theyre made of isnt conventional matter you know theres never been a chronolith with a massequivalency greater than roughly two hundred metric tonnes not for lack of ambition on kuins part im sure hed build them to the moon if he thought he could but again past a certain point the energy bill shoots up exponentially stability suffers too secondary effects become more prominent do you know what would happen to a chronolith scotty if it was even a fraction over the theoretical mass limit i said i did not it would become unstable and destroy itself probably in a spectacular fashion its calabiyau geometry would just sort of unfold in practical terms that would be catastrophic but kuin had not been so unwise as to allow that to happen kuin i reflected had been pretty savvy all along and this did not bode well for our quixotic little voyage into the sunridden western lands i could use a coke sue said abruptly im dry as a bone would you fetch me a coke from the gas station if they have any to sell i nodded and climbed out of the van onto the pebbly margin of the road and walked up past the row of idling trucks toward the sunshine depot the fuel station was a lonely outpost an old geodesic half dome shading a convenience store and a row of rustspackled holding tanks the tarmac was lined with miniature windrows of loose dirt an old man stood in the doorway shading his eyes with his hand and looking down the long row of vehicles this was probably more custom than he had seen in the last two weeks but he didnt look particularly happy about it automated service modules groped under the carriage of the lead truck refueling and cleaning it charges were displayed on a big overhead panel its lens gone opaque in the wash of sun and grit hey i said looks like it hasnt rained around here for a while the gasstation attendant lowered his hand from his eyes and gazed at me obliquely not since may he said you got any cold drinks in there he shrugged soda pop some can i have a look he moved out of the doorway its your money the interior shade seemed almost frigid after the raw heat of the day there wasnt much stock on the stores shelves the cooler held a few cokes root beers orange pop i selected three cans at random the attendant rang up the sale peering at my forehead so intently that i began to feel branded something wrong i asked him just checking for the number number of the beast he said and pointed to a bumper sticker he had attached to the front of the checkout desk im ready for the rapture how about you i guess all im ready for i said is a cold drink what i figured he followed me out of the store and squinted down the line of trucks looks like the circus came to town he spat absentmindedly into the dust is there a key to the toilet on the hook around the side he hooked a thumb to the left show some mercy and flush when youre done the location of the arrival identified by satellite surveillance and refined by onthespot measurement of ambient radiation was as enigmatic and as unenlightening as so many other chronolith sites rural smalltown or otherwise relatively undestructive chronoliths were generally labeled strategic whereas citybusters like the bangkok or jerusalem stones were tactical whether this was a meaningful distinction or just happenstance was subject to debate the wyoming stone however clearly fell into the strategic category wyoming is essentially a high barren mesa interrupted by mountains the land of high altitudes and low multitudes a twentiethcentury governor had called it its oil reserves and its cattle business were hardly vulnerable to a kuin stone and in any case the projected arrival site featured neither of those resources featured nothing at all in fact apart from a few crumbling farm structures and prairiedog nests the nearest town was a postoffice village called modesty creek fifteen miles up a twolane tarmac road that ran through brown meadowland and basalt outcroppings and sparse stands of cottonwood we traversed this secondary road at a cautious speed and sue took time off from her monologue to admire the waves of sage and wild nettles as we approached our destination what purpose i asked her could a chronolith serve in a place like this i dont know she said but its a good and reasonable question to ask it must mean something its like playing a game of chess and suddenly your opponent moves his bishop off to the rim for no apparent reason either its an implausibly stupid mistake or its a gambit a gambit then a distraction false threat provocation lure but it didnt matter sue insisted whatever purpose the chronolith was meant to serve we would nevertheless prevent its arrival but the causality is extremely tangled she admitted very densely knotted and recomplicated kuin has the advantage of hindsight he can work against us in ways we cant anticipate we know very little about him but he might know a great deal about us by nightfall we had pulled all our vehicles off the road an advance party had already scouted the site and marked its rough perimeter with survey stakes and yellow tape there was enough light left in the sky for sue to lead some of us up a rise and from there we looked out across a meadow as prosaic as the surveyed ground of a shoppingmall project this was wild country originally part of a privatelyowned land parcel never cultivated and seldom visited at dusk it was a solemn place rolling prairie edged on its eastern extremity by a steep bluff the soil was stony the sagebrush gray at the end of a dry summer it would have been utterly quiet if not for the sound of the engineering crew pumping compressed air into the frames of a dozen inflatable quonsets atop the bluff an antelope stood in silhouette against the fading blue of the sky it raised its head scented us trotted out of view ray mosely stepped up behind sue and took her arm you can sort of feel it he said cant you the tau turbulence he meant if so i was immune to it there might have been a faint scent of ozone in the air but all i could feel for certain was the cooling wind at my back its a pretty place sue said but stark in the morning we filled it with earthmovers and graders and razored all its prettiness away the civilian telecom network like so many other public works had lately fallen into disrepair satellites dropped out of their orbits and were not replaced lightpipes aged and cracked the old copper wires were vulnerable to weather despite all that i was lucky enough the following night to get a voice line through to ashlee our first day at the dig had been enormously busy but surprisingly productive sues technical people had triangulated the center of the arrival site where the military engineers graded a level space and poured a concrete slab to serve as a foundation for the tauvariable device called the core for short it wasnt of course a nuclear core in the conventional sense but the fragment of exotic matter it was designed to produce required similar shielding both thermal and magnetic smaller foundations were poured for the several redundant diesel generators that would power it and for the smaller generators that ran our string of lights and our electronics by the second sunset we had turned our isolated highland into an industrial barrens of almost victorian bleakness and had frightened away an astonishing number of jackrabbits prairie dogs and snakes our lamps glowed in the darkness like the ancient sentinel fires of the crow or the blackfoot the sioux or the cheyenne the air stank of volatiles and plastic sue had assigned me lookout duty but that was so obviously a piece of makework that i had traded it for the less glamorous but infinitely more useful work of digging pit latrines and hauling lime just before sunset numb with exhaustion i carried my pocket terminal to the rising ground below the bluff and established the link with ashlee there was bandwidth enough for voice not images but that was all right it was her voice i needed to hear everything was fine she said the money hitch had advanced us was paying some bills we had long needed to pay and she had even taken kaitlin out to a couple of movies she didnt understand she said why it had been necessary to leave morris torrance there to keep an eye on her he was sitting in his car on the street outside the apartment he wasnt a nuisance she said but he made her feel like she was under surveillance which she was sue had been worried that kuinist elements might have traced her to minneapolis and i had insisted on protection for ash which took the form of the venerable but welltrained morris torrance doing reluctant guard duty i had refused to leave ashlee without protection if there was even a vague threat to her safety sue had chosen morris hes a nice enough guy ash said but its a little unnerving being shadowed by him just until i get back i told her too long think of it as a way to preserve my peace of mind think of it as a reason to come back soon soon as i can ash so whats it like wyoming i lost a syllable or two of that to dropout but took the gist wish you could see it the suns just gone down the air smells like sagebrush the air smelled like creosote and lime and hot metal but i preferred the lie the skys almost as pretty as you are bullshit i spent the day digging a latrine thats more like it i miss you ash you too she paused and there was a sound that might have been the security bell back home then she said i think theres somebody at the door ill call tomorrow tomorrow she echoed and then the line shut down completely but i couldnt reach her the next day we couldnt get a line through anywhere east of the dakotas despite all the multiple redundancies still embedded in the networks a bunch of nodal servers must have gone down ray mosely told me possibly due to yet another act of kuinist sabotage it was because of the communications problem that the dod media guru decided to alert the press a day earlier than we had planned there were lots of network video stringers still covering the unrest in cheyenne but it would take them at least another twentyfour hours to get to modesty creek where they were needed that next night the engineers erected a circle of achingly bright sulfurdot lamps we worked while the air was cool and the moon was up carving a blockhouse out of the dry earth a mile from the touchdown site burying cables and unrolling enormous lengths of link fence the fencing would keep out both sightseers and kuinists should any of them get wind of the effort hitch opined that it would keep out antelopes but not any number of larger mammals not without an armed guard but we had that too i crawled into my cot at sunrise bleeding from both my hands the siege was about to begin twentythree until now wed had the site to ourselves shortly the world would be with us and everything that implied not just press people but kuinists of all stripes though we hoped the isolated location and short notice would preclude a massive haj this is our haj sue had said more than once this one belongs to us so our uniforces troops arrayed themselves around our fenced perimeter and up along the bluff and we notified the highway patrol and state officials who were deeply unhappy with us for making our work public but lacked the authority to shut us down ray mosely figured we had at most twelve hours before the first outsiders began to arrive we had already managed to erect a cranelike superstructure above the poured foundation that would support the tau core and to rig and test all our ancillary equipment but we werent finished sue hovered around the large flatbed truck which contained the core itself secondguessing the engineers until ray and i distracted her with lunch we choked down milsurplus meals under a canvas tent while ray walked us through a checklist the work was ahead of schedule which served to calm some of sues fears at least briefly sue was what the doctors call agitated in fact she gave every indication that she was on the brink of nervous collapse she moved restlessly and aimlessly drummed her fingers blinked confessed she hadnt been able to sleep even when she was engaged in conversation her eyes tended to stray toward the concrete core emplacement and the glittering steel tubing of the support structure she continued to talk relentlessly about the project her immediate fear was that the press might be delayed or the chronolith arrive prematurely its not so much what we do here she said as what were seen to do here we dont succeed unless the world sees us succeed and i considered what a slender reed that really was we had only sues assurance that destroying a chronolith at the moment of its arrival might tip the balance of this shadow war might destabilize the feedback loop on which kuin allegedly depended but how much of that was calculation how much wishful thinking by virtue of her position and her fervent advocacy sue had been able to carry us all along with her invested as she was with the authority of her mathematics and her profound understanding of tau turbulence but that didnt mean she was necessarily right or even necessarily sane after lunch we watched as a crew of stevedores and a crane operator lifted the tau core from its crate and hauled it as delicately as if it were compressed dynamite to its resting place the core was a sphere three meters in diameter anodized black and studded with electronic ports and cable bays i gathered from what sue had told me that it was essentially a magnetic bottle in which some exotic form of cold plasma was already contained when the core was activated an array of internal highenergy devices would initiate fermionic decohesion and a few nearly massless particles of tauindeterminate matter would be created this material sue claimed would be sufficient to destabilize the arriving chronolith attempting to occupy its space what that meant was still unclear at least to me sue said the interaction of the competing tau spaces would be violent but not unduly energetic ie it would probably not wipe out all of modesty county and us along with it probably by sunset the core was fixed in place and linked to our electronics through a bundle of lightpipes and conductors jacketed in liquid nitrogen we still had much to do but the heavy lifting and digging was essentially finished the civilians celebrated with grilled flank steaks and generous rations of bottled beer a bunch of the older engineers gathered by the roadside after dinner talked about better days and sang old lux ebone songs much to the chagrin of the young uniforces troops i joined in on the choruses we suffered our first casualty that night isolated we might have been but there was still occasional traffic on the twolane county road that had brought us here we had men north and south along the roadside soldiers wearing the orange brassards of a highway work crew they carried glow torches and waved on anyone who seemed more than casually curious about our trucks and gear the strategy had worked reasonably well so far not long after moonrise however a man in a verdigrisgreen landau cut his motor and lights at the top of the northern rise and rolled silently into the breakdown lane not fifty feet from our lead truck in the shadows where the glow of the camp lights began to fade he stepped out onto the gravel berm with his back to two approaching security personnel and when he turned he revealed a heavy indeterminate shape that proved to be a pumpaction shotgun of ancient provenance he turned and fired it at the uniforces men killing one and permanently blinding the other fortunately the chief of security that night was a bright and welltrained woman named marybeth pearlstein who witnessed the act from a watch station fifty feet up the road a scant few seconds later she came around the bumper of the nearest truck with her rifle at ready and took down the assailant with one wellplaced shot the assailant turned out to be a copperhead crank well known to local police a county coroners truck pulled up two hours later and took the bodies away an ambulance carried the survivor into the modesty county medical center there might have been an inquest i suppose if events had turned out differently what i didnt know that is what i learned later pardon me but fuck these stupid and impotent words can you hear it grinding away under the printed page this outrage disinterred from the soil of too many years what i didnt know was that several of the texas pk militia the people hitch had told me about the people who had taken two of his fingers had already followed a trail of clandestine connections as far as the home of whitman delahunt whit it seemed had kept his colleagues informed of my comings and goings ever since i had traveled to portillo in search of kaitlin even then the pk and copperhead elites had taken an interest in sue chopra as a potent enemy or worse a commodity a potential resource i dont imagine whit could have foreseen the consequences of his actions he was after all only sharing some interesting information with his copperhead buddies who shared it with their friends and so on down the line from whits suburban universe all the way to the underground militant cadres in whits world consequences were always remote rewards were immediate else they were not rewards there was nothing genuinely political about whit delahunts copperhead leanings for whit the movement was a kind of rotary or kiwanis dues paid in the coin of information i doubt he ever really believed in a physical substantial kuin had kuin appeared before him whit would have been as dumbfounded as a sunday christian confronted by the carpenter of galilee which is not i hasten to add an excuse but im sure whit never envisioned these texas militiamen knocking at his door well after midnight entering his home as if it were their own because he was one of their own and extracting from him at gunpoint the address of the apartment where ashlee and i lived janice was present when this invasion took place she tried to persuade whit not to answer the invaders questions and when he ignored her she tried to phone the police for this unsuccessful effort she received a pistolwhipping that broke her jaw and fractured her collarbone they both would have been killed im sure if not for whits promise to keep janice under control he had nothing to gain by reporting any of this and im sure he told himself he was helpless to stop it and his potential further utility to the movement what neither whit nor janice could have known was that one of the militiamen had taken a longtime personal interest in the activities of sue chopra and hitch paley this was of course adam mills adam had returned to his hometown in a frenzy of antinostalgia delighted that the threads of his life had knotted back on themselves in such a strange and satisfying fashion it gave him a sense of destiny i suppose a feeling of profound personal significance had he known the phrase he might have considered himself deep in the tau turbulence adam had lost two fingertips to frostbite in the aftermath of portillo not coincidentally the same fingertips he later subtracted by machete from hitch and this had left him with a feeling of entitlement as if he had been anointed by kuin himself kait thank god was asleep in the apartment over the garage during these events there was noise but not enough to wake her she wasnt involved at least not yet sleepless in the aftermath of the roadside shooting i walked a little while with ray mosely on the cluttered ground between the core tower and the quonsets much of the camp had finally settled down and apart from the muted hum of the generators there was not much noise in effect it was possible at last to hear the silence to appreciate that there was a silence deep and potent out there beyond the pretension of the light i had never been close to ray but we had grown a little closer over the duration of this trip when i first met him he was the kind of booksmart underconfident overachiever who fears nothing so much as his own vulnerability it had made him defensive and brittle he was still that person but he was also the end result of years of compulsive denial middleaged now and a little more cognizant of his own shortcomings youre worried about sue he said i wondered whether i ought to talk about this but we were alone out of earshot nobody here but me and ray and the jackrabbits i said shes obviously under stress and shes not dealing with it particularly well would you in her position probably not but its the way she talks you know what i mean it starts to sound a little relentless and you begin to wonder whether shes sane whether the logic that brought us here is as airtight as she thinks it is ray seemed to consider this he put his hands in his pockets and gave me a rueful smile you can trust the math im not worried about the math were not here for the math ray were ten or fifteen leaps of faith beyond that youre saying you dont trust her what does that mean do i think shes honest yes do i think she means well of course she means well but do i trust her judgment at this point im not sure you agreed to come here with us she can be convincing ray paused and looked out into the darkness out past the tau core in its steel framework to the scrub and the moonlit wildgrass and the stars think about what shes given up scott think about the life she could have had she could have been loved he smiled wanly i know its obvious how i feel about her and i know how ridiculous that is how fucking clownlike how stupid shes not even heterosexual but if not me it could have been someone else one of those women shes always dating and ignoring splicing in and out of her life like a spare reel of film but she pushed those people away because her work was important and the harder she worked the more important her work became and now shes given herself to it altogether she belongs to it every step she ever took was a step toward this place right now i think even sue must be wondering whether shes delusional so we owe her the benefit of the doubt no ray said we owe her more than that we owe her our loyalty fond as ever of having the last word he chose that moment to turn and head back for camp i stayed behind standing mute between the moon and the floodlights from this distance the tau core seemed a small thing a very small thing with which to lever such a long result when i did sleep i slept soundly and long i woke at noon under the translucent roof of the inflated quonset alone but for a few offshift security staff and exhausted night crew no one had thought to wake me everyone had been too busy i stepped out of the shade of the quonset into blistering sunlight the sky was viciously bright a thin blue veneer between the prairie and the sun but it was the noise that struck me more immediately if youve ever been near a sports stadium on the day of a game you know that sound the rumble of massed human voices i found hitch paley by the food tent more press than we bargained for scotty he said theres a whole mob of them blocking the road we got highway patrol trying to clear them off the tarmac you know weve already been denounced in congress people covering their asses in case we dont bring this off you think we have a chance maybe if they give us time but no one wanted to give us time the kuinist militias were arriving by the truckload and by the following morning the shooting had begun in earnest twentyfour i know what the future smells like the future that is imposed on the past past and future mingled like two innocuous substances which when combined produce a toxin the future smells like alkaline dust and ionized air like hot metal and glacier ice and not a little like cordite the night had been relatively quiet today the day of the arrival i woke from a round of exhausted sleep to the sound of sporadic gunfire not close enough to inspire immediate panic close enough that i dressed in a hurry hitch was back at the food tent complacently eating cold baked beans from a paper bowl sit down he said its under control doesnt sound like it he stretched and yawned what you hear is a bunch of kuinists south along the road having words with security some of them are armed but all they want to do is shoot into the air and shake their fists basically theyre spectators what we also have is an equal number of journalists trying to get closer than the perimeter fences the uniforces are sorting them out sue wants them close to the arrival but not you know too close so how close is too close thats an interesting question isnt it the wonks and the engineers are all clustered down by the bunker the press people are setting up a little farther east the bunker socalled was a trench emplacement with a wooden roof located a mile from the core where sue had set up gear to monitor and initiate the tau event the trench was equipped with heaters to provide at least a little protection against the cold shock and in a worstcase scenario the bunker was defensible against smallarms fire the core itself remained almost preposterously vulnerable but the uniforces people had pledged to protect it as long as they could keep our perimeters intact the good news was that this ragtag crew of kuinists down the road did not hitch said constitute anything like a superior force we may just pull this off scotty he said given a little luck hows sue i havent seen her since sunrise but how is she wound up is how she is it wouldnt surprise me if she blew an artery he looked at me oddly tell me something how well do you know her ive known her since i was a student yeah but how well ive worked for her a long time too but i cant honestly say i know her she talks about her work and thats all she talks about at least to me is she ever lonely afraid angry this was an incongruous conversation to be having it seemed to me with the sound of rifle fire still popping down the road whats your point we dont know anything about her but here we are doing what she tells us which strikes me as peculiar when i think about it it struck me as peculiar too at least at that moment what was i doing here nothing but risking my life certainly nothing useful but that wasnt what sue would say youre waiting for your time she would say waiting for the turbulence i thought of what hitch had told me in minneapolis his flat declaration that he had killed people how well do any of us know each other its cooler this morning hitch said even in the sun you notice that it was some days before this that adam mills had arrived at his mothers door along with five thuggish friends and an assortment of concealed weapons i wont dwell on this adam of course was psychotic clinically psychotic i mean all the markers were there he was antisocial a bully and in a certain perverse way a natural leader his mental universe was a cluttered attic of secondhand ideology and blatant fantasy all centered on kuin or whatever it was he imagined kuin to be he had never formed the natural human attachment to family or friends he was by all evidence absent a conscience ashlee in her darker moods would blame herself for what adam had become but adam was a product of his brain chemistry not his upbringing a genome profile and some simple blood tests would have flagged his problem at an early age he might even have been treatable to some limited extent but ash had never had the money for that kind of upmarket medical intervention i cannot imagine and i do not wish to imagine what ashlee endured in her few hours with adam at the end of it she had revealed the location of the arrival site in wyoming and the fact that i was there along with hitch paley and sue chopra and the key fact which was that we expected to disable a chronolith she is not to be blamed for this the result was that adam had reliable information about the kuin stone and our efforts to destroy it a good fortyeight hours before the news reached the press adam promptly headed west but he left two of his followers behind to prevent ashlee from making any inconvenient calls he could have simply killed her but he elected instead to keep her in reserve possibly as a hostage bad as this was it was not the worst of it the worst of it was that kaitlin came to the apartment not long after adam left still ignorant of what had happened to janice and expecting to join ashlee for a leisurely lunch and maybe a movie in the evening the statistical measurement of lowlevel ambient radiation had been refined since jerusalem and portillo sues people were able to establish a much more accurate countdown for this arrival but we didnt need a countdown to feel it in the air heres how it stood when i climbed out of the bunker for a last breath of fresh air some twenty minutes before the core was due to be activated there had been more gunfire south along the highway and sporadically at various points along the perimeter fence so far local and state police had managed to contain the kuinists there was a lot of antikuinist sentiment in wyoming since the storming of the state house not least among civil servants and police one uniforces soldier had been injured by an omega militiaman attempting to run the fence in an atv and four armed kuinists of unknown affiliation had been shot to death in an effort to storm the northern checkpoint earlier this afternoon since then there had been only gestures and scattered arrests although the crowd was still growing sue had allowed a body of journalists to set up recording equipment well behind the bunker and i was able to see them from where i stood a line of trucks and tripods about a football fields length to the east there were dozens of these people most diverted here from cheyenne and they represented all the major news providers and not a few of the more respectable independents as many of them as there were they seemed lost in the brown vastness of the land a second contingent of independent journalists had set up their gear on the bluff above the site a little closer than sue would have liked but our media liaison called these folks very dedicated and insistent that is stubborn and stupid i could see their cameras too bristling above the rim rock many of our machine operators and manual laborers had already left the site the remaining civilian engineers and scientific crew were either crowded into the bunker now or watching from behind the line of journalists the tau core was suspended in its steel frame over the concrete pad like a fat black egg a plume of dust in the near distance was hitch paley bringing the last van of our original convoy up the graded access road from the highway to park it near the bunker all these vehicles had been coldproofed against the arrival also obvious was the tau chill the premonitory coolness of the air and not just of the air but of everything earth and flesh blood and bone we had lost only a fraction of a centigrade degree at this stage the cold shock was just beginning to ramp up but it was already perceptible a delicate prickling of the skin i took out my phone and made yet another attempt to reach ashlee the call failed to go through just as all my calls had failed to go through for most of a week now sometimes there was a general failure message from the system sometimes as now only a blank screen and a whisper of distorted audio i put the phone away i was surprised when sue chopra opened the steel bunker door and stepped out behind me her face was wan and she was visibly trembling she shaded her eyes against the sun i said shouldnt you be down below its all clockwork now she said it runs itself she stumbled over a mesquite root and i took her arm her arm was cold scotty she said as if recognizing me for the first time take a deep breath i said are you all right just tired and i didnt eat she shook her head quizzically the question that keeps coming to mind did something bring me here or did i bring myself thats the strange thing about tau turbulence it gives us a destiny but its a destiny without a god destiny with no one in charge unless its kuin she frowned oh no scotty dont say that not long now hows it look downstairs like i said clockwork good solid numbers youre right i need to go back but will you come with me why because theres actually a fairly high level of ionizing radiation out here youre getting a chest xray every twenty minutes and then she smiled but mainly because i find your presence reassuring it was a good enough reason and i would have gone with her but that was when we felt the crump of a distant explosion the sound of gunfire erupted again much closer than it should have been sue instinctively dropped to her knees idiotically i remained standing the firing began as a poppop staccato but immediately increased to a nearly continuous volley the fence and a big gate was yards behind us i looked that way and saw uniforces personnel taking cover and raising their weapons but the source of the fire wasnt immediately obvious sue had fixed her eyes on the bluff i followed her gaze wispy smoke issued from the uniforces observation point there the journalists she whispered but of course they werent journalists they were kuinists a group of militiamen bright enough to have highjacked a network truck outside of modesty creek and savvy enough to have passed themselves off plausibly to our mediahandlers at the gate five genuine net newspeople were later found beaten and strangled in the rabbitbrush twenty miles down the road a dozen less presentable kuinists in unmarked cars were smuggled in as technicians weapons were effectively hidden amidst a cargo of lenses broadcast apparatus and imaging gear these people installed themselves on the bluff overlooking the tau core near the uniforces observation point when they saw hitch bring the last truck up to the bunker they understood that to mean that the arrival was imminent they destroyed the uniforces outpost with an explosive device picked off any survivors then focused their efforts on the tau core i saw the puffs of smoke from their rifles faint against the blue sky they were too far from the core for accurate marksmanship but sparks flew where their bullets struck the steel frame behind us uniforces gatekeepers began to return fire and radioed for support unfortunately the bulk of the forces were concentrated at the south gate where the kuinist mob had begun to fire on them in earnest belatedly i squatted in the dirt next to sue the core is pretty heavily shielded the core is i guess but the cables and connectors are vulnerable the instrumentation scotty she rose and ran for the bunker i had no choice but to follow but first i waved in hitch who had just arrived and must have confused the gunfire from the bluff with the skirmish to the south of us but when he saw sues awkward headlong dash he understood the urgency the air was suddenly much colder and a wind came gusting from the dry prairie dustdevils marching like pilgrims into the heart of the tau event even the heated concretelined bunker was colder than sue had predicted as the thermal shock began to ramp up it numbed the extremities cooled the blood imposed a strange languid slowness on a sequence of terrifying events we all struggled into thermallyadaptive jackets and headgear as hitch sealed the door behind him like clockwork the taucore initiation process proceeded like clockwork it was immune at this point to human intervention technicians sat by their monitors with clenched fists nothing to do but hope a stray bullet didnt interrupt the flow of data i had seen the cores connectors and cables tefloninsulated and kevlarsheathed and thick as firehoses i didnt think conventional bullets fired from a great range posed much danger despite sues fears but the militiamen had brought more than rifles the countdown clock passed the fiveminute point when there was the rumble of a distant detonation dust shook down from the plank ceiling and the lights in the bunker winked off hit a generator i heard hitch say and someone else howled were fucking screwed i couldnt see sue i couldnt see anything at all the darkness was absolute there were nearly forty of us crowded into the bunker behind its elaborate earthworks our backup generator had obviously failed auxiliary batteries restored the pilot lights on the electronic gear but cast no useful light forty people in a dark enclosed space i pictured in my mind the entrance a steel door set at the top of a concrete stepway maybe a yard from where i stood fixing the direction in my mind and then the arrival the chronolith reached deep into the bedrock a chronolith absorbs matter and does not displace it but the cold shock fractured hidden veins of moisture creating a shockwave that traveled through the earth the floor seemed to rise and fall those of us who hadnt grabbed a handhold fell to the ground i think everyone screamed it was a terrible sound far worse than any physical damage done the cold got colder i felt sensation drain from my fingertips it was one of our engineers who panicked and pushed his way to the exit hatch i supect all he wanted was daylight wanted it so badly that the need had overcome his reason i was close enough to see him in the dim light from the console arrays he found the steps lunged upward on all fours touched the door handle the lever must have been shockingly cold he screamed even as he put his weight against it the handle chunked down convulsively and the door sprang outward the blue sky was gone replaced by curtains of screaming dust the engineer lurched out wind and sand and granules of ice swept in had sue anticipated an arrival as violent as this perhaps not the journalists lined up east of us must have been sprawled in the dirt by now and i doubted anyone was shooting from the bluff not anymore the thermal shock had peaked but our body temperatures were still dropping its an odd sensation cold yes indescribably cold but lazy deceptive narcotic i felt myself shivering inside my overworked protective clothing the shivering felt like an invitation to sleep stay in the bunker sue shouted from somewhere deep in the trench behind me youll all be safer in the bunker scotty close that door but few of the engineers and technicians heeded her advice they spilled out past me into the screeching wind running insofar as the cold allowed them to run more like a stumbling waltz toward the line of parked vehicles some few even managed to climb inside and start their engines these vehicles had been proofed against the cold shock but they roared like wounded animals pistons grinding against cylinders arrival winds had battered down the perimeter fence and the civilian faction of our convoy began to vanish into the teeth of the storm west of us where the chronolith must have been i could see nothing but a wall of fog and dust i pushed my way up the steps and pulled the hatch shut the engineer had left some skin on the frigid lever i left some of my own sue secured some battery lamps and began to switch them on maybe a dozen of us remained in the bunker as soon we had some light sue slumped down against one of the inert telemetry devices i reeled across the room and joined her almost fell against her our arms touched and her skin was shockingly cold as i suppose was my own ray was nearby but had closed his eyes and seemed only intermittently conscious hitch squatted by the door stubbornly alert sue put her head on my shoulder it didnt work scotty she whispered well think about that later but it didnt work and if it didnt work hush the chronolith had touched down the first chronolith on american soil and not a small one judging by the secondary effects sue was right we had failed but scotty she said her voice infinitely weary and bewildered if it didnt work what am i doing here what am i for i thought it was a rhetorical question but she had never been more serious twentyfive i suppose when history allows a degree of objectivity someone will write an aesthetic appreciation of the chronoliths obscene as this idea may seem the monuments are arguably specimens of art each one individual no two quite alike some are crude like the kuin of chumphon relatively small lacking detail like sandcast jewelry the work of a novice others are more finely sculpted though they remain as bleakly generic as works of soviet realism and more carefully considered for instance the kuins of islamabad or capetown kuin as gentle giant benevolently masculine but the most recognizable chronoliths are the monsters the citywreckers the kuin of bangkok straddling the rude brown water of the chao phrya the robed kuin of bombay the stern and patriarchal kuin of jerusalem seeming to embrace the worlds faiths even as religious relics lie scattered at his feet the kuin of wyoming surpassed all these sue had been right about the significance of this monument it was the first american chronolith a proclamation of victory in the heartland of a major western power and if its manifestation in this rural wasteland was an act of deference toward the great american cities the symbolism remained both brazen and unmistakable the cold shock eased at last we stirred out of our torpor and woke to a dawning awareness of what had happened here and what we had failed to achieve hitch characteristically gave first thought to the practical business of staying alive rouse up he said hoarsely we need to be away from here before the kuinists come looking for us which probably wont be long we need to avoid the main road too sue hesitated regarding the batterypowered gear lining the wall of the bunker the instrumentation blinked incoherently starved for input you too hitch said this could be important she said some of these numbers pegged awfully high fuck the numbers he ushered us stumbling to the door sue wailed at the sight of the chronolith dominating the sky ray came up behind her i followed hitch one of our few remaining engineers a grayhaired man named macgruder stepped out and promptly fell to his knees in an act of pure if involuntary worship the kuin was well it beggars description it was immense and it was frankly beautiful it towered above the nearest large landmark the stony bluff where the saboteurs had parked themselves of the tau core and its attendant structures there was of course no sign the skin of ice on the chronolith was already dropping away there had not been much moisture in the ambient air and the monuments details were unobscured save by the mists that sublimated from its surface wreathed in its own cloud it was majestic immense tall as a mountain from this angle the expression on the kuins face was oblique but it suggested a smug complacency the untroubled confidence of an assured conqueror ice crystals melted and fell around us as a fine cold mist the wind shifted erratically now warm now cool the main body of kuinists had gathered to the south of the site many of them must have been disabled by the thermal shock but the perimeter fence there veered a good couple of miles from the touchdown site and judging by the renewed crackle of gunfire they were still lively enough to keep the uniforces engaged soldiers closer to us had survived in their thermal gear but seemed disoriented and uncertain their communications equipment had shut down and they were rallying to the flattened ruins of the east gate of the militiamen who had disabled the tau core there was no sign ray told the remaining engineers and technicians who shuffled out of the bunker to stick with the uniforces the journalists in the lee of the bunker must have had a different thought they barreled past the fallen fence in their bulletproof vans they had acquired and were no doubt already broadcasting this stunning image the vast new kuin of wyoming our failure was an established fact ray said help me get sue to the van sue had stopped weeping but was staring fixedly at the chronolith ray stood next to her supporting her she whispered this isnt right of course it isnt right come on sue we need to get away she shook off rays hand no i mean its not right the numbers pegged high i need a sextant and a map theres a topographical map in the van but hitch hitch turned back i need a sextant ask one of the engineers the fuck hitch said a sextant hitch told ray to get the van started while he hurried back with a digital sextant and a tripod from the survey vehicle sue set up the instrument despite the gusting wind and scribbled numbers into her notebook ray said gently but firmly i dont think it matters anymore what taking measurements im not doing this she said briskly for fun but when she tried to fold up the tripod she fainted into rays arms and we carried her to the van i picked her notebook out of the icy mud hitch drove while ray and i got a cushion under sues head and a blanket over her body the uniforces people tried to flag us down a guard with a rifle and a nervous expression leaned in the window and glared at hitch sir i cant guarantee your safety yeah he said i know and gunned the engine we would be safer sue would be safer well away from here hitch cut across the flatlands on one of the local roads these were dirt trails that deadended most of them at failed ranches or dry cattle tanks not an especially promising escape route but hitch had always preferred back roads despite the elaborate coldproofing our engine had sustained damage in the thermal shock the van was kicking and dying by nightfall when we came within sight of a cinderblock shed with a crude tin roof we stopped here not because the building was in any way inviting many seasons of rain had come through the empty windows generations of field mice had built and abandoned nests inside but because it would serve to disguise our presence and would shelter the van from easy view we had at least put a few miles behind us and with nothing left to do the sun setting beyond the nowdistant but still dominating figure of kuin and a brisk wind combing the wild grass we huddled in the vehicle and tried to sleep we didnt have to try very hard we were all exhausted even sue slept though she had revived quickly from her faint and had been alert enough on the drive east she slept through the night and was up at dawn come morning hitch opened the vans engine compartment and ran the resident diagnostics ray mosely blinked at the noise but then rolled back to sleep i woke hungry remained hungry we had only emergency rations and walked past the paintscabbed wall of the shed to the place on the grassland where sue had once again unfolded our tripod and sextant the surveyors tool was aimed at the distant chronolith sue had opened a top map and laid it at her feet the corners weighted with rocks a brisk wind tousled her coiled hair her clothes were dirty and her enormous eyeglasses smudged but incredibly she managed to smile when she noticed me morning scotty she said the chronolith was an icy pillar silhouetted against the hazeblue horizon it drew the eye the way any incongruous or shocking thing does the kuin of wyoming gazed eastward from his pedestal almost directly at us aimed at us i thought like an arrow i said trying to restrain the irony are you learning anything a lot she faced me her smile was peculiar happysad her eyes were wide and wet too much way too much sue no dont say anything practical may i ask you a question i shrugged if you were packing for a trip to the future scotty what would you take what would i take i dont know what would you take i would take a secret can you keep a secret it was an unsettling question it was something my mother used to ask me when she began to bend into insanity she would hover over me like a malign shadow and say can you keep a secret scotty the secret was inevitably some paranoid assertion that cats could read her mind that my father was an impostor that the government was trying to poison her come on scotty sue said dont look at me like that if you tell me i said its not a secret anymore well thats true but i have to tell someone i cant tell ray because ray is in love with me and i cant tell hitch because hitch doesnt love anyone at all thats cryptic yes i cant help it she glanced at the far blue pillar of the kuin we may not have much time time for what i mean it wont last the chronolith it isnt stable its too massive look at it scotty see the way its sort of quivering thats heat coming off the prairie its an optical illusion in part not entirely ive run the numbers over and over the numbers that pegged back at the bunker these numbers her notebook i triangulated its height and its radius at least roughly and no matter how stingy i am with the estimates it comes up past the limit the limit remember if a chronolith is too massive its unstable if i could have published the work they might have called it the chopra limit her peculiar smile faded and she looked away i may be too vain for the work i have to do i cant let that happen i have to be humble scotty because i will god knows be humbled youre saying you think the chronolith will destroy itself yes within the day that would hardly be a secret no of course but the cause of it will be the chopra limit is my work i havent shared it with anyone and i doubt anyone else is doing triangulation the kuin wont last long enough for accurate measurement this was making me nervous sue even if this is all true people will know know what all anyone will know is that the chronolith was destroyed and that we were here trying to destroy it theyll draw the obvious conclusion that we succeeded if a little belatedly the truth will be our secret why a secret because i mustnt tell scotty and neither must you we have to carry this secret at least twenty years and three months into the future or else it wont work dammit sue what wont work she blinked poor scotty youre confused let me explain i couldnt follow every detail of her explanation but this is what i came away with we had not been defeated plenty of press folks were doubtless still reporting the arrival and they would also witness in a matter of hours if not minutes the spectacular collapse of the chronolith that broadcast image would sue claimed interrupt the feedback loop and shatter kuins aura of invincibility win or lose kuin would no longer be destiny he would be reduced to the status of an enemy and the world must think we had succeeded the chopra limit must remain a closelyheld secret because sue believed it was not a coincidence that this chronolith had surpassed the physical limit of stability it was she declared quite obviously an act of sabotage contemplate that the sabotage of a chronolith by design who would commit such an act clearly an insider clearly someone who understood not only the crude physics of the chronoliths but their finest nuances someone who understood the physical limits and knew how to push them that arrow sue said almost sheepishly shocked at the temerity of her words and not a little frightened that arrow is pointing at me of course it was madness it was megalomania selfaggrandizing and selfabnegating both at once sue had elevated herself to the rank of shiva creator destroyer but a part of me wanted it to be true i think i wanted an end to the long and disruptive drama of the chronoliths not just for my sake but for ashlees for kaitlins and i wanted to trust sue after a lifetime of doubt i think i needed to trust her i needed her madness to be miraculously divine hitch was still working on the van when the twelve motorcycles came down the access road in a billow of gray dust they came from the direction of the chronolith sue and i scurried back to the shed as soon as we spotted them by that time ray had alerted hitch hitch had come out from under the engine block and was loading and passing out our four handguns i took one of these gratefully but just as quickly disliked the way it felt in my hand cold and faintly greasy more than the sight of the approaching strangers who were almost certainly kuinists but could have been anyone it was the pistol that made me feel afraid a weapon is supposed to boost your confidence but in my case it only served to emphasize how vulnerable we were how desperately alone ray mosely tucked his gun under his belt and began frantically thumbing his pocket phone but we hadnt been able to get a call out for days and he wasnt having any better luck now the attempt seemed almost reflexive and somehow pitiable hitch held out a gun for sue but she pressed her hands to her sides no thank you she said dont be stupid i was able to hear the motorcycle engines now the sound of locusts a plague descending keep it she said i wouldnt know what to do with it id probably shoot the wrong person she looked at me when she said this and i was inexplicably reminded of the young girl in jerusalem who had thanked sue just before she died her eyes her voice had conveyed this same cryptic urgency we dont have time to argue hitch had taken charge he was alert and focused frowning like a chess player facing a skilled opponent the concreteblock shed possessed a single door and three narrow windows an easy space to defend but a potential death trap if we were overwhelmed but the van wouldnt have been any safer maybe they dont know were here ray volunteered maybe theyll ride on past maybe hitch said but i wouldnt count on it ray put a hand on the butt of his pistol he looked at the door at hitch at the door as if trying to work out some perplexing mathematical question scotty sue said im depending on you but i didnt know what she meant theyre slowing down hitch said maybe theyre not kuinists ray said maybe theyre nuns on a day trip but dont count on it their disadvantage was they had no cover the land here was flat and grown over with sagegrass clearly aware of their vulnerability the bikers came to an idling stop a distance from the shed out of easy range watching through the gap in the cinderblocks that passed as a westfacing window what struck me was the incongruity of all this the day was fine and cool the sky as cloudless as crystal even the perhaps unstable chronolith seemed fixed and placid on the horizon the small sound of sparrows and crickets hung in the air and yet here were a dozen armed men straddling the road and no help for many miles one of the bikers put his helmet in his hand shook out a flourish of dirty blond hair and began walking almost lazily down the dirt track toward us and ill be flicked hitch said if that isnt adam mills we were deep in the tau turbulence i guess sue might have said in that place where the arrow of time turns on itself and turns again that place where there are no coincidences we just want the lady adam mills called from a short distance down the road his voice was harsh and highpitched it was in some ways almost a parody of ashlees voice bereft that is of all warmth and subtlety we have some strange history behind us ash had once said your crazy mother my crazy son what lady would that be hitch called back sulamith chopra im the only one here i believe i recognize that voice mr paley isnt it yes ive heard that voice last time i think you were screaming hitch declined to answer but i saw him clench the fingers what remained of them of his left hand just send her out and well be away from here can you hear me ms chopra we dont mean to harm you shoot him ray whispered just shoot the fucker ray if i shoot him theyll just put a rocket in this window of course they might do that anyhow its all right sue said suddenly and calmly none of this is necessary ill go which surprised hitch and ray if not me some sense of her intention had begun to dawn hitch said now thats just fucking ridiculous you have no idea these people are mercenaries worse they have a pipeline straight to asia theyd be happy to sell you into the hands of some wouldbe kuin youre merchandise as far as theyre concerned i know that hitch highpriced merchandise and for a good reason you really want to hand over everything you know to some chinese warlord id shoot you myself if i thought youd do that sue was as placid now at least superficially as a martyr in a medieval painting but thats exactly what i have to do hitch looked away his head was silhouetted in the window had it occurred to him to do so adam mills could have taken him out with a wellplaced head shot ray horrified said sue no and the tableau was sustained for a fragile moment hitch gapjawed ray on the brink of panic sue gave me a very quick and meaningful look our secret scotty keep our secret hitch said you mean that yes i do he turned his weapon away from the window the building in which we were trapped had probably been erected during one or another of the states cyclical oil booms perhaps to keep prospecting gear out of the rain not that it seemed to rain much here the concrete floor was adrift with everything that had blown through the open door frame in fifty or seventyfive years dust sand vegetable matter the desiccated remains of snakes and birds hitch stood at the west wall where the cinderblocks were waterstained and eroded sue and ray were together in the northwest corner and i stood across from hitch at the eastern wall the light was dim despite the brightness of the day and the air a little cooler than the dry air of the prairie though that would change as sun began to bake the tin roof cross drafts stirred up dust and the scent of ancient decay i remember all this vividly and the sagging wooden roof beams and the angled sunlight through the empty window and the dry sagebrush clustered just beyond the doorway and the glint of sweat on hitch paleys forehead as he aimed his pistol but only tentatively at sue sue was pale a vein pulsed in her throat but she remained quiet point that fucking gun away ray said ray in his tangled beard and sweatstained tshirt looked like a middleaged academic gone feral his eyes were just that wild but there was something admirable in this strained declaration of defiance a fierce if fragile courage im serious hitch said she does not go out that door i have to go sue said im sorry ray but she had taken a single step when ray slammed her back into the corner restraining her with his body nobodys going anywhere you going to sit on her till doomsday hitch asked put your gun down i cant do that ray you know i cant do that and now ray lifted his own weapon stop threatening her or ill but this was beyond the bounds of hitch paleys patience let me say in defense of hitch that he knew adam mills he knew what was waiting for us out there in the relentless sunlight he was not about to surrender sue and i think he would have died rather than surrender himself he shot ray in the right shoulder at this proximity a killing wound i believe i heard the bullet pass through ray and strike the stone wall behind him a sound like a hammerblow on granite or it might have been the echo of the gunshot itself deafening in this enclosed space dust rose up around us i was frozen in my own incredulity there was a cough of answering shots from outside and a bullet chinked the cinderblocks near the western window sue suddenly pinned behind the weight of rays body gasped and pushed him aside she whispered oh ray im sorry im so sorry tears stood in her eyes there was blood on her tattered yellow blouse and blood on the wall behind her ray wasnt breathing the wound or the shock had stopped his heart a bloodbubble formed on his lips and sat there inert he had loved sue hopelessly and selflessly for many years but once she had stepped across his motionless legs sue didnt look back she walked toward the door staggered but didnt fall the air stank of blood and cordite outside adam mills was shouting something but i couldnt make out the words over the ringing in my ears the kuin of wyoming watched all this from the western horizon i could see the monument framed in the window behind hitch blue on blue drowsy in the rising heat stop hitch said bluntly sue shuddered at the sound of his voice but took another step i wont warn you again you know i wont and i heard myself say no hitch let her go our secret sue had said and it isnt a secret if you tell someone so why had she shared it with me at that moment i thought i knew the understanding was bitter and awful sue took yet another step toward the door in the sunlight beyond her a swallow rose out of the dry grass suspended in the air like a piano note keep out of it hitch told me but i was more familiar with handguns now than i had been at portillo when hitch saw my pistol aimed at him he said this is fucking insane she needs to do this hitch kept his own gun trained on sue sue nodded and approached the door as if each step drew down a failing reserve of strength and courage thank you scotty she whispered i will shoot you hitch said if you do not stop where you are no i said you wont he growled it was precisely that sound like a cornered animal scotty you cowardly fuck ill shoot you too if i have to put your weapon down and you sue i said stop right there sue hunched her shoulders as if against the impact of a bullet but she was already in the frame of the door she took another step for a moment hitchs weapon wavered toward me toward sue then suddenly resolute he took aim at her back the arch of her spine her big bowed head he began and i know how absurd it seems to claim to have witnessed this but in the overweening stillness of the moment in the shadow of this bright benevolent afternoon and all of us balanced on the fulcrum of time i swear i saw his meaty dark finger begin to close on the trigger of the gun but i was faster the recoil threw back my hand did i kill hitch paley im not an objective witness im testifying in my own defense but i am finally here at the end of my life honest i have no more secrets to keep the gun recoiled the bullet was in the air at least and then and then everything was in the air brick mortar wood tin the dust of ages my own body a projectile hitch and the corpse of ray mosely ray who had loved sue far too much to allow her to do what she had to do and hitch who did not love anyone at all did i see people have asked me the destruction of the chronolith was i a witness to the fiery collapse of the kuin of wyoming did i see the bright light and did i feel the heat no but when i opened my eyes again pieces of the chronolith were falling from the sky falling all around me pieces the size of pebbles rendered now as conventional matter and fused by the heat of their extinction into glassy blue teardrops twentysix in the great release of energy as the chronolith collapsed a shockwave swept outward from its perimeter more wind than heat but a great deal of heat more heat than light but it had been bright enough to blind the cinderblock shelter lost its roof and its northern and western walls i was blown free of it and woke a few yards from the standing fragments for some period of time i was not quite coherent or fully conscious my first thought was for sue but sue was nowhere visible gone as well was adam mills and so were his men and their motorcycles though i did find later one overturned daimler motorbike abandoned in the scrub its fuel tank cracked and a single helmet and a tattered copy of the fifth horseman do i believe sue gave herself up to the kuinists in the aftermath of the explosion yes i do the shockwave would likely not have been deadly to anyone in the open it was the collapse of the stone shed that had caused my concussion and dislocated my shoulder not the shockwave itself sue had been in the doorway which was still standing i found hitch and ray partially buried in the nibble plainly dead i spent a few hours trying to dig them out working with my good hand until it became obvious that the effort was futile as well as exhausting then i rescued some dried rations from the overturned van and ate a little choking over the food but keeping at least some of it down when i tried my phone there was only a clatter of noise a distorted no signal message drifting across the screen as if through an obscuring tide the sun went down the sky turned indigo and then dark on the western horizon where the chronolith had been brushfires burned brightly i turned and walked the other way twentyseven lately i have visited two significant places the wyoming crater and the shipworks at boca raton one a lake polluted with memory the other a gateway to a greater sea and i thought but no ill get to that ashlee had been released from the hospital by the time i made it back to minneapolis i had been in the hospital myself or at least a little overnight emergencycare clinic in pine ridge three days wandering with a head injury in the wyoming backlands had left me sunburned hungry and too weak to climb stairs at any speed my left arm was in a sling ashlee was less fortunate she had warned me of course but i wasnt prepared for what i found when i let myself into the apartment and she called my name from the bedroom the hurt to her body the burns the contusions were invisible under the snowy white linen of the bed but i winced at the sight of her face i wont catalog the damage i reminded myself that it would heal that the blood pooled in these bruises would fade away that the broken skin would mend around the sutures and that one day soon she would be able to open her eyes all the way she looked at me through purple slits that bad she said some of her teeth were missing ashlee i said im so sorry she kissed me wounded as she was and i held her gently despite my damaged arm she began to apologize in return she had been worried that i wouldnt forgive her for having finally broken and told adam mills where to find me god knows i wanted to apologize for having left her to this but i put my finger delicately delicately against her swollen lips why dignify the horror with recrimination we had survived we were together that was enough what i had not known what i learned after i finally contacted ashlee was that morris torrance hadnt abandoned his post outside the apartment adam mills had identified morris as a guard and had taken his men into the building through a rear entrance to avoid alerting him morris called ash shortly before adam arrived placing her in the apartment and he had seen no suspicious activity since then he logged off after midnight and drove back to the marriott for a few hours of sleep he wore a tag alert in case ashlee needed him in the interim he received no such alarm in the morning he called ash again but couldnt get past her screen routine he promptly drove to the apartment not long after kaitlin had arrived there and unsuccessfully attempted another call deeply concerned now morris buzzed ashlee from the lobby she answered the buzzer belatedly and her voice was slurred morris told ashlee he was from a package delivery service and he needed her to sign his slate ash who must have recognized his voice told him she couldnt come to the door right now and asked whether it would be all right if he came back another time he told her could come back but that the package was labeled perishable didnt matter ashlee said morris then stepped out of camera range phoned the local police and reported an assault in progress and let himself into the lobby with the key i had given him he identified himself incorrectly and illegally as a federal agent to the superintendent of the building and obtained a master key to the apartment he knew how long it might take for a police response and he elected not to wait he rode the elevator to our floor placed another call to the apartment so that the ringing of the phone would mask the sound of the key in the lock and entered the apartment with his gun drawn he was as he had so often told me a retired agent without field experience but he had been trained and he had not forgotten his training kaitlin at this point was locked in a bedroom closet and ashlee was sprawled on the sofa where she had been left after a beating without hesitation morris shot the man who was standing over ash then turned his gun on the second kuinist who had just stepped out of the kitchen the second man dropped a bottle of beer at the sound of the shot and drew his own gun he took morris off his feet with one shot but morris was able to return fire after he had fallen the diningroom table gave him a little cover he placed two bullets in the assailants head and neck wounded in the leg the bullet had carved a divot in his thigh just like the bullet sue chopra took in jerusalem morris was nevertheless able to comfort ashlee and to release kaitlin from the locked closet before he fainted kait who was mobile but had been beaten and raped put a pressure bandage on the wound before the police arrived ashlee rose from the sofa and loped to the bathroom she soaked a cloth in water and daubed the blood from morriss face and then kaitlins and then her own it was foolhardy morris said when i went to the hospital to thank him it was the right thing to do he shrugged well yeah i think so too he was in a wheelchair his damaged leg suspended in front of him swathed in regenerative gels and wrapped in a cast they ought to hang a red flag on this he said i owe you more than i can ever repay dont get sentimental scotty but he seemed a little teary himself ashlees all right improving i said kaitlin its hard to say theyre bringing david home from little rock he nodded we sat silently for a time then he said i saw it on the news the wyoming stone coming down took a while but sue got what she wanted right she got what she wanted shame about hitch and ray i agreed and sue he gave me a meaningful look hard to believe shes really gone believe it i said because a secret isnt a secret if you share it you know im an oldfashioned christian scotty im not sure exactly what sue believed in unless it was that hindu shiva bullshit but she was a good person wasnt she the best right well i couldnt figure out why she asked me to stay here and took you to wyoming with her no offense but that really bothered me but i guess i served a purpose here that you did my friend you think she had that in mind all along i mean she did have a thing for the future i think she knew us both pretty well she took me i thought because morris wouldnt have served in my place he would never have let her walk into the jaws of the wolf he would certainly not have killed hitch paley morris was a good man twentyeight lately i have visited two significant places traveling isnt easy for me these days medication keeps my various geriatric complaints under control im healthier at seventy than my father was at fifty but age breeds its own weariness we are buckets of grief i think and eventually we fill to brimming i went alone to wyoming the wyoming crater today is a minor if unique war memorial for most americans wyoming was only the beginning of the twentyyear war of the chronoliths for that generation kait and davids generation the memorable battles were the persian gulf canberra first beijing canton province after all no one much died at wyoming no one much the crater is fenced and managed as a national monument now tourists can climb to a platform at the summit of the bluff and gaze down on the ruins from a distance but i wanted to get closer than that i felt entitled the parks service guard at the main entrance told me that would be impossible until i explained that id been here in and showed him the scar that runs up from my left ear to my receding hairline the guard was a veteran armored cav canton the bloody winter of he told me to stick around until the visitors center closed at five then hed see what he could do what he did was allow me to ride with him on the evening security inspection we took a golfcartsized vehicle down a steep path and parked at the rim of the crater the guard scrolled a newspaper and pretended not to keep an eye on me while i wandered a few minutes in the long shadows there had been almost an inch of rain this may the shallow crater cupped a tiny brown pond at the bottom of it and sagebrush bloomed along the rilled eroded walls some few fragments of the kuin stone remained intact these had also eroded tau instability the unraveling of complex calabiyau knots had rendered the final substance of the chronolith as a simple fused silicate gritty blue glass nearly as fragile as sandstone there had been airstrikes here during the western secession when american kuinists had controlled these parts the militias had claimed the state during the darkest hours of the war had presumably though there were no surviving witnesses attempted to revise history by rebuilding and rebroadcasting the enormous kuin of wyoming but they had been illadvised by someone someone who had convinced them to push the stability envelope past its limit history does not record the name of this benefactor a secret is a secret but as sue was also fond of saying there is no such thing as a coincidence i stood for a time by a fragment of the kuins head a weathered piece of his brow and one intact eye the pupil of the eye was a concave depression as wide as a truck tire dust and rain had accumulated in the bowl of it and a wild thistle had sprouted there the chronoliths have proven as impervious to history as they are to logic the act of creating such a device is so fraught with tau turbulence and outright paradox cause and effect so tightly entangled that no single narrative has emerged the past rays minkowski ice i suppose is immutable but its structure has been finely fractured layers compressed and upturned in places rendered chaotic and uninterpretable the stone was cold to the touch i cannot truthfully say that i prayed i dont know how to pray but i pronounced a few names in the privacy of my mind words addressed to the tau turbulence if anything remains of it sues name among others i thanked her then i begged the dead to forgive me the park guard eventually grew impatient he escorted me back to the cart as the sun touched the horizon guess you have some stories to tell he said a few and a few i havent told until now was there ever a single substantial kuin a human kuin i mean if so he remains an elusive figure overshadowed by the armies who fought in his name and invented his ideology there surely must have been an original kuin but i suspect he was overthrown by any number of successors perhaps as sue had speculated each chronolith required its own kuin kuin became little more than a name for the vacuum at the heart of the whirlwind the king is unborn long live the king after ashlees death late last year i was obliged to sort through her belongings deep in a box of ancient papers expired ration coupons tax forms yellowed pastdue notices from utility companies i found adam mills birth certificate the only striking thing about this was that adams middle name happened to be quinn and that ashlee had never mentioned it to me but this is i think at last a genuine coincidence at least thats what i prefer to believe im old enough now to believe what i choose to believe what i can bear to believe kait left david at home and joined me at boca raton that summer an unplanned vacation we hadnt seen each other since ashlees funeral in december i had come to boca raton on a whim i wanted to see the shipworks while i was still able to travel nowadays everyone talks about the postwar recovery were like terminal patients granted a miracle cure sunshine seems sunnier the world such as it is is our oyster and the future is infinitely bright inevitably we will all be disappointed but not i hope too badly and there are some things of which we are quite reasonably proud the national shipworks for instance i remember around the time of the portillo arrival sue chopra insisting that the technology of calabiyau manipulation would yield a host of more enduring wonders than the chronoliths i mean star travel scotty thats a real possibility and sue as usual had been right she had an acute sense of the future kait and i walked slowly up a long promenade to the observation level overlooking the launching bays a vast halfmoonshaped structure walled with reinforced glass kait took my arm i need a little help on long walks we talked some but not about the large issues of our lives this was a vacation so many things had changed foremost of course i had lost ashlee ash had died of an unsuspected aneurysm late last year and i was a widower now but we had enjoyed many good years together despite the wartime privation and the financial crises i miss her constantly but i did not discuss this with kaitlin nor did we discuss kaits mother retired and living relatively comfortably in washington state or whit delahunt who was spending his declining years in a federal project outside st paul serving a twentyyear home incarceration and community service sentence for sedition all this was past today we believed in the possibility of a future the observation deck was crowded with children a school field trip come to witness the latest unmanned launch the probe stood in its launch cradle a half mile away like a blue jewel a sculpted glacier time is space the tour guide was saying if we can control one we can control the other sue might have quibbled with the word control but the kids didnt care about that they had come for a spectacle not a lecture they talked and shifted restlessly from foot to foot they pressed their hands and some their noses against the glass theyre not afraid kaitlin marveled nor were they startled at least not much when the tau ceti probe rose as if by slow magic from its bay and glided noiselessly upward they were impressed i think to see so massive an object lofted like a balloon into the cloudless florida sky a perceptive few might have been awed but no they were not afraid they know so little of the past i want them not to forget which is i suppose what all aged veterans want but theyll forget of course they will and their children will know less of us than they do and their childrens children will find us barely imaginable which is as it should he you cant stop time sue taught me that and ashlee in her own way you can give yourself to time or be taken by it its not as hard a truth as it sounds not on a clean bright day like this are you all right kaitlin asked im fine i said just a little breathless we had walked a long way and the day was warm
