ian slater world in flames in the assessment of every member not only of the united states but of all nato allies of all the intelligence agencies the strategic capability of the soviet union today is much much greater than it was before mr gorbachev came on the scene senator daniel inouye united states congress july prologue the commandant for kremlin or citadel security is always a general and he uses falconers to send their goshawks to attack and frighten away the hundreds of crows if the crows were left alone they would defecate on and otherwise disturb the peace and dignity of the seat of soviet government the falcons in the kremlin date back at least fifty years the use of gunfire to rid pests from the kremlins sixtythree acres is strictly forbidden for in times of political unrest as in the gorbachev days when the yeltsinites and other antisoviet elements were allowed to mass in red square it was feared that even a single shot from within the citadel might be interpreted by the masses outside as the signal of a new revolution in wartime it becomes imperative that no shots be heard coming from within the seat of government and that therefore only falcons be used to kill pests chapter one as easily as he had shed his naval uniform for his civilian clothes robert brentwood slipped a pillow beneath his new bride and immediately felt the difference their bodies closer now her fragrance rising engulfing him as in a dream but he knew anything could break the spell outside the winter darkness howled along scotlands rugged west coast and from the upstairs bedroom of the bedandbreakfast they could hear the proprietors dog challenging late arrivals the spaniels barking rising above the crashing of the waves moments later they heard the slam of a car door saw the glow of the front porch light immediately beneath their upstairs room heard voices then felt the tremor as the door banged shut the old stairs groaning as the owner his hushed voice as offputting to rosemary as the dogs barking led his guests two of them as far as robert could tell up to the other oceanfront room across the hall from robert and rosemarys it was well past midnight unusually late for checking into a b and b but rosemary thought nothing of it at the time instead she was wondering how it was that her husband of only a few days knew to do that with the pillows for her there had been no one else before their marriage and when they were first engaged in surrey while he was on leave from his command of his sub the uss roosevelt and theyd first made love he had told her that it had been the same for him that despite the myths about sailors especially american ones thered been no one else but her but now her mounting pleasure was stemmed by itself her moment of doubt mightnt have bothered her but she was carrying his child and any passing suspicion was in danger of becoming an id√©e fixe where did you learn to do that she asked trying not to sound concerned with the pillows in one of your submarine manuals everything slowed and robert sensed thered be time out before she could relax enough for them to start again but he knew better than to show any annoyance matter of fact he replied i did get it from a manual missile launch dont be vulgar she said smiling but he could tell the tone was conditional he loved her very much but the war and his part in it as captain of the most powerful ship in history a sea wolf ii dualpurpose hunterkiller and ballistic missile nuclear submarine had already taken its toll on rosemary since they had become engaged he couldnt deny that her worry was justified the sea wolf iis with their six warhead trident c missiles were the most soughtafter targets of the russian navy but in just the few days since they had been married on their way up to the honeymoon in scotland he had noticed how her worry had become tinged with obsession she was like a student before formal exams or a job applicant before an allimportant interview a case of freefloating anxiety in her case about the war she could do nothing about the anxiety searching albeit unconsciously for something tangible like a dog with a bone over which it might worry and have some measure of control the only problem was that her anxiety was nondiscriminating as likely to alight on a minor inconvenience of food rationing as it was to shift abruptly to the difficulties of teaching shakespeare to her st anselms sixth form in surrey or the terror of the increasing russian rocket attacks across the channel at other times she would be seized by the kind of debilitating depression that still assailed her mother following the loss of young william spence rosemarys brother killed on one of the atlantic convoys which robert brentwood and other sub skippers had been assigned to protect tonight her anxiety about the future manifested itself in the suspicion that she had not been roberts only love when theyd first met robert had found her more confident even fatalistic about the war but now it was as if their marriage the very thing that should fill them with hope and optimism in hard times had suddenly inundated her with concerns shed never had before would the child be all right or would the severe wartime rationing deform him or her and what kind of a world would it be after the war if there would be any world at all if it should suddenly go nuclear she pulled the bedclothes up protectively about her against the mournful moaning of the wind perhaps like the change in the weather everything had happened too fast she mused perhaps they should have waited longer got to know one another better you told me robert said quietly that knowing someone isnt a matter of time and you were right besides theres nothing and you told me she said lowering her voice suddenly aware of how sound carried in the old house that i was your first and only you were the first he said his finger cupping her chin turning her head toward his on the pillow his right arm cradling her so close he could feel her heart thumping there wasnt anyone before you she sighed i wouldnt really care if there had yes you would he told her softly im glad she snuggled into him oh i know its terribly oldfashioned that its not supposed to matter anymore how many people youve slept with or whom but it does to me he said nothing watching her breasts rising and falling i did read about the pillows in a magazine he said kissing her cheek hmm she teased he pulled her closer her breasts warm and full her nipples hardening against him you must think me an awful old prude she said in the first place thirty isnt exactly oldim the one thats old when i hit fortyfour next year theyll retire me from roosevelt thats old in the second place youre not a prude what magazine did you get it from she asked playboy i expect actually i think it was cosmopolitan article on navy wiveshow to home in your torpedo robert she said her expression halfway between laughter and feigned shock you certainly wouldnt have said that before we were married no he admitted his hands slipping beneath the covers the faint glow from the porch light disappeared the room plunged again into total darkness and they heard the proprietor walking creakily along the corridor on the ground floor rosemary pulled the covers over them father warned me the scots didnt believe in central heating its freezing in here never mind said robert ill keep you warm rosemary her jasmine perfume filling their cave moved closer to him kissing him gently at first then her tongue hungrily seeking his when he came up for air he asked where did you learn that oh ive had at least a dozen lovers you wouldnt believe his hand slipped down between her thighs and soon he entered her and slowly they began moving in harmony then bonehard against each other she clutching at him tightly wantonly exciting him so much he knew that unless he diverted his attention he would climax first easing himself up slightly on his elbows not breaking the rhythm but decreasing pressure he tried to think of something completely nonsexual something to do with his work he seized upon the deliberately repetitious almost mechanical routine of roosevelts missile control verification procedure for the hunterkillers six trident c missiles in two rows of three situated immediately aft of the sail each of the fortyeight warheads containing more then forty times the power of the hiroshima bomb should the war go nuclear theyd be fired in ripple or alternate sequence the first number one missile sliding out of its sheath being the first one on the port side behind the sail the next missile to be fired not one adjacent to it but rather number six diagonally opposite to it and farthest away on the starboard side this would maintain the most stable buoyancy mode for the footlong sub preventing excessive lean which if not corrected for would cause wobble which in turn would upset the launch trajectory of the remaining missiles it was a sequence that robert brentwood nightly prayed hed never have to set in motion but was prepared to do so if it came to that meanwhile the thought of a missile breaking through its protective sheath he discovered was no help in calming him down robert rosemary murmured arching her back her breathing faster shallower he lowered himself closer to her and could feel her nipples pressing into him robert robert then he could hear the latecomers again in the room across the hallway talking rosemary was moving faster and faster beneath him clutching his buttocks so tightly he could feel her nails digging in his left hand beneath her neck lifting her he kissed her his other hand grasping the edge of the mattress so hard its inner spring gave like foam rubber his fist squeezing it to nothing darling darling she murmured almost beyond control and he could hear one of the latecomers padding out into the hall heading toward the bathroom if they flushed the toilet and put her off in moscow general kiril marchenko once special adviser to president suzlov and now minister for war was strolling in the kremlins snowmanteled taynitsky garden it was the coldest december night in fifteen years but marchenko had ignored the plummeting temperatures eagerly seeking the fresh albeit frigid air during the recess from the stavka supreme headquarters meeting where the atmosphere had been thick with bluishgray smoke giving him a throbbing headache and if marchenko had ever needed a clear head it was now the nato armor led by the eccentric but brilliant american general douglas freeman reinforced by the nato convoys from america had broken out from near certain defeat in the sovietringed dortmundbielefeld pocket on the north german plain the american general whose reputation had been made early in the war by a daring nighttime air cavalry raid behind enemy lines in korea on the north korean capital of pyongyang hadnt merely breached the russian encirclement around the hundredmilelong dortmundbielefeld pocket but was turning it into a rout of soviet armor and as the soviet troops withdrew marchenko knew his career was also in danger as architect of the stunning spets special forces paratroop attack against adak the american submarine base in the aleutians marchenko was now being held responsible for having committed russian forces to a twofront war his comrades in the stavka were charging correctly that had marchenko not advised president suzlov to attack the us submarine base east of kamchatka peninsula and west of alaska the thousands of supply and support as well as combat troops that had been funneled to the aleutian front could have been used to plug the gap punched out by the american armor on the european front marchenko knew that unless he could stop or at least slow down the nato breakout led by the americans under freeman he could look forward to a demotion as rapid as his previous promotion had been to make matters worse his son sergei a pilot attached to far eastern command hq at khabarovsk in eastern siberia but presently serving in the aleutian islands had written home that the millimawsthe storm winds born in the confluence of the westwardflowing japanese current and the eastwardflowing alaska current had been unusually severe in the past few weeks his comments about the weather were a shorthand sergei used in order to get his letter past the squadron censor the millimaws an aleut word used by sergei and his father to mean americans it wasnt the speed of the american fighting falcons and carrierborne tomcats that had sergei and the other mig foxbat pilots worried after all the russian migs and sukhois at mach and were faster than the american planes nor had it been the daring of the american pilots that had caused sergei and his friends concern for they knew about this from the north korean pilots who had done battle with the american carrierborne fighters providing cover for freemans raid on pyongyang at the beginning of the war what did astonish the soviet pilots was that even in the worst weather in the massive fog banks that covered most of the farflung islands in the crescentshaped arc between the soviet union and america the american pilots had an edge because of their improved radar technology though the mig foxbats stateoftheart fox fire lookdown milerange radar had been thought equal to anything the americans had at the beginning of the war the upgraded us pulsedoppler lookup lookdown radar in the american f falcons had caught up and the f tomcats anawg weaponcontrol system with its milerange radar the latter capable of simultaneously tracking twentyfour targets and attacking eight of them at different altitudes had brought the temporary soviet air superiority over the western aleutians to a screaming halt now instead of being able to keep sending supplies to adak building it up as russias advance springboard for the soviet attacks against norads alaskan flank taking pressure off the soviet forces in europe it looked as if the americans might try to retake adak island and shemya the capture of the huge us earlywarning radar station at shemya by the second soviet airborne only weeks after adak had fallen had been marchenkos proudest boast as for europe marchenko had sought help from the soviet northern fleet to increase convoy interdiction all along the nato sea lanes between north america and europe to cut off natos vital supply line from america but following the sinking of the yumashev the pride of the russian kresta iiclass guided missile cruiser by the american submarine uss roosevelt in the celtic sea off southwestern england the battle for the atlantic had also momentarily swung in the americans favor for the first time since the war began more merchantmen were reaching the french and english channel ports than were being sunk on the far eastern front the soviet navy had assured marchenko and the other members of the politburo that it was working as fast as possible including using forcedlabor battalions from the hitherto upstart baltic republics and the troublesome minority groups on the sinosoviet border regions near vladivostok readying to launch a hitherto undreamtof and highly secret submarine offensive against the us west coast but until the two new subs were ready another two months the nato convoys to the aleutians the soviet admirals conceded while sustaining heavy losses would not be stopped momentarily oblivious to his surroundings marchenko had stopped walking in the garden the blizzard swirling about him stinging his face as he realized he was going to have to make the most humiliating decision of his life with the soviet army withdrawing on the european front the air battle over europe like the air war over the aleutians in uncertain flux and the navys promises not realizable for at least two possibly four months the minister of war knew that only one man vladimir chernko head of the committee for state security and whom marchenko detested could help remedy the crisis in western europe the feud between the short stocky marchenko and the tall steelyeyed chernko whose ambition was to become president had begun in what the committee for state security the kgb had called its vershina or high summer of the wests honeymoon with gorbachev the british as usual had been standoffish the germans willing to accept gorbachevs line in return for moscows support of reunification and the americans chernko said gullible and deluded wanting everyone to be happy believing you could fix everything that was wrong in the world with goodwill and yankee knowhow chernko had served under vladimir kryuchkov whom gorbachev in had ordered to launch a massive industrial and military espionage offensive against the west in order to save millions of rubles for perestroika rubles that would otherwise have to be spent for weapons and technological catchup with the west it was much easier to steal or buy western technological secrets under chernkos direction the kgb had outdone madison avenue in its new image making even going so far as to invite american counterparts from the cia to tour the old dzherzinsky square headquarters and the new offices in the outer ring in an effort to convince the world of just how reformed the kgb was chernko made highly publicized arrests in the gorbachev years of certain outlaw elements among the soviet elite who had illegally profited at the expense of the soviet people chernko promised they would be severely disciplined one of those so punished was kiril marchenkos brother fyodor accused of profiteering in one of the nownotsosecret party specialty stores as far as kiril could find out fyodor had been chosen at random by chernko publicly accused by chernko he was tried and sentenced to fifteen years reduced to five as a humanitarian gesture by gorbachevs administration chernko had meanwhile been featured on the cover of time magazine as being typical of the new breed in the kgbtechnocrats more interested in rooting out inefficiency at home than in spying abroad fyodor marchenko hung himself after one month in lefortevo prison kiril marchenko remembered that chernko had sent flowers comrade marchenko marchenko turned to see one of the kremlins guards ruddyfaced his breath coming out like a hot tap in the icy air the red piping on his bluishgray greatcoat rubycolored like thin lines of blood the peasized snow bouncing off his furlined cap yes answered marchenko irritably what is it the stavka meeting comrade it is about to reconvene marchenko looked nonplussed at the guard but it is he glanced at his watch not yet one am the adjournment was for another marchenko saw that the second hand on his watch had stopped his father who had died in one of the gulags that were supposed to have disappeared under gorbachev had once told him that when a mans watch stops it is a warning his life is in imminent danger of course marchenko knew it was a ridiculous peasant superstition of his fathers nevertheless in his present mood it jolted him and he resolved that unpalatable as it was he would have to ask beg if necessary chernko to help him deal a death blow to the nato advance which had become embodied by one man the american freeman after all it had been chernko who had successfully purged the politburo of siberian separatists who hated moscow as much as they hated america and who had been plotting to overthrow suzlov it was also chernko who had come up with the idea of sending spets commandos dressed in captured american uniforms to infiltrate the nato lines and sow confusion among the allied troops in the dortmundbielefeld pocket what marchenko needed now was someone with the training to again pose as an american or some other nato officer but who could penetrate right through to freemans headquarters and kill the american general perhaps thought marchenko it could be done in the same way as some of chernkos men already in place overseas had been ordered as well as carrying out sabotage to track down and eliminate the commanders of americas weapons of last resort the sea wolf nuclear subs if chernko would support such an audacious plan then marchenko would support chernko in his bid for the presidency if and when president suzlov was replaced or died whichever came first if you mean to get ahead in this world marchenko could still hear his father say you must swallow your pride now and then kiril marchenko told himself it was time he did so to ask chernkos help not only for himself but for mother russia for his family as he headed back for the stavka meeting in the council of ministers marchenko saw that the guard about his son sergeis age could very well be his guard in some godforsaken prison in the transbaikal if he kiril marchenko didnt quickly restore his own reputation in the politburo and stavka you ever been to the far eastern theater he asked the guard to khabarovsk no comrade general youre lucky then replied marchenko morosely a sudden flurry of snow swirling about him its much colder than here my son tells me that in khabarovsk the winds come all the way down from the kara sea the prisoners have to dig through the ice of the amur river so they can fish the trouble is the ice is jagged you see not at all smooth and flat as some people imagine chaotic going this way and that at impossible angles the guard was feeling nervous it was highly unusual for a general to be conversing in such a way with a mere private especially the celebrated general who was minister of war and who had engineered the penetration of natos fulda gap where the masses of russian armor had burst through before heading north to the german plain and south to the danube valley sending the nato defenses reeling ii dont know anything about the far eastern theater comrade general i didnt know we had taken prisoners east of no no boy said marchenko irritably our own people in the gulags the guard was doubly perplexed as far as he knew gulags had been banned ever since the time of the revisionist gorbachev marchenko had only a few minutes before the stavka meeting would be called to order and presented his deal to chernko quickly succinctly chernko rejected it out of hand this is not possible chernko said icily the american freeman moves too fast we never know where he is chernko signaled an aide i need help comrade repeated marchenko if you assist i will support you wholeheartedly for what asked chernko feigning ignorance for whatever you wish comrade chernko replied that perhaps something could be worked out he did have a plan to stop the americans but it was nothing like marchenkos amateur proposal of assassination behind enemy lines nevertheless he conceded he would welcome marchenkos support when he presented his plan to the politburo at tomorrows meeting can you tell me what it is now asked marchenko tomorrow answered chernko meanwhile i will welcome your support in this meeting chernko was looking directly at him support of what asked marchenko of anything i say marchenko felt his blood rising at chernkos contemptuous tone but held himself in check president suzlov was calling the meeting to order as the members took their positions either side of the long baizecovered table with the portrait of marx gazing down behind them chernkos aide slid in beside his boss pencil and paper in hand yes comrade draw up the plan at once chernko informed him two teams twenty in each neither must have any knowledge of the other purpose penetrate nato front lines target the american general freeman code name asked the aide trojan said chernko and colonel sir book an appointment for general marchenko tomorrow morning early yes comrade director the room was soon full of bluegray smoke and chernko could see marchenko sitting glumly pinching the bridge of his nose lingering for a moment before he got out of bed robert brentwood watched rosemary her face childlike her breasts pressing against the turquoise negligee in her contented sleep and he had the urge to make love again but dawn was creeping over the western sea and though this time of day had long ceased to have any meaning for him aboard the roosevelt on patrol in the perennial darkness four hundred meters beneath the sea once ashore he found that he quickly reverted to the dawntodusk habits of annapolis up early ready to go one foot on the windowsill looking out at the windlashed ocean he began stretching his legs preparatory to his fifteenminute workout he hated it but a believer albeit reluctantly in the no gain without pain school he forced himself through it twice every twentyfour hours whether he was at sea or not out on the stormcut swells he could see the bobbing of a trawler probably from ballantrae several miles to the north its mast momentarily spearing the cold blue sky then disappearing in deep troughs the constant vigilance bred at sea never left him and he reminded himself that just over forty miles to the west beyond the tempestuous north channel lay northern ireland in the grip of continuing internecine strife between ira terrorists and orangemen the ira had become increasingly active against the british military who had been stretched thin in northern ireland because of the heavy losses suffered over the channel by the british army of the rhine in the battle for the dortmund bielefeld pocket and robert recalled the talk between his executive officer peter zeldman and the other officers aboard the roosevelt about reports from cinclant commander in chief atlantic to head of security for holy loch to be alert for ira provisionals britains military intelligence mi warned that ira provos might try coming across in trawlers if they landed farther north near the firth of lorn they could fairly quickly head inland through the wilderness of the sparsely populated argyll to loch lomond men down the fifteen miles to holy loch despite the bases reinforced concrete pens a wellaimed shoulderborne antitank missile could take out the roosevelt or any other sub not surprisingly robert hadnt mentioned any of this to rosemary knowing how the very mention of a submarine got her worrying indeed hed gone so far as to promise her that they wouldnt go near the base during the honeymoon but rather head inland a little go north along loch lomonds western shore then north again along the firth of lorn on their way to the ancient and picturesque fishing village of mallaig near the fabled isle of skye rosemary murmured in her sleep and rolled over to his side of the oldfashioned fourposter bed her right hand moving to where he had lain her lips in a smile that at once touched robert with its simplicity and aroused him in its sensuousness below he could hear someone stirring the proprietors wife in the kitchen he guessed and he caught a whiff of kippers cooking the one thing rosemary couldnt bring herself to eat on the honeymoon scottish blood ran in her veins but the thought of smoked fish for breakfast appalled her and no shed told him it didnt have anything to do with morning sickness which so far shed escaped halfway through a headtoknee stretch while still watching her robert wondered whether thered be enough time before breakfast for what his horny crewmen ashore habitually referred to as a dawn breaker he could hear the floorboards creaking outside in the upstairs hallway as early risers made their way to the bathroom and down to the dining room he began the last stretch right heel on the windowsill his hands fully extended in unison to touch his toes for a moment he glimpsed the trawler again on the pewter sea the wind had died but it seemed only temporary a scud of cloud invading from the north robert when he turned he saw she had pulled the bedding tightly about her with one hand the other patting the sheet on his side coming back to bed funny you mentioned that brentwood said in midstretch i was just thinking about it hadnt decided yes you have she said a cheeky glint in her eyes her gaze wandering below his navel unless its an optical illusion rosemary he was genuinely and pleasantly shocked at her impishness after her fretting the night before it was as if the worries of the night about his old girlfriends et cetera et cetera had vanished with the howling of the wind we might be late for breakfast he cautioned sliding eagerly in beside her no we wont she assured him happily ill take the fifth on that he told her what do you mean as she spoke he detected the scent of fresh mint about her doing battle with the smell of kippers wafting up from below i mean he explained that i refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate me the phrase sounded familiar to her from the american films shed seen she popped a mint candy in his mouth i thought only gangsters talked like that well you dont know much about me maybe i run a still aboard roosevelt the subs name was out before he could stop himself but it didnt matter it was lovers talk easy without strain and he was glad to see he could mention the sub without her getting upset again about him the war about what might happen the rosemary of the morning had put her worried self to flight as if sometime during the sweet darkness after hed settled her down following the latecomers arrival she had decided once and for all to live in the present that the world and all its troubles were too big for them to control that their time together was too precious to permit armies of what ifs to sabotage what happiness they might find before he went back to war he pulled her toward him no she said teasingly giggling yes no my god he said if you dont let me ill explode the answers still no i wont let you his left arm curved beneath her and he raised her kissing her nipples through the negligee i love you he said breathlessly are you always like this she asked her hand sliding beneath the warm sheets squeezing him when im with you he said kissing her again all the time robert her tone was soft urgent dont leave me i wont sweetheart i wont chapter two though fashionably smart in a tweed jacket tie and flannels that rosemary had chosen for him robert still wasnt used to being out of uniform and felt more selfconscious than his bride as they entered the b and bs dining room they were relieved to receive a jolly greeting without any honeymoon jokes from mrs mcrae a small dumpy and irrepressible scot who had been running the b and b sixtyfive miles southwest of glasgow for the past forty years and her husband alfred a partially incapacitated veteran of the falklands war the battle that left mcrae with a gammy leg and intense pain especially now in the depth of the scottish winter had been the single most important event of his life it had also left him with a growing conviction that next to napoleon montgomery of alamein and robert the bruce he was one of the great unsung strategists of warfare his greeting to the honeymooners and the other five guests two couples and a single commercial traveler consisted of a throat clearing and a stiff nod as he read the latest war news in the edinburgh herald whatll it be lass asked the ebullient mrs mcrae porridge to start no thank you rosemary declined opting instead for corn flakes a choice that she had the distinct impression mr mcrae didnt approve of robert asked for kippers his request receiving an appreciative nod from mrs mcrae and one of the other two couples meanwhile alfred mcrae head buried in the paper let out his breath in short audible bursts of disgust his head shaking at something hed just read one of the other two couples in their late twenties were finishing their ersatz chicory coffee excusing themselves from the table robert handed a dozen or so onecup instant coffee packets he had brought with him from roosevelt to mrs mcrae och mon will ye look at this alfred real coffee from america mcrae grunted behind the paper while the other of the two couples a pair in their early forties robert guessed their accents distinctly upper middle class beamed as did the lone commercial traveler i say began the husband sitting forward the pale cloudsieved sunlight shining on his tan dutch corduroy jacket havent seen anything like that for months and yere no likely to again put in mr mcrae suddenly and thas a fact the convoys are doomed oh said the englishman in the corduroy jacket who by now had introduced himself and his wife as james and joan price of london a rather pinched yet tight goodhumored look about him his wife clearly deferring to him though at the moment she was picking a pill of fluff from his jacket wearing a tartan shirt with nonmatching maroon necktie he was the type of englishman robert thought whod wear a necktie to the beach his wife a thin woman with mousy brown hair wearing a beige tweed skirt white blouse socks and what rosemarys father would have called sensible walking shoes smiled pleasantly at rosemary as she flicked the fluff away from her husbands sleeve her husband looked up at the proprietor of the b and b why do you say that mr mcrae whats tha the commercial traveler a tired overweight stocky man in his late fifties was torn between listening closely to what appeared to be a developing argument and watching to see whether mrs mcrae was going to offer him one of the packets of american coffee you say the convoys are doomed said price aye were all doomed och noo interjected mrs mcrae sliding the steaming kippers in front of robert brentwood its not as bad as that surely then yeve no read the paper ive noo had time she said eyebrows raised goodnaturedly theyve attacked sullom voe mcrae announced gloomily yet somehow sounding strangely triumphant just as i said they would robert brentwood though he had difficulty understanding the scotsmans brogue knew that sullom voe one of the shetland islands three hundred miles off scotlands northeast corner was the site of a big oil refinery servicing the major part of the north sea oil fields he was interested but said nothing finding mcraes melodramatic air irritating aye went on mcrae biggest terminal in europe tis sullom voe tankers line up there like buses with that he suddenly swung the front page of the heraldrussians hit sullom voefor all to see the color photograph having captured great curling plumes of dense black smoke rising over a glint of gold sea two tankers barely discernible in the bottom right of the photograph soopertankers at that continued mcrae to add to the horror he was clearly enjoying god knows how many casualties och he put the paper down disgustedly on the linen tablecloth and pushed a large thick china mug marked british rail over his place that of burnss poetry toward his wife for more tea it was daft of em not to have more air cover what did they expect i told them maggie didnt i but noo the experts in london knew best airtoair missile batteries would be sufficient they said with some fighter cover he shot a glance across at brentwood drained scotland they did and sent everything across the water to save the frogs what do they care aboot scotland a great deal i should imagine put in price its always a problem i suspect how many to put where he too looked across at the brentwoods wouldnt you agree yes said brentwood theres never enough to go around precisely enjoined price ye no think the oils important laddie said mcrae wincing in pain as he abruptly turned around in his chair left hand vigorously massaging his left kneecap his right hand ladling heaping teaspoons of sugar into his milky tea not at all answered price while his wife rosemary noticed tugged as surreptitiously as she could on her husbands sleeve her eyes rolling heavenward as she caught rosemarys glance rosemary smiled sympathetically but price wouldnt be restrained oils vital of course he said but i suppose there was enough in storage in the first few months until the convoys och said mcrae his tone one of sneering contempt his left hand continuing to massage his knee there might have been reserves for a wee while but it was obvious right from the very first shot that wed be in a right pickle started rationing straight off they did london wasnt prepared laddie and thats all there is to it only thing that surprises me is that the russians havent hit it sooner i daresay they could use your prescience in london said price you should be in the admiralty there was a flash of anger in mcraes eyes his face clouding ive done my bit laddie aye and got this for it he smacked his leg glancing at the brentwoods for moral support rosemary reached for more corn flakes while robert diplomatically gave all his attention to separating the second kipper from its spine mrs mcrae suddenly emerged from the kitchen now whod like some of mr brentwoods coffee id love a cup said the commercial traveler rising eagerly toast crumbs tumbling from his napkin and said mcrae staring at price who was now looking rather sullen himself how old are you laddie im a lecturer price replied defiantly quick to the intimation of mcraes question lse rosemary looked up mcraes chin jutted forward combatively och never heard of it he returned noisily to his mug of tea london school of economics said price crisply perhaps put in rosemary half out of genuine interest half in an effort to calm things down you know my sister georgina spence price looked at her blankly i cant say i do sorry im im in political studies actually theory oh aye said mcrae we certainly need that a good dose of political theory essential war work is it shes in her final year rosemary continued price trying to be polite to her while clearly furious at the scot georgina spence you said spence yes i do remember the name i think but cant put a face to it im afraid its a big place to tell you the truth of course said rosemary i know what its like im a teacher myself and a lot of people studying politics then are there cut in mcrae ignoring rosemary and shoveling several more spoonfuls of sugar into his tea special rations along with exemptions from active duty is it for the important work at the university i mean mcraes gray eyes sparkled even in the dim light of the dining room no said price hands clasped before him no same ration as everyone else actually though we dont have everything of course sometimes weve no sugar at all the door from the hallway opened and the young couple who had excused themselves earlier as rosemary and robert had arrived came into the dining room a spot or two of confetti still on the womans lambswool coat the husband despite the civilian garb was a young serviceman robert guessed as he watched the way the man pulled out and carefully counted the fivepound notes the man a little younger than his bride robert thought had the look of a junior officer anxious to take the lead in front of her but not quite sure of what he was doing turning to his wife he whispered something robert detecting a distinctly new york accent as the man finally gave up trying to understand the british currency handing his bride a clutch of tenp notes by the time the couple had left their interruption of the table conversation long enough to have cooled tempers the prices were completing their meal in silence and seeing that mrs mcrae wasnt going to bring out any more real coffee packets politely fended off further offers of tea as he rose to leave price asked robert you on holiday yes thought so i suspect well see you again joan and i are doing a spot of sightseeing ourselves few weeks off till the new term well said robert rising and offering his hand next time i hope youll have time for more coffee so do i said joan an edge to her voice smiling at rosemary and not so much talk there was a long silence after the couple left robert finishing his kipper the commercial traveler sitting quietly hands about the cup of coffee in a warm embrace but looking as pained as mcrae who was now avidly reading the obituaries finally the traveler spoke excuse me all he had the look of a petty criminal does anyone mind if i smoke he glanced awkwardly at rosemary not at all she lied next the salesman sought mr mcraes permission the scot shifting in his chair again pushing his tea mug to a new position ill not mind mrs mcrae was busy in the kitchen the commercial traveler sat back eyes closed to luxuriate in the twin pleasures of smoke and coffee through the dining room window they could see the young newlyweds getting into a yellow honda civic the faint remnant of just married visible across the passenger door thats a silly thing to do observed mcrae cost him a packet to get that painted over mrs mcrae put a new pot of tea before him smoothing its cozy perhaps they dont want to paint it over mcrae aye conceded mcrae knowing hed gone too far for her liking with the prices but still grumpily eager to get in a last salvo at the world well they certainly didnt mind who heard em during the night robert saw rosemary blush the commercial traveler had his eyes closed in a grin of contentment as he exhaled the long stream of smoke swirling in the air as gray and turbulent as the storm clouds scudding in from the irish sea youll be heading north then said mcrae yes answered robert his hand beneath the table on rosemarys thigh yes were off to mallaig what said mcrae as if theyd taken leave of their senses thatd be nigh on two hundred miles it always amazed brentwood how the british sense of what distance it was proper or possible to travel in a day was so different from how the americans viewed it even accounting for the fact that the long lonely roads over the moors and through the highlands were often oneway and certainly a far cry from any freeway or motorway as the british called it we should be there by dark said robert confidently youll be seeing robbies cottage first it sounded more like an order from commander in chief atlantic than a question yes said robert and glencoe it didnt ring a bell with robert rosemary came to her husbands rescue even as she was trying to fend off his groping beneath the table you remember robert i told you it was the site of a great battle between the scots and the english who won asked robert smiling the scots i guess mcraes face was swept by squall eyes brooding and sullen as the clouds congealing over the sea it wasnt a battle said mcrae it was a massacre maclain macdonald his wife and thirtysix of the clan slain by the english and by men who had supped with them mcrae paused youll not be calling into your holy loch then robert reacted quickly trying to hide his surprise turning the question back to mcrae holy loch aye youre a submariner arent you robert didnt answer youre american arent you pressed mcrae yes but your face laddie said mcrae clean as a bairns bottom youve no seen the sun or any kind of weather for a wee while have you youre very observant mr mcrae robert complimented him mcrae came around the table face grimacing his limp favoring the stiff left leg then quite unexpectedly he offered his hand to brentwood mind how ye go next his steelgrey eyes shifted from robert to rosemary and take good care of the lassie robert nodded his head thank you sir i will after theyd packed their bags into the trunk or as rosemary insisted on calling it the boot of the morris and driven off rosemary waving back to the lone mrs mcrae on the porch robert wondered aloud why if mcrae was such a determined scot he had bothered fighting for the british in the falklands war the scots love to fight she said simply winding up her window against the splatter of rain and taking out the map of scotlands west coast looking down at the thin solitary roads winding up past ayre to the highlands and beyond to cape wrath chapter three from the highresolution satellite pictures the politburo had clearly seen the vast north german plain streaked with a white mange of snow crisscrossed with allied pontoon bridges over the tributaries to the elbe and strewn with all the detritus of war eviscerated stillsmoking armored columns gutted empty gasoline dumps and bloated bodies all indicating how rapidly the americans were advancing and the russians retreating the american general freeman was obviously moving so fast that soviet divisions hadnt time to bury their dead sergei marchenko one of the soviet fighter pilots temporarily seconded from the far eastern tvd aleutian section to plug the gaps opened up by the american breakout from the dortmundbielefeld pocket to the north german plain was coming in low over the white ribbon of the e the mile autobahn between berlin and what before gorbachev used to be the frontier of western germany his foxbata mig one of a combat pair crossed the elbe seven miles northeast of magdeburg he pressed the arm switch for four acrid airtoair missiles two of them infraredhoming the other two radarhoming the two fighter interceptors with no internal armament were equipped with external podmounted twentythreemillimeter cannons to be used strafing either nato supply lines or nato fighters covering the american advance sergei marchenko was no coward but he like the other pilots rushed to the western front hoped that the spets units long in place in western europe would help slow the american advance by sabotaging their forward airfields which the americans were so good at laying down despite the slushy conditions of a temporary thaw in the freezing weather besides as much as sergei marchenko enjoyed being a fighter pilot after his military slog through the armored corps to which he had originally been assigned because of his height he would have preferred to be flying the somewhat slower but more maneuverable sukhoi flagon it had served him so well at his home base in the aleutians during the attacks on the american outposts of adak submarine base and shemya island in supporting the spets operation against shemya the united states largest western radar warning post the sukhois flying out of the komandorskiye islands less than two hundred miles from the americans westernmost island had performed exceptionally well it was true that marchenko despite his impressive record of five unichtozhennykhkillshad been shot down by an american f tomcat from the us carrier salt lake city reputedly flown by the american ace shirer marchenko had ejected been picked up within ten minutes and was back at komandorskiye base within three hours but pilots who survived a plane shot up in a dogfight tended to grow more not less attached to the make and so it was with marchenko still he knew it was silly to become sentimental about such things and one had to learn to adapt quickly amid the vicissitudes of a rapidly changing war in any event marchenko and his wingman had been buoyed by the information given them during enginestart that intelligence reports showed allied pilots in europe were being forced to fly in excess of six sorties a day in order to try to deal with the swarms of russian fighters now being funneled in from the eastern sectors of the ussr it was predicted that at this unheardof except for the battle of britain sortie rate sooner or later the unrelenting fatigue would take its toll not only on pilots and the radarintercept officers who flew with them but also on the ground crews but the russian estimates were wide of the mark for while there had been even more casualties than they thought british and american pilots were not about to ease off or pause to catch their breath not after the american army spearheaded by freemans corps had finally breached the soviet ring of steel the allied pilots were like marathon runners worn down but suddenly invigorated by a second wind in this case provided by freemans breakout from the db pocket and by the possibility of quickly gaining ground to make up for air crew losses many of the british and american aircraft normally crewed by pilot and rios were being flown with pilot only doing what he could with the electronic countermeasures but going up anyway disdaining secondbysecond control over all the avionics in favor of pressing home the attack going airtoair giving maximum attention to dogfight maneuvers coming in from the southwest over gottingen and the recaptured airfields of lower saxony a flight of two fa fighting falcons though not yet visible against the bright whiteness of bluepatched nimbostratus could be seen quite clearly on marchenkos fiftytwomile lookdown fox fire radar unaware he was already on the soviets radar kurt schulz an american from los angeles now picked up one of the russians on his dalmo victor analr radarwarning receiver the computer telling him the russian fighters were now in excess of mach his falcons top speed mach lying back in full recline sidestick mode of the f to reduce the g force schulz pressed the zoom toggle bringing up the da a designated area of attack the blipping rectangle showing cattle grazing against sodden snowslushed fields either side of the highway where once the tall barbed wire had stood the black streaks schulz could see in the zoom shot were slicks of oil visible against the unthawed shoulder of the road where snow had remained then there were other streaks against the snow these rising from the ground toward him as sam sites opened up from the harz foothills to the south schulz immediately noted on his kneepad that the sam sites had shifted from the day before and so were presumed to be mobile launchers in the distance he could now see the two russians specks of silver closing fast and he was alert for an elok enemy lockon tone radio silence was pointless now that visual id had been made and he asked his wingman that barn down there eleven oclock was it there yesterday there was such a deafening noise it made shulz grimace he lost the video image momentarily as the plane shifted violently left he went to jammer to play havoc with the sam radars coming up at him at over five hundred miles an hour from less than three hundred feet the terrain below him now a racing whitegreen blur schulz dropped two iron bombs and let the afterburner have its head the barn was gone so was his wingman a young pilot hed met only that morning as theyd raced from the ready room in response to the scramble horn at five thousand schulz banked hard the sun glinting behind him as he turned to take another run at the broken span across the elbe where hed spotted the black marks against the snow possibly they were tire ruts leading down from the highway to the waters edge more tracks coming up from the other side of the river through snow a sunken pontoon bridge the flak was thick and he saw a burst of red tracer catching the sun fading climbing leisurely up toward him through the smoke of the barn more tracer now coming from the direction of magdeburg he was into the smoke turning tightly coming in low again the hud lines flicking rapidly the four green diamonds closing spastically the smoke was gone he saw the wreckage of the sam site in the barn hed destroyed littering the icy green fields some of its debris caught in a high mesh fence either side of the autobahn schulz knew it was only a matter of minutes before the migs rising like silver gnats in his rear vision from stendal would be on him he set the clickerautomatic release when the river section hed chosen on his tv zoom was mirrored in the radar image the falcon rose as the bombs released the plane yawed slightly and he headed south climbing to clear the harz hoping to lose himself in cloud black puffs of flak from the aa batteries around stassfurt and aschersleben smudging the air about him chapter four three miles south of burnss cottage outside ayre occasional spots of rain turned to sleet and robert turned on the wipers in the drowsy hum he and rosemary were lost in their own thoughts she wondering how her younger sister georgina and roberts executive officer peter zeldman were getting along or if they were getting along at all after having graciously performed their official roles as best man and maid of honor at robert and rosemarys wedding georginas beauty was matched by her pride and a strong streak of leftist feminism that rosemary surmised might not go down or as robert would say sit well with the plainspoken somewhat taciturn zeldman on the other hand rosemary after the years of teaching all types of students in her shakespeare class was aware that sometimes opposites attract in the most unpredictable way she hoped so suspecting that deep down georgina though too proud to admit it wanted a relationship that would give her a measure of certainty and stability in the world of avantgarde politics at the lse and in a world made daily more uncertain by war she thought of her brother williams death in the convoy and of how terrified he must have been his ship torpedoed in the middle of the atlantic she thought too of roberts sister lana who as williams nurse had written them about william and without whom rosemary would never have met robert whod so kindly brought the letter down to surrey on his first leave lana brentwood it seemed had been with william in the final days of his life on the halifaxbound hospital ship where he died rosemary thought too of roberts youngest brother david twentyfour who though now safe in liege in belgium had been listed as an mia for several weeks after he and others in the big drop by the american airborne over the dortmundbielefeld pocket had been swept off course by cross winds into enemy territory she wondered what he was like there was still so much she didnt know about roberts family does your brother david have a girlfriend she asked robert shrugged sort of i guess what does that mean im not sure had a girl he liked back in the states he paused high school sweetheart far as i can recall but that was before the war dont know if its still on between them do you know her name mmm robert pondered the question while using another tissue to clear the semicircle of mist above the dash now there he said youve got me oh robert you must know melmel melanie i think it bugged him that he couldnt remember a nuclear sub skipper who like zeldman and others in the service was expected to have a photographic memory of enemy maneuvers and myriad descriptions of ships and armaments but he was having trouble even trying to visualize the girls face melanie who pressed rosemary he must have spoken about her not david said robert very closemouthed about dating we all were all i remember is that he and a guy called rick stacy were in competition for her sounds serious i guess she was a nice kid well a kid then so youve met her once on leave she was a coed a firstyear student what oh yes replied robert first year at oregon state she was a bright hold on rosemary was thrown forward the cars rear end skewing hard right skidding to a stop on the rainslicked road you okay honey he asked her quickly off to her left rosemary caught the auburn blur of a deer slipping through the mist im all right she said for a second she sat back against the headrest and turned to him hand over her heart i thought it was another car figured the honeymoon was over eh he said swinging the morris back onto the lefthand side of the road yes she said i did he put a hand on her knee sorry sweetie its all right not your fault the fog was so thick it made day seem like night and for a moment robert realized again how close the line was between survival and death if it had been another car a headon collision on the lonely narrow road across the moor the irony of him and rosemary dying on their honeymoon while david having weathered the vicissitudes of the dortmundbielefeld pocket was now safe in liege awaiting transport back to england struck with full force even hitting the deer could have been disastrous for them and in a second he found himself envisaging rosemarys face slashed bloody with broken glass and saw his other brother ray the thirtysevenyearold excaptain of a missile frigate the uss blaine ray once nicknamed cruise because of his resemblance to the onetime hollywood idol had been wounded in the flash fire following the attack of a swarm of fast small north korean attack boats one of whose missiles had exploded on the blaines bridge rays face was now a horror mask of tight polished skin and he was still convalescing after a long painful and still unfinished series of plastic surgery operations robert had been revolted when hed first seen the pictures of ray and then felt guilty he had never been close to either ray or david perhaps he thought it wasnt so much a matter of different personalities as the gap in ages between him and his two younger brothers it was like the age of bing crosby as robert was called by his crew meeting springsteen after a certain age your tastes just didnt change much nor your tactics as one of the submarine instructors had told them which is why anyone heading into his deep forties was considered too old for submarines the temptation to let old habits ride never to change them from music to tactics he knew could be fatal aboard the most complex fighting machine in history burnss cottage said rosemary looking down at the map should be about five miles further on robert was feeling unusually drowsy a temporary reaction he knew from his war patrols on the sub to the rush of adrenaline caused by a near miss in this case a deer standing in for a russian depth charge robert i dont want to be a backseat driver but youre going awfully fast he glanced at the speedometer seventy kilometers per hour just a tad over forty he said and almost added that roosevelt went faster than this when she was submerged but he stopped himself youre angry she said turning to him nope yes you are no seriously i was melissa thats it what davids girlfriend melissa lange have you been thinking of her all this time rosemary pressed mischievously i supposed thats why we almost hit that poor deer no he said smiling across at her that had nothing to do with it you were right i was going too fast for fog like this och och as mr mcrae would say yere noo tellin me the truth robert brentwood you were going fast because you were thinking of her this melissa creature turns you on i suppose as you americans say aye he joked in an atrocious imitation of a scottish accent the car slowed to twenty kilometers the fog so thick visibility was near zero now the car was at a crawl robert sitting well forward in the seat he flicked on the left turn signal what are you doing asked rosemary alarmed were not there i know that but this is unsafe at any speed there should be one of those staggered pulloffs the scots are so fond ah there we are ahead no more than fifteen feet away rosemary glimpsed a black rectangle of macadam or as robert would call it blacktop barely big enough for a car bracken blurring its edge she couldnt imagine a more forlorn spot to stop but robert was right it was riskier to go on besides at most it would mean a late arrival at the bedandbreakfasthouse at mallaig pulling off leaving the parking lights on robert let the motor run for a little until it was cozily warm rosemary lying back against the headrest closing her eyes its ridiculous she said excusing a yawn i feel tired and weve just started make the most of it sailor he said reaching over taking the map from her lap and adjusting the seat into the semirecline youre beautiful i ever tell you that she smiled dreamily all the time kind sir as he began folding the map he glimpsed a filigree of black lace against the stockinged tan of her thigh she began to say something but gently he placed his finger on her lips and felt the moistness of her tongue his hand slipping beneath her skirt we cant she said hushed what if wed hear anyone coming a mile away dont be vulgar what oh i wasnt he laughed i didnt mean to be honest yes you did no i didnt she made sweet murmuring sounds her thighs trapping his hand i want he began i want to whats that she said suddenly stiffening pushing him away he stopped listening there was only the sound of the sleet pelting against the car nothing he assured her adding submariners can tell honey if i cant hear it it isnt there we can pick out a noise short for miles and he didnt finish her embrace smothering all talk his eyes closing with hers as his hands slid further beneath the lace to her secret warmth she whimpered ever so slightly in a mounting joy the very moment she touched him gripped him he felt his whole body stiffening with a throbbing urgency the likes of which hed never known schulz heard a high bipping tone a radarhoming missile locked onto him left quarter from dessau thirty miles away he hit the jammer went to full thrust and felt the g force dumping on him as the falcons pratt and whitney f afterburner screamed in the full vertical climb as he jettisoned sea urchin flares and three highfrequency burp box decoys just in case to sucker off the enemy missile already ten miles nearer american lines than the dessau batteries sergei marchenko fired his first acrid aa missile schulz saw one of the acrids streak below in front of him the second one passing above left hitting a flare disintegrating a white cloud speckled black with debris coming down at him from the explosion he flicked the sidestick for afterburner but the engine was out and his tail radar warning receiver wasnt working so he had no idea if the russian fighter was in the falcons cone of vulnerability down below he saw the snowstreaked blur of green plain start to spin foothills moving to its periphery mountains looming fast ahead he pulled the douglas eject next moment he was soaking wet the cloud he was in supersaturated schulz knowing only that he was alive the ruby spot of the falcons dying jet vanishing in gray stratus christ he was above the harz his greatest fear of bailing out had always been that he would be hung up in a tree on one of the steep mountain sides unable to free himself with a hundredfoot drop or worse beneath him and no other way out search and rescue had found a colleague of his on the american side of the harz on the run for weeks and of course dead when they found him eyes pecked out stomach bloated enormously and every orifice oozing with maggots for marchenko the downed american plane not only added to his score of five nato kills three earned over the aleutians including his otplatapaybackdowning of the american shirer but it added enormously to his reputation as the upandcoming soviet ace who might take the title from the belorussian gorich who had eleven kills this was marchenkos second f the first shot down over adak in the aleutians and the f was regarded by the soviet pilots as one of the best allaround combination interceptorground attack aircraft ever built bristling with american knowhow but if marchenko was pleased with the kill he showed no such emotion to his wingman the truth was that though he was satisfied enough with the kill he wasnt happy that the american flier might have gotten away by having ejected you beat the americans not by killing their machines their industrial capacity was enormous you had to kill their pilots this was the allies critical vulnerability and it irked him that the american ace shirer had also survived and bailed out when marchenko had shot him down over the aleutians the fact was sergei marchenko was the only soviet ace who had not killed an american ace it rankled him particularly when his critics charged that since the fierce dogfights over the aleutians he had only been up against secondstringers shirer became his obsession marchenko had a photograph of the american ace taken from the german magazine der spiegel pinned up in his home base at khabarovsk shirers face the center of his squadrons dart board low on fuel marchenko and his wingman turned back toward berlin in the shuddering moment of their ecstasy followed by the warm flooding peace that enveloped them neither robert nor rosemary was aware of any sound on the lonely scottish road it was only when he returned to the drivers seat that robert saw the twin yellow spots of light in the rearview mirror still there was no sound and it was another several minutes before the car feeling its way through the fog could be heard in the frantic race to button her blouse and make herself respectable rosemary dropped her lipstick between the hand brake and the seat as she and robert reached for it they crashed heads och were doomed said robert mimicking mcrae of the bedandbreakfast rosemary began to laugh and the more she laughed the more uncontrollable it became so that soon she was weeping robert pulling her toward him she fending him off slumped down out of sight beneath the window level the lights from the car now no more than fifty yards behind them disappeared momentarily and at first robert thought the car had stopped before he saw more thick sheets of fog sweeping in from the coast obliterating the approaching car and roiling over the road rosemary get up i dont want anyone to see me the car was almost on them its horn sounded as it drew level with them the driver a dim outline waving robert acknowledging it from one driver on a lonely road to another rosemary sighed with relief watching the red taillights of the car and a lorry that was obviously using it as a trailblazer on the fogbound highway disappearing like two sore eyes into the mist funny commented robert what me being ravaged out on the moor the car that passed us robert said looked like the pair we saw at mcraes there i found it rosemary proclaimed victoriously grimacing as she reached down behind the hand brake to retrieve her salmonred lipstick well they did say theyd probably see us theyre sightseeing too remember no robert replied not the prices that other couple the soldier and the girl confetti still on them remember soldier well he was wearing civvies but he looked to me like a junior officer nco maybe i dont understand rosemary said winding her passenger window down a tad in an effort to thwart any more misting up on the inside of the windshield whats so funny about them being on the same road theres no other highway to speak of i should think its likely well see them again robert shrugged he tried to remember whether the yellow honda civic that had passed them had had just married sprayed on the side but he hadnt noticed it was sprinkling rain again and he turned on the wipers its just that they started out long before we did maybe they stopped somewhere for the fog to clear too he nodded in acquiescence for several seconds they drove on in silence soon they saw the taillights again at first thinking they were the lorrys but then realizing the two red lights werent far enough apart for a truck the lorry having apparently overtaken the car on one of the passbys any other points of interest along this road before ayre he asked rosemary casually before we get to burnss cottage i dont she began stifling a yawn know why just wondered wouldnt want to miss anything mcraed send a lynch party you want me to look up the map she offered unenthusiastically nope he said doesnt matter i do hope this fog clears said rosemary peering ahead at the dim gray strip of bitumen a few feet in front of them if not we will be doomed up at glencoe daddy told me the highland mists are always much worse wont see a thing perhaps we should stop at glasgow for a bite give the weather a chance to improve aye lass he said you have a terrible scottish accent did you know that im working on it you want to eat in glasgow then do you for a moment robert brentwood was back in his familys home in new york it was his mothers habit to ask his father five or six times whether he was sure he wanted to do something after hed said thats what he wanted to do drove him nuts her repetition his father had written robert had been particularly bad after ray had been wounded her nerves shot to pieces the trying repetition of every goddamn question clearly a symptom of her anxiety robert knew in rosemarys case the repetition was thoughtfulness on her part not wanting him to feel obligated to do anything he didnt really care to do particularly given the short time he had ashore but rosemary too had changed between the engagement and the wedding her nerves and her sense of self trembling like so many in britain whod experienced the sudden dangers of modern war for the submariner it might be the fear of asrocs coming down at you out of nowhere for civilians like rosemary and her family it was the terrifying cacophony of massed soviet rocket attacks fine he said well eat in glasgow you sure it might clear up you never know in the highlands apparently daddy told me you can have rain sun and sleet all in one morning youre as cheerful as old mcrae im trying not to plan things too far in advance thats all on your honeymoon youre supposed to be carefree anyway as your best man would say i guess its no use frettin they were getting closer to the car you know your southern accent is terrible he said yes i know so well stop for chow in glasgow and what happens happens yes they have any places to pull off up in the highlands oh lots of them rosemary said encouragingly or so father says roads so narrow in places you have to go off just to let another car pass so who has right of way no one she said first in first served sounds like a texas whorehouse robertreally and what pray do you know about texas whorehouses nothing he said absolutely nothing shipboard talk thats all tell me more about these highlands theyre supposed to be wildly beautiful she said forlorn but beautiful and there are lots of places to pull off he said leering my lord is that all you can think about i would have thought youd had enough for one day she adopted her stern schoolmarmish pose anyway youll just have to wait till we get to mallaig how fars that about a hundred and sixty miles dont know if ill make it he said reaching out for her she pushed his hand away you stay alert captain otherwise neither of usll make it youll have us in the bracken and thas a fact for a moment he glimpsed red taillights again but then the rain came down in sheets and they had to slow to a crawl damn he said above the whine of the wipers this is tougher than driving a sub in the heavy rain they missed burnss cottage rosemary was disappointed but didnt press to go back theyd only a week left of his leave before hed once again set out on war patrol sorry sweetie he apologized i was so busy looking at the damn road oh never mind she said gaily well see it another time yes he said thats a promise both of them fell silent the rain coming down so hard on the roof it made a steady drumming sound and was splashing up from the narrow road but they didnt mind it gave them a cozy feeling together inside the car like being in a cave safe from the raging forces outside their control well stop at glasgow he said if we find it when kurt schulz entered the swirling grayness of the stratus above the harz and could no longer glimpse the reassuring green khaki parachute above him he had the distinct sensation of going down a lot more slowly than he really was his worst fear was not realized as he saw the tall pines glide past his landing on open ground in the mistshrouded outskirts of stolberg in the harz mountains near a copse of poplar and spotted by an old villager out walking his dog as the german shepherd ran toward schulz the pilot a dog lover intuitively went down on his left knee left hand resting on it his right hand hanging loosely fingers cupped his body loose in as nonthreatening a pose as he could make fingers snapping here boy good boy the villager stood and watched his pipe hanging loosely from aged stained teeth above a stomach that despite the economic hardships of living in the gdr had consumed its fair share of german beer his dogs tail began wagging the villager whistled quietly over to the flier looking about them anxiously almost tripping on a patch of moss hier kommen it looked all right but shulz knew that if the grenztruppen border troopshad seen him coming down the villager would have no alternative then he saw the mans shortbarreled shotgun slung across his back haben sie amerikanisch zigarettenhave you any american cigarettesasked the villager no schulz told him astonished by the question he wished he had a bagful a truckload the old man shrugged philosophically schulz decided to act quickly to take no chances he could easily overpower the old man if he was quick enough and shot the dog first but then the dog began pawing at him tail wagging intuitively or perhaps because of his long boyhood association with pets of his own schulz began scratching behind the dogs ear the shepherd nuzzling into him the harder he scratched the border said the old man is sixteen kilometers we will have to leave now the patrols are much heavier at night schulz trusted the dog but not the old man hed heard a number of tales of wouldbe rescuers leading fliers into a grenztruppen trap they heard one patrol but it was a long way off the german shepherd the best earlywarning radar schulz had ever seen four hours later schulz was across into west germany afterward schulz tried to dress it up a bit with each retelling it sounded more and more like a harrowing escape with the entire east german army pursuing him in fact it had been little more than a hike through one of the most beautiful wooded parts of germany schulz knew that whether or not he survived the war to his last day he would think of the old villager whenever he smelled wood smoke when they had parted schulz asked for the old mans name so that if ever he had the chance to repay he could but the old man wouldnt give it if ever such a thing should slip out he explained he would be a dead man chapter five northeast of the bronx on the placid waters of croton reservoir the water police helicopter was carrying out its normal patrol to ensure that no power boats were churning up the surface if left undisturbed the water would be aerated through the action of the suns ultraviolet light and once rid of impurities would pass through the aqueducts and tunnels built a hundred years before and become part of the one and a half billion gallons of water that new yorkers consumed every day the chopper came down as it spotted the qualitycontrol men on the only power boat allowed in the lake lowering the seki disc which they could see was visible down to about three and a quarter meters much deeper than the twometer clarity required by law when the chopper had gone a man in his late fifties taking his usual walk by the dam sat down by the edge of the spillway fascinated as always at how quickly the placid surface of the lake became a cascade of white water over the elegant beveled curves of the dam he emptied the thermos into the water chapter six in the stormwhipped night of the northern pacific the uss salt lake city turned her bow into the wind the jet engines on her flight deck screaming from ruby red to an urgent white the catapult officer his head barely visible in the slightly raised perspexcovered hatch peeking above the flight deck knowing he had only fifty seconds to launch each fighter cursing the condensation building up inside his bubble despite the heating duct his eyes having to strain to get a visual verification of takeoff weight for the f tomcat on the waist catapult so that he could set the appropriate steam pressure for the cat and crosswind the catapult officer thought he heard six eight zero indicating steam pressure on the cat for around sixtyeight thousand pounds about right for a tomcat with ordnance on its four underfuselage points and the two hard points closer in under the wings but still he couldnt make out whether the rainsmeared digit on the board a traysized counter held up by the yellowjacketed member of the flight deck was a six or a five he had to get it right but if he took much longer he knew the air boss a hundred feet up in the carriers island would be onto him the catapult officer pushed his earphones in hard trying to hear the yellow jackets voice above the screaming of the twin twentyonethousandpound pratt and whitney turbofans but still couldnt make out what the other man was saying he looked again through his deck bubble at the board saw a six for only a fraction of a second but it was enough the cat was set for sixtytwo thousand pounds he saw the last yellow jacket running from the plane his right thumb up indicating all setthe launch bar between the fighters nose and catapult rail connected he pushed the button the jet shot forward in a blur of battle gray and swirling steam that momentarily obliterated the blast deflector the launch had taken fortynine seconds there wasnt even time to grimace at his assistant that hed made it under fifty seconds before the next plane an a intruder was on the waist cat screaming just as insistently for release the catapult officer prayed he got every one of them right this night damn the bubble was fogging up again high above the flight deck the captain of the uss carrier salt lake city battle group received an urgent request from compaccommander pacific pearl harbor that one of the carriers pilots lt comdr f shirer be reassigned to washington dc knowing there were over five thousand men and women aboard and that there could easily be two with the same name even the same rank the director of personnel a new man on the salt lake city waited for the computer to come back on line to doublecheck the fliers service number he was pretty sure it was the shirer of the pyongyang raid fame who in the midst of the north korean armys invasion or rather rout of the south korean and american forces had led the second wave of tomcats through a raging monsoon over the north korean capital the raid of american airborne troops led by gen douglas freeman against kim il suck as the general called him deep behind the north korean lines had electrified the world and in a way reminiscent of doolittles raid on tokyo in world war two it had given american morale at home and particularly in the shrinking pusanyosu perimeter a muchneeded boost it had also bought precious time for the us troops en route from japan to restock the perimeter in time to start the counterattacks that were now driving kim ii sungs forces across the wide frozen wastes of the yalu into the mountain fastness of manchuria for the men like shirer whod been in on freemans raid it had given them an √©lan not normally found in battlehardened men until they are much older even now shirers exploit in downing four sukhois over the aleutian islands was overshadowed by his reputation as the cool warrior who had gone in over pyongyang his flight through flak and missilethick air giving crucial support to freeman and his troops engaged in a fierce firelight outside mansudae hall here a young american marine david brentwood had been busy winning the silver star flushing out the enemy in a vicious roomtoroom battle seeking the nkas general kim kim either escaped shortly after the defenses of the koreans supposed impenetrable fortress of pyongyang had been penetrated or as intelligence suggested might have been shot on the orders of kim il sung the failure to get kim had bitterly disappointed general freeman the tv pictures of the successful sweep of mansudae hall its windows now roaring with flame and the felled statue of kim il sung once sixty feet of solid bronze seconds later shattered by the american demolition teams reasserted however the american determination to go on the attack even though they had been retreating in the south the american public made heroes of young david brentwood and the others who deserved it and some who didnt but who had been in the right place at the right time for most of the men the reputation of having been in on the pyongyang raid proved as much a burden as a blessing later in europe during a night drop when brentwoods battalion had bailed out over the dortmundbielefeld pocket as part of the american airbornes drop to relieve pressure from the trapped british army of the rhine four american brigades and a german division david like most in charlie company had been blown into enemy territory by crosswinds he had lain against a fetid disemboweled corpse in a shellpocked field under enemy artillery barrage too paralyzed to move at dawn when he did go forward and found himself looking through the foresight of a russian ak he was secretly relieved that was until he saw the russian spets commandos herding american and british prisoners making them take off their uniforms and dog tags and issuing the shivering nato pows only one coarse blanket apiece the russians were preparing to infiltrate the nato lines and blow up the allied prepo supply depots subsequently brentwood after seeing a british officer and americans murdered in cold blood on a forced march through deep snow had been jolted out of his funk escaping from the column using two of the enemys stick malefemale connector grenades hed singlehandedly set a huge soviet oil dump near stadthagen afire robbing marshal kirovs armored columns of their critical fuel supply during the assault by over five thousand russian t and t tanks against the dortmundbielefeld pocket for that david brentwood had been awarded the congressional medal of honor to add to the silver star earned at pyongyang now recuperating in a belgian nato hospital outside brussels the exhilaration of having found his courage at stadthagen was quelled by the burden of his memory of those hours alone before dawn in the shellcratered field outside the db pocket when only he and god knew hed been immobilized with fear the wounds caused by flying shrapnel from the stick grenades hed used at stadthagen to blow up the dump were superficial but extremely painful yet he bore the pain without any ill will his stoicism born of the gnawing guilt that festered out of those two hours for him two hours of cowardice to make matters worse everyone he spoke to from the pretty young admitting receptionist at lille to reporters from the stars and stripes kept admiring his courage and the more reticent he became to give yet another interview the more he was celebrated as the modest hero and the more the guilt of those two hours mounted finally david felt literally weighed down longing for the dutch harbors to be cleared of the soviet airdrop mines and allied wrecks so that he could be shipped back to a convalescent hospital in england there hopefully he could bury himself among the anonymity of the half million allied soldiers in the vast encampments of southern england and east anglia who fed and resupplied by the convoys now getting through from the states would be far too busy to worry about any one individual as the personnel officer aboard the uss salt lake city waited to get confirmation that it was frank shirer whom washington was requesting david brentwood on the other side of the world sought solitude along the banks of one of the narrow olivedrab canals but the denuded winter poplars and the flat lush green of flanders fields beyond only nurtured his gloomy mood he wondered how much of his attack on the soviet fuel dump had been due to having seen other prisoners shot at the whim of a soviet guard and how much of his desperate run through the blizzard that night with the grenades had been motivated by nothing else than fear of meeting the other prisoners fate instead of by any conscious plan to strike back at the russians onehalf of him told him that the reason he did it wasnt important who cares as his marine buddy thelman would say what matters babe is you did it yet the other half of david brentwood his father the admirals side was unmoved for adm john brentwood the reason for doing something was almost as important as the deed itself a phantom breeze ruffled the canal water its leaden surface shivering like a living thing apprehensive of the gunmetal skies gathering ominously overhead david turned around to head back to the hospital smelling rain in the air wondering whether this tugofwar within him afflicted others who like him had been singled out for public celebrationbest of show propaganda at a time when allied commanders well knew the war could easily go either way despite freemans breakout from the db pocket or was his condition peculiar to himself was he in some way abnormal he had tried to visualize confiding in his brothers to find the answer but he felt too far away in years from robert and his older brother wasnt given to opening up about himself like all submariners cocooned in a world of secrecy he had a natural reticence to discuss personal matters or for that matter anything else outside the sub hed only told david of his impending marriage to rosemary spence a month before it took place in any case like their father robert probably wouldnt want to discuss personal matters perceiving such selfabsorption as a sign of weakness an inability on davids part to handle his own problems perhaps it was david heard the high thunder of bombers probably bs the socalled stealth b a disaster easily picked up by the enemys low longwave radar despite the pentagons claims and assurances otherwise looking up seeing nothing but thick overcast david felt more depressed than ever someone said that coming off the painkillers helped induce depression or was he just feeling downright sorry for himself a thing neither of his two brothers or father would abide especially not after rays burn trauma he had thought of writing lana sure shed understand his doubts and fears about having so much expected of him once youd been a winner you were supposed to go on winning distinguishing yourself what had old george patton said americans love to win and will not tolerate a loser but the problem with trying to talk about any problem in a letter to lana or anyone else was the damned censor oh the censor would keep it to himself all right wouldnt go about blabbing a medal of honor winners doubts about himself but the thought of anyone especially another marine seeing his innermost doubts revealed was too humiliating to contemplate no hed just have to bear up as his di had bellowed at him and thelma at parris island flush all the shit out and go forward or as adm john brentwood had said ad nauseum when the going gets tough yes i know david could hear his mother saying but were not all as tough as you john david smiled at the memory despite his dark mood he longed to see his mom remembering how as a small child he could go to her in the mornings and cuddle up the warm soft smell of her enfolding him safe from the world and he thought of melissa lange his last day with her a rushed lovemaking torn by anxiety about his posting to korea and by the memory of rick stacy a political science major stacy the weasel bow tie and forced preppy charm except he was from oregon having no doubt waited for david to move out so he could try a move on melissa the thought of her with stacy even though shed said her relationship with the weasel was strictly platonic was damn near unbearable in her most recent letter melissa had said stacy was applying for an mba program scholarship his tuition to graduate school being paid by an air force scholarship providing he would serve four years as a crewman in one of the air forces twoman or was it twoperson missile silos its a very popular program melissa had written david sure it was sixty feet underground wanking yourself off while everyone else was overseas with the crap coming from every direction david could see stacy now waltzing about in his missile crewmans blue jumpsuit cravat and missile shoulder patch for everyone to see the thought of stacy with his finger on the button david could imagine him strutting across campus writing aplus papers on the nuclear threatand how taking out a whole city wouldnt worry him one little bit trouble was after seeing the way the russians had shot americans out of hand david knew he wouldnt have much trouble pushing the button either if it came to that brentwood it was like being woken up from a sleep the british sergeants bullish voice rolling down the embankment of the canal brentwood yo answered david youre to report to brussels lad there are no hospital ships in brussels he told the sergeant who was one of the military policy detachments assigned to liege nothing about hospital ships lad hq wants you something about prisoners they suspect there might be a few of those bloody fancydress artistes sometimes david didnt know what the british were talking about churchill was right the english and americans were two races divided by a common language you know said the sergeant taking off his beret bowing and slapping it hard against his thigh before putting it on again artistes actors those bastards who took our blokes uniforms and oh spets said david what about them brussels thinks they might have captured some of the swine but they need positive id see were rounding up all you blokes from the db pocket who might have seen em least all of you who are still around londons dead set on making an example of em shoot a few of the pricks send a big message to moscow right david was surprised to find himself out of breath after walking up from the canal his old di wouldve been disgusted and he made a mental note right then and there that hed better get back into shape i doubt itll make any difference he told the sergeant pausing for breath spets are very professional wont stop them sending more like you marines eh said the sergeant he was a much taller man than david an angry glint in his eye well im inclined to agree mate continued the brit wont stop em i reckon but london wants to let em know that its the high jump if theyre caught bump off a couple anyway hell you shouldnt worry free trip to brussels lad see the sights wine women and song eh train leaves in two hours dont think i could identify any of the spets said david glancing worriedly up at the sergeant ahead were long white loamy cart tracks beside the canal some parts of europe hadnt changed in three hundred years except for the guy who shot your lieutenant said david couple of birds among them i hear said the sergeant bending down cracking a fallen branch from one of the poplars stripping the bark in no time and slapping it under his left arm as if he were the regimental sergeant major on parade david looked up at him puzzled birds women lad you know tits and yeah yeah i know said david hed been thinking about melissa and whenever he did crude descriptions of the female anatomy bothered him not interested charged the sergeant as they walked along the path david finding it hard to keep up the cart track stopped and became a bicycle path by the canal maybe said the sergeant lecherously youre dipping your wick into that admitting filly eh young lili he laughed so loudly anyone could easily have heard him on the far side of the bank no such luck answered david the truth was he hadnt really tried he guessed she mustnt be more than seventeen well boomed the sergeant shes got the hots for you boy medal of honor winner and all that yeah sure said david im serious lad ive seen her giving you the onceover when you pick up your hero mail cat if ever i saw it mark my words cat the sergeant thought for a moment slowed then stopped ah he said swiping the top off a long stem of reed grass pussy i mean isnt that what you call it cat said david starting to laugh the sergeant was exploding in laughter again when he finally got control he told david that several of the female pows were supposedly smashing youve seen them david asked surprised no but word has it theyll be ugly as sin said david beards most likely now dont be particular laddie its wartime no kiddin david replied im not kidding said the sergeant its in all the newspapers youre nuts said david he was starting to like the limey here said the sergeant thrusting his right hand out a packet in his hand whats this it was a strip panel of condoms if you dont know what to do with em ordered the sergeant read the instructions after you get through your fan mail he tapped them with his poplar stick see the condom instructions were in dutch course the sergeant said its all greek to me and began another belly roll of laughter but he kept laughing and wouldnt stop wildly swiping at more reed grass tears rolling down his face until the fixed glint in the britishers eye told david the man was quite mad despite the stinking kerosene fumes from the avgas sucked in by the airconditioning there was a halfhearted cheer in personnel two levels below the salt lake citys flight deck when the computers came back on line but they told the personnel director that lt comdr frank shirer was presently assigned to the tomcat squadron at dutch harbor on unalaska in the easternmost sector of the aleutian arc shot down over the western aleutians eight weeks before following an air strike from the carrier and picked up by a helo from one of the nine escorts in the battle group shirer had been taken to unalaska because of the big show in europe pilots were in short supply on the aleutian front and shirer had quickly found himself seconded to the air forces sixtyfifth wing stationed at dutch harbor what the computer didnt reveal was that between sorties over the russiancaptured outposts of adak and shemya at the westernmost reaches of the aleutian arc shirer had renewed a fleeting romance in dutch harbor with a wave nurse lana brentwood whom hed met years before in washington but the screen did show that shirer was afrcd available for recall to the carrier at the captains discretion very well the captain informed the personnel director check with dutch harbor my hunch is theyll be about as unhappy as i am to have one of our top guns reassigned to washington but if the pentagon wants him im not going to stand in their way any advisory on why they want him back east the personnel officers reply was drowned by the roar of a grumman eaprowler or wild weasel one of the ships electronic countermeasures aircraft landing on the roof say again asked the captain his eyes on a yellow jacket far below whose thumb was held high in the air as he sprinted away from the nose of the prowler the wash of jet engines flapping the mans vest the planes proboscislike midair refueling spout giving it the look of some giant insect anxious to be on its way compac gives no reason for requesting shirer sir the prowler was off swallowed by the darkness very well said the captain slapping the personnel director on the shoulder ours not to reason why phil draw up the papers ill sign them end of the watch wheres shirer now dutch harbor sir the captain nodded okay but the personnel director knew the old man was still trying to figure out why the hell washington awash in top brass would bother to recall one of the fleets top aces at a time when the damn russians were at the back door in the aleutians clearly using shemya and adak as advance carriers to islandhop along the island chain readying to hit americas western and most vulnerable flank for his part the pd was concerned it might be a bureaucratic screwup it had happened before a liaison officer in san diego ordered verbally by washington to grab the first available flight to what was supposed to be oakland the guy ending up twentyfour hours later in auckland new zealand we have any other shirers aboard asked the captain as he waited for the answer from the pd he never shifted his gaze from the flight deck watching the crews working feverishly the carrier launching a plane every fortyseven seconds meanwhile other aircraft from the battle groups constant combat patrols were coming in to land at over miles an hour one slip could take out two pilots flight deck crew and billiondollar aircraft in milliseconds captain came the pds reply weve got four shirers one also a frank a purple jacket but his numbers never mind the number get a repeat from washington phil son of a bitch whatd i tell you another pentagon snafu the pd requested verification of shirers service number one wrong digit was all it would take the confirmation came back within the hour it was frank shirer the fighter ace at dutch harbor whom washington wanted when he received the information the captain sighed resignedly telling his executive officer that neither salt lake city nor the aleutian command could afford the loss of even one pilot with more airsupported land battles shaping up in the aleutians very well he instructed the personnel director send message to dutch harbor immediate for shirer yes sir but phil sir i want that f back here he can be ferried back to pearl from here and then to washington via san diego he might be their fairhaired boy but the planes ours got it yes sir washington put in the executive officer is probably going to give him another medal the skipper shrugged even washingtons not that stupid he could receive it in the field its got me beat im tellin ya its ridiculous the executive officer agreed so did shirer chapter seven whether it had been mcraes morbid description of how maclain macdonald and his clan had been cut down or whether it was the strange effect of the subdued light in the western highlands that was responsible for his sense of unease robert brentwood wasnt sure but the sight of the glencoe massacre was unexpectedly grim and unsettling looking over the jagged outcrops of the gloomy glen he understood how it was the stuff not only of the inevitable ghost stories but of many a highlanders sense of separation from other men more than one scot sober as the bitter cold had sworn by everything holy that hed seen the bloodstreaked face of alastair maclain macdonald by god this is a barren place he said to rosemary as he stopped the car in one of the pullouts the sight of a red english phone booth standing by the road a hundred yards away distinctly anachronistic to the mournful windriven nature of the place the booths solitary presence only adding to roberts sense of anomie and to what rosemary called the spiritfilled strangeness of the place soon out of the bruised sky above ben nevis ten miles to the north more mist descended and at times completely obscured the long ribbon of narrow road behind them that had wound through the lonely valley to the desolate glen despite the mist robert was able to see a lone car second time said robert second time for what asked rosemary as they paused on their way back from the monument walking toward what rosemary called their car of ill repute what oh brentwood caught himself nothing just noticed that car down theres a yellow honda civic didnt realize there were so many in scotland lord said rosemary easily theyre common as colds in england that other couple at the b and b had one as well the prices did they robert asked surprised yes rental companies love them why easy silly less accidents in the fog best color yellow though i think its ghastly then she surprised him again besides robert if they were following us i should think theyd be a little more subtle than that i mean the only other car on the road huh grunted robert perhaps he was being a little paranoid but as one of the elite skippers whose sub was one of the most powerful in the world as well as being his countrys last line of defense in the event the war went nuclear he and everyone else on the sea wolf ii knew their vigilance didnt start and end with the sub even so rosie had a point why would the prices if it was them or the other people or anyone be so obvious as to be seen unlesshe began but trailed off as more thick clouds born about the summit of ben nevis gathered and came rolling down obliterating glencoes stark beauty it wasnt until they were halfway to the ferry that rosemary struck by roberts unusual bout of suspicion felt her chest tightening in a rush of fear as she realized russian agents would have no compunction in murdering a nuclear submarines captain she turned to him wideeyed in terror its an occupational hazard he explained quietly everybody knows about it when they join up is that supposed to comfort me guess not sorry i shouldnt have he paused smiling hell we could get hit by a bus you cant live in a box you can the in one she said my god you mean you accept this as a normal part of your right besides honey i do have my executive officer here for a second rosemary was nonplussed no robert explained shifting down using the gears as a brake on the narrow wet road i dont mean pete zeldman he said well then who do you robert pressed the glove box button nothing happened he punched it and the compartment lid dropped spilling out road maps as well as a smith wesson rosemary gasping for breath recoiled from it as if it were a snake dont worry he said casually safetys on steering with his right hand he slipped the between them and stuffed the maps back into the glove box dont look so shocked honey its only a gun there is a war going on rosemary started to say something but was still too astonished by the sight of the gun hey he said slipping his arm around her shoulder it was supposed to reassure you thats what its for well it doesnt she answered emphatically looking up at him as if in some way she were seeing him for the first time why didnt you tell me this before they issue them for protection while were ashore not to frighten brides it doesnt frighten me she said staring at the gun its khakigreen camouflage pattern making it appear more ominous to her it terrifies me hon he assured her i wasnt going to show you but you seemed so wound up about these you were wound up she answered yeah well he was using his left sleeve to wipe condensation off the windshield the diaphanous fog now pierced by rays of sunlight streaming down on the mosscovered crags theyre gone she said watching the rearview mirror robert adjusted it from where shed twisted it to one side combing her hair before theyd got out to see the glencoe memorial now he could see the road farther back but she was right the long stretch of blacktop along the valley floor was bereft of movement ahead lay loch ballachulish where rosemary informed him they would have to catch a ferry across the loch on their way to mallaig the fishing village six miles farther up on the rugged west coast in the prewar days mallaig had been a repairs port for russian trawlers out of the kola peninsula some suspected of being siglint signal intelligence listening for nato sub traffic around the holy loch sub pens eighty miles south from which all being well roosevelt would set out on another war patrol as soon as robert brentwood returned from his honeymoon a week from now i hope the ferrys on time said rosemary anxiously as they rounded the ubend leading down to the loch doesnt matter said robert we can fill in the time she looked quickly at him oh no you dont not again im not no he said i didnt mean that you didnt she asked feigning astonishment youre ill she took in a deep breath leaning back on the headrest telling herself not to be a ninny feeling better now that the car hadnt been seen following them after all youre getting tired of me she charged playfully ill never get tired of you he said doing a w c fields my little cooing turtle dove he took her hand in his never hmm a likely story robert could see a long calm cobaltcolored tongue of water coming into view their first sight of the loch and a welcome one after the unrelieved wildness and isolation of glencoe driving through the mistshrouded valley had been cozy enough part of the coziness coming from the safety of the warm car and its comforting dash lights which like those aboard a sub created a sense of security when in fact the line between civilization and the wild safety and danger was very thin where did you put the gun she asked suddenly it was no longer between them in my jacket he said it was blustery outside as they pulled up to wait for the ferry and cold despite the suns attempt to break free of the low stratus think ill hop out and stretch my legs he said youll freeze nah put on my old tweed coat here no problem she watched him draw up the collar of the tweed jacket as he walked away and waved back at her she loved watching the way he walked a purposeful yet relaxed stride that was somehow distinctly american part and parcel of their optimism which no matter what the odds refused to be dimmed shed noticed it the first time robert had met her greatuncle geoffrey robert and some australians shed known had no sense of class difference and so werent even aware they were crashing right through it with a friendly handshake and firstname familiarity they didnt give a fig about social status simply rode over it judging what a man said more than the way he said it she wound down the window dont go too far she called out over the howl of wind that was ruffling parts of the loch while other stretches of water remained surprisingly almost alarmingly calm he strode back down the hill whats wrong nothing oh dear im sorry pet just didnt want you to go too far the ferryll be here in ten minutes or so besides i dont want you to catch a cold you must be freezing have to spend a shilling he said oh she began perplexed oh she felt herself blushing and laughing at the same time he was walking away again its spend a penny she said well he said without turning around i was close you were not rosemary kept watching him and suddenly her smile and laughter vanished surely he could have waited until theyd reached the ferry and wasnt that one of those portable lavatories shed seen parked down by the ferry ramp all right rosemary brentwood she addressed herself sternly as if bringing one of her sixthform boys to order that will be quite enough of your morbidity it had been the sight of the loch that had upset her the unforgiving aspect of its gunmetal surface now that the sun was momentarily shut out again it called up the memory of her brother williams death on the atlantic convoy how one day he had sailed out never to be seen again so young she took a tissue from her purse and adjusting the rearview mirror began making herself look presentable good grief she told her reflection will you stop worrying robertll probably outlive you yes he would undoubtedly the an old man and in bed with her she used just a dab of blusher recalling georginas rather highminded counsel about how makeup was a bourgeois conceit it always astonished rosemary that here the whole world was at war the communist ideology so utterly discredited despite gorbachevs attempted reforms and yet there were still young intellectuals like georgina fresh from the thesis and antithesis of university and who filled with the outrage of people who know they will never actually have the responsibility of power could still be drawn to the lefts unholy mysteries she closed the lipstick holder adjusted the mirror and froze coming over the last dip before the long hill leading to the ferry was a yellow car chapter eight shirer saw there were fourteen minutes to go the sea hidden from him beneath the flat gray expanse that seemed to go on forever the edge of the front had come down from the bering sea over the aleutians even before shirer had taken off in his f tomcat number the second fighter assigned him the first lost when he was shot down by sergei marchenkos sukhoi and had to bail out over adak island before being picked up and taken to dutch harbor there he and lana brentwood had taken up where they had left off before the war but just when he was getting used to the idea that hed probably be with lana and flying out of dutch harbor for the foreseeable future he was jolted back to the bleak reality of just how unforeseeable any future was when he received the terse instruction from salt lake city that he was to deliver his jet back to the carrier shirer glanced at his vector control on radio silence approach toward the carrier his plane on a passive not active radar to warn him of any approaching bandits unless the russians had launched midair refuelers without aleutian radar picking them up there shouldnt be any danger by nature he was an optimist lana wasnt she had been through the trauma of a failed marriage with jay la roche the boss or some said don of la roche pharmaceuticals a multinational spread over twentythree countries including china shirer remembered that china was one of the countries because lana had told him it had been in shanghai that the threeyear marriage had ended in a violent attack on her by la roche who had beaten her so badly that only his money and influence with corrupt chinese officials had prevented charges being laid she had long ago learned to suffer the carefully chosen and medically screened stable of call girls and boys la roche had used on his business trips abroad but when his anal and oral fixations went beyond all bounds with her to the point at which excreta became inextricably linked in la roches mind with sex she had drawn the line and la roche had stepped over it he couldnt prevent her from leaving him from joining the navys whores as he jeeringly referred to the waves but no way he told her would he ever allow her to divorce him to cause him to lose face if she tried it la roche warned hed unleash his chain of tabloids and throw so much muck around about her parents that the family would be ruined theres no muck to throw around shed challenged him bravely she remembered his sneering cold reply youre so fucking naive lana i dont believe it doesnt matter whether its true or not once it hits the street on page one its game over for the brentwoods sweetheart it was little wonder shirer realized as they had parted in dutch harbor that shed learned to roll with lifes punches their washingtonenforced separation not upsetting her as much as he had expected or secretly hoped it might and yet he knew she loved him still her greatest fear wasnt of separation but of him simply vanishing somewhere over the vastness of the pacific more terrifying to her than anything jay la roche might have done i wont get shot down honey hed tried to assure her recognizing the hollowness of it as soon as he spoke you have been already then its over finished one time is all youre allowed if you get out of that youre home and a luminescent green dot the size of a pinhead was blipping on his radar screen the carrier he had done it hundreds of times before but during the approach his stomach still knotted his g suit warmer as the perspiration increased his heartbeat like most pilots faster now than when in a dogfight he still couldnt see the ship through the gray candy floss cloud flitting below him like a black river with air brakes full on he was coming in at over miles an hour he remembered that during freemans raid on pyongyang salt lake city had lost more planes on landing than in combat the slightest thing going wrong could mean curtains but it hadnt happened to him yet and hell he told himself cavalierly it wasnt going to happen now even if salt lake citys air boss was always claiming a fighter pilots worst enemy wasnt the russians but a woman who took your mind off one joystick onto another no way shirer told himself feeling the slight vibration of his oxygen mask convinced that the thought of making sweet unhurried love with lana was the best guarantee in the world that he wouldnt foul up his vector was dead on five minutes to the carrier the possibility of enemy fighters suddenly appearing and pouncing remoter than ever in salt lake citys air traffic control with the cic combat information center and in prifly primary flight control above flight deck control computers and status boards showed tomcat approaching the carrier with fiftyseven thousand pounds gross weight information conveyed instantaneously to the lso landing signal officer in the flight decks trench the lso his dayglo orange vest only dimly visible above the decks skirting kept one eye on the video recording s approach and the spin or speed indicator that showed the tomcats approach speed this speed together with that of the crosswind and carrier aided the lso in deciding the correct tension for the four arrestor wires too little would fail to stop the fighter within the three hundred feet too much could snap the cable with the same result tomcat two zero three five seven zero came the confirmation from the arresting gear room whose crew of four set the dials for fiftyseventhousand pounds shirer was looking for the orange ball of light in the big convex mirror mounted on the carriers starboard side if centered the orange blob of light would be a second visual confirmation of the glide path projected by his computer there were so many variables state of sea humidity cloud cover wind sheer he saw the orange ball between two horizontal green lights but it was above the mirrors midline he was too high quickly he realigned degrees of flap saw the orange orb go dead center and called meatball which told the lso he was on the balllocked into the correct glide path the relief in his voice palpable despite his long experience the lsos voice blasted shirers earpiece and suddenly either side of the meatball he saw two vertical red lines appear a wave off damn try again instructed the lso shirer hitting the button for full afterburner the tomcat veering hard left engines screaming in a banshee howl as it climbed leaving the carriers island leaning hard right and slipping downhill then the carrier was gone below cloud try again two oh three repeated the lso nose wheel not lowered in flight deck control a man on the ouija board moved the plastic model of to the side while another crewman took up his grease pencil a backup in case of power failure and marked s position on the transparent plastic screen asking he a nugget no replied comdr phil harris the officer in charge of fdc flight deck controlnothing green about him been on this tub longer than you have two oh three said the crewman disbelievingly i havent heard of a tomcat of ours with that number its been in dutch harbor watch him hes turning got him replied the seaman cockily skidding the plastic model around two oh three was already on infrared video its ghostly outline like an underdeveloped negative a heat blur around the twin twentyonethousand pound pratt and whitney exhausts heat streamers trailing from the fuselages shimmering edge shirer pressed the nose wheel release button again unable to hear whether or not it was coming out of its well because of the noise of the fighters engines the indicator nevertheless showing the wheel was down his g suit feeling like a sauna as he took another run over the carrier alert for other incoming aircraft he was on a vector that would take him fifty feet above the flight deck giving the lso and other deck crew plus everyone in prifly a chance to see whether the wheel was in fact down there it is said one of the redjacketed ordnance crew no responded a green jacket from electronics maintenance his arm following the line of the plane its only halfextended you sure sure im sure the lso saw it swooping directly overhead through the mist lso to two oh three your nose wheel is only halfextended do you read me affirmative nose wheel halfextended came shirers voice crackling through static lso to two oh three go to five thousand repeat five thousand minimum radius ten miles repeat ten miles and hold pattern i say again hold pattern going to five thousand confirmed shirer silently cursing the nose wheel will hold pattern the carrier couldnt waste any more time on him at the moment he would have to hold pattern until salt lake city got all its other planes which included combat patrols approaching bingofuel exhausted status and only then when his tomcats fuel was all but gone reducing the risk of fire could they try to bring him in his eyes refocused on his helmet display which remained steady despite the motion of the fighter shirer could see he had fiftyseven minutes of fuel remaining meantime hed try the wheel again he thought he felt it give a little hoped that it might only be a bird jamming the lower gear a birds body most likely a gull would compress on retraction unless it was one of the big wandering albatross with a wingspan up to seven feet but hed felt no impact he tried the release again and it seemed to give but only a fraction trouble was it was so damn hard to be certain given all the noise simultaneously the indicator panels constant flickering demanded close attention if he was to avoid midair collision with the ferry almost at the dock and the yellow honda rolling slowly up behind theirs rosemary looked about anxiously for robert she saw him walk out from the bracken behind the prices coming up to them on the drivers side rapping on the window rosemary saw price start winding down the window looking flustered going to mallaig robert asked price his tone convivial ah yes price turned to his wife joan said wed probably meet up with you small world said robert still smiling rosemaryll be glad to see you he indicated the ferry at the dock better be getting back to the car see you on board ah yes by the time robert reached the car the ferry attendant was waiting for him to drive on down the ramp there obviously wasnt any hurry about it not until the christmas rush in a few days time would the lonely road see a line of cars and trucks backed impatiently waiting to cross the loch well asked rosemary what did they say not much answered robert seemed surprised he pulled his seat belt strap across looking at rosemary better buckle up more accidents happen leaving port except were not on your submarine she replied affably and were not leaving port exactly buckle up accidents happen when you least expect them as they approached the ferry and he was watching the prices in the rearview rosemary saw that on the other side of the loch mist had crept right down to the bank and she pointed out patches of old snow discolored by pink algae visible among the heather in a few more seconds the mist was replaced by heavy fog tongues of it tumbling like dry ice over the embankment spreading quickly turning what had been the cobalt blue of the loch into a monotonous gray sheet i dont fancy being ahead of them in that she said indicating the fog on the far side of the loch neither do i how can we avoid it said rosemary almost as if she were asking him to turn back her suspicion of the prices now complete not like the big ferry is it i mean well be first on and first off they went over the bump of the ramp the metal drop plate reverberating under them followed by a quieter sound as the tires burred on the grooved steel decking itll be all right robert told her what are you going to do ill think of something what did she say mrs price nothing all smiles didnt seem surprised at all very cool perhaps she doesnt know robert looked across at rosemary it was the kind of glance she used to give a student when he didnt know what came after hamlets to be or all right then she conceded so she would have to know if shes with him all the time i mean if she is his wife was she wearing a ring what oh i dont know never noticed men never do ring wouldnt prove anything not these days he saw the hood of the prices honda dip toward the deck as it pulled up behind them keep the doors locked he told rosemary i wont be stay here locked in she said adopting a cockney accent to convey the apprehension an uppermiddleclass upbringing wanted to subdue not ruddy likely im coming with you as robert walked around to the left side of the car and opened her door the wind buffeting his tweed jacket he felt the bulk of the gun against his chest if there was any comfort in it it was also a reminder that he hadnt practiced with the serviceissued sidearm for at least three years at norfolk virginia when hed first taken command of roosevelt opening her door he gave her his hand and flashed a honeymoon smile get mrs price if thats who she is off to one side get her talking i want to jaw with her old man yes rosemary said hesitantly all right you know he was very defensive about not having joined up when old mcrae remember challenged him about being a lecturer at lse hello mrs price called out jovially a bit nippy isnt it yes said rosemary still expect it wont do us any harm do us the world of good i should think said mrs price fresh air james smokes a pipe they were drawing level with a yellow school bus from some girls school a few giggling as robert walked by one of them calling out i say there tall dark and there was more laughing robert nodded at mrs price but kept walking toward her husband at the stern addressing him with a questioning air ive never seen snow like that before have you oh said price looking up the pink stuff yes its quite common up here both men were close to the rail spray catching their face robert despite his preoccupation about the prices automatically wondering what the freshtosaltwater ratio was in the loch for a sub diving it would be critical information altering the density and therefore the subs buoyancy if you didnt react fast enough to a sudden change youd be dead youre familiar with these parts then he said to price while leaning eagerly into the wind against the rail without looking at price but remembering that at the bedandbreakfast place price had said it was his first trip to scotland ah yes price conceded adding hastily well you know ive read a lot about scotland before i came robert said nothing for a second or two his gaze fixed on the fog cascading down the bank they had just left encircling them i heard an interesting story the other day oh yes said price politely brentwood was still watching the shore yeah it was about this guy kept following a sergeant and his wife they were taking a trip through the sierras back in california wherever they went he went well after a couple of days this sergeant pulled the guy over and told him that if he didnt bug off hed get his head blown off there was a long silence and all brentwood could hear was the ferrys wake boiling furiously into the calm loch rather silly of the sergeant said price i mean to threaten people like that i would have thought all he needed to do was call up the local constabulary you know the police register a complaint robert turned to look at price noticing the mans hairline was receding something he hadnt been aware of at the mcraes there price had looked well groomed hair combed down over the front in a stylishly casual forelock he wondered how much else he hadnt noticed about price funny you mentioned that said brentwood about calling the police the sergeant did look for a phone it was high in the mountains you see not many people around when he did find one it had been trashed line cut price shook his head tuttutting vandals everywhere the change in prices tone from his offbalance surprise in the car to his present air of confidence told brentwood his bluff wasnt working he should have asked the englishman pointblank instead hed given the man time to think regain his balance anyway continued price what do you think the police could have done to help the sergeant the sergeant could have been delusional i dont think he was said brentwood his eyes fixing price look old chap said price youre making me a bit nervous with that bulge in your jacket ive made a bit of a cockup with all this but well i suppose this wont assuage you very much but im not who you think i am nor is joan robert brentwood said nothing waiting point is continued price pushing the disobedient lock of hair back special branch didnt see much point in unduly alarming you certainly not on your honeymoon and especially given what you sub chapsve done for us re the convoys were all terribly grateful brentwood let the flattery go by him like the spray what special branch scotland yard joan and i have been tailing you ever since you left surrey your wedding what the hell peter zeldman price cut in your executive officer was best man georgina spence your wifes sister was bridesmaid young william spence was killed in the atlantic looked after by lana brentwood your sister its through her looking after him that you met rosemary correct i mean you took young spences personal effects to his parents during one of your shore leaves from the roosevelt how am i doing anyone could have learned all that stuff said brentwood reading a paper down in surrey do be reasonable old sport said price flashing a special branch card youve got american express too and youre a blood donor right robert challenged him anyone can get cards printed up sport many as they like price slipped the card away glanced behind them squinting in the suninfused fog seeing rosemary and joan price ambling from the ferrys bow back toward the cars another few minutes and the ferryd be across the loch look said price i dont want to be indelicate old boy but dyou know your sister lana was transferred to the aleutians sure i know responded robert brentwood she wrote me her ex is a stringpuller congressmen in his pocket whats indelicate about that i mean the real reason she was transferred robert brentwood shrugged i told you la roche is the original sleazeball besides aleutians is a combat zone he paused looking hard at price the russians are trying to get through the back door theres a navy hospital at dutch harbor so well im not saying la roche had nothing to do with it but he lucked out as you americans put it the navy already had a good reason to banish her up there he paused still looking at the far shore your sister was transferred to the aleutian theater old boy because her care of young william spence shall we say exceeded the requirements of duty he paused to let it sink in not to put too fine a point on it captain she performed certain shall we sayfavors what the hell dyou mean i think you americans call it a blow job rosemary heard a crack prices watch smashing against the ferrys bulkhead as robert brentwood felled him with one blow you son of a bitch price stayed down only daring to raise himself slightly on one arm the other held up in submission rosemary made to run toward them but joan price grabbed her arm no stay here get up you son of a bitch yelled robert brentwood his voice all but inaudible to the women his face red tweed jacket ballooning in the wind get up or ill im not making began price fearing the blow to his chin had fractured his jaw his voice breathless im not making a moral judgment the spence boy was dying perhaps it was an act of look im sorry but if you dont believe im from special branch i had to convince price paused his face grimacing in pain we havent been following you well we have but its the other two newlyweds that we were really shadowing youre inbetween as it were brentwood looked blank your innocent young gi price continued easing himself back so he could rest against the bulkhead you know the young couple at the b and b confetti still in their hair and his lovely wife real charmer she is been to bed with two of your sub captains already found them should say what was left of em down by loch lomond we had to change everything including their subs etd from holy loch just in case our bonny pair got anything out of them he paused feeling his jaw wishing he hadnt were your minders he told brentwood we caught up with them just before you reached the b and b they were your late arrivals you were bloody lucky you didnt make it to burnss cottage the sweet young thing was carrying a beretta and two shrapnel grenades very nice by now price felt safe enough to get up im afraid were on duty till we see you safely back at holy loch sorry to dampen your nuptial bliss but we cant afford to lose a sea wolf skipper especially now robert brentwood gave a grunt sorry isuch a fool didnt realize not to worry price assured him dusting himself down the wind from the loch playing havoc with his hairpiece national healthll take care of the teeth i hope he tried a grin but his jaw hurt too much i feel like a goddamned idiot said robert his face still red from wind chill and embarrassment here they are protecting us and we think well responded rosemary chagrined by her own embarrassment but her tone more defensive they should have told us no said brentwood he glanced in the rearview and gave a friendly wave price honked in reply if wed known they were following us it wouldnt have been much of a honeymoon wouldve seemed like someone was watching us through the keyhole all the time rosemary didnt like it but she had to agree the thought of her and robert trying to make love with two people staking the place out from across the hallway of the b and b would certainly have put her right off oh no she said they must have heard everything her face was between her fingers looking at robert tell me was i screaming with joy he said all the time she slid down into her seat as they drove off five miles on both cars disappearing into fog rosemary gasped in fright turning to robert my god he mightnt be from special branch at all i mean he could be just saying that to no robert interjected he told me some stuff that only someone in the know could have a handle on they couldnt have found it out in surrey found out what what kind of things about my family robert answered gearing down on a hill the fog so thick he could barely see the front of the hood i dont want to talk about it damn it i wish this goddamned demister would work the car slowed robert unconsciously taking his foot off the gas pedal not because of the fog or his preoccupation with the windshield misting but because he realized a russian agent could as easily have had contacts in north america and the aleutians as in surrey that the information about lana if it was true whats assuage mean he asked rosemary a little embarrassed to allay she explained eagerly without a trace of surprise why she pressed did price use it yes he said he hoped hed assuaged my suspicions has he robert pushed himself backward from the steering wheel his back hard against the seat arms still as if bracing himself for a crash it was one of the isometric exercises he often used during the long watches aboard the sub and which he would be doing in several days time when if he returned safely to holy loch i dont know hon he told rosemary he could have got all the stuff about my family from some i dont know some intelligence network in the states prices jaw was throbbing and badly swollen on the left side could you hand me one of those towelettes from the glove compartment he mumbled or are they in the boot joan opened her purse took out the beretta ninemillimeter and rummaged through the contents heres one she pronounced triumphantly tearing it open and passing the towelette to him dabbing it gently on his chin he relished the temporary cold that took the edge off the pain by god he can pack a wallop hope he isnt like that on his submarine a man like that in charge of how many is it fortyeight nuclear warheads gives me the willies i can tell you thought they were supposed to be the silent type not bloody rowdies you were talking about his sister how did you know all that about her anyway because he replied i do my homework thats why the thing robert brentwood found unforgivable in himself was that try as he might to push the image of lana performing oral sex on young spence from his mind the more he fantasized about whether rosemary would do it for him the moment he thought he had evicted the scene from his mind as unworthy of him the more pervasive it became until he had such an erection he thought rosemary would be sure to notice at least he hoped she would the image of her moist red lips encasing him her tongue darting with abandon sucking him dry made him doubt whether they could make mallaig without him having to pull over returning again and again to what price had said about lana he remembered price also saying something about how grateful the admiralty was for the protection afforded by the sea wolfs especially now but surely the subs had always been important to admiralty why especially now he mentioned it to rosemary perhaps somethings happened she proffered that we havent heard yet on the news robert switched on the radio but highlands static crackled like a log fire anyway it was a violation of their pledge not to listen to any newscasts while on their honeymoon not to let anything intrude on their alltoobrief time together but now he wondered whether their pact had been a good idea after all he hated not knowing what was going on he looked in the rearview again but couldnt see prices car not even the yellow eyes of fog lights he was unsure as to whether he should pull over and wait or keep going chapter nine the white house when the army chief of staff general grey arrived from the pentagon and was ushered into the oval office by press aide trainor he wasnt sure whether the president had heard him and so coughed politely to announce his presence the chief executive of the united states was reclining in the black leather chair behind the dark oak desk from hms resolutegiven to the much earlier president hayes by queen victoria in the great seal of the united states carved on its front adding to the quiet dignity of the office that general grey found distinctly gloomy in the fading evening light outside the darkening magnolia bushes and stark brambles of the rose garden added to the heavy oppressive atmosphere that had descended about the white house since the news had come in from the big aerial arrays at fort meade in maryland the elint electronic intelligence experts had picked up forcomps forward command post signals between the us and south korean armies under the command of gen b w anderson supreme commander of all allied forces in southeast asia on top of this mayne was in the throes of a migraine attack it being no consolation to him as trainor well knew that other presidents too had been victims of disease while in office that ulysses s grant had suffered one of his worst migraine attacks the night before lees surrender take a seat general said mayne waving him in the gloom to the redandyellowstriped cushioned chair to the left of the presidents desk and directly in front of the presidential flag as the generals eyes adjusted to the dim light he could see the president wasnt looking directly at him but was deep in thought in the island of soft peachcolored light casting its glow on the portrait of george washington in full uniform above the mantel i was told began the president his voice quiet measured your intelligence boys told me beijing couldnt do what theyve now done maynes right arm came into view indicating the map of the big prick as the pentagon called the korean peninsula set up to the right of him already in the first twentyfour hours of heavy fighting between the enemy and usrok forces there were over eleven thousand american casualties the chinesenorth korean breakthrough was threatening to be an even bigger rout of the usrok forces than that suffered by them at the beginning of the war around the pusanmasan perimeter in the far south the president turned to the general how many chinese have crossed already grey rose and reluctantly took up the retractable pointer its tip sliding from southwest along the line of the yalu to the northeastern end of the eighthundredmilelong river that had been the border between the korean peninsula and manchuria for a thousand years they moved down from up here mr president in shenyang chinas most northeasterly province the thirtyninth army out of anshan the fortieth from shenyang city itself and the sixtyfourth from fushun possibly theyve moved the twentyfourth up from yangshan but that would have to be seconded from beijing command how many troops altogether asked mayne ah a hundred and twenty thousand thereabouts mr president grey paused for a second or two to collect his spittle give or take a division how in jesus name began mayne turning on the general can a onehundredandtwentythousandman army and their equipment move looking back at the map he eyeballed the distance south from shenyang to the yalu a hundred and fifty miles over mountainous terrain in the dead of winter cross a goddamn river and take us by surprise the rivers frozen over sir all right then a hundred and twenty thousand of them crossing a frozen river and taking us by surprise and our intelligence units didnt see any of them until i get this elint report until its too late come on general maynes voice was rising where are all those superduper movement sensors and infrared nighttime scopes we used in vietnam and for which i had to fight congress the general didnt think it appropriate to remind the president of the united states that sensors hadnt stopped general giap in vietnam either though grey had to concede the president had a point he nevertheless felt obliged on behalf of the us army to explain the difference here mr president is that under the terms of your our agreement with beijing any overflights by us to drop those sensors on the yalus northern bank would have violated chinese air space all right jimmy but whats wrong with your mens eyes he gave the yalu the back of his hand the map stand shaking from the impact how the hell do a hundred and twenty thousand chinese regulars give or take a division general thatd be another thirteen thousand right yes sir how do a hundred and thirtythree thousand men move up and down mountains and get across the yalu without us seeing a goddamned one of them sir its an old chinese maneuver they used it on doug macarthur they travel only at night hide by day anyone moves they execute them by bayonet on the spot saves a bullet and theres not even the noise of a shot we can pick up mayne returned to the desk his face contorted as much by pain despite his effort not to show it as by the sudden catastrophe of china with its standing army not counting reserves of over three million men having entered and suddenly exploded what the pentagon in their report to the president were pleased to call the parameters of the war parameters said mayne theyve blown the gate wide open jimmy theyve he sat down in the chair and was silent for a moment jimmy i dont want to sound like a hardass or anything but if this is an old chinese trick like firecrackers why the hell werent you ready for it didnt we have reconnaissance patrols aircraft yes sir but we could only go as far as the yalu christ jimmy im no mayne hesitated his mind searching for the name of an ace pilot frank shirer i dont even have a pilots license but even i know if you fly high enough you can see over a damn river see anything move our satellites supposed to read pravda in red square from space right i dont know who made up that old crock mr president but its far from accurate more a pr dont nitpick jimmy you know what i mean how come the first i hear of it is in a national intelligence digest out of fort meade who picked up a radio intercept from some poor kid in one of our forward observation posts screaming that he was being overrun by chinese the weather sir its been snowing like crazy the last few days not even the satellites could get through that before that pressed mayne relentlessly he wasnt interested in assigning guilt but he damn well didnt want it to happen anywhere else in europe for instance or god forbid at the aleutian back door or the middle east general grey retracted the pointer sir we just plain didnt see them i mean thats pretty tough discipline they have sir the general could see mayne behind the desk sitting well back in his chair but far from relaxed hand massaging his temple well i wish we had that kind of discipline our boys and the south koreans are on the defensive again just when i thought we could wrap it up in korea and divert some of our divisions up to the aleutians and europe now that doug freemans got us moving again over there he sat forward hands clasped on the green blotter speaking more slowly now more reflectively course if we were like them had the kind of army where you could shoot a man for moving i suppose we wouldnt be fighting them but hell jimmy weve got to do something fast by pulling back retreating like this some units just plain broke mr president and ran maynes arms were cradling his head the thumbs pressing hard into tense neck muscle got to get some stiffener over there or else his voice was more agitated than the general had ever heard it or well have a goddamn agrade number one fullblown political and military disaster on our hands he was out of the chair again fingers running about his belt glancing up at the map for several seconds then turning toward grey if we lost korea jimmy as a base the only one we have on mainland asia from which to harass russias southern flank then he broke off his tone suddenly infused with new energy jimmy were still pressing ahead in europe am i right no surprises in the last twentyfour hours or anything no sir everythings going as well as can be expected doug freemans got the russkis retreating so fast hes in danger of outrunning his own supply line the british and norwegians are worried moscow could panic throw in the conventional towel and go nuclear while theyve still got time theyll talk peace before that said mayne im not so sure sir i mean it might be politburo policy to talk before anyone pushes the button but policy gets the bums rush when panic sets in it only takes some nut some kid on an ss battery to start it and remember the russians and chinese have huge shelters havent a hope of saving most of their population and industry of course and they know it but the chinese figure on say saving twenty percent of their population in the worst possible case for us thatd be totally unacceptable but in china thats two hundred million people left russian estimate used to be theyd lose twentyfour million and still theyd have more than twice our population we havent got anything like their civil defense our public was so pummeled with that nuclear winter shit excuse me sir that we didnt think there was any point to civil defense so if the russians do panic in the face of freemans advance were in one hell of a lot of then wed better slow down the advance tell freeman to consolidate give him time to build up supplies good point jimmy about the supply lines will the joint chiefs go for a halt they will sir from the generals quick response mayne guessed the c in cs had instructed him to make that very argument then i suggest we transfer doug freeman immediately to c in c korea get anderson out of there put freeman back on his old turf for a while this the general wasnt ready for but mr president we want to slow down in europe yes but if we take general freeman out and theres a russian counterattack then dont tell me we havent got any other generals over there jimmy defensive backs of course not sir i simply mean that freeman has a high profile if the russkis see him withdrawing itll be a demonstration of enormous confidence in all our other field commanders countered mayne most of them trained by you jimmy i might add maybe sir but still jimmy freeman knows korea he attacked the north korean capital at night got in got out and gave us time to reinforce the pusanmasan perimeter we need a man like that you mean someone a little bit crazy we have to get those chinese back across the yalu i dont know if even doug freeman can do that mr president lets try the general nodded his assent very well sir jimmy sir if you arent happy with bringing him out of europe how about we play a shell game general grey frowned general we live in a country that produces more actors than any other we breed them by the bushel hell if i remember correctly one of them occupied this office there was subdued laughter from trainor general grey was warming to the idea a double you wont have much time conceded mayne but grey pursing his lips was considering the logistics it might just work they did it with montgomery but how about freemans getting to korea if that gets out the russians it wont said mayne turning to trainor under wraps no press shut everything down like reagan did in grenada and bush in panama keep the press right out of it and only allow two or three of dougs top aides to go with him leave the rest in europe hell hell need to leave most of them in europe to execute his strategy over there until he gets back mr president general grey told his commander in chief doug freemanll the without the press without an audience then hell the in a good cause said mayne reaching for the water decanter a signal to trainor it was time for the pain pills think positive frank shirer told himself as one by one he saw the green blips of salt lake citys brood of aircraft disappearing from his radar screen as they landed safely on the carrier finally only one blip remained approximately three miles starboard aft of the carrier the sea king helo on its plane guard station shirer had been making pattern for thirty minutes and the nose wheel hadnt budged so that now he knew that he had only twentyseven minutes remaining before hed have to take her in like a bird like a bird he repeated to himself recalling the words of his old instructor during his first carrier landing coming in on a carriers way different from having a mile of runway to screw around on go in like the birds feet first get your rear rubber down hook the wire and the nosell take care of itself the only trouble was this time shirer knew the nose wouldnt take care of itself not with the wheel only halfway down he tried to remember whether there had ever been a barricade engagement on salt lake citya crash landing racing at miles an hour into the nylon net in another three minutes commander harris in flight deck control was watching the last of the salt lake citys air umbrella an ec hawkeye longrange warning aircraft its rotodome stem retracting the dome sitting on the planes fuselage like a huge white pancake wings already folding up and back as the plane was being hauled by a mule a flat yellow tractor to the port elevator as fast as the crosswind would allow so that it could be moved out of harms way in the hangar deck below soon as that babys in the dungeon instructed harris let me know yes sir replied a tired assistant one deck below in air traffic control which was part of the combat information center sir lso says we may have a foul deck chri harris began checked himself and asked how longs two oh three got fuel for twentyfour minutes sir the flight deck commander called the lso what he needed to know was whether the lso had any idea of what the debris on the deck might be and where cant tell you phil came the lsos reply might be nothing but thought i saw something drop off when the last hawkeye came in it was a clean trap wasnt it the fdc asked the lso yeah clean trap but i thought i saw something after she hit could have been thrown up in her wash okay wed better check it out looked like it was near three cat he meant the white line that marked the waist catapult run thanks pete answered the worried fdc if it was an obstacle near the waist catapult line it could be a dislodged nut fuel tank flap or anything from the scores of deck vehicles used to push and pull the planes into position a nut sucked into either one of the tomcats intakes could mean a multimilliondollar engine gone or a seabird that had been hit and knocked to the steelgrooved deck could become an instant lubricant the moment the twentyfiveton aircraft its nose wheel not fully extended landed sending the tomcat sliding an inch or two out of alignment which at over a hundred miles an hour could wipe out the aircraft and anyone nearby the fdc lifted the phone for the air boss six decks above him depressed the other phone atop his right shoulder and requested a search party for the area around the four arrestor wires they simply didnt have time for a fullfledged walkdown to make sure the deck was sterile within a minute the chief petty officer and the sixteenman search party team were scouring the deck and it was seaman first class sic elmer ventral whod been on the salt lake less than a year who spotted the oil rag caught in the corner of one of the fourfeetdiameter circular steel mountings that houses the oneandahalfinchthick cable to which the number one arrestor wire was attached whenever the wire hooked an aircraft the big cable took the strain all right said the chief petty officer whose job it would be to report to flight deck control lets get inside before we all freeze our butts off young ventral two days away from his twentyfirst birthday married little more than fourteen months and already a father felt good about having found the oil rag it couldnt really have caused that much damage unless it got sucked in by an air intake but the air boss was a fanatic about a sterile deck and ventral knew it would stand him in good stead the cpo who had to tell the fdc wasnt so lucky jesus christ harris bellowed what was that doing there somebody must have dropped it sir i know somebody dropped it chief and i want his ass you read me yes sir said the cpo but he knew the task would be hopeless so did the fdc they were both feeling bad about it both having worked with the air boss long enough to know that when any single player screwed up the team screwed up fdc called prifly and told the air boss what had fouled his deck a rag said the air boss his voice rising like a tenor going for the high c as he walked or rather stalked behind the grease pencil status board and stared down into the bluish light that washed the flight deck weve got a man to come down and some jokers dropped a fuckin rag yes sir listen phil i want his ass yes sir the moment he put the phone down the air boss turned to priflys mini boss get lieutenant ronson up here pronto yes sir ronson was the chief of the salt lake citys tv station the air boss knew there was no chance of finding out who exactly dropped the rag but he was going to make it item one cut right into the movie and play it on every shift for the next fortyeight hours theyd be so goddamned sick of that oil rag meantime he had a plane to get down and glancing at the realtime prifly clock saw he had seventeen minutes we going to get this barricade up in time it was more an order than a question but the mini boss complied theyre working on it sir they think theyll make it the air boss picked up his binoculars looking down at the barricade a series of tough hydraulically anchored nylon ribbons forming a vertical netting that stood twentyfour feet high strung across the flight deck and which he hoped would catch the tomcat if due to the necessarily high up angle the pilot would have to have on the nose the tomcat missed the three wire you done one of these before henry the air boss asked his assistant no sir what time we got henry sixteen minutes sir replied the mini boss wondering whether his superior had ever handled a barricade engagement himself weather report sir interjected a seaman handing him the printout winds dying but more fog great said the air boss sardonically just what we fucking need be lucky if he can see the meatball we got rescue and fire all set henry all set sir anyone loses a goddamned oil rag in future and the whole shift pays beer ration cut to one can or zilch he shifted his binoculars to look down at the port side of the barricade being laid out its nylon ribbons flapping furiously in the cross wind how much time we got henry fourteen minutes sir said the mini boss the other spotter trying to keep visual contact with shirers blinking red light along with the radar blip the mini boss looked teed off couldnt the air boss read a goddamned clock everyone was getting too tense five decks below tv technicians were plugging into the flight deck camera feed with the crew of over five thousand below decks run ragged by the dayin dayout dangerous task of keeping planes constantly airborne the tomcats final approach might as well entertain as instruct in the dungeon above the noise of the mules pushing and pulling planes about and scores of technicians swarming over parked planes many of the aircraft looking as if theyd been roughly cannibalized for spare parts some green jackets checking tomcat avionic slipin pullout circuit boards in the black boxes started making book on whether shirer would make it or not more navy pilots had been lost in accidents than had been shot down up on the flight deck in the wait room sc elmer ventral whose job it was to race out to release the hook immediately after a plane caught the wire was being ribbed by the rest of the work crew whod awarded him the roforroyal order of the fucking oil rag unbeknownst to ventral the cpo in charge of the shift ventral was part of following carrier tradition had called down to one of the bakeries aboard to have them bake a cake for ventrals birthday and to decorate it with something that looked like an oil rag up in prifly the air boss was going over everything that could possibly go wrong he called down to flight deck control harris yes sir phil you have the new weight for two oh three the loss of weight occasioned by the tomcat burning up as much fuel as possible before landing would have to be vectored in so the arrestor wires wouldnt be too taut weve got it covered sir good man barricades up sir reported the mini boss clear the deck ordered the air boss his voice projected by the powerful pa system designed to cut through any noise on the carrier including the cacophony of noise attending the launch of a full air operation when the air boss dispatched the carriers planes at a rate of one every thirty seconds decks clear came the confirmation two minutes later very good acknowledged the air boss fog bank closing another voice informed him not good said the air boss turning around there was a nervous chuckle the air boss then ordered the sea king helo off the starboard beam to move from its plane guard position three miles away from the carrier to one mile if the pilot overshot and had to ditch there was no way the ninetythousand ton ship at twentytwo knots could stop or alter course to assist risking the integrity of the entire battle group besides even if all engines were shut down it would still take the ship over a mile to stop after crossing the loch robert and rosemary noticed how many more cars were coming south from mallaig than those like themselves heading north toward the fishing port and after a while when the prices car hadnt shown up behind them robert brentwood grew even more suspicious of the englishmans story if the prices or whatever their real name was were really protecting him and rosemary then theyd be going on to mallaig for robert the choice was clear either he and rose could go on ahead to mallaig looking over their shoulders all the time in the foga hell of a way he murmured to spend your honeymoonor he could do something about it as he made the uturn cautiously in the swirling fog heading back in the direction of the ferry rosemary asked him to pass her another gravol whether it was morning sickness or from their runin with the prices she didnt know but she felt awful brentwood saw the vague shape of a car coming at him from the direction of the ferry it wasnt the prices it occurred to him they might have turned back to the ferry recrossed the loch and made a call perhaps arranged a little surprise for the captain of the sea wolf in mallaig away from witnesses and the busload of kids on the ferry after another five minutes or so he saw what at first seemed to be a cluster of lambs and a shepherd at the roadside but on getting closer he could see it was a group of teenage girls and immediately behind them the school bus the girls in buffcolored skirts and maroon blazers stood near the bus which had a miter with a scroll underneath painted on its side it was pulled off on the opposite side of the road where it had been heading for mallaig and soon he could read st marks written in black letters above the more colorful school emblem the girls were all standing in a group subdued a moment later he saw two figures a man and a woman emerging from behind the bus but saw it wasnt the prices the woman in a gray pleated skirt and coat was walking toward him briskly and behind her was a man who appeared to be the bus driver wearing an anorak the woman obviously in charge nodded brusquely anything the matter he asked theres been an accident she replied matteroffactly can you help i know first aid said brentwood getting out of the car what its too late for that im afraid she said first aid the bus driver looked shaken turning his arm pointing behind the bus to a car lopsided in a ditch almost completely hidden by bracken brentwoods first thought was that it was the prices but he couldnt tell from this distance i think began the bus driver what miss sawyers means sir is that you could help us if youd take a message for us to mallaig we cant go over sixty kilometers an hour on the bus be a while afore we get in if youre going in that direction said the schoolmistress no problem said robert be glad to help just give me the message and ill noo lass called out the bus driver miss wilson where you think youre going robert saw it was one of the schoolgirls across the road moving away from the group mother nature the girl replied up tother way the driver instructed her and not too far from the bus mind we could lose you in this lot the schoolmistress was leading brentwood back to the car obscured by the bracken it was the pricess a terrible accident she said perhaps we shouldnt touch anything christ said brentwood the mistress wincing at his blasphemy sorry he went on not wanting to look any further but feeling compelled i think we should keep it quiet she said her voice calm but nevertheless strained until you reach mallaig no point in upsetting the girls any more than they have been one or two of them saw the broken glass otherwise we wouldnt have seen the car in the bracken thank goodness wilkins our bus driver had the sense to keep them away from it yes agreed robert well leave it to me miss ill tell the police in mallaig maybe you should give me your name and you she asked robert showed her the us navy card with his photo she was visibly relieved oh thank goodness i saw you leaving the ferry you see and wondered brentwood suddenly remembered something too the car speeding past him in the rain shortly after hed made the uturn to come back what if he and rosemary hadnt turned but like the prices had kept on in the fog toward mallaig listen miss sawyers he said urgently i think we should all go into mallaig on your bus can we hitch a ride with you why yes but i havent time to explain fully yet he saw her suspicion return look when we get to mallaig you can call this number here on my card its the us navy attach√© at the us embassy in london but right now i think itd be best if we all go in together to mallaig perhaps one of us should stay here and she began no cut in brentwood no one stays here everyone gets on the bus the teacher and the driver looked uneasily at one another trust me said brentwood i know what im doing believe me the driver made noises about sweeping the glass off the road leave it said brentwood believe me i know what im doing very well i suppose began miss sawyers youd best get the girls back on the bus wilkins yes miss the drive to mallaig was a mournful one only a few of the girls talking a few giggling trying to act nonchalant despite their having come across what miss sawyers had somberly told them was a fatal accident but i didnt see any damage to the car rosemary insisted it was on the driversside fender robert told her on the right side you couldnt see it from where our car was parked slammed right into the ditch price probably dozed off at the wheel how dreadful the gravol hadnt worked yet and she felt so ill she thought she was going to throw up when the bus reached the mallaig police station it was an anticlimax for the girls of st marks who had thought they were in sole possession of knowledge of the accident but the police said someone had already called it in that being the case robert told the desk sergeant he was surprised he hadnt seen any ambulance or rescue vehicle passing them on the way in ah replied the desk sergeant goodnaturedly we wouldnt be using flashing lights unless its an extreme emergency sir air raid regulations you see the sergeant took down the statements from the three of them spun the log book about thanked miss sawyers and wilkins for their help and informed robert that the superd like a word with you captain brentwood if you dont mind sir ill have the corporal make mrs brentwood a cuppa come inside the staff room if she likes sir thanks the superintendent had brentwood draw up a chair well captain i know youre not a police officer but id appreciate your assessment of the situation in your line of country i expect youve seen a few injuries yes acknowledged brentwood well from what i saw through the shattered window id say the car was forced off the road then they were shot both between the eyes at short range bullet holes in the windshield you couldnt do that at speed i mean from a moving vehicle were the doors locked captain i think so if i remember correctly on the way up here the bus driver said hed had to reach in through the shattered window glass to pull up the lock silly man said the superintendent he told me he used a handkerchief said robert oh aye but now any other fingerprints on the door lock are probably gone the superintendent paused running fingers through thinning white hair youve no idea of the weapon i suppose smallbore id say neat hole in the forehead the back of the skull was something else strewn about was it robert sat back in the uncomfortable wooden chair face grim with the recollection never seen anything like it the superintendent was nodding a highvel most probably he mused not much noise faster than most with a mercuryfilled head they like twentytwocaliber thatd explain the backofthehead business he looked across the desk at brentwood did none of the girls see tha no wilkins the bus driver kept them away and quite right too hows your wife taking this shell be fine i told her it was an accident i doubt she believes me but well when shes feeling better maybe not much of a honeymoon youve had lad the superintendent cut in robert couldnt remember telling him they were on their honeymoon the sergeant saw his surprise oh weve been given the gen on you lad ever since our boys got on to them in surrey youve circulated their descriptions i hope said brentwood the corporal came in with two teas and the stations ration of peek frean biscuits on a tray the superintendent dunked a chocolate sandwich tapping it on the large mug showing president suzlov being kicked in the butt im sorry captain im not with you how do you meancirculated their descriptions well i mean whoevers chasing us whoevers trying to kill nuclear sub captains of course i know theyre special soviet agents spets i suppose but i assume you know what they look like by now or dont you och mon youve got it all mixed up twas those bloody prices who were gunning for you hoping for a lonely place on the stretch after the ferry if our boys hadnt caught up with em youd be dead lad brentwood slowly put his tea down on the superintendents desk then who in hell were he gave the superintendent the description of the young newlyweds theyd met in the b and b the ones with the confetti still in their hair the superintendent fished a file from his top drawer and opening the folder passed over an id kit sketch it was them the charmers we call em said the super real charmers they are bastards change their name every other week the super hesitated captain brentwood i hate to say this but well first of all id better make sure ive got the right info from london your naval attach√© informed us your leaves up in a few days correct yes now this is up to you mind but if i were you id get back to holy loch out of danger if you see what i mean how about my wife its you they want lad not her sides well keep a close eye on her we do it for a lot of you chaps but theyve not grabbed any of the womenfolk yet they know wed never give in to a kidnapping situation no as i say its you theyre after there was a long silence broken finally by the superintendent would you like a wee dram of something stronger in that tea yes robert brentwood replied i would corporal while they were waiting the superintendent told the nuclear sub skipper she wont like it of course wives never do but tell her youve got orders to sail a few days earlier wont be much of a christmas im afraid brentwood nodded tiredly he realized that then and there police protection or not he was going to give spence senior his along with the police id sketch of the two charmers from the b and b and he was going to tell richard spence that if either of the charmers ever showed up around the spence house he was to call police emergency straightaway and if he couldnt he was to shoot the charmers dead robert brentwood took the tea and double scotch in one gulp it wasnt safe anywhere coming down toward the postagestampsize deck of the carrier shirer knew it would be his last chance he had the carriers meatball centered the green dots either side of it confirming he was on the right glide path despite the buffeting of the crosswind the wind had blown the deck clear of fog and while the salt spray on his cockpit obscured his view it wasnt enough to trouble him while flying in pattern to use up his fuel hed had time to psyche himself up for a barricade engagement should he fail to make a cleantrap hooking the three wire besides this there was the four wire and providing he could keep the tomcats ass low nose high most of the braking would be over before the nose could lunge and take out the fighters hughes radar and the longrange northrop targettv if all went well hed halt the plane fast enough so that even if he slid the tomcat would stop before reaching the net his major problem which the lso calmly reminded him of was that unlike the normal landing when after hitting the deck at miles an hour the pilot kept the engine at percent power ready for touch and go should there be anything wrong stirrers approach on bingo fuel would be his only one and with the barricade up the tomcat would be fully committed once it touched the deck shirer having to immediately cut power if he hit the net at threequarter power he could total any or all of the other aircraft clustered cheek to jowl on the cramped parking area of the flight deck the carrier able to house only half her aircraft belowdecks beautiful two oh three came the landing officers voice beautiful on the glide path on the glide path the bluishwhite blot of the deck suddenly became a blur of lights the narrow deck widened the orange ball centered the twentyfiveton fighter hitting the deck with a force of over forty tons below the flight deck the cable housings crashed like two freight trains shirer felt the harness jerk his body slammed back into the seat with a force of over seventy tons he cut power and left it to god the tomcat skewed and halted abruptly the wires pullback failing to release the hook so that elmer ventral and two other green shirts following a brownshirted plane captain raced to unhook the plane but the three wire snapped the cable whipped through the air ventral disappeared two men near him smacked clear off the deck as the petty officer and two other men attended the planes chocks another sounded the man overboard alarm of his fiber mike the klaxon wailing throughout the enormous ship immediately the sea king helo hovering a quarter mile astern moved in ventrals top half continued writhing close to the island slithering in its own entrails the green jackets helping shirer unstrap leading him quickly off to flight deck control and debriefing the sea kings searchlights crisscrossed the sea the helo hovering above the wide bubbling wake whose luminescent plankton made it look like wild undulating hills of cream neither of the two men were found as both the captains and the flight deck controllers investigation would reveal the oil rag should have raised the alarm that the big oneandahalfinch braking cable to which the arrester wires were anchored had been strained a loose strand hooking the oilstained cloth the worst section of frayed cable hidden from view in the cables housing shirer sitting exhausted in his cabin knew it wasnt the first time a wire had gone and it wouldnt be the last he felt bad about it but not guilty if you went into guilt as the air boss often repeated youd soon be out of flying it was announced on all three of the carriers tv channels that there would be a service for leading seaman ventral and the other two flight deck crewmen at hours next day air ops permitting most of the five thousand men aboard salt lake city had never heard of ventral or the other two men but this made it all the more important for those who could to attend shirer it was the air bosss voice outside his cabin shirer found the effort of getting up off his bunk and going to the door as tiring as if he were dragging a bag of cement yes sir you okay yes sir no youre not the air boss slapped him on the shoulder youre off to pearl in the morning then san diego and washington whats the scuttlebutt shirer asked dont know havent got a clue guess ill find out soon enough sir the air boss smiled and turned to go need anything tonight we can lay on room service if you like no thanks sir replied shirer dwe know what screwed up on that nose wheel not as yet by morning yes sir ah id like to attend the burial service for the air boss was shaking his head sorry but washington wants you asap dont worry ill explain it to the men appreciate that sir you get some shuteye shirer didnt need an order to sleep he hadnt been as tired as this since the dogfights over adak when after three or four sorties you were ready to sleep on the tarmac lying on the bunk he looked down at his boots hed have to undo them before he his head lolled and he was fast asleep chapter ten belgium david brentwood had never dreamed that he would get fan mail as a soldier and yet here it was over two hundred letters from admirers waiting to touch however indirectly one of the few who had won what general freeman in the manner of congratulating an olympian had called the gold and silverthe congressional medal of honor for davids singlehanded destruction of the russian fuel dump at stadthagen the silver for conspicuous bravery above and beyond the call of duty during the assault on pyongyang the letters depressed him their writers trusted him so much they didnt know unless theyd been in combat themselves how thin the line could be between cowardice and bravery between thumbs up and screw up david had seen men officers like freeman who though they could understand fear were able to disdain it for them the adulation of the public was fuel for their fire for david adulation only did what high marks did for him in college drove him on not because he wanted to but because it was expected had been expected by generations of brentwoods in the armed services personal achievements were nothing for a brentwood if they werent surpassed the next time around the pressure was enormous dutifully he opened the next letter without having taken any notice of whom it was from only when he unfolded it did he recognize the handwriting melissa langes hey yank david turned around and saw it was the mad british sergeant perched high in the back of a lizardcamouflaged humvee using its swivelmountedmillimeter machine gun as an armrest got you a seat on the hospital train to brussels ten minutes better get a move on right answered david quickly folding the letter slipping it into his top breast pocket as he headed toward the humvee ere ere bellowed the sergeant albeit goodnaturedly wheres your gear david stopped feeling as foolish as he had in the first terrible hours at parris island hed forgotten his kit bag in the excitement of receiving melissas letter as he climbed aboard the humvee he saw the sergeant pointing toward the administration building hear about your little sweetie the sergeant was talking again about the young admitting clerk lili who had flirted with david when hed first arrived at the belgian hospital on convalescent leave after stadthagen shes coming along too the british sergeant informed him which reminds me you ever see that old cartoon barrack room full of birds all stripped down to their waists tits sticking out all over the place sar major comes in beet red good god he says i said kit inspection thats terrible said david never mind lad ill ave another one for you when you get back david never liked people saying things like when you get back always made him nervous lili was helping some of the nurses load the last of the abdominal cases that were being transferred to brussels on the train she waved smiling at him ello ello the sergeant teased david bit of the old inout for you jack eh before david could answer the humvee jerked to a stop at the gate throwing them both against the drivers cabin the guards were demanding id this mans got a train to catch the sergeant informed the corporal of the guard we must check all passes said the belgian sentry in impeccably stilted english we much check all passes said the sergeant mimicking him to david what for the sergeant asked the corporal think im a bloody spy he dug david in the ribs sending shooting pains down to the scar tissue no i do not think so replied the belgian corporal unfazed you are too fat i think what you cheeky bastard said the sergeant passing his and davids id down dont give me any of your lip im responsible for this hero see and if we dont catch that train you will catch the train wed better the sergeant retorted snatching back the id and indicating the younger guard asked david you fancy the young one bit of lance corporal on the side he roared laughing david leaning against the machine gun shaking his head as the truck moved out chapter eleven as the red cross hospital train headed for brussels from liege diverted south because of a rockettorn section of track on the more direct westward line david fell under the slow hypnotic sway of the carriage the train restricted for a time to no more than forty kilometers an hour because of the danger of airsewn mines that might still be in the area hidden by snow the clickety clack of the wheels passing over the ties took david back to his childhood of going up from new york to albany the river meuse effortlessly slipping by him now a standin for the narrower reaches of the hudson river but he knew the analogy was a strained one more a pining for home than an accurate remembrance of things past america was not only a long way off in his mind it was another time so remote so unlike the warfilled continent that he was part of that it might as well be on another planet it wasnt simply that the snowdusted flat country around the meuse didnt approximate the heavily wooded banks along the upper reaches of the hudson but the smells were so unfamiliar europe always smelled different an older colder brick smell and especially in winter with all the fumes of coalburning furnaces that had come back into use as north sea gasoline supplies that came from england via the channels subfloat pipeline were jealously coveted by the armed forces the brownish haze from the coal fires created at once the most polluted and beautiful sunsets europe had seen in the last hundred years david saw a red cross nurse coming through from the carriage loaded with badly wounded abdominal cases into the walkingwounded carriage where david and the british sergeant were sitting with a number of other american british and belgian troops the nurses experienced eye was looking for repatriation cases which if they were up to it would be sent on from brussels to the channel ports when these were cleared of debris and sent back to england the sergeant dug david in the ribs look at the knockers on that davey boy imagine those dangling all right said david thwarting more detailed description the sergeant he decided was one of those who took a perverse pleasure in getting the sexually deprived soldiers worked up about dipping your wick david turned his attention to the scenery the train picking up speed as he heard an american in front of him in a neck brace telling his buddy the trains engineer had told him they would pass through waterloo on their way up from namur to brussels right now david didnt care about waterloo last thing he needed was to see another battlefield no matter how historic it was what he wanted was privacy longing to read melissas letter to hear her voice but he wasnt going to spoil it like a dessert youre so hungry for that its gone before youve time to savor the taste letters from home like everything else in this war had to be rationed carefully he glanced back at the toilet lineup but there were too many soon his eyes were tearing because of the cigarette smoke in the carriage the war he mused had been a monumental setback for the antismoking lobby his older brother robert or so his mother had told him had mentioned it in his letters home too opining that sometimes he felt that along with looking to escape unhappy situations back home half the sub crews had joined the silent service because on a sub you could smoke all you wanted you are enjoying the scenery yes david looked up and saw the pretty young admitting clerk lili the british sergeant already unabashedly leering at her his cockney tone taking on a decidedly vulgar edge ello luv he said patting the inside of his thigh want to sit on daddys knee then no thank you daddy she smiled david burst out laughing sending a burning pain down his arm but he didnt care momentarily he forgot everything unpleasant in his life the heartthumping run hed made on the stadthagen dump the raid on pyongyang and the churning doubt inside him about whether or not he could withstand the strain of any more combat wondering how close he was his body was to simply throwing in the towel his will exhausted by the combination of physical and mental fatigue the sergeant wasnt amused by lilis repartee a burning resentment in his eyes against the young girl a resentment that david felt partly responsible for because of having laughed at him ah said david in an effort to change the subject someone was saying well be going through waterloo yes said lili it is very famous you know about this he doesnt know anything luv cut in the sergeant es just a boy what you need luv my name is lili she said it without rancor but evenly all right lili luv listen you know where we can get a snort she looked blankly at him you know said the sergeant as he motioned knocking back a drink booze ahle vin eh no she said i the train lurched approaching the bend near auvelais and lili bumped into the sergeant quickly righting herself blushing i am sorry i sorry said the sergeant dont you apologize lili just what we need on this lay off said david my my the sergeant snorted at david i think hes jealous lili and im wiv all those lovely letters please davey my hero i want to marry you eh the sergeant was digging his elbow further into david eh thats what they want isnt it brentwood a bit of the old stick david turned on him but the sergeant his face having lost all trace of humor wasnt to be interrupted his grin the same expression hed worn when whacking the heads off the brambles by the canal cant you take a fucking joke matey eh lili moved off shes gone now sarge said david icily you dont have to sergeant to you dick all right sergeant said david quietly shes gone the sergeant sneered you fucking heros are all the same get a bit of fucking tin on your chest and you think youve got it on tap right david turned away refusing to be drawn further into argument fixing his gaze back on the whitesnowdusted blur of the hills to the southeast where the low country of wallonia gave way to the formidable barrier of the ardennes his greatgrandfather had been there when hitlers panzers had broken through to make their last great counterattack of the second world war bringing the us allied advance to a bloody halt inflicting over fiftyfive thousand casualties on first armys eighth corps and destroying more than seven hundred american tanks soon david heard a noise like someone farting in a bathtub it was the sergeant asleep david marveling at yet another example of murphys law run rampant if the army concerned that davids injuries might give him some trouble en route to brussels had wanted to choose a more unsuitable candidate for escorting him to identify the spets at the incamera trials in brussels it couldnt have chosen anyone as unsuitable as the british sergeant the sergeants mouth was agape revealing a row of tobaccoand teastained teeth the english david had discovered drank enormous quantities of tea now and then at the front hed seen british centurion tanks in revetment areas the drivers jerryrigging a small can of water by the exhaust the water quickly coming to a roiling boil and theyd let the tea stew until it was the color of cocacola the sergeant mumbled something and closed his mouth issuing a nasal whistle that immediately caused a stir farther down the aisle a british naval rating head bandaged shouting shut his cake hole the man across the aisle calmed the seaman down later the american sitting directly in front of david said the limey sailor was probably freaking out because the whistle sounded just like the russian rusix thousands depth charge rockets the american explained russkis fire em in horseshoe pattern twelve at once only theyve put whistles on em like the stukas in world war two frightens the piss out of you the sub boys say you couldnt hear em under the water though could you proffered a sapper across the aisle who looked as if there was nothing wrong with him until david saw the man had no left hand like hell you cant answered the man in front of david one of my buddies is on one of those pigboats says underwater you can hear sound four times easier faster commented david four times faster you been in subs a marine no answered david one of my brothers no way man said the sapper across the aisle i want something i can get out of in a hurry like what challenged someone else yankee stadium came the answer the man who said it turning selfcongratulatingly to david but david was no longer there having seen the line for the john was no more easing his way out past the sergeant outside canals flashed by under a leaden sky the train picking up more speed its sound louder now there wasnt so much snow to muffle it the train heading away from wallonia where lili came from and toward waterloo where wellington had stopped bonaparte sitting in the relative peace of the washroom david took out melissas letter a salvo of russian rockets couldnt have stunned him more than the first sentence richard and i are engaged i know this might be quite a shock but i wanted to tell you straightaway you always told me davey that we should be honest with one another thats what im trying to do now i hope you understand it just sort of happened between rick and me i thought we were just good friendsi know youll think that sounds awfully corny but honestly we were i mean we are i mean we are friends you know but well rick has really become quite a different person since you left oh i know im not saying this right but gee i guess that makes it sound like your going overseas had something to do with it not really it was actually sort of accidental and the train took a corner at speed its rails squealing throwing david hard against the hold bar his stomach tightened christ the thought of the wimp in bed with her made him want to throw up while others were fighting and dying thousands of miles from home the bowtied weasel had got into her mr bland costbenefit analysis stacy would no doubt have meticulously planned his moves first exemption from the draft in return for a fouryear stint as an sac missile silo jockey sitting sixty feet under the ground in his protected superhardened shelter wearing his fucking cravat it was true women went for the uniform hell what were a grunts fatigues next to sharp air force blue rick feels bad about it melissa explained he hadnt planned it that way no said david what other way did he plan it the fucking there was a thump on the door hey you all right in there what shouted brentwood yeah im having a crap you mind enjoy man enjoy damn said david skimming over the rest of the letter one phrase leaping out at him richard funny how women always used the guys full name when they were going to shaft you made it sound more civilized david guessed richard has gotten me interested in the sac program too i didnt want to write you until id qualified its a very intensive course as you probably know didnt want to talk about it too much for fear it mightnt happen well i passed not only that but with outstanding commendation so there davey who said women couldnt man the silos of course theyve been doing it for years i know so im hardly breaking new ground but and this is so ridiculous sac wont permit mixed teams both operators have to be of the same sex can you imagine tv cameras all over the place the next word was blocked out by the censor jesus thought david even the censor knew he brentwood d medal of honor and silver star was being dumped as if the letter went on anyone would try any hanky panky down there even if you wanted to there are too many drills to keep you busy the whole shift anyway i really like it davey and its kind of nice i think that youre over there doing your thing for the war and im here sort of keeps us closer at least we can write i hope some of the girls who have steadies on the subs say they dont get replies for months on end hope you can write me more often than that i called your mom the other day she seems fine but is worried of course about your brother ray well all of you of course but at least she more or less knows how things are with you and robert and lana i mean you do write but ray she says has just stopped writing altogether hes had more laser plastic surgery apparently and its amazing what they can do nowadays but apparently hes been really depressed lately hes asked his wife sorry i cant remember her name to stop bringing down their two kids because he doesnt want them to see him that way or so your mom says your dads taking it hardest i think though of course he would never admit it your mom says he keeps telling ray you know when the going gets tough etc etc etc oh jesus david sighed no no he also told ray the doctors told him that despite the severity of the burns rays physical condition isnt too bad really and that he could get another command in time of course your dad means something like a minesweeper important i guess like trash collectors but hardly a command at least not for someone who used to run a guided missile frigate off korea talking of korea i guess youve heard as much as we have arent you glad youre not there now it really is scary rick says that we shouldve nuked them soon as they came across the yalu he says that what we should do now is the rest of it was crossed out by the censors pen just like stacy thought david they put him in a hole somewhere in the midwest in some friggin wheat field and he thinks hes an authority on how to run the war very scary in canada melissa went on six big grain silos huge things like round skyscrapers no windows and full of wheat waiting for rail transport to the great lakes they were blown up abc late night showed shots of one of them terrific explosion apparently they build up a lot of electricity from the dry grain dust and it makes for a very explosive atmosphere but of course sabotage is suspected theres a big row about how come abc got an exclusive live coverage of one of the silos blowing its top they said they got an anonymous tip which is probably right i mean whoever blew it up probably wanted us to see it just to show how vulnerable we are now everyones saying our big mistake was to have let so many socalled refugees into the states during the gorbachev years turns out apparently that the head of the kgb was stuffing in as many agents as possible nobody figured what would happen after gorbachev i guess must run now i am sorry davey but i wanted to tell you right away please write id love to hear from you love lissa there were hugs and kisses hey came a british voice from outside dont make a meal of it yank heros probably wanking himself off said another voice it sounded like the sergeant so that when david came out he was ready for him but it wasnt instinctively the british soldiers stepped back one pinned up against the water fountain his sleeve getting wet brentwoods face was white with anger as he passed them the men waiting for the toilet fell silent and for a moment it was as if the noise of the train drowned all else even the sergeants snoring while david mumbling excuse me made his way back to his seat by the window the letter now a crumpled tight ball in his fist one of the soldiers waiting outside the toilet a corporal lit a cigarette and noted quietly a dear john letter you think ill put a fiver on it said an australian gunner arm in a sling dear john in the john a cockney quipped not funny mate said the corporal knock the piss out of you that will rotten bitch he should chuck it throw it away said the corporals mate nah said the cockney our eros a bloody brooder i reckon ell covet that e will read it over an over torture imself proper drop is bundle e will no more gongs for him mate ah i dunno said the australian reflectively drawing thoughtfully on the cigarette might take it out on the russkis and win another friggin gong a purple earts only medal ell get rejoined the cockney a loser dunno opined the australian lighting a cigarette from the corporal hears his birds getting screwed by the milkman first hes mad full o piss and vinegar know what i mean then he goes really crazy runs at a fucking machine gun hell get his gong the australian blew out a cloud of smoke and looked down at the cockney but itll be posthumous well answered the cockney e wont get it in bloody brussels all ell get there is the clap no way concluded the australian definitively right now he hates all women i reckon who are you asked the cockney derisively dr freud listen mate i know about those blokes overachievers type a go go go and then suddenly they look around and meres no one there then they can go either way hes on a high wire mate make no mistake when lili came through the carriage again clutching a sheaf of papers in her hands checking each patient had the right chart to avoid the kinds of bureaucratic foulups that so often bedeviled administrators trying to keep track of wounded as they moved from train to buses to ships she saw david and could tell instantly something dreadful had happened to him he was staring out the carriage window like an old man the coloration in his face splotchy teeth clenched like those patients shed seen who ground their teeth at night and wondered why they woke up with a pounding headache a look of such unrelieved bitterness in his eyes that it seemed to distort the very contours of his face lili could only wonder what might have caused it her heart wanted to go out to him not only because she had found him attractive when shed first seen him but because he was an american in her fathers house the word american had always been uttered in reverential tones when she was a child her father had taken her to the south deep into frenchspeaking wallonia to bastogne where the nazis had made their deep armored thrust through belgium in december of lili had stood in awe of the huge monument outside the town with the latin inscription which her father translated to the american liberators the belgian people remember he had told her of how his greatgrandfather and his wife and two children like so many other belgians owed their lives to the americans who though surrounded by a ring of german steel in that bitter christmas wouldnt surrender at school lili had heard the story of how the american general given the surrender terms by the german commander had replied nuts though her fatherin the interest of truth as he gravely told her felt compelled to explain to her in order to save her any embarrassment as she grew older that what the american general mcauliffe after whom the town square in bastogne was named had actually said was not nuts but an english synonym to do with as lilis father put it a part of the male anatomy because of the fearlessness of her youth and because she had always assumed americans were heroes lili felt that no matter how offputting davids mood or appearance was now she must try to help him he was after all far away from his home and to have fought with such courage must have exacted a terrible cost she was so used to seeing soldiers whose wounds were external she had to remind herself that some of the most terrible wounds as her father had so often told her were unseen inside the heart perhaps she thought he was worried about the coming ordeal of identifying the captive spets it was not a thing she imagined that a soldier liked doing even to his most bitter enemy even though she knew such people must be punished perhaps after he had been to the nato hq she could help him forget the ordeal by showing him around brussels she must be brave she resolved brace herself and risk his anger the belgians debt of honor to the americans her father had said was eternal and every generation must do its best to repay chapter twelve five hundred miles to the east on the snowy vastness of the alluvial polish plain the thunder of artillery was intense along the cshaped front that took in gdansk in the north to poznan miles to the southwest and krakow miles to the southeast the crashing of the artillery was so constant that it was said newborn babies were accepting the noise as normal since december over a thousand russian selfpropelled millimeter gunhowitzers refueled by urgently rushed oil supplies from the estonian shale fields were mobile again and together with the lighter millimeter guns still in action on the front were laying down a wall of steel that had already destroyed advanced elements of the dutch fortyfirst and german third armored and with blizzards moving in from the baltic advance allied air cover was soon reduced to almost nil except for the allweather groundhugging tornadoes whose british and german pilots were flying often no more than a hundred feet above ground level denying russian antiaircraft radar stations any telltale bounceback the situation was made even worse for the allies when the american helicopters which had performed so magnificently at fulda gap when the russian armored surges had first breached the nato defenses now found themselves hampered by lack of refueling depots the helos including the redoubtable black hawk uhthreemancrewed air cavalry choppers capable of carrying up to eleven fully equipped troops antitank and antihelo missiles plus m mine disposal baskets were fuellimited to a hundred minutes in the air drop tanks could be fitted but then the fuel weightweapons equation shifted dramatically making the missions doubly dangerous for the pilot in short as general freeman was first to recognize in his forward hq bunker less than forty miles from poznan his armies were the victims of their own success like small businesses he had told his aides all the business we want fellas and too little inventory after hed broken out of the dortmundbielefeld pocket the speed of his advance from natos central front had been such that urgently needed fuel ammunition and food supplies had either been slowed or stopped altogether in the truck convoys attempt to keep up with the troops in the blizzards sweeping down from the baltic and the north sea in such weather artillery notwithstanding the opinion of most allied commanders was that neither side could mount major offensives particularly fighter sorties nato air forces as much as the soviets thankful for the respite of the snowstorms so they could attend to the high levels of maintenance demanded by stateoftheart aircraft in any case the pilots of the super birds like the f eagles and mig foxbats were presently as worn out as their fighters engines furthermore apart from the luftwaffe and raf risking their tornadoes in zero visibility subjecting other billiondollar airplanes and pilots to dogfights in blizzard conditions was a losing proposition for the allied chiefs it was viewed as a good time to pause and consolidate in this they were in concert with washington not so for douglas freeman he wanted to press on give me a fuel dump lord freeman declared studying the headquarters map of the curving polish front beyond poznan and ill be in warsaw in two weeks in another week ill be over the river bug into russia without turning from the map freeman addressed his aide colonel norton jim ive gotta have gas by god well fly fuel in here by the pallet if we have to like we did it inside the db pocket meanwhile i dont want anybody digging in for christmas get as much as we can as far forward as we can we cant stop attack attack attack thats the strategy thats the only strategy you start letting troops dig in they start thinking its r and r start putting up pictures of the girl back home and their dog next thing you know you have to stick a bayonet up their ass to get em moving again no sir now weve got the bastards on the ropes finish them off thats the plan i neednt tell you its a risk general cautioned norton anyway you could lose everything youve gained i know i know its against every military credo but all we need is the gas goddamn it if we can get the gas up here we can kick ass from here to moscow freeman paused arms akimbo looking up at the huge operations map shaking his head we made one hell of a mistake jim and ill be the first to admit it he paused though i wouldnt want that to get around whats that general that we meaning everybody from the president down screwed up royally when we thought that once we hit the russian regulars all their frappin republics would take advantage of it try like siberia to break free of moscow even help us but the general sighed his righthand glove sweeping over the map beyond the urals and the caucasus we should have known mother russia isnt politics its an emotion republicsll hang together to beat us no matter they hate one anothers guts freeman lifted a mug of coffee holding it thoughtfully between his hands still studying the map but i do believe the baltics will be different theyll help us oh not much only a handful of troops compared to the russians but look what finland did in fortyone jim he put his coffee down making short skirting movements about the russian baltic seaports if they can harass the russians a week ten days long enough for us to drive a wedge here into lithuania and out we can do it jim we can do it i hope so general so do i it was such a shocking unpredictable thing for the general to say to concede even the slightest doubt that it had the effect of jolting norton general no no freeman shook his head i have no doubt about my troops about the ground war what im alluding to colonel is a matter of time what im concerned about is that if we dont hit hard and fast enoughhe paused and took a sip of coffee what general that some bastardll push the button knowing the general as well as he did what disturbed norton most was that if the general had seemingly envisaged the possibility of the russians going nuclear then freeman had probably thought of doing it himself chapter thirteen in atlanta cdccenter for disease control another skullandcrossbones pin this one for the state of new york was stuck into the map of the united states there were now twentythree pins clustered along the eastern seaboard near chicago and the midwest the others sprinkled throughout california the major clusters of stings meaning five or more acts of sabotage in silicone valley the site of some of the countrys leading electronic defense system manufacturers what was first thought to be only a new york problem because of the sabotage of croton hillsview and the other main reservoirs for new york affecting eleven million people was now a national crisis affecting seventytwo million over a thousand cases of arson had been reported many of the fires impossible to extinguish by water from city reservoirs because the water once evaporated left lethal residues of airborne poison all but two of the twentythree cities salt lake city and portland declared martial law and curfews in an effort to contain growing crowds clamoring for water supplies in norfolk virginia and in puget sound north of seattle at the bangor sub base several nuclear submarines in for maintenance were ordered to stay in port their saltfreshwater converters providing emergency drinking water for households with a ration of two gallons of water per day for a family of four national guard units throughout the country on shoottokill orders surrounded distilleries and bottled water depots and in colorado more guard units were deployed to turn back ad hoc convoys of armed civilians heading for aspen and other winter resorts where fresh snow had not yet melted down into the contaminated water tables atlanta cdc issued a national alert so urgent that it could not wait for the chiefs of staffs normal clearance and so was disseminated under president maynes executive order signature the cdc alert was a warning that because of the poisoning that by now had been conveyed via myriad underground aquifers into the major us water tables no water other than rainwater directly trapped by uncontaminated vessels would be safe for at least three months when president mayne realized the enormity of the problem he knew he was confronted by a danger whose implications posed a greater threat to the public than that posed to lincoln during the threat of disunion already looting and attendant crime were the worst they had ever been as the president moved from his white house work study around to the oval office to address the nation the kleig lights seemed to stun him momentarily and he used his notes with xeroxes of the atlanta cdc crisis map to shield himself from the glare how long have we got he asked trainor who was grumpily telling the cbs mobile crew to clear the hallway six minutes mr president trainor replied as he raised his cup of coffee seconds before going on national tv to try to calm the nation mayne looked at the black liquid and put the cup down its been tested mr president an aide informed him washingtons supply hasnt been affected so far why not he asked surely the capital would be the prime target we think suggested trainor its a message us leadership can survive if it comes to terms with what chemical warfare snapped mayne with their terms responded trainor one of the tv crew stepped forward beneath the kleig lights and put a glass of water on the presidents desk there were ten seconds to go take it away said mayne indicating the glass cant show that on television cause a goddamn revolution get it away hissed the tv producer the red light turned green unbeknownst to president mayne as he began his speech red lights all across the frozen tundra of northern canada and alaska came on in every one of norads north american air defense earlywarning stations reporting bogeys fifty plus it was the third time that week that norad jets engines constantly warmed in the hardened snowwhite hangars scrambled to meet the soviet bombers who with all canadian and american fs airborne turned back before they reached the bi baffin island circle duty officers were watching the operators as much as the big screens this game of cat and mouse constantly testing each others state of readiness did much more than tell the other side whether you were ready or not forcing the norad fighters to gulp thousands of gallons of precious fuel during each scramble it also wore down the nerves of potential attackers and defenders alike especially those of radar operators on the norad line any one of whose yea or nay could inadvertently start the chain of events catapulting both sides into allout nuclear war trainor read the message handed him by the tv producer ahead of the pentagon the wire services were reporting ten massive forest fires apparently deliberately set and now raging on the northsouth spine of the sierra nevada causing the evacuation of over thirty communities and producing a thick pall of smoke and ash over ten thousand square miles in the western united states as trainor walked quietly back to the white house press room he glanced at the monitor ever conscious of the presidents appearance as well as what he was saying but in this crisis trainor knew that it hardly mattered what the president looked like so long as he projected calm and did not come across as being as stressed out as he was hearing the presidents speech en route to washington dc on eastern airlines flight out of san diego frank shirer who had been dreaming of lana now had a fairly good idea of why he as one of the top five american aces had been recalled what bothered him however was that if sac had recalled him to pilot one of the two looking glass twentyfourhour command planes each e with fifty battle staff and communications experts a week before the presidents speech then things must be much worse now or perhaps he hadnt been recalled to fly looking glass at all perhaps shirer flattered himself the president like the countrys chief executives before him wanted a firsthand account of exactly what the precarious aleutians campaign was like within a few minutes of touching down at dulles international in washington dc shirer would learn he was wrong on both counts the sixteen spets who carried out the sabotage in new york were among the first citizens to support the president and joined crowds in burning effigies of premier suzlov outside the now boardedup though still guarded soviet embassy in the next twentyfour hours more than three thousand reports of sabotage poured in the most hysterical callers screaming about the vulnerability of the countrys nuclear power plants which had already been placed under heavy protection by national guard units in detroit it was reported that large concentrations of deadly pcbs once used in old electric power station generators had been dumped into detroits and on the canadian side windsors water supply a bottler of mountainfresh water in cleveland ohio was arrested when tests showed hed been bottling water that had been contaminated by highly toxic pcbs chapter fourteen david brentwoods first shock upon reaching the outskirts of brussels was to see just how badly damaged the city was like so many other soldiers whod seen action at the front and the terrible punishment meted out by the russian rocket artillery attacks he knew that civilian centers behind the front were being hit but he hadnt imagined it would be as bad as this piles of red and yellow brick rubble were everywhere as the train slowly crept in from the southern outskirts the rockets clearly having made no distinction between residential areas and military targets not that david could blame russians for that any more than he could the allies artillery for the havoc their shortrange rockets were now wreaking on the ancient capitals of eastern europe church spires and stained glass mixed in with the rubble of thousands of homes as well as the officially designated targets there was very little wood around he noticed most of it already scavenged for fuel the atlantic convoys having been hit again by soviet sub packs his second shock in brussels was that he had not been summoned to identify any of the spets hed seen in us and british uniform around stadthagen and who had murdered british and american pows instead david found himself being escorted by the mp sergeant then by an american captain to a rather nondescript mustysmelling basement room in the pockmarked brussels hq a us marine major sat at a long plywood table supported by sawhorses in front of a crumbling plaster wall the major flanked by another american a captain on his left and a british captain to the majors right it was a recruiting committee for the elite and now joint british and american sas or special air service of which little was known by regular units except that elements of the joint sas regiment sometimes made tactical strikes deep behind enemy lines they were the british and american equivalent of the spets kommandos some of whom were believed to be operating in civilian garb behind nato lines davids orders that he was to id captured spets were as the american army captain from the threeman interviewing board had put it before taking him inside merely a cover limeys are very careful about recruitment the captain explained special air service personnel are never identified not even in their own regiments its always put down as a transfer anyway there are no spets for you to identify brentwood we havent caught any the captain had paused looking david over carefully before entering the room you in the picture yes sir david answered unenthusiastically he didnt like it hed had enough inside the windowless interview room he could hear the faint hum of the furnace heat recirculating the cloying dust particles from the bomb rubble above quite an honor lieutenant the marine major sitting in the center told him yes sir david wasnt sure whether the major was talking about the honor of him having been selected for interview or whether it was meant as a compliment to davids decorations there was an awkward silence the us army captain glancing up at brentwoods regulation somber straightheaded gaze then at the marine major and british sas liaison captain the marine major cleared his throat course its purely voluntary but a man with your experience brentwood would he looked at the british officer who was showing no sign of embarrassment over brentwoods obvious hesitation i think continued the major your experience in pyongyang and he glanced down at a file stadthagen would prove invaluable to sas so thats it thought david the major was now pointing out that in keeping with nato policy washington and whitehall were actively encouraging joint allied participation in both sas in europe and further afield in the pacific with us special forces it was either korea concluded david or the russian front then the major threw him the curveball general freeman recommended you personally the british captain a bentstem pipe in his right hand was scooping dark erinmore flake from its pouch and palming it into a stringy consistency before stuffing the bowl please dont feel pressed old man he told brentwood the us marine major was looking down hard at the pencil he held captive between his burly hands purely voluntary the englishman continued as your chaps have already told you and heaven knows medal of honor silver star i should say youve done your bit and more just thought you might like a crack at it thats all heard so much about you he smiled and what made it worse for david the englishmans smile seemed genuine without the trace of irony hed come to expect of some of the other british officers hed met the englishman was now tamping the tobacco into the pipes bowl blowing through it before waving a lighted match back and forth over it just thought you might be a beggar for punishment he told david congenially getting a bit bored he paused to suck in hard on the pipe with all those flemish girls and couques given your record thought you might be craving a little action again the very thought of action produced in david the chilledbowel feeling hed experienced before final exams at college his throat dry face feeling strangely hot yet cold at the same time his heart racing thumping so loudly he was afraid they might hear it thanks sir he said in a parched voice but all i dont think im fit enough for your sas or any other quite understandable old man cut in the british captain no apologies needed were scouting for new chaps thats all we got rather a bloody nose up in schleswigholstein when the balloon went up he flashed another smile just looking around proceeding to draw heavily on the pipe the brit winked at him understanding then glanced at the us marine major and army captain at the same time tell you the truth if i had half the chance shouldnt be surprised if i gave the bloody lot up myself off to sunnier climes i should expect next to the pole scotland must be the chilliest place on earth the mention of scotland made david wonder if they werent trying to use the fact of his brother operating out of holy loch as a possible lure but he rejected the possibility as soon as hed thought of it they probably didnt even know his brother was there if he still was and the last thing the military cared about was trying to reunite family members in fact in time of war it was the last thing they wanted to do besides nothing david could think of could overcome the gutgnawing fear he seemed incapable of shucking ever since stadthagen the british captain had risen extending his hand thank you for your time lieutenant david shook the englishmans hand the marine major tried to look understanding but came off as grim the us army captain meanwhile had opened the door to take brentwood down to pick up his travel voucher for the trip back to liege where he was to await further orders after david saluted and left the marine major shook his head at his british colleague im sorry captain the englishman held up the pipe in protest not to worry major i do worry hes a marine hell i know it was rough at pyongyang and at stadthagen too from all accounts damn rough but it wasnt a sustained action some of my boys on the polish front no doubt major responded the english captain gracefully but at stadthagen the lad was completely on his own and in that kind of situation at least in my experience how long a mans actually been at the front has little meaning he was captured by spets saw men all around him being murdered in cold blood before he managed to make his break and was hunted to ground again in raging blizzard dogs after him with all that he kept his head and blew up an ammo dump after youve been through that lot medal of honor notwithstanding i should think the nerves are never quite the same damned sure mine wouldnt be the marine major conceded the point but true or not his pride in the corps had taken a blow because of brentwoods refusal to join the joint sas team some chaps do recuperate of course the english captain continued another match scratching circling the pipes bowl as he blew voluminous curls of grayishblue smoke into the high windowless room in malaya i remember i dont think so cut in the major in my experience captain once they go to pieces they stay in pieces best thing we can do is ship him home the englishman was expansive in his agreement by all means old chap hes earned it he has replied the major his tone not so gruff now but the englishman knew the major a row of ribbons attesting to his own valor under fire still didnt approve how about his comradeinarms asked the englishman black chappie thelman i think the name was another one on freemans recommendation list yes said the major we should try him they went to parris island together parris island said the us captain turning to the marine major well at least we know brentwoods a survivor then i wonder peter zeldman the roosevelts executive officer was enjoying his leave down in surrey with the spences following the wedding knowing nothing of robert and rosemarys near brush with what mi were convinced had been spets sleepers neither did rosemarys parents richard and anne spence until a registered letter arrived one morning for richard spence marked personal and confidential it was roberts letter of warning about the charmers and about a package robert would be sending richard via rose when she returned to surrey till this letter from robert the previous postcards of wild heathercovered highlands in reality rather forlorn and snowcovered at this time of year had borne no hint to richard spence of the danger his daughter and new soninlaw had been in during the final days of their aborted honeymoon up to now the cards full of a carefree optimism had been gratefully received by anne and richard spence whose loss of their son on convoy escort duty still cast a pall over the house young williams death was something they knew they had to accept but which they also realized they would never become reconciled to in a world where so often the good seemed defeated by the bad georgina spence rosemarys younger and vivacious sister was down from the london school of economics and political science for christmas but careful not to let peter zeldman think for a moment her visit had anything to do with his presence in the house it was this haughty indifference to him that attracted zeldman to her he was sure that behind the sophisticated leftist chitchat and learned allusions there was a woman waiting to be let out and he was sure that she couldnt be so naive as not to think how downright sexual she appeared in front of men the fact that she disdained makeup as a bourgeois affectation as hed overheard her telling her mother only highlighted her natural beauty the kind of woman zeldman believed who would look as good first thing in the morning as she had the night before after six tensionfilled months without a woman the mere sight of her was a feast and every time he saw her move he was tantalized by wondering whether or not she wore a bra still he refused to play a game there was no time for dancing as his uncle saul would say you want you ask you get or you dont get thats all some enjoyed the chase he enjoyed the sex all the maneuvering he wanted to do was in bed he decided hed give her the weekend to show some interest in him or rather admit her interest in him or he was off up to london to take in a few shows and wait for his orders there brentwood had told him what a sharp mind rosemarys sister had that was nice but he didnt care he wanted her body hed had enough of her mind students at lse shed announced were going to prepare a pretty deadly broadside in a petition to the government on the wartime limits on individual freedom he said nothing hed seen good men the so that she could sign petitions and the only broadside he had in mind was a chance to get her in bed and fire all tubes what bugged him was she knew they were mutually attracted sexually anyhow hed admitted it every time their eyes had met she couldnt or wouldnt close the curtains will you he heard richard spence asking her in the living room been a bit overcast tonight im afraid spence was referring to the fact that russian rocket attacks launched from the baltic usually came over on stormy cloudy nights when the fighters scrambling from east anglia had more difficulty seeing them the problem was that in bad cloud conditions if the idd or identification friend or foe signals sometimes got jammed pilots had to go to infrared for airtoair missile launch which had caused a number of them to shoot down missiles sent up by their own aa batteries on occasion in the splitsecond world of the dogfight theyd even shot down friendly fighters in the darkness whose exhaust theyd mistaken for that of an enemy rocket zeldman heard georgina drawing the drapes shut and saw her mother the heavy lines in mrs spences face belying the determined charm with which she had tried to hide the pain of her sons death well be late dear she called out to richard who still hadnt solved the telegraphs crossword mrs spence smiled at zeldman sure you dont want to come commander being a submariner you might have some very practical suggestions about recycling i imagine you leave him alone mother said richard folding the paper and at last making a move to haul himself out of the lounge chair im sure commander zeldman has far better things to do than turn his energies to the oxshott recycling society tell you the truth im not sure i want to very well the commander must do as he likes of course it made zeldman feel uncomfortable and old being referred to as commander but despite his telling them to call him pete english reserve carried the day oh do get a move on richard said anne impatiently yes yes he said irritably reaching for his jacket suppose i must dont come if youre going to be cross she turned to zeldman last time he came he just sat there and harrumphed at the professor as richard slipped off his bifocals popping them into his jacket pocket he explained to zeldman professor knowlton a bag of wind apparently hes got some mad scheme now for the local councils to recycle shoes can you imagine last thing id want to wear is another mans shoes here said anne holding his scarf out to him dont be so negative you thought he was crazy about everyone handing in their hair dryers helping him on with his coat she turned to peter zeldman when they make those jumpup planes jump jets anne for heavens sake vertical takeoff and landing to be precise well whatever im sure the commander would like to know she added turning back to zeldman did you know that the harriers those jets were made from layers and layers of material that had to be handdried presto the hair dryers it was very original i think theyll give him an obe zeldman looked perplexed order of the british empire anne explained ope more like it said richard doubling his scarf about his neck order of pompous eccentrics honestly the mans so inflated with his own importance its a wonder he doesnt take off well said his wife as they went out the door glancing back at peter zeldman and georgina enjoy yourselves outside richard turned to anne i hardly thought that was necessary anne what telling them to enjoy themselves sounds like youre well matchmaking i wouldnt mind good grief woman weve just got over rosemarys wedding have you seen our bank account oh stop fretting its like chalk and cheese with those two hes interested i think but not georgina im afraid she considers him unsuitable shes probably right dont mind putting the chap up nice enough and its our duty really as the government says if it wasnt for the american submariners wed be starving everyone knows that no i dont mind billeting the chap at all pleasant enough but were not obliged to open a marriage bureau in any case georginas far too young shes twentyfive richard yes and hes what late twenties thats all im not talking number of years richard replied its a matter of maturity shes not ready oh stop fretting so i told you she has no interest in him whatsoever tell you the truth shes been rather rude to him goes about the house as if hes not there well shes studying her michaelmas term paper oh you know what i mean or perhaps you dont every time i see you youve got your head stuck in the paper leave off old girl it was said politely but firmly the danger signal that they were close to reliving the terrible time when theyd heard young william had been killed richard retreating for days at a time saying nothing reading burying his grief in his own silence and the two of them quite apart at the very time they both knew they should have been closest they were approaching the parish hall a big crowd to hear professor knowlton now dont worry richard hes not georginas type nothings going to happen my god said richard look at knowlton old fool looks like a recycled coat hes wearing richard behave yourself yes yes he glanced up at the brooding sky clouds were curdling ominously about one another but not yet a solid sheet of gray when the phone rang georgina jumped her nerves on edge because of the expected soviet missile raid but as she rose to answer it she pretended to zeldman her fright was due to her having been absorbed in one of her textbooks its for you she said surprised as he took the phone from her their fingers touched he watched her walk away the phone call was from faslane the village near holy loch informing him the post office was holding a familygram for him a fifteenword message each submariner was allowed over a month did he want it forwarded to surrey the question about whether he wanted it sent on meant however that it wasnt from home instead it was a message to him that he must report back to the sea wolf within seventytwo hours he had counted on having several more days at the spencesat least till christmas if things worked out with georgina but now his time with her had suddenly been cut in half have to leave tomorrow he said after putting the phone down georgina said nothing at pm the first russian salvos could be heard several miles away their distinctive shuffling noise sounding as if they were chopping the air instead of coming at supersonic speed toward their targets peter picked up the tvs remote control and turned the television off for as well as the increasing russian salvos an electrical storm was coming in from the channel better not use the phone either he said charge could throw you across the room she barely acknowledged his comment continuing to read in the soft glow of an edwardian lamp its light trapped by heavy blackout drapes finally the din of missiles exploding came several miles closer suddenly the power was out okay if i open the drapes asked zeldman she didnt answer looking outside at the garden pond neglected through the winter he could see reflected in its icy surface the stalks of searchlights starting to cluster and intertwine high in the sky to the east beyond the garden yellow slits of headlights came to a standstill everything stopping during the raid except for a blackedout commuter train rumbling through the nearby culvert making its run for the nearest tunnel right said peter im off for the shelter coming no thank you she said it as if the missile raid were a mere impertinence and that in any event it was too bourgeois by half to go scuttling into the nearest shelter suit yourself said zeldman walking out through the wild shrubs of the english garden toward the shelter richard spence had dug not far from an old sun house in the momentary lighting of the nike hercules air defense batteries around leatherhead georgina saw the ugly leafless vines of morning glory which had strangled the best of the garden its wild aspect the result of her mothers neglect following williams death suddenly oppressively the red and bluish flashes of the aa missile batteries nearby the tang of ozone in the air the decaying garden seemed to leap at her in a series of strobelit pictures of primeval forces victorious not only in having run riot over the garden the very semblance of civilization but over civilization itself the russian rockets were crashing closer and closer and a rain of redtailed missiles could be seen plummeting down over leatherhead and nearby in oxshott devastating what had been heavily camouflaged army staging areas a salvo of zhukov j rockets their long crimson exhausts plainly if only momentarily visible their harsh metallic retching sound rending the air crashed into the nearby culvert the explosion blowing out most of the spencess windows the living rooms heavy blackout drapes sucked frighteningly inward swirling about her but stopping most of the flying glass zeldman in the shelter heard the implosion glass shattering within seconds drawing the nansen slide bolt and wrenching the heavy door open he was racing up the short flight of sunken brick steps as georgina her nerve breaking as more salvos rained about the culvert fled the house toward the shelter in another flash of a nike hercules battery and the glow of fuel dump fires the two of them all but crashed into one another in the garden it would have been funny but for georginas frantic panic leading her back to the shelter peter zeldman said little apart from a few quietly given instructions and sat holding her stroking her hair trying to calm her down for a long time her body remained rigid tense with fear but then slowly she yielded all her pretenses shattered by the closeness of death their mutual longing unreined by the dull thumps of the rockets explosions bringing danger ever closer her fingers tearing into him as he lifted her high against the shelters damp wall penetrating her with equally wild abandon the fullness of her release sweeping over her time and again the air raid reaching its crescendo their joy a reverie chapter fifteen in montana coyotes howled in the foothills of bear paw mountain while in the hardened shelters of strategic air command on the snowcovered great plains an air force instructor was telling rick stacy and the other eleven silo cadets not to hesitate if your partner goes berserk under pressure you not only have the right but the duty to shoot him or her he paused none of them showed any surprise which was good now the air force has taken great pains to select the best possible people for this job but none of us knows for sure how well perform if things start coming apart that is if it comes to a nuclear exchange if other silos in your sector were to be hit you all passed aokay on the simulators but tomorrow youll be in silo on solo ride stacy smiled across at melissa lange the instructor saw it gave no sign of disapproval but made a mental note that these two were to be kept apart in the twomember team drills you couldnt stop fraternization in fact it could be a stabilizing factor off duty but you kept them well apart in training and in the silo despite the advancement of women in the forces the nomixedsex rule remained inviolate at ground zero theres something else i want to mention the instructor continued neat and tan in knifeedged ironed pale blue uniform and tie in any crew youll find theres a tendency for one partner to become leader by default know what i mean lieutenant stacy yes sir one team member relies too heavily on the other stacy looked pleased with himself not really replied the instructor youre all taught to rely on one another lieutenant the problem however is when one member habitually relies on the other so that in the event of a slipup by the one whos been leading we are likely to risk either aborting launch or executing an inappropriate release at the critical moment it is not the instructor emphasized a pilotcopilot situation down there in the silo there are two of you with equal responsibility youre a team no one of you can launch and forget all that bs youve read about a string and second key game where one of you supposedly goes bonkers shoots the other and then catapults us into a nuclear exchange by using a connecting string to turn both keys at once you cant we fixed it you need a twokey insert to initiate your launch procedure the instructor paused you got that corporal lange yes sir okay lets recap before you all head off to get drunk there was a polite ripple of laughter none of them were heavy drinkers the air force had carefully checked that out in the psychiatric profile on each recruit besides everyone knew that if they so much as took an aspirin it had to be reported if anyone climbed aboard the pickup van and had taken so much as an antihistamine theyd have to immediately declare themselves dnia duty not involving alert not to do so carried the same penalty meted out to a fighter pilot who hadnt reported himself dnif a verbal reprimand a fine and confined to barracks with launch crews of necessity required to live in and around the silos being cb meant staying in the plusher sac living quarters but in the middle of the snowcovered prairie with all calls automatically monitored the only recreation was to watch tv get laid difficult given the long duty hours eat get overweight and risk a wrc weight reduction course for some reason melissa couldnt understand the us air force did not want their missile shooters fat rick stacy a fitness fiend postulated that excessive poundage in his words made people slower on the controls melissa said she knew a cab dispatcher who was fat enormous and the most competent dispatcher around were not dispatching cabs lissa stacy told her were into kilotons on the front line melissa didnt bother pursuing the fact that the front line was five thousand miles away in europe and nine thousand in korea in a way she knew rick was right but his egocentric habit of automatically assuming the front line wherever he was annoyed her still he was kind to her considerate and in this world where the casualties in europe and korea meant that there were about four women for every man back home richard was a better catch than most and hed given her good advice while some of her friends at college had put their professional goals on permanent hold to have a good time while the world lasts as theyd put it melissa had signed up for the silo program which would help pay for her degree after the war her degree and experience in such a highly skilled job would stand her in good stead in any case she and rick by planning on getting married in the spring were going to try both for the good time and in ricks words improve their marketable skills the only thing she regretted was that rick was as organized and efficient in bed as he was in class it was all very purposeful and unerringly on target as he so romantically put it and it was all over in ten minutes she was reminded of some vulgar engineering student in portland talking about slam bam thank you maam part of the problem was that rick detested sweat now and then she found herself conscious of the stares of a local contractor a man the air force used for base and silo support building repairs he was a big man very hairy known to some of the unmarried women team members and it was said some of the married women as kits killerton in the sac melissa hadnt been listening to the instructor idly wondering whether kits referred to his weight on top of you or to his actual performance in bed the instructor was rambling on about how weather bias such as differences in air density could cause possible skipping of a reentry warhead vehicle and how one way around this was for the kiloton or megaton warhead to effect reentry at a steeper angle than usual which would make it more accurate but that this in turn would generate more heat so be alert said the instructor when were going through palfir which is he was pointing at melissa rick stacy was watching her prearming she replied arming launching firing releasing she added smartly very good okay that wraps it up for today remember tomorrow youre on solo which may or may not include a problem with the blast valve three ways to clear he looked about the room using a stick of chalk as a pointer johnson ah the instructor laughed unfair question tomorrow right yes sir zipping up his parka before going out in the thirtybelow icy hell as rick stacy called it with what he thought was a fine piece of irony he complimented melissa on her palfir answer right on the button lissa very impressive dont call me that she snapped what lissa whats wrong with it whats right with it my names melissa sorreeeee in the pickup van there was a lot of loud talk as the class members unwound no one spoke of estimating warhead yield launch reliability factors or reentry penetration only when it was suggested that the px might have run out of coors did one of the silo cadets a tall youth from louisiana drawl that if the px manager hadnt ordered in enough beer the managers tkp terminal kill probability would be absolutely certain melissa ignored the small talk thinking instead about the bungalow she and another woman trainee shared the bungalow had developed a leak in the roof it would be all right for the time being but once there was any melting itd be like a waterfall be spring rick said sulkily before theres any melting around here you might be right she said but i thought you didnt like my place looking unkempt the ceilings stained i dont well then melissa i have better things to do right now than to mend roofs we go solo tomorrow remember i remember she said tartly whats gotten into you he asked brusquely nothing well if you want it fixed that badly call base repairs theyll send someone over i thought you liked doing that kind of stuff i would if i had the time okay okay ill get base repairs right the van suddenly slid on black ice there was a chorus of whoas as it slithered further then righted itself it was all very funny but for a second melissa felt they were going to go right off the road and smash into the icehardened ditch life was too short full of hazard chapter sixteen as david brentwood left brussels headquarters stepping out onto the wet black pavement his mood was one of brooding selfcondemnation about melissas letter the interview board everything his dejection wasnt helped any by the ceiling of overcast drizzling gray clouds so low they obscured the ornate spires of the grand place or by the british military police sergeant waiting for him under a dark canvas awning the last thing he needed was the brits nonstop patter full of empty homilies and pubic jokes what ho here comes our hero the sergeant said until then david hadnt seen lili with him the rosyfaced girl smiled with such transparent pleasure at seeing david that momentarily his attention shifted from thoughts of melissa whose letter lay like a poison against his chest so powerful was the effect of the letter that for a moment during the interview he had petulantly thought of agreeing to join the joint britishamerican commandos out of pure pique hed show her the bitch but then the fear of sudden death had prevailed and now he was glad lilis smile beneath the flemish bonnet was so radiant and open that despite himself he was smiling too you have forgotten she said he looked blank well are you ready she added full of enthusiasm ohoh thats a leading question guffawed the sergeant david wished the mp would evaporate lili ignored the englishman you do not remember she said but it was uttered without rancor almost alluringly i promised i would be your ah she couldnt think of the english word her hands gesticulating impatiently but even this was done with an infectious eagerness full of life of the kind of spirit that david felt had deserted him what the french call joie de vivre my guide he proffered ouiyes my guide lucky you said the sergeant can i come along too no lili said it with such unequivocal authority given her age that david found himself laughing the sergeant unamused mumbled something ending with bitch adding officiously were leaving brussels at sixteen hundred hours by rights i should accompany you you being a big hero and all youre my charge you might say david wasnt listening he was still watching lili hey bellowed the sergeant im a big boy sarge said david youve done your duty directing me to hq i can find my way back to the station thanks oh all fit again are we fit enough said david ah quipped the sergeant you signed up then david stiffened what do you mean come on yank the sergeant said derisively the bloody commandos beret boys they asked you to sign on the dotted line right youre in violation of secrecy said david looking anxiously around youre an mp you should know oh pardon me sir galahad retorted the sergeant buttoning up his greatcoat one of the blackened brass buttons hanging by a thread i didnt realize youd taken holy orders and dont tell me my fucking job he glared at lili anyway common bloody knowledge isnt it what said david hardeyed he felt lilis arm slip through his protectively and for a second her perfume of roses washed over him and he was transported to a summer with melissa a warm breeze bending and teasing the young grass melissas breasts warm and pliant beneath him a surge of arousal outstripped his anger and he decided there wasnt any point in pursuing the question of security with the sergeant the brit was a little off the deep end anyway lili snuggled closer to david in the rain as the sergeant mockingly answered brentwoods question by repeating it whats common knowledge for christs sake brentwood anyone with half a brain knows hqs recruiting fucking arabs are threatening the yids right iraqs going to drop a few cbs on em right so were going to send in some of our heros to the rescue right or arent you going brentwood saw the mad look in the sergeants eyes again remembering the first time hed seen him bellowing down the canal bank this time lilis grip on davids arm was one of alarm youre nuts said david before he could stop himself hey hey yank button your beak the sergeant hissed lili moved in closer against david holding him in tighter still all right old buddy said david placatingly all right then eh eh the mp was getting out of control david said lili quietly please as they walked off lilis free arm stretching high above her in an effort to bring her floral umbrella over him the rain was drumming on the canvas canopy of the hq building rivulets pouring over the edge the rain so heavy it was pitting the snow that still lay in dirty mounds by the sidewalk the sergeant was shouting after them better come by fifteenthirty mate or youll be fucking awol understand he is the nuts said lili wideeyed her bonnet shaking side to side david slipped his arm further about her she told him first she would take him to the grand place to show him the fourhundredyearold gilded flemish gables surrounding the square then they would go to the museum of art and she would present the immortal rubens do you like the little people she asked little people pygmies in brussels no no silly the puppets he didnt answer preoccupied with crossing the rainspattered street in what was now heavy military traffic and still thinking about the sergeants blatant breach of security david hated the idea of fingering anyone but knew he had no option too bad the sergeant had cracked and the englishman couldnt know how much david sympathized but brentwood knew if he didnt report what the sergeant had shouted about a lot of american and british lives might be lost what for example would have happened if lili malm√©dy had been a spy whats that david snapped at heri mean pardon the puppets do you like them yes he said sure i like puppets ill have to make a call too okay okay she said it with delight it is all right we have time after we will go to the toone toone a puppet theater for how do you say adults i guess it made him think of the british special air service captain at the interview saying something about enjoying flemish girls and what sounded like cokes he pressed lili for an explanation the same as in your country she answered fizzy drinks no said david way i heard it i think it must be a belgian word oh you must mean a walloonian not flemish okay he said a walloonian word then it must be couques it is a she thought for a moment a vast cookie a cookie yes very large as big as she withdrew her arm from his holding her hands about two feet apart a cake he said no no she answered a cookie her face suffused with such enthusiasm that momentarily david felt much older it is a cookie she insisted you do not believe me he took her hand and looked at her yes he said i do and her smile told him unequivocally that she loved him chapter seventeen rosemary stood on the dockside at holy loch watching the uss roosevelt slip her moorings from the sub pen inside the huge floating dock and pass her tender the uss topeka as she made her way through the oily calm of the loch past the crushedstone houses that lined the shore and the magnificent snowmantled hills of scotlands western approaches heading out toward the rougher water south in the firth of clyde she knew she might never see robert again and yet rather than the overwhelming sadness of saying goodbye numbing her as it had the first time the clean wintry smell of the loch the snowdusted blue of the hills and the screech of gulls all came to her aid their wild beauty enough to make the very idea of war seem momentarily unreal besides the strain of these last few hours together before theyd reached the safety of mallaig had worn her down so that she felt too tired to weep in any case with robert on the roosevelts bridge the last thing she wanted him or any other of the crew aboard to see was a woman bawling her eyes out it was time to be strong to return to surrey spend christmas with her parents and get on with her teaching again at st anselms in the new term and to keep herself and junior robert still insisted it would be a boy well nourished no small feat with rationing becoming more severe the allied convoys under constant attack from the russian subs taking off a tartan scarf robert had bought her in mallaig she waved once more his captains cap no more than a blip on the bridge atop the roosevelts tall tapered sail robert had her framed in the circle of his binoculars she was standing alone on the dock dwarfed by the hills and he was afraid for her the charmers aside who the police had told him had never bothered any of the wives it was still possible in this war that a soviet rocket attack from as far away as the russians baltic bases could kill her as easily as a depth bomb could implode his sub killing every man aboard in seconds now fully provisional and reloaded with the latest d trident missiles the sea wolf was passing through the aerial arrays of the degaussing station beyond the few small surface craft of the royal navy that would run noise interference for him until he reached the more open water of the firth of clyde the best way to avoid detection from either spy trawlers or satellites which might pick up either the roosevelts thermal patch from even the minute heat exchange of the subs exhaust systems or its surface bulge not visible to the naked eye was to go deep as well as the sea wolfs speed being greater beneath the water because of the absence of roiling depth was the best defense against aircraft with magnetic anomaly detectors looking for the sub and its lethal load of six missiles each d with a range of sixthousandplus nautical miles and with fourteen mirvs independently targeted reentry vehicles of kilotons each normally the crews scuttlebutt would have been alive with rumor of where they were going based on a word here and there around the dry dock but this trip it was different britains miits secret services counterespionage branch had discovered that a spy a disc jockey on a glasgow radio station had by using letterforletter code in his selection of record titles been broadcasting departure times as well as the names of submarines egressing holy loch as a result security at the base had been so tight that the base commander wouldnt even risk verbal instructions to his captains for fear of parabolic directional mikes being beamed in from the hills around the loch the result was that it was only now that robert brentwood his subs food supplies the only factor limiting the normal war patrol of seventyfive days submerged was going down below to control forward of the sail as soon as he was clear of the firth heading into the irish sea he would dive and only then would he open up the magnetictapesealed heavygauge white plastic envelope to find out where he was going and what his mission was officer of the deck last man down hatch secured zeldman took up his position as officer of the deck last man down hatch secured aye captain the ship is rigged for dive current depth one three two fathoms

firing point procedures aye sir master four five tube one aye solution ready weapons ready ship ready con said brentwood not hostile repeat not hostile it was a british eboat with a similar noise signature probably due to repairs on its prop to that of a footlong russian nanuchka attack boat it was the fact that the british eboat had suddenly increased speed to sixtyseven kilometers at least nine kilometers an hour faster than a russian nanuchka missile boat that had saved her from being sunk by roosevelt as he gave the order to stand down from battle stations and began tearing open the orders envelope robert brentwood recalled that it was an nka nanuchka that had crippled his brother rays fastguided missile frigate off korea with everyone still coming down from battle stations executive officer peter zeldman kept a sharp eye on the planesmen and the other crew on watch making sure the adrenaline didnt find its way into overcompensation in the controls brentwood tore open the envelope then having read his instructions spoke calmly purposefully into the pa this is the captain speaking uss roosevelt has been ordered north through the gi gap to hold stations beneath the ice cap duration will be seventyfive days unless otherwise ordered by saclant during rendezvous with tacamo aircraft this will mean that well be in shallow waters part of the time but we will have air cover from our bases in greenland on our port flank as we head up and some longrange asw aircraft from iceland on our starboard flank before were in the safety of molly malone and environs he paused handing the envelope to zeldman for countersignature consequently silent running is the order of the day soviets have been dropping buoyattached hydrophone arrays all over the approaches whenever they can get through our air cover same as we do i might as well tell you that there is no way we can completely avoid the arrays which may send our signature to soviet hunterkillers but we can minimize the risk and could luck out once were under the ice our safety margin increases if however we cannot avoid being heard well be in a fight which were ready for that is all molly malone asked a perplexed cooks helper his first haul on the roosevelt a chief of the boat poured himself another coffee offering the pot around molloy deep he explained about seven hundred miles from the pole over fifteen thousand feet straight down less chance of being detected you mean we just sit there you hayseed said a torpedomans mate christ three thousand feets our crush depth what i mean the chief told the newcomer is that theres lots of deep water room so we can keep moving to different launch spots the chief quickly switching the subject to the chromium guard around the twin silex glass coffeepots those are a bit loose he told the cooks helper better make sure theyre secure dont want anything dropping theyd hear it from here to murmansk no sweat put in the cook once were north of sixtyfive well be under drift ice north of seventyfive were under pack have a roof over our heads eh chiefie dont matter fix those guards will do as the chief walked out of the mess the cooks helper noted he doesnt look too happy ah retorted the cook probably put a packet on us going south instead of north whats wrong with north friggin dangerous said a torpedomans mate aint nothin right with it fuckin cold too in control robert brentwood told the navigator to instruct the cray navcomp to plot a course for latitude sixtytwo degrees north longitude thirtytwo degrees ten minutes west which would bring roosevelt to a point over the reykaanes ridge south of iceland this position would put them miles southwest of icelands north cape before they headed for the narrow denmark strait of the gi greenlandiceland gap in parts no deeper than five hundred feet from there brentwood intended to execute a zigzagweave pattern leading eleven hundred miles farther north to koldewey island at the southernmost extent of the pack ice that extended like a long righthanded thumb pointing down from the pole into the greenland sea in all the war patrol would run west of scotland to reykaanes ridge then north beyond koldewey island to the fifteenthousand foot deeps along the fracture zone around spitzbergen island putting the sea wolf between greenlands northern reaches and northwestern russia in all the journey of around three thousand miles would normally take her the best part of four days at her flank speed of thirty knots plus but moving more slowly at a third of her speed so the cooling pumps would not have to work so hard therefore limiting the subs noise the slower trip while navigating through the ice fields and the southwardflowing east greenland current would take around thirteen days while the greenlandiceland gap was known to mariners at large as the gi gap to the nato sub crews it was the gastrointestinal tractthe one where ships quartermasters recorded a higher than usual consumption of peptobismol as drift ice calved from the pack ice ground together all around you like a giant grinding his teeth it also added ominous and forbidding tones to the sound waves coming in via the sea wolfs towed passive sonar array which was integrated with the conformal bowmounted passive hydrophones which meant it could confuse sonar operators brentwood bent over the chart carefully circling the six stations he would have to maintain in the arctic deep ready on a moments notice should the occasion ever arise to attack one or all of the more than fortyfive russian navy army and air force bases on kola peninsula from the icefree ports of polyarnyy and murmansk in the west as far east as amderma on the kara sea and uelen on siberias edge that looked out on the bering sea less than a hundred miles from alaska and only eleven hundred miles from unalaska where his sister lana was stationed chapter eighteen as commander of all us forces in europe gen douglas freeman left brussels with four f fighters escorting him on the first leg of his circuitous tenthousandmile journey to korea via a us stopover where he would secretly consult with the president at camp david freemans lookalike seconded from the fifth canadian armys entertainment battalion left the icy barrens of newfoundland for the flight across the pole to brussels nato headquarters david brentwood and lili were in the brussels gallery admiring the rubens which along with other masterpieces had been relegated to a rather poky basement of the museum because of the possibility of soviet rocket salvos he admired lilis knowledge of rubens and other painters caravaggio bernini berckhuide and hals hed never heard of her mention of them made him feel provincial as his sister lana and probably melissa would have teasingly called him he even felt prudish in front of rubenss voluptuous women whereas lili talked about them at a deeper level with such affection and knowledge of detail that it was clear she had been nurtured by such paintings and felt a need for them as much a part of her life as baseball was to him his older brother robert had written home in much the same vein about his fianc√©e rosemary who taught shakespeare it made david feel slightly inferior to lili despite the fact that he was older but she had none of the pomposity of some of the selfproclaimed aficionados of art who flaunted their disdain for the neophyte he tried to understand the paintings but at heart displayed more curiosity about how they were done than what they depicted but lili put him at ease telling him he shouldnt even try to explain them it is better to feel them david she advised happy with the joy of showing her handsome young american the best of her culture do you feel them she asked he thought for a moment i suppose so they look warm yes she said triumphantly squeezing his hand in delight rubens always makes it come alive so she glanced about the basement gallery of course they are not in a very nice setting and the light is not good its fine david assured her makes them seem cozier she didnt understand the word he explained by pulling her closer to him to the stern disapproval of the security guard and david felt the happiest hed been since he couldnt remember when he told lili she said nothing putting her head on his shoulder as they sat in silence on the bench in front of a vermeer each lost in one another until reluctantly david reminded her they must soon head for the train station if only we could stay she said sighing forever we will he said perhaps he thought remembering his mothers timehonored adage god did work in mysterious ways perhaps lili would take away the pain of losing melissa a penny for your thoughts said lili looking up at him what oh i was thinking wed better be going or the mad sergeant will have me down as awol david stood up searching for change in his pocket which reminds me i forgot to make that call there a phone somewhere you can call from the station all right as he waited for the british captain to answer david realized that any line in nato hq might well be tapped by anyone from natos own intelligence to a spets undercover operative and so he spoke to the british captain in deliberately vague terms about hearing news from a sergeant that perhaps hq brussels should know about oh said the captain his tone clearly one of interest then i think perhaps youd better give us a verbal if you dont mind dont worry about your train well lay on a driver to fetch you from the station and you can catch up with the train around ezemaal it has to stop at a few places to pick up more wounded anyway i thought the line had been cut replied david by spets or yes it was but our erstwhile belgian railway chaps have put it right again dont worry lieutenant i promise you youll catch up with your girl david looked unhappily out of the phone booth at lili okay he told the captain but can you send your driver right away as he left the phone booth david saw the sergeant rheumyeyed looking as if he was drunk giving lili a flower a single red rose where the hell had he got that david walked up and nodding curtly to the sergeant turned to lili and told her hq wanted to see him again oh no she said the disappointment in her eyes making him wish his conscience had never prompted him to make the call about the sergeants big mouth being a walking security risk i wont be long david assured her been a naughty boy said the sergeant his breath reeking of beer how the hell the man had become a military policeman david couldnt fathom and no longer cared much if he showed his disapproval of the sergeants behavior the englishmans eyes narrowed whats up with you yank look like youve lost your virginity i have to report back to hq joining it are you joining what david parried bloody ushush brigade spat out the sergeant david turned to lili you okay course shell be okay you bloody twit said the sergeant lifting his head so fast as he spoke he almost lost his balance shell have a bloody trainful of wounded coming south from hasselt shell have her hands full mate he winked lewdly at brentwood if you get my meaning for two bits id punch you out said david taking a step forward bloody try snarled the sergeant cmon bloody try youre drunk dont saythe sergeant slurred contemptuously sat a fact yank and whatre you ignoring him david turned back to lili wont be long he said taking her hand for a moment squeezing it reassuringly she was holding the rose limply by her side in her left hand where in the hell david wondered again did the crazy sergeant manage to find a rose in the middle of winter in a war the sergeant no doubt knew the black market in the belgian capital see you at ezemaal he told lili and gave her a peck on the cheek as he walked down the platform toward the entrance he passed a long line of belgian reserve medical corps moving collapsed their hospital bunks into the first four carriages french reinforcements and an american engineer company bound for the front being informed that theyd have to vacate the first four cars and move back to the rear of the train to leave enough room for the wounded who would be coming down from hasselt when david turned at the entrance he looked back in lilis direction but shed disappeared among the troops the sergeant slouched into the phone booth noisily inserting francs into the slot the voice on the other end was friendly almost desperately chipper hello captain smythe here the military sergeant identified himself yes sergeant hes passed with flying colors sir ive done everything to goad him insulted his piece of skirt no go bit annoyed mind but held himself in check lots of selfdiscipline the sergeant could hear the captain exhale pity he declined then sergeant just the kind of man we need you going to have another crack at him sir asked the sergeant yes but i doubt hell change his mind still i appreciate what youve done sergeant lets know if you have any other chaps you think could do the job will do sorry he didnt turn out sir thought he was made of sterner stuff maybe we could take another run at him in a month or so i doubt it sergeant especially given young miss malm√©dy goodbye goodbye sir it took the sergeant a second to remember malm√©dy was lilis last name no flies on the sas captain smythes prognosis was borne out by david brentwood upon arriving at hq brentwood was clearly anxious to rejoin lili after telling smythe albeit reluctantly that in his opinion the sergeant who had accompanied him to the sas interview was a serious security risk having blabbed something on the way out about an sas attack against the arabs smythe thanked him and asked i dont suppose youve changed your mind about joining the team no sir i havent typical brits thought david always making it sound like they were merely asking you to join a cricket club one british officer he remembered insisted on referring to the whole war as the unpleasantness very good brentwood smythe reacted heartily dont mean to press you like hell thought david who before he left turned to smythe sir ive heard quite a few rumors about some kind of action in the middle east against the arabs no specific targets until the sergeant that is smythe took his pipe out of his pocket turning it upsidedown smacking it hard against the heel of his boot then blowing through it little pieces of charcoal flying out into the wastepaper basket well of course its hardly news i mean the possibility of us going into the gulf with iraq threatening to go to war again with iran if that happened its possible of course wed have to put pay to that chappie in baghdad we simply cannot tolerate disruption of oil supplies smythe seemed to brentwood far too unconcerned about the voluble sergeant mouthing off about an allied attack against the arabs the british captain put his arm around davids shoulder as he escorted him toward the door momentarily it made david wince but the englishmans gesture was purely that of a comrade or was it he wondered or was he worrying about nothing again he realized how badly his whole sense of his own self the confidence of his own masculinity and of the world around him had been shattered by the nervepounding experiences of pyongyang and stadthagen it was something he couldnt explain to anyone who hadnt been through it war he had once thought was supposed to clarify conflicts the enemy was there you were here but war had only made his life at least his inner life extraordinarily more complex he felt at war with himselfhis psyche a battlefront never clearly defined and as changeable as any freefloating anxiety constantly shifting in its attempt to escape a flak of uncertainty truth is smythe assured him weve been feeding the sergeant a lot of cockamamy plans hes known as flapper lips around here you know anyway point is everyone expects nato to hit if the iraqis and iranians become difficult so we might as well plant a few fake rumors about the actual targets to give us cover cover for what david wondered but knew better than to ask if he wasnt willing to volunteer for the team he had no right to know besides he understood the general strategy well enough the allies were simply going to have to punch out the iraqis a la desert storm if they threatened to stop the oil youd have to go in and kill them to go on killing elsewhere it was necessary and mad like the sergeant thank you for coming lieutenant said smythe graciously no problem sir ta ta outside the hq david waited impatiently for the humvee from the transport pool to arrive the train had left fifteen minutes ago and car traffic he knew would be slow due to the endless convoys heading east to liege and on to the front the driver was a british corporal and david asked him if he thought they could get to ezemaal in forty minutes dunno about that lieutenant said the cockney shaking his head morosely bit of a squeeze theres a ten in it for you if you can david promised him marks or dollars sir fussy arent you begging the lieutenants pardon not fussy sir practical dollars worth more right now dollars said david right you are sir said the driver his mood suddenly upbeat as he rushed a yellow traffic light an mp whistling and waving his baton to no effect the driver was correct thought david you had to be practical look after yourself no one else would what does ta ta mean david asked the corporal as the humvee weaved its way through the brussels traffic past the high gables of the grand place i guess it means goodbye right sort of commented the corporal turning sharply into one of the fashionable redbrick alleys leading from the grand place not goodbye exactly more like till we meet again hmm mused david i dont think so once on the highway heading eastward toward liege the corporal drove dangerously get out of the bloody way he shouted looking in the rearview shaking his head at brentwood women drivers david wondered if lili drove melissa did chapter nineteen the thing that puzzled canadian forces base esquimalt at the southern tip of vancouver island the listening post for the us and canadian sosus network was that the undersea hydrophone should have picked up a sub that had attacked a canadian coastal steamer the mv jervis the steamer alerted by her shipboard lookout had actually seen the wave of the torpedo that had struck her and failed to explode a standard soviet millimeterlong fish of the type that had decimated the nato convoys what worried esquimalt was that the sosus hydrophones should have heard the enemy sub much earlier no matter how silent a nuclear sub was its reactor wasnt noiseproof and the reactor couldnt be shut down because it would take hours to cook upsuicidal for an operational sub as it would give asw forces ample time to reach the area and pound it with asrocs and depth charges besides without the subs prop going it would not have been able to stalk the ships it attacked it continued to be a mystery until the cnos office in washington on advice from comsubat commander submarines atlantic in norfolk virginia informed esquimalt and bangor washington state trident and sea wolf base eighty miles to the south of esquimalt that the reason a russian sub had got so close to them was that the russian navy yards at leningrad and elsewhere must have improved even further on quietening their props after the gigantic advantage given them by the walker spy ring and by toshibas sale in the s of stateoftheart prop technology to the russians either that said norfolk or the sosus listening network of hydrophones on the sea floor had been cut or more likely neutered by synthesized noise override producing fake yet naturalsounding sea noise that would be interpreted by the sosuss monitoring teams at esquimalt and bangor as phytoplankton scatter or as the sonar operators called it fish fry in any event it was decided that deepdiving submersibles out of vancouver should be used to inspect the network in the area of the attack but if they were wrong about fish fry norfolk warned it would mean that the united states had suddenly become vulnerable to closein icbm sub attack america could be blindsided there was no malfunction in the sosus however the sonograms called up on the computer showed that like a seismograph picking up the slightest tremor sosus had had no difficulty picking up the sound of the dud soviet torpedo hitting the steamer which had been well within the supposed impenetrable antisubmarine warfare zone something was wrong chapter twenty the moment frank shirer was told he wouldnt be flying looking glass and instead was given the innocuous fleshcolored eye patch from the outgoing pilot at andrews he understood his mission and was immeasurably depressed he knew it meant his chances of seeing lana for the next several months were zilch oh he realized full well that he was being accorded the highest honor the true grit or duke eye patch the ultimate accolade a flyer could receive its recipient being the man in whose hands the fate not only of america but of the west might reside whats the matter with you asked the outgoing pilot look like youve been poleaxed shirer glanced down at the patch yeah christ man this is it as good as it gets what dyou want youll have to beat pussy off with a stick top gun shogun thats what you are buddy shirer looked up at him what if the balloon goes up the other man shrugged thats the downside comes with the territory hell if i could stay on id the man didnt finish shirer thanked him shook hands and walked out on the tarmac toward the cavernous hangar containing the sixstoryhigh taj mahal the most sophisticated command plane in history he had mixed emotions in a sense coming back to the million boeing b was like coming home to the job of test pilot he had had before the war as one of the elite selected from among the top guns of the top guns the few who were entrusted with the responsibility of flying air force one in the event of nuclear war more important than looking glass the sight of the huge plane took him back before the war and to the day of the outbreak of hostilities when from the pool of peacetime air force one pilots hed requested active service with the fs and now it had come full circle they had recalled him which either meant that some member of the taj mahals pool had cracked or was over forty considered too old for the quick reflexes necessary should the president find himself aloft in a nuclear exchange the conversation hed had with the outgoing pilot had unsettled him not only because piloting air force one would mean he and lana would be separated longer than hed thought but because if nuclear war broke out the aleutians where america herself had tested the abombs on amchitka would be a prime target for the russians icbms on kamchatka peninsula even those americans like lana at dutch harbor and the other easternmost islands of the chain close to alaska which were not directly targeted would be in the path of the radioactive clouds carried swiftly via the millimaws engulfing the islands in the fallout lana and everyone else would the of radiation poisoning a lingering painful death which shirer wouldnt wish on his worst enemy not even la roche the young communications lieutenant aboard air force one was eager to show him the latest wizardry pointing proudly to a signal jammer course wed still use basic flares against heat seekers as the first line of defense against incoming trouble is russians have reportedly got the french r airtoairs they dont go for heat but home in on the radar beam no kidding said shirer the sarcasm was out before he could stop himself sorry sir guess youre familiar with all this stuff no shirer answered he pointed to a console that he knew was another radar beam jammer whats that echo delay mode sir slows down the bogeys radar pulse so he gets the echo later than he normally would thinks his target is further off than it is what happens if were in the missiles path anyway shirer asked console also has cdc chaffdispensing capability shirer smiled despite himself give the military manufacturers a simple idea and theyd give it a fancy name to impress the congressmen on the defense budget committees cdc you mean it drops foil strips to scramble enemy radar yes sir but we do have electronic jammer backups as well this babys got over two hundred and forty miles of sheathed wiring sixtyone antennas shirer wasnt sure an electromagnetic pulse could be prevented by sheathed or condom wiring as the technicians called the pulseresistant fiberoptic cable it was certainly better than the old microchip circuits which an electromagnetic pulse would certainly knock out and which had been replaced to some extent by gallium arsenide chips but he wondered aloud whether the cables could survive a closein nuclear air burst ah manual doesnt give minimum air burst radius sir didnt think they would said shirer dont think wed like the answer the lieutenant was quickly getting teed off with the new pilot as he told the ground crew later hes a moody son of a bitch the lieutenant charged heard he was an okay guy put in one of the electronic engineers one crackerjack of a pilot by all accounts an ace my man yeah well im not the fucking enemy probably lonesome for his missus put in the engineer though i thought they liked bachelors to drive the beast no family to think about might stop the trigger finger dunno whether hes married or not said the lieutenant disinterestedly well put in another technician maybe something else is buggin him maybe hes been drinking tap water then he wouldnt be sick said the engineer hed be dead could be hes lovesick said another of the ground crew i dont give a shit said the communications lieutenant whatever his problem is id rather not be one of his crew if it hits the fan dont worry said the engineer tearing open a sugar packet letting it stream into his coffee it wont go nuclear chapter twentyone normally david wouldnt have shown such irritability maybe it was the bad weather the overcast still so low you could almost touch it and the rubble from the soviet rocket attacks still not cleared partially covered by snow turned dirty from the coal fire pollution or bad ions in the air as his brother ray would have said whatever the reason for his mood the gallic shrug of the stationmaster at ezemaal thirty miles east of brussels bugged him he suspected the man could speak english but was refusing to do so on principle continuing to rattle away in either flemish or french as the unhelpful stationmaster walked on by them a porter nearby told david slowly and clearly un train est d√©raill√© pres de roosbeek son of a bitch said david turning and walking quickly back to the humvee come on he yelled to his driver corporal parkin who had just started to relax with a cigarette lets go they say a trains been derailed ours dont know at roosbeek you know it not to worry chief got a michelin in the glove box has to be on the line tween here and brussels doesnt it right said david with more optimism than he felt why dont we just go on to liege guv suggested parkin its not too far wait there nothing much we no said david trains full of wounded need all the help they can get besides i know some people on it oh yeah well thats different int the stationmaster was coming back down the platform glancing quickly at them his mood changed be careful he told david you must have your identification ready there will be many people there by now what you mean guv put in the corporal calling out over the rattle of the humvee engine lots of people the stationmaster shrugged as if the answer were surely obvious to all police the army they might still be around you see why asked parkin the spets of course it was they who attacked before the belgian could finish parkin had unclipped his seat belt reaching down into the backseat he produced a red light its magnetic base thudding on the roof over him as he plugged its adapter into the dashboard lug as they sped back from where theyd come having to use several detours because of rocket damage to the main brussels road david told himself it probably wasnt lilis train anyway there were dozens goods trains troop trains passenger every day had to be one of the busiest lines in all europe the red light swishing in the mist produced a surreal pink glow david wasnt sure an illegal mp light was a good idea itd get them there faster but if there were spets around it could draw fire momentarily he was ashamed he was thinking about his safety rather than lilis but then again his marine training had conditioned him against drawing undue attention to himself in any battle zone dont worry sir parkin assured him spets wouldve been after them for the front the troops wouldnt bother with anyone else on board anyway this bird of yours shes a noncombatant right as if that made any difference david thought more noncombatants are killed than soldiers corporal besides you obviously dont know about the spets as he spoke david instinctively felt for his sidearm you carrying any weapons he asked parkin the corporal was shocked by the suggestion only my rifle in the back havent fired it since me national service that was two years he paused ah not to worry sir the spetsre hitandrun types right wont bother us hardly gonna go runnin around in uniform are they civilian garb most likely allied uniforms said david not taking his eyes from the fields dim outlines of farmhouses and gaunt stripped poplars racing by theyve got nothing to lose theyd be shot as spies either way in civilian garb or military there was another flashing red light ahead and parkin started pumping the brake the humvee slowed and though visibility was poor they could soon make out six or seven men all with submachine guns possibly in belgian military uniform waving them down off to the right ahead david spotted at least fifteen more spread out the same number to his left all in all a ushaped formation running down either side of the road the road blocked by two ton trucks parked so they overlapped each other in a tight v so youd be forced to drop to five kilometers per hour in order to negotiate the sturn bound to be our blokes right proffered the corporal unconvincingly dont know said david softly watching the officer approaching him you any good at reversing this jalopy not now said the corporal no way he was looking in the rearview mirror the ushape had closed to an o with three men about twenty yards behind them advancing submachine guns at the ready out shouted the officer ten yards in front of the humvee with your hands up theyre not belgians said the corporal english is too bloody good dont know answered david quietly i could try a run said the corporal his foot hovering above the accelerator wed hit the ditch but take a few out turn off the engine this is an order you the officer in a black beret was pointing the gun directly at brentwood the holster take it off parkin switched off and david did as he was told slowly while trying to make out the insignia of the belgian regiment he became aware of a faint tinkling sound like an old steam kettle all but boiled dry its metal flexing giving off the most mournful sound hed ever heard it was only as the officer moved forward that he saw what it was beyond the roadblock across the canal the locomotive sat deserted derailed its boiler punctured steam bleeding from it like vaporous ghosts floating this way and that until the white became absorbed by the gray of the mist there were small groups of men watching further back behind the locomotive their figures fading in and out of view in the mist which rising for a second revealed a line of khaki trucks further beyond the train on the canals north side off to his right david saw a line of other figures the sticklike projections of their rifles visible now and then as a breeze flustered the mist which continued to roll across from the canal looks like a bloody firing squad said parkin joking uneasily ah bound to be our blokes taisezvoussilencesaid one of the soldiers on the road venez avec moicome with me whats your business here demanded the senior belgian officer a colonel his military police checking david brentwoods id as closely as the railway inspector had at ezemaal the other belgian officer whod escorted him and parkin down the road had now turned back to the roadblock ive got a friend on the train david told the colonel the belgian looked at davids face and back at the photograph all right you may pass through he said returning the id cards but dont get in the way of the ambulance teams wait until they tell you its all right the stationmaster at ezemaal said david told me spets had hit the train is that true yes neither in the frightfilled bloody and often confused fighting at pyongyang nor the bonechilling terror of stadthagen the bared teeth of the german shepherd at his throat near the ammunition dump had david brentwood felt as he did now standing on the platform of the first carriage of the still mistshrouded troop train as david moved aside while the stretcher bearers negotiated the tight rightangle turn from the carriage down the steep steelgrate steps to the spongy turf parkin was standing by the nearest of the six ambulances talking to one of the belgian drivers first aid attendants who had at first swarmed over the train were now poking carefully through the chaos on a second sweep how many survivors parkin asked the driver dont know we were among the last ambulances to arrive but not many i expect when the spets hit my friend it is total he offered parkin a cigarette which the englishman eagerly accepted they leave no one continued the belgian flicking open his lighter who might be able to identify them you see course said parkin cupping his hand around the flame silly bloody question really ja said the belgian with a distinct flemish accent they are marksmen those ones believe me they are the best those bastards have got the belgian nodded toward the canals and poplar woods beyond probably miles from here by now david overheard the conversation but something he couldnt explain what told him lili was alive the next stretcher he saw coming out had the military police sergeant on it a neat hole above the left ear the small hole and dark color of the blood telling david the sergeant had been killed by an expert shot quickly and some time ago it fueled davids hope for it meant the ambulance teams had probably left all the really hopeless cases till last first having taken all the survivors few though they may have been why arent they using body bags asked parkin tactlessly but with the directness of natural curiosity poor buggers can hardly get round them corners with those friggin stretchers as if to underline his point a swirl of thickening mist swept up against the carriage momentarily hiding the ambulance team from view the man carrying the front of the stretcher not having yet touched ground the man stumbled for a moment and had it not been for david helping the man at the rear of the stretcher to take the weight the sharp angle of the stretcher would have caused the dead sergeant to slide forward beneath the restraining straps onto the sodden grass ran out of body bags explained the belgian driver used over sixty already were running out of everything how come asked parkin surprised thought ruddy antwerp and ostend were fair flowin over wiv supplies some more trouble with the convoys from america they say blimey i thought wed fixed that lot so did everyone else shrugged the belgian but apparently the russians have something up their sleeve new sonar i guess parkin was watching the ambulance men bringing off more of the dead jesus said parkin they wipe out all the reinforcements ja shot every one of them train staff as well and the hospital cases the wounded parkin could hear steam bubbling away and he swung angrily toward the still locomotive why the hell doesnt somebody turn that friggin thing off the engineer is dead too said the ambulance driver no one here i think knows how to shut it off ill have a go said the corporal a wheyfaced ambulance man emerged from the end of the third carriage and began to negotiate the steep stairway excuse me began david je ne parte pas anglais said the stretcher bearer using his head to indicate the driver whod been talking with parkin who was now climbing aboard the engine whose mournful dying sound seemed to fill the forlorn field can i help you sir the driver asked david is it all right if i go in now david told him have a look around the driver spoke to one of the ambulance men who managed to shrug despite the weight of the dead body a marine his arm in a cast face jaundicedlooking and frozen in pain they say you can have a look the driver told david but do not move anything more ambulances are on the way the police may want photographs what for put in parkin returning down the track nothing to investigate is there the belgian driver shrugged regulations parkin drew heavily on the cigarette regulations aint gonna help those poor bastards he said looking at the ambulances filling up on this their second trip eight shrouds in each dead laid out on the wet grass for the additional ambulances on the way david hesitated before going in as parkin heading on down to the other end of the carriage called out beg pardon lieutenant but whats she look like about five four said david entering the second to last carriage looking at the slumped bodies which the ambulance men still had to clear blue eyes he told parkin very good sir but i mean what was she is she wearing brentwood tried to think recoiling from the stench well she had a sort of yellow raincoat on the kind fishermen wear over here slicker said parkin right but i mean she wouldnt be wearing a coat in the train probably bit stuffy in here before i mean not when she was busy looking after the wounded yes replied david i guess youre right i dont know a kind of floral patterned dress skirt he said red and yellow flowers i think white sweater a bonnet blue david eased his way down the bodystrewn aisle each hand on the corner of one of the daysitters the upholstery torn here and there where the bullets had passed through some of the beigecolored sponge rubber filler oozing from the seats speckled with blood he remembered she was wearing a red poppy too for remembrance day even though the actual day was weeks ago david paused wiping the sweat from the caps band before he could bring himself to move deeper into the carriage he could still hear the heavy muffled tinkling of the boiler steam still rising floating back past the carriages even though parkin had shut down the main valve he moved farther into the carnage having to step over the bodies gingerly trying not to disturb anything finding a footfall wherever he could and using the web of the overhead luggage racks to keep his balance recoiling one moment from pinkishgray ooze of brains sticking to one seat the upholstery black with blood one of the american reinforcements was slumped in a corner and from the pinkishwhite pulp that david guessed must have been bone and flesh david could tell the spets had probably used highvelocity mercury or depleteduranium tips which would penetrate the target like a whitehot rod exploding through the other side with the force of a sledgehammer jesus said parkin softly now entering the carriage from the far end get away you bastard he was waving his hand ineffectually at a large blowfly crawling bloated through the mash of a gis eye dangling by a thread suddenly parkin put his hand to his mouth and rushed back toward the toilet door as it flung open david heard parkin utter another halfchoked oath and saw him reappear rushing out the doors at the end of the carriage as david reached the washroom he saw the reason another gi crumpled against the outer wall one leg bent impossibly between the toilet stem and sink pipe hands protectively over his face the impact of two spets bullets having blown him clean off the seat even as hed tried to cower in the corner or had he simply been too terrified to move again it had been a head shot and david saw the splattered slug that had ricocheted ending up after smashing the cistern embedded in the copper float there were empty ninemillimeter brass jackets all over the place same ammunition as used by nato forces david pushed open the carriages end door and saw parkin head over the rail beyond him david could see through the doors of the fourth carriage another carnage of khaki bodies strewn about several of them clustered by the water fountain you okay he asked parkin no jesus never seen anything like it bloody slaughter the bastards david passed by him heading for the doors of the fourth carriage and heard ambulance men behind him starting to clean out the remaining bodies now that more stretchers had arrived as he opened the door he saw several bodies that had fallen from upper bunks where the wounded had been david felt his nostrils assaulted by a stringent mixture of spilled antiseptic saline drip bottles medications and excrement he stood still looking about for her for any sign of movement still having a gut feeling that as she was of slighter build than most she could well be buried but alive under the crush of bodies he heard something and motioned the ambulance men coming in behind him to be quiet listening for the faintest sound of breathing for anything but all he could hear now was the sound of the boiler condensing its melancholy sound still with them outside more ambulances were arriving should check those whove been taken away suggested parkin reappearing smelling of sick he meant those who the belgian had told him had been stacked earlier in the roosbeek morgue damn it she isnt dead david said i just know it he turned looking at parkin sorry you dont have to come wait back at the humvee if you like parkin didnt answer but followed brentwood as he entered the last carriage she was the first one he saw spread across a wounded youth both his arms in casts one eye bandaged the bandage bloodied now and rustcolored at the base of her head there was a small ugly hole the edge of her white sweater stained david knelt down and felt her wrist no pulse cold he couldnt breathe and tore at his collar parkin moved up behind him oh christ lieutenant oh shit david biting his lip bent over her still clinging to hope and saw a phantom breeze blow the soft baby hair on the nape of her neck it was his own breath he took her right hand in both of his holding it gently feeling for the faintest pulse he doubled over pulling her hands to his face his head moving side to side sobbing in desperate denial that it was lili that the bloody mush that had been her face was lili but the poppy of flanders field that shed worn like those poppies she had told him sprang form from the artilleryplowed earth after the war was still there crushed against her by the body of the soldier shed been trying to protect david didnt remember the walk back to the humvee nor much of the ride back to the convalescent military hospital in liege where he was to await orders possibly for light supply duties in france parkin had put the poppy her id bracelet and a lock of her hair hed had to wash it first in a white linen envelope marked lieutenant brentwood personal and left it at the front desk he wanted to stay at liege but couldnt in the morning hed have to report back to brussels as what supplies were making it through the renewed russian sub attacks on the convoys had to be shipped up quickly to the front if freemans army wasnt to be halted and a counterattack risked all along the line nato needed every driver it could get its hands on you take care of yourself lieutenant parkin enjoined david nodded thanks for bringing me back corp anything i can do sir i mean if youre not feeling up to it someone should let your folks know parkin was holding out a packet of cigarettes momentarily forgetting that the american didnt smoke no said david they know nothing about her he looked up at the englishman his lip quivering the corporal embarrassed offered him a light brentwood looked down cleared his throat and asked in a strained voice can you fix me a ride to bouillon its in the ardennes her parents live there id like to i mean i should no problem said parkin relieved he could do something anything to help ill go over to the motor pool right now thanks said david sitting on the edge of his bunk eyes fixed on the drops of rain slowly making their way down the window of the quonset hut he felt a hollowness a vast emptiness and the beginning of rage that they could waste someone so young so beautiful so good the best thing he now realized too late that had happened to him in the whole rotten war parkins footsteps echoed on the highly polished linoleum well if you can put up with me lieutenant they say i can drive you down but i was thinking maybe her folks wouldnt i mean maybe we should wait a few days no said david id like to go now its about ninety miles good three hours lieutenant maybe you should rest awhile go in the morning parkin waited patiently for the lieutenant to reconsider to at least put it off till the morning parkin knew he couldnt appeal to the americans convalescent status anymore either the sister on the ward telling the corporal that brentwood was as fit as they could make him now and that he could certainly go to bouillon if he wanted to to cheer him up the sister brought a pile of letters waiting for him from the united states and abroad she said showing him one with a scottish postmark thank you david said looking at the bundle in his hand he might as well have been looking at a relic from the ancient past right now nothing held any importance for him not how lana was faring in the aleutians or robert on the rooseveltif he was still on the rooseveltor even the state of rays progress in the burn unit of san diego vets the only thing that mattered was that lili was gone she had been a bright burst a warmth in the winter of his recovery from stadthagen only his anger at the russians offered any salve for the emptiness that now engulfed him he fed on it on that anger and what he felt was his duty to go to bouillon he hoped theyd find each and every one of the spets and hang them it hadnt been a military action what was military about hitting a train and murdering wounded in cold blood it was butchery he only hoped he could keep the worst of it from lilis father and mother s all right with you sir said parkin i wouldnt mind a kip before we go all right said brentwood finally but i want to go down first thing in the morning it was the most dispirited voice parkin had ever heard chapter twentytwo the december sun was weak in khabarovsk but its reflection off the snow dazzled the city ice crystals sparkling in the pristine air apart from the massive underground supply depots and the munition factories on the citys outskirts where the wind kept most of the industrial pollution blowing west the city though shabby up close nevertheless looked stunningly clean and peaceful gen kiril marchenko had sensed the difference in the air the moment hed deplaned following the long fourthousandmile trip from moscow after having received greetings from the khabarovsks kgb chief colonel nefski he went up the winding stone stairs of the jail general marchenko took off his greatcoat cap and gloves and got right to it who put you up to this he asked the girl alexsandra malof the moment she was brought in she said nothing its a very grave matter it was worse than that nefski knew even suspected sabotage carried the death penalty several submarine captains from the far eastern fleet out of vladivostok had reported that some torpedoes were not detonating a serial number check showed they all came from the munitions factory at khabarovsk in a perverse way nefski admired the woman dark in her late twenties not much over five feet she radiated defiance her body stiffening the moment the two burly guards held her one on each arm when she looked as if she was about to spit at the general the coarse woolen prison top could not hide her beauty her breasts more alluring each time she resisted the pull of the guards her eyes quick with rage her whole body tense proud too wouldnt even acknowledge the presence of nefskis subaltern near the window overlooking the courtyard whether from fear or contempt he didnt know of course shed just been in the prison for a day brought straight from the munitions factory anyone could act tough for the first couple of hours and amateurs were always profligate with their resistance it never occurred to her interrogators that she might be innocent of any sabotage either on the railway or in the munitions factories where the jews were supplying what was euphemistically called volunteer labor she was also one of the young jewish women prorosilirequestedto entertain the pilots at khabarovsk air base refusal meant family harassment or most usually what the fliers called a surprise partya pogrom when things became too dull at the base is this how you jews repay us pressed marchenko she glared at colonel nefski and his assistant looking on impassively we give you your autonomous regions said marchenko let you worship your god and this is how you treat us he waited nefski and his assistant could see the generals patience was wearing thin there are jews in all our armed services you know continued marchenko loyal to the ussr how do you think they must feel knowing there are traitors among their own people she smiled but it was one of contempt as if to say they are the ones who are the traitors marchenko rose from behind the colonels desk put on his coat and picked up his gloves from his cap holding his gloves in one hand the general put the edge of his cap beneath her chin forcing her to look up at him you think this jewish stubbornness is a virtue she remained silent and marchenko sweeping the cap away turned to nefski im wasting my time shes your charge putting on his cap he gestured to nefski with his gloves a moment comrade as the two mens footsteps echoed down the stone staircase toward the brilliant white rectangle of snow framed by the door of the kgb headquarters nefskis assistant asked the prisoner if she would like some tea she made no sign marchenko began putting on his furlined gloves it might be sunny outside but it was still twenty below she is banking on the kosoglazyslanteyes being beaten by the americansif the americans cross the yalu i think you may underestimate the chinese general said nefski with all due respect they may solve our problem for us look at the americans in vietnam they failed miserably and with overwhelming air superiority they failed said marchenko pulling the other glove on tightly and squinting against the brilliant reflection of the snow because they lacked national will colonel they dropped more ordnance on the vietnamese than in all of world war two but it does you no good if you dont have national will this war however is very different comrade the americans see it as a holy grail vietnam veterans were spat on in this war americans think god is back on their side like the jews which is why we must break that one upstairs a dud torpedo that does not sink an american nuclear ship a missile that fails to bring down an american nuclear bomber could mean the difference between victory and defeat for us remember colonel for the want of a nail the shoe was lost for the want of a shoe the horse for the want of the horse the rider for the want of the rider the battle i will get the information about the sabotage said nefski confidently no doubt comrade but when its all a matter of time you remember the yumashevthe best battle cruiser we had well we found the estonian bastards who sabotaged her depth charges depth charges which might have saved her from the american sea wolf the rooseveltthat sank her luchshie umy mysliat odinakovogreat minds think alikesaid nefski i was telling my assistant only this morning comrade general about the yumashev nefski didnt go on to tell the general that his mention of the yumashev to his assistant had been used to illustrate how moscows interference with local investigations could actually delay solving the problem good said the general then we are in concert on this matter the chauffeur opened the door of the handtooled zil and marchenko stepped into the warm plush interior i will be here for another six hours before i return to moscow with my report i can be reached at khabarovsk air base it would go well for us both colonel if i could tell the politburo upon my return that the situation had been solved of course general i understand im sure you do the splashgreenandwhitecamouflaged zil moved slowly out of the compound its tires crackling on the frozen sheet the heavily coated kgb guards coming snappily to attention rifles at the present you are as foolish as your grandfather alexsandra nefski told her you see no matter what the official records show we have always known your little secret oh yes your grandfather paid his fifteen rubles like a good little boy to change the family name to russian and thought hed bought the family protection i admit for some it worked but you see we he meant the kgb here at the local level have always known that you were jews and said nefski his tone magnanimous we told no one outside because we wanted to give you a chance in return this is how you repay you told no one outside she said sitting forward nefskis assistant grabbing her hair pulling her back hard against the wooden chair because she shouted undaunted you were being bribed not to tell nefski pouted like a disappointed grandfather you see he turned to his assistant the old mans grandchildren are not grateful for his sacrifice the poor old fool changes his name he knows he cant change the noses but the name will help to make sure he does not go to synagogue for seventeen years to show us hes sincere nefski walked over lifting up her chin he does this for you and you despise him nefski let her head drop he surrenders his faith and you spit on him i didnt spit on him nefski glanced at his assistant as if he could no longer be bothered with her she spits on him she and her brothers as nefski stood by the window the sunbeam caught his flat shoulder boards and alexsandra could see his red stars vibrant like spots of blood the sunbeam slicing the room in two dust particles dancing madly in the beam their randomness terrifying her she didnt know how much longer she could be strong she thought of her grandfather a good man but a compromiser deluded into thinking he could buy respectability and safety believing that even if the secret of the familys origin got out the very act of changing their name to russian and not going to the synagogue would speak for itself she despised nefski and all those like him in them hatred of jews ran as deep as it had in the nazis gorbachev had not changed that she remembered the resurgence of nationalism in the republics all crying for more independence and along with it the wildfire of antisemitism even before that she remembered the reports coming out of hungary in the great days of the liberation when at the beginning of the first big soccer game in free hungary the cry had gone up from the fans kill the jews kill the jews you and your three brothers said nefski you worked in the khabarovsk munition factory dispatch correct yes she said the munitions are checked on the production line so the logical place for sabotage is in dispatch you agree she didnt answer your family worked the night shift correct everyone worked night shift sometimes the midnighttodawn shift said nefski before the transport trucks arrive there are truck pickups all night she retorted can you loosen these handcuffs he had gone to the window where he had been distracted for a moment by watching a driver from one of the redandcreamcolored trolley cars trying to realign its poles after they had been deflected by a glistening scab of ice hell need his gloves on for that ilya nefski told his assistant who was still watching alexsandra it was a ploy for the colonel to appear unconcerned his confidence that he would break the prisoner transferring itself to the prisoner nefski lit a cigarette and soon alexsandra could smell the strong pungent turkish tobacco the interrogation room filling with swirling brownish smoke she inhaled as much of it as she could dont think the fact that youve been fraternizing with our pilots will help you nefski told her still ostensibly watching the trolley car before she could stop herself alexsandra had suddenly looked up and ilya knew the information was correct and it all slid into place for him she had been buying protection from officialdom through her pilots or so she had thought well well said ilya and who would your pilot be alexsandra she fell silent again maj sergei marchenko said nefski without turning around nefski told ilya to inform the guards it was time for her meal ilya lifted the phone and advised the guardhouse as he put the phone back down he had new respect for nefski marchenko had obviously come all this way on a twofold mission as moscows heavy to urge the locals to get to the bottom of the sabotage but also to show for the record that he himself had interrogated the girl it had been so brief that in ilyas eyes it could hardly be called an interrogation at all but it would allow the general to say hed personally questioned her showing no favoritism even though his son had been seen in her company what his assistant admired most about nefski was that while it would have been so easy for nefski to do a deal to protect the marchenko name he had stood firm if the jew had thought shed compromised the kgb by making it with the son of one of the supreme soviet commanders then she had made a serious mistake the phone jangled ilya answered it and cupping the mouthpiece told nefski that the kitchen said her meal was ready should they bring it up to the office alexsandra looked surprised since when did the kgb provide room service it depends answered nefski he beckoned to her as a father to a child come he said dont be afraid and she walked slowly toward the window down below in the highwall quadrangle of the prisons exercise yard she saw her three brothers ivan alexander and myshkalittle michaelwho had just turned twelve little mike because he so loved bears and like the yakuts had always believed that if you shot one of the great beasts save in selfdefense god would punish you he looked so tiny the drab khaki prison jacket and bulky trousers making him look even more diminutive a guard stood near them an officer from his shoulder boards a moment later she saw a squad of nine men in gray infantry caps their earflaps down which somehow made it even more ominous kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders their boots crackling on the frozen snow and the bananashaped magazines of the rifles painted in winterwhite camouflage pattern her attention to such details was an escape from what she knew was happening either the three brothers had not seen her or had been told not to look up trudging out in the footdeep snow looking straight ahead hands behind their backs making them look strangely like holy men it was only when they stopped and were told to face the wall that she saw they were handcuffed ivan the oldest and alexander the next oldest had marched out together but not in unison their footprints scattered myshka on the other hand had taken pains not to disturb the snow but to walk as precisely as he could in his older brothers footsteps he had always believed it was bad luck to be the first to disturb virgin snow who told you to do it nefski asked calmly his arm about her rigid shoulders he could feel her trembling her arms and neck muscles were going into spasm her skin covered in goose pimples nefski shifted his arm down about her gently rubbing her buttock theres no need for all this eh alexsandra it only causes trouble for everyone she lowered her gaze to the windowsill nefski told her brusquely to look up ordered her to look out through the frostedged glass down at the prison yard at her three brothers and she knew nefski had done such things many times before the officer was now pushing the brothers against the wall his boots kicking theirs as far apart as possible well nefski asked her tell me a story alexsandra a true story her face was white as the snow and taut the blood draining from her cheeks you look kosher he laughed well the officer down in the quad looked up at nefski and the colonel lifted his finger the officer roughly jerked michael away from the wall turned him about and ordered him to look up he seemed confused well im waiting nefski told her tears were streaming down her face the oldest one nefski said ivan did he she waited for him to say something else but he didnt you see he told her you have brought it to this you you and your brothers traitorous jews all of you but i will spare them alexsandra if you tell me what i wish to know neskazhi imdont tell them it was ivan screaming up at her his voice barely audible from behind the high closed windows the officer shouted his voice echoing from the stone walls a guard stepped forward driving the kalashnikovs butt into ivans stomach as ivan fell the officer kicked him hard on the back keeping him down in the snow you bastard she shouted at nefski nefski opened the window and made a sign to the officer and a squad of six of the nine guards marched alexander and myshka back toward the cells the officer had drawn his pistol now nefski knew that alexsandra finally understood her lovers name wouldnt protect her or her brothers shes tough nefski said to ilya in mock admiration while lighting a second cigarette from the first it was starting to get dark the jagged ice at the confluence of the amur and ussuri rivers now silhouetted like black daggers as it broke up the dying sunlight the officer in the courtyard his foot still on ivan looked up at nefski again waiting well nefski asked alexsandra whats it to be she said nothing her gaze below transfixed her knees shaking nefski dropped his hand the officer fired at pointblank range she screamed hands leaping to her face then turned to attack nefski but ilya held her dragging her back into the chair nefski turned his back on her and walked to the window smoking his cigarette two guards entered to return her to the cell next time nefski told her without turning around it will be the second oldest alexander and then myshka with her screams reverberating down the stairwell she was taken away ilya asked nefski when they would try again with alexsandra nefski said nothing do you think shell crack ilya asked him possibly he paused to draw heavily on the cigarette theres more than one way to skin a cat chapter twentythree david and his driver parkin had arrived in bouillon where lilis parents lived only minutes before the first salvo of longdistance russian sss crashed into the ancient town the sss designated rockets by nato rather than missiles with their nuclear warhead connotation made a strange shuffling noise in the air the first rocket had exploded high up on the spur of ardennes woodland upon which the ancient castle of bouillon sat overlooking the confluence of the two floodswollen arms of the semois river that embraced the ancient walloonian town david had come to tell the malm√©dys about lili but within minutes people were rushing for shelters parkin and david finding themselves separated calling out agreeing to meet back at the humvee parked outside the caf√© renoir soon they lost sight of one another parkin finding himself carried by the crowd into a shelter holding about sixty people mostly locals they went out of their way to make parkin feel welcome telling him as if it were somehow a comfort that the russians launched their rocket attacks only in bad weather when allied bombing of their launch sites was limited and that the russians were not really trying to hit bouillon but the fabrique nationale smallarms complex north of liege and allied supply depots that had been identified by spets dropped behind allied lines into the ardennes the cep circular error of probability one of the elderly bouillonese told him was plus or minus two hundred meters well over the man explained to parkin slowly in english how do you say monsieur over alf a mile eh bah the russians cannot hit anything then monsieur said another elderly gent why are we in here they had to remain in the shelter for over an hour and with the sharp splitting sounds of wood exploding in the ardennes and the earthshuddering thumps of hits on bouillon parkin pushing his schoolboy french to its limit asked if anyone knew of monsieur malm√©dy and where he lived cest moi came a friendly voice in the crowded shelter all parkin could see was a beret and a hand there followed a rattle of french that parkin didnt have a hope of understanding he was grateful his french was so poor he had no desire to tell the old gentleman that was lieutenant brentwoods job and parkin was praying brentwood had made it to a shelter when the all clear sounded even before parkin helped the frail monsieur malm√©dy up the stairs to street level they could hear a commotion people were pouring out of the shelters but suddenly all movement seemed to cease many standing with mouths agape like stunned mullet thought parkin a huge cloud of dust and smoke obliterated the castle its eastern ramparts no more than an avalanche of smoking rock and debris that had cut a great swath out of the forest beneath the castle some of the rubble having taken out a dozen or so trees and houses along the esplanade fire trucks were already screaming across both bridges and over the river they could see trees near the railway station aflame despite the drizzling rain parkin looked about for the humvee relieved to see it still there but brentwood was nowhere in sight bloody hell pardon asked monsieur malm√©dy where are the other shelters parkin asked him gesticulating back to the one they had just emerged from but malm√©dy was unsure of what he meant another man helping out pointing to the white office building off to their right parkin indicated to malm√©dy that he should follow him malm√©dy hesitated lili said parkin ah the old man happily exclaimed and graciously motioned parkin to go before him bloody hell thought parkin he thinks im taking him to lili parkin looked about for brentwood but couldnt see him surely he couldnt be far from the caf√© renoir policemen were already on duty on the nearest of the two bridges stopping outgoing traffic from the old part of the town to allow an ambulance its siren blaring to pull out of the congested line leading from the rail station chapter twentyfour deep in the montana missile silo it didnt matter whether it was night or day only the clock told melissa lange and her coteam member shirley cochrane that it was hours having received the command melissa sat in the highbacked red upholstered chair slid it forward on its glide rails and buckled up waiting for shirley when melissa heard the click she began the litany hands on keys key them on my mark three two one mark both watched the clock its long white second hand having passed zero and now sweeping to ten seconds before light on confirmed shirley light off the second ten seconds passed both women tense hands on keys instructed melissa hands on keys came shirleys confirmation initiate on my mark five four three two one now ill watch the clock ive got the light said shirley light on light off release key ordered melissa key released they waited for the launch code to come in their onecrew keyturn having initiated only one vote in the launch process the ringing indicating launch message coming through sounded like an old telex chattering inside a metal box they were now on standby requiring another vote from another lcc launch control center in order to go to strategic alert the yellow lights changing to white as they moved from the key release waiting mode to launchfirerelease mode after which the five nuclear warheads would be sent streaking toward their targets their infinity delay shifting to a tensecond delay from target each of the two women praying for the ilc inhibit launch commandto be activated instead of the valid wordnumeral message for armageddon they began to relax waiting for the instructor to call it off and tell them it was a drill suddenly there was a highpitched electronic tone and a mans even modulated voice above a sizzle of static charlie tango papa sierra oscar stand by message follows then came the repeat message follows both women heads bent pencils poised waited then they began to copy victor november uniform oscar charlie tango hotel xray sierra papa papa lima two seven november foxtrot echo one lima acknowledge copied said shirley her voice without a quaver i see a valid message i agree confirmed melissa go to step one checklist launch keys inserted both women unbuckled went to the midpoint red box as melissa and shirley each took out her respective round redtagged brass key their eyes did not meet both returned to their consoles flipped aside the plastic safety cover inserted the keys and then buckled up once more in their seats ready said melissa ready okay hold it said the instructor its a drill melissa felt her whole body sag then she sat up briskly again so as not to show it shirley said the instructor whats the matter with your chair you wasted three seconds back there dont know sir strap wont reach give it play let the strap run back and pull it right out again just like you do in your automobile shirley gave the strap more play this time the buckle clicked in damn belt shirley complained to melissa as the door of the silo elevator shut silently and they began to rise happens to me all the time ive had the same problem something wrong with that seat said melissa the guide rails dont worry theyll fix it wasnt your fault you were cool as a cucumber down there oh yeah said shirley slipping into her cheeky harlem accent were you melissa thought for a second wondering if the elevator was bugged would they do that she looked across at shirley and shook her head shirley burst out laughing i wet my pants honey they rode the rest of the way in silence relieved the drill was over but still too tense to come down from the adrenaline high as the air force van slowed to drop them off at their shared bungalow shirleys boyfriend a junior lieutenant from the silo complex hq was waiting in his car its exhaust blowing clouds of steam high into the frozen air and melissa could feel the steady thump thump thump of the stereo as she got out of the base van the frigid blast of air hitting her like a sheet of ice hi she heard shirley call out to the boyfriend come on inside he shook his head sliding the window down a fraction kilotons in there doing some repair work didnt think i should go in anybody knows you gave me a key well said shirley walking over to his car you can come in now cant you he looked anxiously at his watch were gonna miss that movie okay shirley called out give me a couple of minutes already inside melissa saw the jackofalltrades repairman known on the base as killerton he turned around his bodybuilders torso threatening to burst the coveralls a clump of chest hair so prominent it made her look away didnt think anyoned be home said killerton grinning his smile immediately suggestive a shock of black hair as dark as that on his chest melissa noticed melissa shook the snow off her boots still shivering and not knowing quite what to say to the repairman not that there was anything unusual about him being there base personnel often requested repairs and the workmen were issued a key happened all the time she didnt have to say anything to him just fix the damn ceiling tile and roof requisition said killerton holding up the pink slip from his toolbox for melissa to see shirley came in snowflakes racing after her hi killer didnt see your truck round the back you fix that sucker workin on it you got a leak all right coming right through the flashing he indicated the spot with a fullsized hammer that looked like a toy in his hands uhhuh commented shirley uninterested taking off her parka cant see it from there he said looking over at them well i tell ya killer said shirley im not into roofs man she disappeared into the bathroom show melissa dont bother melissa said quickly im not into roofs either shirley was calling out from the bathroom lissa you and stacy coming to the movie ricks probably still on his solo so give him a call if you two are still talking that is melissa didnt answer and out of the corner of her eye she could see killerton with a grouting gun testing the nozzle against his hand wiping the putty off on his coveralls as melissa dialed stacys bungalow outside the wind was picking up throwing peppercornsized snow hard against the panes no answer from stacys bungalow hes not there melissa told shirley come with us then no thanks threes a crowd i dont think your beau would appreciate beau honey hell do what hes told or else no thanks i feel zapped anyway ill wander down to the px later on see you there shirley was out of the bathroom walking back to the door and pulling on her anorak well rug up honey freeze your butt off out there i will bye the moment the door slammed shut melissa wished shed gone with her i wont be long said killerton fine melissa sat down and switched on the tv but the repairmans presence made her feel uncomfortable although he seemed to be patching the leak smoothing it off melissa felt he was watching her she was starting to get annoyed but it was really her own guilt for having requested base repairs in the fight with stacy she should have left it for rick to do instead of being petty about it worse then i thought said killerton woods rotten in here wormed right through oh said melissa uninterested but adding politely thought itd be too cold for them sure now it is but summertime its hottern a pistol out here no this is old damage im gonna have to fill in more holes than i thought melissa said nothing and changed channels a commercial for rocky mountain bottled water blurted out with a jingle she despised the wars the best thing that ever happened to em said killerton melissa looked over at him he was reloading the caulking gun with a new tube but did it with such dexterity and long experience he didnt even glance at it looking at melissa explaining wars kicked the ass out of all the europeans destroyed fuckin perrier and now with most of our water poisoned hell rocky mountain can jerk us off any way they like he was still smiling and she was flustered the bad language was nothing she hadnt heard before but he seemed to be throwing it down like a gauntlet to see how shed react feeling pretty thirsty myself he said would you like a coke she asked for want of anything better to say beer if youve got it she went over to the kitchenette took a coors from the fridge and passed it to him still looking at her he tore the tab off with his teeth revolting she thought a big hairy adolescent right out of animal house it was the kind of comment david might have made and rick it was about the only thing rick and david had in common a disdain for the gross macho bit yet try as she might she couldnt deny in her a sense of danger of excitement around killerton with a man like this she knew you could let yourself go completely mind you it could never be a permanent thing she heard the click of the toolbox chapter twentyfive when parkin found him david was all but unrecognizable covered in the chalk dust from the direct hit on the castle high above the town with only his eyes visible beneath the chalk brentwood would have looked comical had it not been for the broken child in his arms he walked straight past parkin and monsieur malm√©dy toward the first aid post set up by the caf√© renoir the childs head her spine snapped lolling like a rag doll apparently without a scratch on her the muck and stench of body fluids causing the tiny dress to cling to her matted hair her eyes wide open fixed in horror when david placed her down taking off his tunic to cover her crumpled body he tried to shut her eyes but they wouldnt he drew the battle tunic up higher to cover her face old malm√©dy parkin saw was in tears as brentwood lowered his head for a moment to compose himself to pray or both parkin didnt know which only that when the american straightened up he looked different it wasnt simply that now his tunic was off the clean pressed army shirt and lieutenants collar bars were in such sharp contrast to his bedraggled vaudevillian appearance moments before that they made him look fresher than others who had been in or near the shelter that had taken the side blast of a near hit the difference in brentwoods appearance was in his eyes they were the eyes of an old man in a young body not wearied by age but the determined steel blue of a man who had at one stroke lost all illusion about the fairness of life a man who to parkin looked resolved what a bastard said parkin looking down helplessly at the tiny form covered by brentwoods tunic brentwood said nothing his eyes not moving from the girls body but if there was compassion in them it had become subsumed his look parkin thought more that of a surgeon who along with the recognition of the tragic seemed to be standing in judgment not only of those who had done this terrible thing but of himself of his own behavior his competence of how he might have prevented it and now he had to tell the old man who was already in tears over the young girl that his daughter too was dead he put his arm about the old man and instantly malm√©dy knew it was terrible news as parkin watched them walking down the street seeking a moment of quiet amid the cacophony of the rescue now near fever pitch he saw the old man stop burying his head in his hands unable to go on and brentwood standing with him holding him for lili before they left bouillon david tried to phone captain smythe but all lines were down in bouillon following the rocket attack and he had to wait until he reached namur while welcoming brentwoods change of heart smythe felt obliged to tell david that it was by no means a foregone conclusion that he would make it into sas why not asked david i qualified as a marine didnt i well yes but i think youll find our special air service training is somewhat different tell you the truth quite a few of our red berets and your navy seals have tried and failed its a very concentrated training course for what we have in mind whats that cant tell you that old boy need to know if you pass the course youll find out brentwood was irritated here he was volunteering and now smythe was telling him he mightnt be good enough and how he wondered could this joint britishus force possibly be tougher than the us marines what was so special about sas training have you ever heard of brecon beacons smythe asked him no responded david what are they mountains said smythe in wales the only thing david could remember about wales he told smythe was the prince of wales and an old movie where coal miners black with soot from head to toe came home up a hill singing ah said smythe how green was my valley walter pigeon well i dont think youll find therell be much time for singing smythes remark david brentwood was about to discover was a classic case of british understatement it was christmas eve snowing heavily in washington dc and gen douglas freemans plane at andrews air force base was delayed once again the general standing impatiently inside the hangar as the deicing trucks rolled out and sprayed the wings once more after his briefing with the president on the korean situation freeman had immediately asked for the best pilot available to fly him to honolulu where they would have a brief refueling stopover then on to japan and seoul they had assigned a major from andrews military air transport squadron a man they said with more time on s than any other officer on duty that day but at the last minute freeman in his usually gruff and straightforward manner asked his g colonel norton whether the major assigned had had any combat experience general these people are on the air force one flight crews and theyre selected to fly the president they can fly anything from a tiger moth to an f norton freeman said exasperatedly his athletes bulk impressive even in his incognito garb as he called the business suit and matching serge coat i took you on as my g because you were smart enough to spot those soviet ts in the reconnaissance photos didnt have extra fuel tanks strapped to their backs that gave me the opening to go full steam ahead for warsaw even though we were low on gas and the fat was in the goddamned fire soviet artillery pounding us left right and center i also hired you then because you gave me straight answers and were willing to risk my displeasure with bad news now if were going to keep getting along jim in korea from here on in youd better tell me everything i want to know without any farting about otherwise were never gonna get those chinks asses back over the yalu where they belong hes had no combat experience sir then damn it i want someone who has and i want him now i dont want to go flying in there on a wing and a prayer with someone driving this thing who hasnt seen a flogger coming up his ass at mach through the blind spot yes sir but we will have fighter escorts from here right on through to seoul course that doesnt invalidate your point ill get someone with combat experience how many fightersll be flying escort twenty sir fs hornets what bellowed freeman thats not an escort thats a goddamned invitation draw the enemy like a bear to honey fewer aircraft around me the better i like it yes sir said norton saluting from habit even though the general was in civilian clothes we own the pacific from here to japan dont we asked freeman with the exception of the russian subs yes sir all right then lets keep the bulk of the fighters away from me japan to koreas a different story its catch as catch can across the sea of japan so heres what we do when we enplane from where will it be hiroshima possibly sir or matsue if the weathers bad on the east coast well wherever when we leave send fighters ahead on a northwesterly course well go a few minutes later with only three fighters escort maximum if the russkis do know anything about me coming which i sincerely hope they dont theyll go for our big fighter formation while we slip into seoul and theyll get their tails shot off norton anxious to draw another pilot from the duty roster who had combat experience nodded quickly in agreement to the generals diversionary plan it was typically freemanishdeceptive but also putting himself in danger with little protection all freeman cared about was the importance of the presidential order to get to korea as fast as possible and revive americas military fortunes there if he didnt turn things around there the entire asian theater would collapse and give the russians far eastern command an unprecedented opportunity to direct all the forces it was holding in reserve against a possible american attack from korea toward vladivostok toward the aleutians to hit americas back door besides added freeman if this play actor theyve got impersonating me in brussels does his job well enough damn russians wont even know were coming and we can just fly across under the normal patrol umbrella of the sixth fleet must say general that sounds like a much better way of seeing the sea of japan with the sixth fleet below us freeman frowned but norton wasnt sure whether it was something he said or whether the general whose pride kept him from wearing eyeglasses for his myopia was squinting having difficulty making out the approach of lieutenant harlin the new press aide freemans regular press officer having been left in brussels to help coordinate the impersonationdeception plan jim when we reach japan its no longer the sea of japan were going over its the east sea our south korean allies are very touchy on that particular point they wouldnt give you a stick for a nip historical enemies hadnt been for korean admiral yi in the twelfth century sinking all the emperors ships in the tsushima straits theyd all be eating sushi in seoul poor bastards and thats another thing jim i dont want any member of this flight fighter pilots included to leave the air base in japan wherever it is we land they start eating all that raw fish crap next thing well have half of em down with the johnny runs yes sir talking of japan its been suggested by the state department that a visit to the emperor wouldnt go astray in the interest of interallied goddamn it jim i cant go giving an order for everyone to stay put while i go out and eat seaweed with the emperor besides what if somebody recognized me en route never mind this wall street garb theyve stuck me into itd compromise the whole operation besides only emperor i wanted to see was douglas macarthur then he went and screwed it all up gave them brandnew factories put them years ahead of detroit which is why the automobile industry in this country is a basket case freeman paused you dont agree never said a word general i can read it all over your face well im no racist bucko ill fight and the with those people what they did for us in the early months of the war when our perimeter round pusan shrank till we didnt have a pot to piss in was magnificent magnificent but for a moment the general moved closer to the colonel eyes intense ill tell you this jim if theres anything left of a command in korea and i do push premier lin zhous boys back across the yalu and the tamur i wont be giving beijing new automobile factories so they can pull another economic miracle on us hell id give em democracy too but theyd have to rebuild from the rubble norton felt a flush of alarm the rubble in japans case had come from an atomic bomb you dont mean youd drop the bomb on the chinese general when are those jokers going to have my plane ready excuse me general freeman turned to see his press aide and the us navy pilot name tag maj f shirer you have combat experience major asked freeman yes sir where aleutians sir pyongyang pyongyang yes sir i flew off the salt lake city cover said freeman for my choppers yes sir answered shirer adding in a tone that spoke of pride with a flush of uncharacteristic immodesty led the wing in twice that where you got that navy star major yes sir well hell son what are you doing here there was a sudden tension in the air norton knowing that if the general thought for a moment anyone was goldbricking hed just as soon shoot him beats me sir shirer told him honestly apparently im a replacement for one of the air force one teams told me they wanted someone with combat hours though why they chose freeman extended his hand ive got a more important job for you than ferrying the president around the young press secretary shot a worried glance at norton as if there might be some hidden microphone or reporter in the hangar despite the fact that no one from the press would have been allowed anywhere near andrews if thered been even a suspicion that freeman was in town whats the mission sir asked shirer barely able to contain his excitement at the possibility of returning to active service maybe even the aleutians back to korea explained freeman beaming as my pilot shirer hesitated you mean a thats right yes sir norton tried to send an eye code to shirer to the effect that it wasnt just anyone who got the job of flying the legendary freeman back to the scene of his first glory but the truth was that shirer had had enough honor since he had come to washington what he wanted was combat instead hed be jockeying the big slow if a fighter was a sports car the was a mack truck fully loaded besides it wouldnt take him anywhere near lana he also didnt like the general calling him son though only in his late twenties it wouldnt be that long before theyd be retiring him from fighter duty shirer said freeman if you dont want it say so but before you do remember this im directly responsible for implementing the presidents orders now i dont care what you think of me but the mission is nothing less than to initiate a decisive action to win the war for us in asia if my hunch is right itll be a commuter ride from here through pearl and on to japan and it should be a breeze from there to seoul im not supposed to be here but in europe all our indications are that our ruse is working so there shouldnt be any trouble but there could be red navy units with surfacetoair missiles and if any shooting starts id like a veteran at the wheel id be honored to go general good man see him aboard jim yes general the young press aide was now alone with the general freeman shook his head grinning watching shirer heading out through the bluishwhite veil of snow toward the aircraft hes about as happy to be flying that big bird as id be seeing the emperor yes sir agreed the press aide harlin eagerly he had still not recovered from being assigned to the generals staff overawed by the generals reputation and the scenes it evoked of the general shooting his way room to room through the great hall of the people of pyongyang looking for his nemesis general kim know why hell do it said freeman because hes a soldier hes a warrior harbin yes sir said harlin too awed to tell the general it was harlin not harbin i want you to take some notes harbin ordered freeman pass em on to jim norton soon as you finish yes sir shoot freeman raised an eyebrow and looked down at the young aide offering him a stick of gum no thank you sir last chance youll have between here and korea were going to be at the front mr harbin not sitting on our butts in seoul in that sewer staring up at the big board he meant the subterranean hq operationsshelter complex beneath seoul and at the front a commie can smell a stick of gum half a mile upwind now first thing i want you to put down on that pad of yours distribution all commanders down to battalion and company level is that i dont want anybody pulling back from anywhere the second thing is you getting all this harbin yes general good second order is that ammunition is not to be wasted at present we have an effective ammunition usage rate of twenty thirty percent tops this constitutes a seventy to eighty percent consumption rate fired in panic and its got to stop my gll want to see all aurs the press aide stopped writing ammunition usage reports explained freeman and if anybodys just shooting for the hell of it hell have to answer to me personally yes sir course said freeman smiling an order like thats impossible to police but i want our boys to get the general idea capiche yes sir were in a winter battle freeman went on his voice rising above the wild spitting hiss of the deicing sprays those nangnim mountains are going to be rough peaks well over six thousand feet next order is i want hot food chuted in and chopperdumped wherever possible though of course that wont be possible at the front yes sir next thing memo to the entertainment officer in seoul i dont want any communist propaganda film shown in any unit and that includes hospital units in seoul the press aide was nonplussed he doubted very much whether entertainment officers would ever do such a thing even if they were kgb plants which you couldnt discount given the paranoia sweeping the states in the wake of the poisoned water crisis and other sabotage by that freeman explained i mean that i dont want any goddamned hanoi jane movies got it the lieutenant in his early twenties wasnt familiar with the actresss name are they bad movies general bad harbin the only goddamn picture i want to see ms fonda in is a cartoon of her ass being blown to pieces by one of those guns she sat on in hanoi when she was calling our boys war criminals and another thing i dont want any mash reruns you know what im talking about old funny hawkeye with all the jokes about the futility of war and the mad american generals if it wasnt for mad american generals like macarthur and ridgeway thered be no funny hawkeyes in hollywood theyd all be munching rice harbin and a lot of south koreans would now be fertilizing the paddies of the north with their bones trouble is with mash it was an antiwar film against vietnam policy set in korea but our boys wont make that kind of distinction harbin too young to remember korea i dont want them sabotaged in the rear by those longhaired weirdos that did us in over vietnam and ill tell you another thing harbin north vietnams one of the poorest most oppressive countries in asia thats why theres no mash ii the hapless press aide was glad to see colonel norton returning from the informing freeman all set to go in twenty minutes general theyre sending a crew bus to take you out rather than an official car case theres some press hanging around the never mind that jim said freeman nothing wrong with my legs lets go harbin whats the flight schedule jim how many hours twenty plus sir allowing for refueling in hawaii and japan forecast snow from here to the midwest general but then clearing up as we get to hawaii from then on it gets better good harbin yes sir notice you dont use a plate between those note pages harlin didnt know what to make of it and looked over to norton for help but the colonels head was down against the finegrained snow that was bouncing off them like uncooked rice piece of aluminum explained freeman striding ahead dont use cardboard plastic if you like but never write any of my orders down without a separating pad between the pages you put the top ones in the burn basket as a matter of course but more than one sergeant ive known has been reading his cos confidential memos holding the second page up to the light that happens in my command and youve got a free ride to nowhere understand yes yes sir answered harlin dont worry about it said freeman but you see son any fool can figure out the big plans only have to look at a map its the details harbin the details thats what wins or breaks the day yes sir ill remember i know you will now you just relax were gonna have that big bird all to ourselves cocacola machines everything more electronics on that baby than you can shake a stick at next thing you know well be in the land of the rising sun ever been to japan harbin no sir beautiful country that right jim sure is general you eat sushi harbin ah he thought the general had said shoosh raw fish explained norton no ii dont believe i have general didnt have any of that in idaho just as well mightnt be here today if you did goes through you like crap through a goose sucks all the energy out of your legs that right jim thats right general though i must say ive never had any trouble with dont contradict me goddamn it no sir chapter twentysix do we know for certain asked president suzlov soviet head of kgb vladimir chernko was equivocal not absolutely premier i mean mr president despite his support of president gorbachev during the latters years of decline chernko had always found it difficult to address subsequent leaders as president rather than the old pregorbachev premier our agent one of the best in brussels said the car was unmarked a mercedes en route to the airport no fanfare no motorcycle escorts but a glimpse of freeman stepping out its freemans style president what challenged suzlov to slip out in the middle of the night hardly comrade i thought he was a prima donna likes to be seen unquestionably comrade president said chernko publicly and i suppose for that matter privately but hes no fool he is the most brilliant tactician the americans have anywhere a master of the unexpected everyone thought this would be a war of high mobility and technology that the socalled technological imperative would dictate strategy but this freeman has obviously mastered more than technical manuals his grasp of tactics and of tactical details is legendary among his troops we know now that the pentagon thought he was mad when he presented the plan for pyongyang an airborne assault at night precisely when the american and south korean forces were in full retreat therefore it is logical in my opinion that they would shift him back to korea now the chinese have crossed the yalu he knows the country suzlov remained unconvinced yes comrade director but another of your agents is reporting that freeman is still in europe going between brussels and the front he may be a firstrate commander comrade but hes not a magician suzlov turned away in his swivel chair banks of white phones behind him and looked over at the picture of lenin he cant be in two places at once and why would the americans give him a new command when his offensive against us is going so well in europe their supply line from the french ports to our polishrussian front is now over seventeen hundred kilometers mr president its true they have aerial superiority and their armored divisions have moved within striking distance of minsk but we are having increasing success where it ultimately counts with our submarines in the pacific and the atlantic theyre about to turn the tide are you that confident comrade asked suzlov while studying lenins photograph as if he had never really seen it before yes came the reply from director chernko if our submarines continue to stop the supplies we will win the mathematical equation is simple no supplies no advance meanwhile we are also reinforcing our supplies along the transsiberian to khabarovsk and vladivostok and now chinas entry has diverted what would have been nato supplies from america to korea this takes even more pressure off our western front if the americans are beaten in korea well be free to move our sinosoviet divisions for a final push against the aleutians its no wonder washington is sending this freeman back to korea perhaps responded suzlov but you can never be sure what the chinese will do they will make peace and war when it suits them our situation will not influence them either way they are strictly allies of convenience you know this if we falter anywhere in the eastern theater they will cross the amur into our territory and gobble up what they can look at khabarovsk sabotage is already taking place there and we cant seem to stop it we will chernko promised him but back to freeman it makes sense for the americans to give freeman the korean command the snow is deep in western europe and neither side apart from the air forces will be making much of a move until the spring it is an ideal opportunity for them to recall their senior commander for consultation we also do this when suzlov turned abruptly away from the table and began pacing down past the long baizetopped table where the stavka high command sat during the long day and night sessions in the enormous complex of the council of ministers building suzlov was considering the number of fighters the director was requesting based on air force estimates of what chernkos plan would need most of them would probably be shot down by either american or japanese fighters the bulk of the soviet fighters might evade radar on a low run in from the russian airfields at vladivostok but the rotodomes of the american hawkeye electronic surveillance planes from the us carriers in the sea of japan would pick them up before they intercepted freemans plane if indeed it was freeman who had left brussels en route to washington dc and then possibly on to south korea to make it more difficult for suzlov the distance he discovered between vladivostok to seoul was twelve hundred kilometers mig flogger c interceptors with a combat radius of twelve hundred kilometers would need drop tanks thus slowing their speed significantly to say nothing of their maneuverability at least on the way in still the target suzlov had to admit was irresistible if they could get confirmation from their japanese agents of freemans arrival in japan and attack him en route to korea his death would be a stunning victory america would be devastated by the loss of her most able field commander and at a time when she desperately needed him if her troops in korea were not to suffer another humiliation at the hands of the chinesenka legions and the psychological effect of freemans death in europe would be almost as dramatic and help tilt the odds in favor of the soviet union if we are to do it said suzlov we must have the best all volunteers that doesnt necessarily bring us the best comrade president oh said suzlov looking genuinely surprised the president turned back to his desk and globe contemplating the korean peninsula it had been a constant thorn in the soviet side first it was kim il sung using millions of rubles in foreign aid to build towering bronze statues of himself all over pyongyang and his son kim il jong determined to keep the dynasty as gorbachev had once referred to it going and now there was talk that general kim hero of the north korean invasion of the south once in disgrace due to the success of freemans pyongyang raid was now back in command of all north korean forces along with zhou li supreme commander of the plas northern armies kim was no more likable in suzlovs opinion than kim il jong and co but at least he was convinced that for north korea allegiance to moscow was as important as allegiance to beijing unlike il jong and il sung who had been stunned by gorbachevs criticism of their selfglorification freemans death would also have the advantage of impressing kim that allegiance to moscow was not as beijing not so subtly charged less important because of north koreas closer proximity to china it would demonstrate that in matters of technology the kind of technology it would take to kill freeman the soviet union was light years ahead of china very well said suzlov go ahead but only if we get positive confirmation of freeman arriving and leaving japan chernko rose matteroffactly thanking suzlov but careful not to be effusive too ingratiating it wouldnt do for suzlov to get too big for his boots besides suzlov had not impressed chernko by his willingness to accept chernkos statement that volunteers are not always the best they were of course provided basic military criteria were met but chernkos comment that they werent always so had been calculated to give him leverage against another member of the stavka marchenko another comrade who was getting too big for his boots in return for chernko not ordering the far eastern air force command at khabarovsk to assign marchenkos son sergei to fly on the top secret and highly dangerous mission the director knew that he would incur an implicit yet clearly understood iou from marchenko senior or so he believed in khabarovsk gen kiril marchenko strolled with his son sergei outside the hardened shelters of the fighter squadrons at six feet the general was half a foot taller than his son and in his general staff uniform looked more impressive he was conscious of the fact that throughout their relationship his rank had intimidated sergei but he doubted that this still held true now that his son had become one of the soviet unions most decorated fighter pilots the general would have preferred to be inside the base hq in the warmth of the operations room than strolling outside but he did not want to be overheard this was as much a family matter as a military one pulling up the collar of his greatcoat his breath steaming in the arctic air that had swept down from siberia he gazed up for a moment at the stars their brilliance in the clear air astonishing after the pollution of moscow you should have had more sense he told sergei im a man replied sergei unapologetically it isnt exactly unnatural im not talking about that said kiril of course a man gets lonely needs the company of i understand your feelings he hesitated then added especially after your experience in the aleutians a close brush with death often does that to a man stirs up the blood this is quite normal but a jew you know how they are no matter what they say even that fool gorbachev understood that much why do you think he let so many of them go then why are you so worried retorted sergei he felt good a combination of his status as an ace the tailored dress uniform under the greatcoat the weight of the coat made by one of the jews from the autonomous regions fitting perfectly as did the boots that crunched the hardened snow beneath him all of this gave him a consummate feeling of wellbeing of power he remembered reading in his fathers library when his father had been chief censor and therefore the bestread man in the ussr a book by the englishman orwell in which the englishman had written of similar feelings about his mounted policemans uniform when he served the british raj in burma of how the uniform the riding pants the boots spurs and the riding crop had given him too a feeling of pleasure and power following the surge of confidence hed experienced after shooting down the american tomcats in the aleutians sergei had worn the uniform with special pride and so now next to his father whom he had always held in awe he felt a rush of equality i told her nothing of military operations here he told the general im not that stupid its not what you told her retorted the general but playing in the muck puts you in a vulnerable position you mean it puts the family in a vulnerable position if you wish to put it that way yes besides she could have slipped you poison anything sergei laughed and seeing how it infuriated his father rather enjoyed it poison or some filthy disease snarled the general i use precautions said sergei im not a moron besides poisons only for the politburo sergei sensed his father stiffen beside him but the general kept walking the snow crunched harder you miss the point entirely sergei you know shes been arrested as a saboteur her brothers also thats not my affair am i supposed to run a security check on every peasant i youre supposed to use your judgment you might be a fighter ace but youve obviously a few things to learn about women about living with your two feet on the ground shes using you no doubt and her arrest could place you in a precarious position the general stopped for a moment began to speak then walking on again announced abruptly it would be unwise of you to see her again or have anything to do with her family keep away from jews sergei said nothing well pressed the general what sergei challenged him do you want me to sign an affidavit i want you to assure me here now that youll not see her again sergei turned to head back toward the fighter hangars his father following the questions academic isnt it i doubt the committee for public safety will release her there was a sarcastic edge in his use of the kgbs official title i assume youve made sure of that dont be insulting said kiril marchenko looking at his son angrily there was a long silence as they continued walking the only sound that of their boots now out of step in the snow colonel nefski began the general is in a difficult position if these saboteurs arent caught and they cut the transsiberian our garrisons out here would be seriously i know that said sergei impatiently your own squadron will feel the effect too the general continued not only from the railway delays but the munitions being made out here weve already had problems said sergei oh the general slowed nefski never told me that some of the aphids said sergei what are they airtoair they appear not to have exploded on the target range though its possible they could have gone into the ocean its difficult sometimes to you see said the general seizing the opportunity this is precisely what i mean sergei this mission against the american general freeman imagine if after all that trouble a rocket didnt he stopped you havent volunteered have you of course kiril marchenko had said it before his professional obligation had had a chance to override his feelings as a father then he said im proud of you sergei said nothing they were approaching the control tower a dark obelisk in the sporadic moonlight that was shining through wisps of stratus the air redolent with pine and in the distance somewhere a convoy the faint slits of its air raid headlights approaching the base like some strange segmented yellow snake weaving through the forest the saboteurs sergei remembered had also cut the khabarovsk and volochayevka roadway would be nice said kiril marchenko changing the subject if you wrote your mother more often yes said sergei i mean to but kiril held his gloved hand up i know i was the same but i told her id order you sergei couldnt see his fathers face clearly but sensed the attempt at good humor is she all right asked sergei thriving shes soon to be promoted head of chemical defense for all of moscow the first woman its quite an honor you think it will come to that no said the general the americans dont have the stomach for it not after theyve seen what weve done with our sleepers in their own country their water supplies and the like its the one great advantage we have over them sergei one must admit that for all his childish idealism gorbachev did at least make it easier for chernko to flood the united states with our agents happily its never been the other way around the general paused for a moment looking about to see whether any of the air traffic control sentries were nearby lowering his voice but if were attacked with it well use it suzlov wont hesitate neither will the stavka put in sergei he said it without rancor but as a matter of fact kiril saw a guard at the door silhouetted against a faint glow from the officers mess he called out to the man reminding him it was an air raid precaution violation and to have the shutters drawn securely sergei i wouldnt be surprised if comrade nefski gives you a call to warn you off this woman try not to be rude it wont do you any good just accept youve made an error the general hurried on you can find another outlet for your passions you understand eh he slapped sergei on the back find a good russian girl or one of the brownskinned ones eh he paused at the entrance to the mess my plane leaves in half an hour sergei still said nothing it was sergeis worst failing in his fathers view on the battlefield his son had distinguished himself more than once but he had retained a childish propensity to sulk or was it only with his father that he behaved so look said kiril a man must be sensible about these things if you need more money in order to huh so i can buy a woman if necessary yes said kiril marchenko if you go to a clean place at least you know what youre getting youre not the first soldier to i dont need money said sergei i have enough his father hadnt even used her name again there was a long awkward silence between them finally sergei murmured dont worry ill be careful good said the general they hugged write to your mother yes in the officers mess sergei was flipping through a fingerworn copy of a german pornographic magazine lingering over a blonde tarted up in a top hat and tails no shirt her long rednailed fingers clasping the silver top of a long walking stick sergei and his wing man boris were trying to discover whether the blondes attributes were natural or siliconeassisted such procedures were rare in the soviet union but apparently quite common in germany our women have bigger breasts than that said boris and bigger bottoms countered sergei so whats wrong with that parried boris i like something you can grab on to all i want to grab put in the ground crew captain are enormous great pendulous majormajor marchenko da telefon when sergei heard nefskis voice he was immediately on guard at once struck by his fathers warning that his association with the jewess was bound to incur a warning from the kgb to stay away from the yevreysk autonomous region major we believe you know the girl alexsandra malof yes marchenko said then as he was wont to do in a dogfight seizing offense as the best defense added shes a jew ah now there you are you see the kgb colonel seemed to be talking to someone else at the other end then came back on the line i was just telling my assistant major that you are just like your father a man who gets straight to the heart of things no thought sergei i am not like my father i wont do a dance around it the jewess was the best lay hed had during the entire war besides what could nefski do to an air ace it would make the local kgb boss very unpopular not only with the stavka hq in moscow but with all the propaganda cadres throughout the sixteen military districts and the four air armies i would like to talk to you said nefski his tone upbeat casual yes said sergei guardedly waiting no no said the colonel not on the phone let us have a meal dinner at the bear inn marchenko knew the place in khabarovsk it specialized in yakut food what is there to talk about comrade colonel lets talk i cant tonight i realize that said nefski marchenko surprised that the colonel apparently knew about operatsiya otmorozhennayaoperation frostbitethe planned intercept of the plane that reportedly would be flying the legendary american general freeman across the sea of japan to korea but then sergei told himself he should have guessed that nefski would have spies everywhere probably knew what the base commander had for breakfast tomorrow night then said nefski congenially when you return marchenko knew that what nefski meant was ifyou return or had he merely guessed that sergei had volunteered to go on the mission no sergei concluded the colonel would know not only that he had volunteered but was also leading the mission major would sixteen hundred hours be satisfactory yes agreed marchenko good said nefski i hope you understand we have no objections to our men in uniform going out with the jewish faith such prejudice is against soviet law i know said sergei pointedly it wasnt that he loved alexsandra he didnt she was merely an attractive brunette her figure enough to satisfy even his ground captains more outrageous fantasies it would be easy for him to ditch her there was a lot more pussy around khabarovsk besides being an ace meant having the highest pay scale of any field combatants he could buy what his uniform and medals couldnt attract no what he objected to was the politicos like nefski telling him whom he could screw and whom he couldnt the odd thing however was that nefskis tone despite his parroting official policy of nondiscrimination against minorities made it sound as if the colonel didnt really hate jews which was unusual chapter twentyseven during the retreat from the frozen jumble of ice that was the yalu river its choppedup appearance due to sections refreezing after american millimeter artillery shells had holed it the third infantry division under gen arthur c creigh now in full retreat from the river was encountering the worst korean winter for the past seventeen years medics were carrying their morphine ampules in their mouths in order to keep the morphine warm enough to pass through a syringe many of the wounded waiting in the heavy snow for the khaki angels the helo medevacs died before the choppers could reach the besieged changsong road that lead back from the river toward the mash units of kusong many of the wounded covered with snow slipped into the warm sleep of hypothermia as plasma froze solid drip pouches split open and the men still able to march discarded everything nonessential including mess kits using their helmets instead others ate the freezedried emergency c ration as it was unable to get hot water except for rare moments when a tank or rather those tanks still moving could provide the heat from their engines while the freezedried food kept some of the troops going many of the wounded who normally would have survived the relatively quick medevac ate the food using snow to wash it down and in doing so reduced vital body heat before the consumed food had time to do any good since coming under heavy fire from the chinese artillery much of which had been carried piece by piece by the chinese and korean infantry to the ridges overlooking the road creighs division had suffered over four thousand casualties at hours the snowfall swallowed up the sun thereby limiting the vital air support that had been coming in from the carrier salt lake city it gave the chinese perfect opportunities for ambush and closein fighting for which they had been especially trained by the divisions casualties had climbed to over five thousand making it apart from the mass us surrender on corregidor in world war ii one of the worst disasters in us military history as fresh chinese and north korean divisions continued to pour across the yalu general kims north korean regulars formed the eastern arm of a pincer soon to be completed by an artillerysupported right hook of four chinese divisions over sixty thousand chinese and north koreans in all closing on the beleaguered americans the next morning december in korea christmas eve in the united states millions of viewers across america were riveted and sickened by astonishing clear tvsatelliterelayed pictures from the changsong gauntlet seeing haggard holloweyed american infantrymen many too weak either from exhaustion wounds or both struggling to fight off repeated chinese attacks which at times cut the road into segments in which they hoped to annihilate the us troops the fighting often hand to hand after which the remaining chinese cannibalizing the retreating gis equipment reformed for yet more attacks on the flanks of the demoralized and retreating american army in all the television footage however one shot a lingering pan of a quartermile section of road that had been white but was now red with american blood and littered with american dead was the picture that traumatized civilians back home about the road brown boils of uprooted earth marked the spots where shells from the chinese artillery had bracketed the retreating americans and now in this war the taboo that had been so long and meticulously observed right up to and including vietnam never to show a dead americans face on film if possible was broken the taboo had not been violated through any willfulness of field reporters but because of the sheer efficiency of the electronic media whose signals were received in real time only seconds after the action had taken place what at first viewers assumed were long shots of crumpled clothing turned out to be closeup photos of dismembered american soldiers blown apart by the chinese artillery and highvelocity closein weapons fired only seconds before throughout the television coverage one of the most persistent comments concerned the bravery of the television cameramen who though their pictures often shook violently from time to time more from the pressure waves of the few remaining american s and mortars than from fear kept filming some of the worst of the fighting even the older generation of civilians at home who though too young to have remembered the vietnam war had seen footage of it later on had never seen such carnage what the us media didnt know however was that north korean general kim whose favorite expression at panmunjom during the prewar days was be careful you americans or you will end up like kennedy shot like a dog in the street had issued orders with threat of severe punishment if not obeyed that enemy tv cameramen and crew were not to be harmed wherever possible they are your allies in the struggle against the american warmongers kim had explained to his comrades the way to defeat americans is to show what is happening to their children they are a weak people they will cry for armistice as they did when our forefathers defeated them over fifty years ago remember comrades american television was one of the most decisive strategies of our comrades in vietnam show them american casualties and the antifascist youth of america will clamor for their brothers return this is particularly true of the american bourgeoisie the middle class show them how we are cutting the americans to pieces and there will be mass demonstrations in the streets to bring their sons home when the first reports both visual and decoded military traffic of creighs retreat first reached douglas freeman his plane en route to korea was approaching hawaii and against all normal safety procedures he not only refused to leave the plane while it was being refueled but ordered all thirty electronic warfare and other console operators to stay aboard as well the situation in korea was too critical for anyone to leave the plane freeman having decided to immediately issue orders for creigh to stand and fight not a matter of heroics jim he told colonel norton but if this casualty rake keeps up the entire divisionll be wiped out before they get anywhere near kusong thats over forty miles away my god whats the matter with creigh norton handed him a sheaf of eyes only transmits from creighs retreating hq the messages routed via seoul sir one of freemans aides cut in weve got reports here from general waverley two brigade commander in creighs outfit he doesnt come right out and say it but you can read between the lines waverleys saying creighs stressed out stressed out bellowed freeman goddamn it ill give him stress he stood up from his seat in the planes forward command booth riley the radio operator came running down through the canyon between the two rows of consoles yes general top secret priority rush to general creigh second infantry division korean northern command if you cant pinpoint his position and beam it down funnel it through seoul but get it there yes sir said riley flipping out his notepad message reads began freeman glowering as if creigh a popular commander by all accounts was standing before him freeman starting to pace up and down the aisle just beyond the radio control like a caged bear second division is to cease retreat immediately if you are incapable of command you should transfer all authority at once repeat at once shoot any man refusing to fight i accept full responsibility freeman c in c korea message ends by god said freeman turning to address the two lanes of operators stressed thats just a fancy word for funk word gets out about creigh shitting in his pants well have desertion on that road his voice was rising well leave more than blood on that road gentlemen well leave american honor he paused norton taking the opportunity to follow the radio operator down through the canyon now continued freeman i want everyone here to remember that i dont ever want to hear stressed out in this command goddamn pansy excuse for not working hard not doing your job do i make myself clear there was murmured assent do i make myself clear yes sir came a chorus down by the radio console norton stood behind the operator and spoke in a quiet even tone to riley who was feeding the message into code pretransmission change the first part of the message riley norton told him replace if you are incapable with if you are incapacitated riley looked up worriedly at the colonel just do it son said norton if it hits the fan ill take the flak yes sir chapter twentyeight in the halls of the admiralty in londons whitehall and in brussels hq a crisis of another kind was building one of whose consequences if nothing was done about it would be infinitely more terrible than those facing the americans in korea the operations board told the story in cold unemotional figures the rate of soviet submarines sunk in the atlantic had fallen off drastically and the allied convoys from the united states and canada devoted to maintaining the rollover necessary to resupply allied europe were being sunk at a rate greater than that which had occurred in the early months of the war for natos c in cs the danger suspected earlier was now being confirmed with yet another convoy of fifty ships having suffered over sixty percent losses barely a hundred miles north of the azores how the russians submarines were doing it neither admiralty in whitehall nor norfolk virginia knew but the mathematical equations gave them the stark warning if rollover faltered any further then not only would europe face the possibility of being starved into submission through lack of conventional munitions as well as food from america but this lack would force the allies to the weapons of last resort which might be the last of everything but if in whitehall the growing fear of the allies was evident in the cold statistics on the computer screens and by the tiny models representing the growing number of convoy ships sunk then for the allied submarine commanders like robert brentwood a thousand feet or more beneath the surface of the atlantic the danger took on an infinitely more palpable if invisible reality chapter twentynine the hawaiian islands the fijian trawler mv vanuatu was manned by east indian fijians with long memories of colonel kabukas coup d√©tat of when the fijianrun military overthrew her majestys duly elected government in the south seas island indian journalists were imprisoned and the everpresent hostility of the native fijian population against their fellow east indian citizens was as palpable in the balmy air as the humidity that hung so oppressively over suva bay paradise had lost its innocence forever after the coup and into the void created by the condemnation issued from her majestys government the russians had come bearing aid in return the russians received not only fish treaties but also the right to visit and use fijian port facilities for repairs to the huge soviet trawler fleet whenever necessary at one stroke the soviets in the eighties had extended the kgbs and mvds intelligencegathering facilities halfway around the world to the south seas hitherto the american navys domain and so it was that the mv vanuatu ostensibly a fijian trawler but in reality under subcontract to the russian merchant marine operating between the ellis islands group and hawaii was in honolulu when freemans landed still the indian operatives aboard the trawler wouldnt have learned of his presence but for one of the civilian ground crew from honolulus airport grouching in the reef bar about missing the first round of poker because hed had to work overtime juicing up some bigwigs flying lanai some politicians freebie suggested one of the players another mechanic making like a high roller ordering maitais all round nah said the airport mechanic wasnt politicians they hit the tarmac soon as they land suck in their gut leis all around them and big smiles for the advertizer these guys wouldnt even leave the plane when we were pumping er full of avgas it wasnt much to go on for one of the vanuatus crew sitting at the bar knocking back his fourth bud but it was enough for vanuatus skipper to pass it along via fish talk this innocuous plainlanguage transmission full of information about sea conditions movements and depth of schools of fish was relayed from one trawler to another as far as the south korean and japanese trawler fleets plying the tsushima straits off japans southern island of honshu by the time freemans plane reached tokyos narita airport osaka ruled out because of fog a south korean trawler manned by north korean illegals all with bona fide rok papers had sent a fake sos of predetermined coordinates the rescue hovercraft of the japanese defense forces taking the message as a genuine distress call ended up on a wildgoose chase and assumed the boat had sunk when they reached the area and found no sign of the vessel the coordinates a numberforletter code alerted soviet operatives from japan to vladivostok and khabarovsk that the americans vip plane was at narita in order that there would be no possibility of either soviet or chinese radarguided surfacetoair missile batteries along the yalu and tamur firing at the soviet missions aircraft as they headed south a secret message in four group numberfornumber code went out from stavka moscow hq to far eastern tvd hq khabarovsk for repeat to the soviet embassy in beijing the message mainly for the benefit of the chinese was to inform all aa batteries that in the next twentyfour hours soviet fighters would be in manchurian air space and were not to be fired upon the message was intercepted by us intelligence satellite k in geosynchronous orbit over the south china sea but as the stavkas code had not been broken the number series transcript of it was filed to add to the voluminous piles of other intercepts which included everything from military traffic to civilian traffic between the united states canada and asia even if the code had been cracked by us intelligence the chances of it being brought immediately to sacpac hq in tokyo were fiftyfifty due to what insiders habitually called the phs or pearl harbor syndrome referring to the avalanche of information which might contain what you want to know but which even with computers working flat out takes hours often days to process i assume we dont have to stop at matsue freeman asked norton as their car drove across from the secluded vip lounge at narita to the boeing we can go straight through to seoul yes sir and in the morning we fly up to pakchon its only about thirty miles from the front front the front it will be the front if creigh doesnt pull himself together as the car drove across the runway a dull thudding sound came from underneath as the clacking of the tires on the cement seams was muffled by the cars heavy armorplated chassis those fighters remember to have them go off a half hour before us its all arranged sir dont think therell be any problem overcast above the sea of jap sorry sir over the east sea thatll help hide the big bird and so far security seems to be holding up by way of underscoring his point norton reached forward and took a copy of stars and stripes from the pocket by the jump seat heres a photo of you inspecting the forward troops around warsaw you were in washington at the time the headline ran freeman crosses border takes brest drives on to minsk the lookalike freeman had to admit was very convincing and well rugged up the military scarf speckled with snow bundled high against the cold and closeup shots yes agreed freeman obviously pleased if not by the deception then by the papers announcing to the world at large that his americanled nato armored column had succeeded in breaking through and were now engaging the russians on their own soil nevertheless he uncharacteristically intoned a caution but can we hold them dick he paused and put down the paper by god i told my men i dont want to ever hear were holding anything and last report i get is were grinding to a stop consolidating because russian subs have been chopping up our atlantic supply line weve gotta have more gas jim more food munitions more of everything before those bastards in moscow can organize a counter attack more battles in history have been lost by overextended supply lines than for any other reason the russians are stuck too general snow is neutral the hell it is for the russians it comes with mothers milk maybe sir but the fact of the matter is they are digging in for the moment freeman nodded pulling up his coat collar and tightening his belt as he walked unhurriedly in the pouring rain to the plane stuck but for how long jim russias vast all right but their supply problems are still not as rough as ours we can blow up their rail tracks they fix them we blow them up again they can use horses to haul supplies if necessary but we have to cross an ocean deep in thought the general walked up the stairs to the plane you know the greatest surprise in this war jim whats that general all the experts said that there would never be trench warfare again because it would be a war of mobility the fastestmoving war men had ever seen fact is soldiers have never been worn out physically and mentally as fast before all because of this mobility at this point in history both sides are exhausted colonel norton thought it impolitic to remind the general of what he had said earlier about stress being an excuse for cowardice geniuses he figured had the right to be inconsistent weve got to surprise them jim somehow we have to merlin proffered norton referring to the plan the general had been working on a plan so secret that only he norton and his g knew about it freeman shook his head our boys arent ready yet jim god knows im not known for overcaution but wed only have one shot at it besides its a lastditch scenario dont want to use it until i absolutely have to first lets try to untie this logjam in korea beat the chinese and north koreans back over the yalu if we do that we can take pressure off our boys around brest while our jokers figure out what the hell is going on with our convoys something screwy going on with the russian subs well he sighed at least the russians dont seem to know im over here no sir flying over the east seas going to be the most restful part of the trip good i sure as hell could use the sleep as the general buckled up the boeings jets screaming into high pitch norton was called up to the communications console moments later he walked back through the eerily lit alley of winking consoles and computers and handed freeman a top secret message of unconfirmed gas attacks by pla communist chinese forces against several south korean positions across the yalu chapter thirty the twinfinned mig a nato designation fulcrum a was not only top of its class some nato pilots believed it to be the best fighter in the world smaller than the tomcat more powerful than the f in ready rooms all along the nato front allied pilots held that were the soviets allowed time to produce enough of them the allies would no longer have the edge in the european war sergei marchenko holder of the order of lenin hero of the soviet union and distinguished flying medal for his actions both at fulda gap at the wars beginning and later over the aleutians where his mig flogger d had downed among others frank shirers f tomcat and where in turn marchenko himself had been downed snatched from the freezing bering sea with only moments to spare was known by sight to all civilian and military personnel at the huge khabarovsk air base yet he was not liked there was a hardness about him that was offputting a brutal streak some said but as a pilot it was said he had no equal in a world of hightech millisecond avionics marchenkos fame his ability to make splitsecond decisions and his extraordinary skill at handling the fulcrum had spread throughout the armed services not only was he recognized as a natural in the air but it was common knowledge that despite the best possible connections in moscow he had proven himself as an ordinary soldier in the blood and dust of the boynya abattoirof fulda gap where the sun itself had been obscured by the massive clouds of exhaust dust and shellfire from the massed american and russian armor locked in battle and even those who saw the killer too often in his eyes acknowledged that unlike the sons of other important men he had not placed himself within the highly protected walls of the kremlin in the stavkas hq as an officer but had volunteered for frontline duty in the far eastern tvd despite this he remained a loner occasionally sociable in the mess and ready room but always holding something in reserve the cold hard streak which some claimed verged on the sadistic didnt show itself however until he was in aerial combat among the ground crew he was known as nemignuvshiyno blinka reference to the story that had been passed on from his training days after hed moved out of the twoseater l jet trainers at the yuri gagarin academy qualifying for migs at the gagnon higher aviation academy they had been readying for an air race at the end of the course to test them before they could go on to fly the topoftheline fighters the test in migs involved a lowlevel half roll and loop then a return to level flight over the academys airfield prior to receiving the coveted wings to go with the green ca shoulder boards before the race the pilots six of them including sergei marchenko had walked as was customary through the maneuvers on the chalk lines outside the academys glassandcement tower even then one of the instructors had remarked on marchenkos total concentration while the other cadets occasionally glanced at one another to see how the others were doing indulging in a joke or two as they slowed the walk to avoid near misses the six went up moving off two at a time the migs tumansky rs on full afterburner swing wings at sixteen degrees the migs gaining altitude retracting landing gear extending the dorsal fin and spreading wings to fortyfive degrees the fighters formed a sixplane perfect diamond performed one thundering lowlevel pass over the field separated and climbed for the tenthousandfoot ceiling the training video camera in each plane mounted beneath the sight for later replay already whirring the instructors in the tower listening closely to the chatter for any sign of hesitancy all six migs then came in for the low roll under mach but in excess of six hundred miles per hour where a splitsecond mistake would put them into the ground they came out of the half roll in unison and were into the second half of a loop there was a cry from one of the pilots at the apogee of the roll the instructors shouted correction from the tower came too late the mig a ball of fire in the birch trees on the eastern edge of the runway in that moment as the videotapes of the remaining five planes later showed only one pilot sergei marchenko hadnt looked down at the crash but in that instant had exerted maximum throttle and won zipping up his g suit marchenko said nothing as the other pilots on the mission talked animatedly among themselves most he noticed strictly observing the ritual of zipping up either right or left boot first to marchenko it didnt matter their rituals to him were those of juvenile superstitions of talismans lucky numbers obsessions held as tightly as american baseball players who an instructor had once told him often favored the same pair of socks or undershirt as being lucky for their game marchenko viewed such rituals with the same contempt as he did belief in god it was all voodoo the only belief one could rely on was the belief in oneself in ones own precision and ability the best talisman being the sure knowledge that you could do it and win marchenko saluted his ground crew captain the man barely visible in the dim red night light by the planes ladder and lowered himself into the fulcrums cockpit pulling on the skull cap followed by his darkvisored helmet and a metamorphosis took place man is a natural killer his father had told him regrettable but true the best warriors knew this caldwell the australian ace who in world war ii shot german pilots in their parachutes after hed let one go and seen the german kill his best friend the next day knew it and so did the great american aces of the vietnam war there was no glamour there was only precision and death in the fulcrum his precision and the cruel beauty of the mikoyan fighter met and fused as one he could perform a hammerhead stalltail slide under a mere three thousand feet then go straight and he meant straight into an eightyfive degree climb the combined eighteenthousandpound thrust of the twin tumansky rds shifting the metallic honeycombed and plastic composite machine from reduce thrust to idle back to flat out without the engines so much as missing a beat for marchenko the fulcrums thrustweight ratio greater than one was velichestvennoesublimeand it made the fulcrum not only a superb fighter but an ideal interceptor as well his fulcrum a large painted on the starboard jets box intake with its slogan ubiytsa yanki yankee killernext to the bluebeige winged insignia of the mikoyangurevich design bureau rose with the eight other migs into the zero visibility above vladivostok crossing the sovietchinese border heading south over chinas northeasternmost province of heilongjiang en route to the planned intercept of the americanfighterprotected believed to be carrying the american general douglas freeman strict radio silence was observed no active radar which might be picked up by us fighter cover over the sea of japan was permitted only passive radar could be used to receive advance warning of the american presence the american fighters marchenko knew would no doubt be doing the same but once contact with them was made six of the fulcrums would peel off to the southeast to engage the largest group of the american fighter cover the remaining three fulcrums marchenko leading would ignore all else staying low in the sea scatter in hope of hiding themselves from american radar their sole target the largest blip recorded by vladivostok control the latter coordinating the sovietchinese ground radar network as well as the offshore buoymounted radar once they picked up the vladivostok center would send a burst transmission vectoring the s position relative to the fulcrums only nearing the vectored point of intercept would the migs lookdown shootdown radar with a range of sixtyseven miles be turned on for the attack climbing then diving at mach over three thousand kilometers per hour loaded with six pylonmounted alamo airtoair missiles apiece and fully drummed thirtymillimeter gun beneath the left wing marchenkos fulcrum and the other two following him in arrowhead formation would close the sixtyseven miles to the in two minutes plus or minus fifteen seconds only then marchenko had told the other two pilots would each planes irst infrared search and tracking dome mounted high on the starboard side of the fulcrums nose be switched on to pick up the s exhaust lest the boeings formidable jamming capability scramble any of the fulcrums avionics including the multimode nose radar and the sirena radar warning receivers it was and eleven seconds when vladivostoks ground station four on the jilin provinceussr border reported a cluster of aircraft rising from matsue japan heading across the east sea at twenty thousand feet and traveling at mach the operators opined that though these aircraft were traveling at only seven hundred miles per hour they were possibly a fighter umbrella protecting a larger blip traveling at mach accompanied by three smaller aircraft farther south of the first group eit plus or minus fourteen minutes the nine fulcrums peeled off to engage not doubting for a moment that what ground radar four had seen were american fighters going slowly to keep pace with the boeing what they did not realize was that the burst message they received from vladivostok control was immediately picked up by two of the fiftyman crew manning the consoles aboard the big footlong boeing jet and that via satellite bounce the positions of both groups of fulcrums the six coming straight for the american fighters and the three others on the deck staying on course for the were being plotted by the americans then for both sides the fighter pilots nightmare happened the first crack then rumble of one of several electrical storms fractured the air above the sea of japan with a splitting that began to play havoc with the sophisticated avionics of both the hunters and the hunted the only hope was that in between electrical surges a quick fix on the opposition might be possible aboard the boeing commander of the aircraft frank shirer was immediately alerted to the presence of bogeys the battle staff correctly assuming and he concurred that the six soviet fighters too fast to be chinese were peeling off to engage the f tomcats farther north while three whod been trying to hide in the scatter were the strikers now climbing fast toward him while the bigger american formation would have no choice but to engage the six fulcrums damn it said shirer glancing over at his copilot i wish to hell i was in two oh three my old f id give those bastards a run for their money without any armament the electronics of the having taken up all available space shirer felt naked then it started to rainlike a cow peeing on a flat rock announced freeman hes cool commented the copilot as freeman left the cabin hes not driving said shirer in the rear of the jim norton looked ill he tried to hide it but he was a whiteknuckled flier at the best of times and the storm was terrifying jim said freeman i ever tell you bout the time i was in louisiana bunch of us on leave dressed in civvies went into this greasy spoon bill fryer was with us you know bill hundred and first airborne no said norton and he didnt care well said freeman this white waiter ambles up takes one look at bill and says we dont serve coloreds here everyones struck dumb cept johnny morgan my g at the time quick as a flash johnny looks from bill fryer to the waiter and says but hes a king no shit says the waiter and toddles off manager comes down and now bill fryers sitting there like hes king farouk and were all going along with it kowtowing your majesty this your majesty that managers as obsequious as a pimp on a slow day apologies galore sos the waiter by now what can they do for us et cetera et cetera so we stay and have a big meal all the time we keep up the act treating bill like hes a goddamned royal the lurched violently norton closed his eyes well continued freeman just as were about to leave the waiter comes down with the bill all smiles looks at bill fryer and says we aint never had a king here before know what bill fryer says no shit norton shook his head freeman laughed so loud norton felt obliged to offer a weak smile convinced by the turbulence and the oncoming soviet fighters that it might be the last joke hed ever hear chapter thirtyone from the train david brentwood looked out on the rolling green hills of west englands herefordshire he thought it the most beautiful country hed ever seen and as the train passed on through hayonwye over the englishwelsh border winding its way between the brooding black mountains deep into brecknockshire toward brecon at the foot of the two windswept mountains known as the beacons slowly and inexorably everything changed for david it was as if he had been in this place before it wasnt only the smell of the fresh winter air the earthy dampness that reminded him of the wet winters in the pacific northwest in washington and oregon but the wild beauty of the place the windriven hillsides of flattened grasses spoke to him as they did to few others on that train though brought up by his mother in the protestant faith which viewed god in deeply personal ways david could not believe as she did the suffering of children the death of lili how could there be any good in that we all have to die his mother would say the timing and circumstance of it david are only things we fret about so long as we see this life as all there is was this war all there was he wondered if so then winning it seemed more important than ever before for in mourning lilis death hed realized in a way he never had before how short life really was it had been a thing his parents and grandparents had always told him an old persons cliche repeated to the young so many times it became nothing more than a bore because inside him there had been the secret belief of all youth that they would not die at least not before their time a time which in their own minds was always secure and far in the future for a moment he had doubts about volunteering for the sas force if this life was such a transitory thing why bother because he answered himself corny as he knew it might sound to others he believed it was right to fight evil if you didnt then people like lili melissa damn her would live in a far worse world a world where there could be no honor no love only subservience to the kind of brutality hed seen as a child the day the newscasts had shown the communists crushing the movement for democracy with tanks in tiananmen square as the train carrying him thelman and the other ninetysix volunteers who had been interviewed for the sas training program pulled into brecon david looked up again at the grasscovered sandstone slopes the sweeping line of the high hills broken now and then by woods of gnarled trees deformed by the wind and cottages that had looked picturesque from the distance but which now appeared to be deserted and rundown high above the threethousandfoot beacons buzzards circled ever patient waiting he presumed for any of the blackfaced sheep grazing on the steep slopes to fall still the scene did not depress him and inhaling the fresh mountain air he closed his eyes the better to impress it upon his memory as a new beginning a place that whatever happened would always be close to his heart perhaps it was not so much the place at all but that it was a new place where he might regain the old surety of action hed known before the nerveshattering experience of pyongyang and stadthagen a new beginning you okay asked thelman fine said david it was the first time thelman had seen his old buddy of parris island days smile since theyd left france aboard the overnight hovercraft the channel still blocked by the massive explosion that had closed it in the first weeks of the war when a spets cell one of them posing as a crosschannel truck driver had set off the bomb that had collapsed the two main tunnels concussion killing most of those in transit the north sea pouring in and drowning the rest nice little town remarked thelman somebody told me wales was full of slag heaps well theyre not here replied david he had no inkling that within fortyeight hours he would hate the place cursing the moment he had agreed to try out as the english captain smythe had so casually put it yet the beginning of his time at sas gave no hint of how quickly he would feel hed made a mistake for at first it wasnt at all like parris island or camp lejeune indeed when he first stepped out of the train he and all the others had been struck by an angelic singing male voices in a harmony he wouldnt have believed possible outside of the mormon tabernacle choir voices raised singing ancient welsh hymns it did sound like how green was my valley as david looked around at the other ninetyodd volunteers he saw unit badges from every kind of regiment including several dutch and german troops sappers to engineers even a seabee and at least six men from the coldstream guards all brought to a standstill by a chorus they could hear somewhere beyond the station even thelman though an avid fan of what davids father the admiral would have described as moron thump stood on the station platform listening in rapt attention concert in town one of the volunteers asked the sas regimental sergeant major who turned up to greet them no the rsm replied his quiet welsh accent surprising to david cymru versus the barbarians thelman and brentwood looked at one another in bewilderment football interjected a captain called cheekdawson wearing the coveted beige sas beret with the bluewinged dagger above the emblem who dares wins welsh against the english he explained the singing you hear needless to say is coming from the welsh supporters if they lose i daresay well hear a pretty decent requiem ah said one of the sappers a hispanic american name tag bartroli soccer right no no man said the rsm his tone goodnatured but intent on correction nevertheless not that sissy business this is rugby more like american football right sarmajor said cheekdawson goodnaturedly without the ruffles replied the rsm ruffles challenged thelman all that padding wonder you dont kill yourselves then retorted thelman it happens said the rsm all right lads into the trucks with kit reception at senny bridge in he glanced at his watch half an hour fourteen hundred thelman reminded brentwood of the joke theyd heard at parris island about the first intake of women into the marine corps getting it all wrong when the female di said shed give them twenty minutes to get ready for kit inspection brentwood fell silent remembering the last time hed heard the story was from the british sergeant whod been murdered along with lili on the train to liege an australian listening in to the joke as the trucks pulled away from brecon station laughed so loud thelman thought hed fall off the tailgate heard the one about the kangaroo and the priest asked the aussie no said brentwood the aussie was talking to them as if hed known them all his life he didnt get to tell them his joke however as they were passing the football ground and a surge of welsh patriotism mainly the voices of old men most of the young ones having been drafted filled the truck with such emotion that men whod never heard of rugby were moved you play that in australia dont you asked david yeah but australian rules mainly said the aussie australian rules put in cheekdawson with good cheer i should have thought that an oxymoron what dya mean said the aussie moron ah i meant a contradiction in terms explained cheekdawson you know australians and rules no offense meant the aussie grinned none taken mate the names mick mick lewis they say that with a name like that im halfirish and halfwelsh but i cant sing a bloody note the first hour was like that informal the distinction between officer nco and other ranks not paid anywhere like the attention it received elsewhere particularly in the british forces where class differences readily became recognizable to even the most recent arrival from overseas it was different too from parris island which surprised david and thelman and no doubt many of the other american recruits no dis screaming hysterically at you treating you like dirt even before you got off their bus and david couldnt imagine a regular british officer elsewhere joking with the australian there certainly wouldnt have been any apology so readily offered shortly after they arrived at the sas hq at senny bridge eight miles west of brecon the headquarters having been moved forty miles west of hereford on the english side because of soviet rocket attacks the brecon beacons were covered in deep fastmoving shadows and then brilliant sunlight a dabbledy day said the rsm as he jumped down from the jeep leading the threetonners and looked up at the jumbled sky all right then lads columns of three tallest left and right smallest in the middle shake a leg major rye an officer in his midforties with slightly graying hair and a broad friendly face dressed in beret camouflagepattern battle dress smock and trousers came out to welcome them they were all volunteers from every branch of the services their reasons for volunteering as varied as the men themselves some bored with life in the line regiments which because of the slowdown in supplies occasioned by convoy losses were now forced to dig in and wait others no doubt were escaping domestic entanglements of one kind or other and some had volunteered because they as young men some of them children at the time had been electrified as was the whole world by the riveting spectacle of the first sas public appearance there had been rumors that an elite force called the special air service had existed but the first time the world knew the rumors were right was on may in london in operation nimrod the sas counterterrorist team covered head to toe in what was to become their telltale black uniform wearing cs gas masks which also protected their identity attacked and with astonishing speed ended in front of the worlds tv cameras a sixday twentyonehostage drama in the iranian embassy the attack combining sheercliff mountaineering abseiling stun grenades and perfect hk mps submachinegun kill shots at close range in crowded rooms was so fast the iranian terrorists literally didnt know what hit them though this constituted the first public view of the sas the special air service had already been operating for over thirty years ever since being formed from an oddbod collection of commando enthusiasts who wreaked such havoc behind the enemy line in the western desert destroying over of rommels german aircraft and vast quantities of oil and ammunition that adolf hitler issued a personal order to the wermacht regarding the sas that these men are dangerous they must be hunted down and destroyed at all costs after the second world war the sas had carried on its covert service of british foreign policy involving them in everything from the malayan communist emergency to joining the west german counterterrorist csg in the hostagerescue attack against the hijacked lufthansa airliner on the airstrip at mogadishu in somalia the fierce gun battle there lasted for more than seven minutes but the success of the operation only one hostage was wounded and not fatally was due once again to the extraordinary speed and accuracy of the assault during which every terrorist aboard was hit in the first bursts of the commandos gunfire and then there were the audacious and devastating night raids in the falklands war and later deep inside iraq against saddam husseins airfields chapter thirtytwo over the sea of japan shirer nosed the down toward the thick cumulonimbus at fifteen thousand seeking protection of zero visibility against the three breakaway fighters the s overthehorizon radar showing the bogeys were now only sixty miles away active radars on and coming in arrowhead formation for interdiction at a thousand miles per hour almost certainly mig fulcrums shirer knew the f tomcats that would try to protect his were good on afterburner over a hundred miles an hour faster than the fulcrums but as an ace he also knew the old rule still held with the gizmology being more or less equal over sixty percent of all kills in dogfights went to only the top six percent of pilots as the entered the cloud in the pitch darkness the three fulcrums now only forty miles away shirer called through to the comco countermeasures control officer compute distance from vladivostok to here and back approx the comcos cray computer had it in four seconds return journey plus or minus one thousand miles captain i say again miles as if reading shirers mind the officer had already computed the fulcrums combat radius of plus or minus eleven hundred kilometers against the distance from vladivostok and the arithmetic projection was clear the fulcrums could make it to interdiction and back to vladivostok but it would leave them little time for the attack their wing commander must certainly have taken this into account comcos conclusion quickly relayed to shirer was that the fulcrums were probably hauling drop tanks for extended range even so shirer knew that during an attack the bogeys would at some point have to jettison the drop tanks even if they hadnt used all of the fuel from them in order to reduce weight and so engage the tomcats at maximum speed this would force the russians fuel consumption to jump to eighteen times normal suckthrough rate in four minutes on full war power each fulcrum would guzzle more than thirty percent of its entire fuel load shirer flicked on his mike freedom one to angel leader do you read me angel leader acknowledged the tomcat pilot go ahead fire fox one at each bogey repeat fire fox one at each bogey the rio radar intercept officer behind the pilot in each tomcat wondered what in hell shirer was up to very soon each of their fox one airtoair radarhoming sparrow missiles would be ready the fastclosing fulcrums within range but why they wondered fire now allowing the bogeys to have at least ten to fifteen seconds to jinx their way out of it particularly when the fulcrum was so highly maneuverable but orders were orders all three rios in the tomcats going to warning yellow weapons hold status each of the rios straining to hear the tone alert a low growl in their earpiece telling them the missile was fully armed and ready for launch back in the generals compartment col jim norton was ill the continuing its hairraising fortydegree dive buffeted by so much turbulence the whole plane seemed to be rattling to pieces norton convinced his stomach was now in his chest or was it the other way around blocking his breathing glistening in the reddedout combat lighting of the aircraft the droplets of sweat on his forehead looked like hundreds of tiny rubies now dont you worry about it jim freeman assured him that boy up in front is gonna put this bird down in seoul in no time norton couldnt speak unable even to articulate his terror the veins in his hands standing out like dark strings as he clenched the armrests eyes discombobulated mouth parchmentdry his heart thumping rapidly doubly mortified at exhibiting such fright in front of freeman and painfully conscious again of the great and terrible divide between a civilian aircraft and a military one here the noise was at once thunderous and screaming as it fell through the blackness the nausea indescribable in its clammy dizziness overtaking him in a suffocating net fix your eye on something middistance jim freeman instructed him helps keep your balance it was the stupidest goddamn thing the colonel had ever heard freeman utter there wasnt anything fixed everything was spinning out of control christ he wished the general would just shut up and let him die in the tomcats the radar intercept officers got the tone alert master arm on announced the tomcat leader centering up the t bogeys twentyone miles centering the dot fox one fox one the next rush of conversation between the angel pilots and their rios surged with static and was full of overlay so that it was difficult for shirer to know exactly who was speaking battling with the yoke in heavy turbulence at ten thousand feet he heard his copilot yelling there they go the exhaust of the pound american missiles lighting the clouds nearby in a momentary and astonishingly beautiful peach glow and then six seconds later a fast broken chorus of good kill good kill shoot him havent got a fucking tone shoot him shoot christ said shirers copilot seeing a blip on the boeings radar screen disintegrating they got one of ours shirer was fighting to keep the boeing in the steep dive slipping farther away from the point of intercept the babble of the tomcats now interspersed with russian unichtozhit unichtozhitfinish him off finish him off lock him up lock him up a tomcat pilot was yelling to his rio then good kill good kill the rio yelling bogey missile two oclock high two o jesus behind shirer at the consoles chaff and wide infraredband flares were being jettisoned to confound the fulcrums missile which the comco saw wasnt aimed at the tomcats but was streaking toward the at over twentyone hundred miles an hour the console operator his body at a down angle of thirty degrees face bathed in perspiration fought with everything he had to maintain control of the scrambler beam he was coning in on the incoming missile any wider cone and he would interfere with the avionics in the tomcats the russian missile a quarter mile away curled hard left and exploded an amber blossom on the s console screen seconds later the shock wave and debris hit the boeing and shirer saw the warning light for the starboard two engine flashing its intake fouled temperature soaring he shut it down but still kept diving hard to port down toward the sea as long as there were bogeys in the area he wanted to get down low where the boeings upwardlooking radar could pinpoint the attackers for electronic countermeasures but where the fulcrums downwardlooking radar would be confounded in an electronic haze of sea scatter bogey contact shirer heard from somewhere high above him in the night sky judy at ten oclock splash it told shirer that one of the two remaining fulcrums was down one to go came an exhilarated cry angel leader to angel two thats it break off let him go aw shit let him go repeated the tomcat leader cover the big bird thats our job you see any eject asked the second tomcat pilot negative sergei marchenko didnt know who the pilot of freemans boeing was but whoever it had been he knew his business the boeing was lost and all that he was getting on his radar screen was the leaping frying static of sea clutter like a television set gone haywire and in the dogfight hed used up so much fuel he knew it was opasnoe delotouch and goas to whether hed make it back to vladivostok let alone khabarovsk and he suspected that one of the tomcats rotarybarreled twentymillimeter cannons might have taken a chunk out of the fuselage covering his nose landing wheel there was no warning light on but air speed indicated there was a drag somewhere and even if the hydraulics hadnt been hit the tomcats short burst had made a hole somewhere big enough to slow him down he punched in the coordinates for vladivostok return the computer telling him hed be on empty fifty to a hundred miles before depending on headwinds he jettisoned his remaining r alamo airtoair missile which made him pounds lighter fate willing this might just do the trick alert yet fatigued from the combat in which he had downed one of the fs he thought for a moment of alexsandra of her long dark hair the slow way she unpinned it before they made love if he got back he was going to see her again and to hell with nefski there was nothing gentle about his desire for her no sense of protecting her from nefski or himself only the sheer drive after having cheated death once more to have her with all the force he could muster but first hed have to fill out a zayavlenie o poteryanom imushchestvelostproperty reportexplaining on the prosaic gray form why hed dumped millions of rubles worth of airtoair radarhoming missile well he asked himself what did they want a top ace in far eastern command or an easily replaceable missile as the boeing still miles away below the radar screen approached the south korean east coast fs were leaving taegu in the south to look for it while in seoul the aides of freemans hastily assembled advance staff waited anxiously for word of whether or not the had made it and if so whether the general was still alive shirer maintained total radio silence as he continued over the sea beginning his climb off yongdok to cross over the sixthousandfoothigh hump of the taebaek range then descending still on three engines over the western lowlands out over inchon using up gasoline fuel gauges showing a leak in the left wing tanks the gas vaporizing streaming along on the portside fuselage shirer wanted only enough kerosene left to land and was too careful a pilot to consider himself as good as home as he let the boeings nose dip then lift as he approached kimpo field the foamed airstrip rushing at him in the night like a long streak of shaving cream neither ground control shirer nor his copilot able to tell from visual flyover whether the landing wheels were fully extended the warning lights blinking but erratic his handling was as perfect as a pilot could make it under the conditions but not until after he heard the banshee scream of the engines as he applied the brakes enough to control the skid in the fireretardant foam then shut the engines down was he satisfied freeman was the first man in the cockpit wearing a broad grin shirer was slightly disappointed the least the general could have done was to have been as scared as most everybody else on the plane you said you missed combat flying major freeman said hell i bet thats the best damn sortie youve flown shirer smiled politely and felt the generals firm congratulatory handshake for a job well done by god said the general im going to recommend you and your copilot for a decoration shirer knew immediately it was one of those moments that might never come again general sir may i make a request shoot well sir i know ive been seconded to fly air force one vips but permission denied major said freeman but without rancor and as dispassionately as his gratitude for shirers outstanding flying would allow you ordered those tomcats to fire missiles when the enemy was barely in range why was that there was a spurt of air traffic control talk from kimpo tower and shirer hit the squelch button shrugging with professional nonchalance thing to do general figured they must be carrying drop tanks given the return distance to vladivostok and before theyd go into action theyd drop em those tanks weigh you down a ton general reduce speed down to well like i say i figured if we got away a few sparrows at em theyd have to start maneuvering pretty damn quick otherwise theyd be blown out of so you forced em to drop the tanks cut in freeman dump a whole bunch of fuel reduce their attack time to hell and gone yes said shirer matteroffactly that was the idea why do you ask sir freeman shook his head but it was a gesture not of incredulity but of admiration shirer you realize how many jockeys would have thought of that and as fast as you did only a combat pilot look ill give it to you plain and simple i know youre not as happy on board this airborne bunker as everyone here thinks you are right shirers answer was tight with passion sir i wasnt trained to run away from migs my job my whole reason for sir my jobs to splash em thats what im paid for not to youre paid to do what youre told request for retransfer to fighter command denied if everything suddenly goes to hell in a handbasket and the president has to go up in his taj mahal i cant think of a better man to be driving it shirers jaw clenched yes sir shirer saluted freeman who returned the salute and moved out of the cockpit colonel norton standing outside by the first console with a goofy grin in stunned wonder at his deliverance he hadnt stopped shaking but was looking about the plane as if seeing it for the first time as if god had descended aides from seoul hq were now pouring into the aircraft suddenly freeman turned back to look at shirer still strapped into the pilots seat his shirt soaked with sweat major sir shirers tone was militarily correct but bordering on carrier sulk the kind of pretantrum doginthemanger mope that carrier pilots went into when the deck boss for whatever reason grounded them how long do you think itll take them to fix this bird up no idea general said shirer indicating the copilot who was in dreamland over the possibility of a decoration from the legendary freeman ah began the copilot ah three to four days sir if were lucky maybe more theres the engine leaking gas wing patch all right said freeman impatiently holding up his hand to thwart the copilots apparently endless list and looking back now at shirer if we can get you a fighter you can keep your hand in until this bird is ready shirers face was transformed a schoolboy flush now just hold your horses freeman warned him first i need to know he stopped goddamn it im the supreme commander korea with that he shouted above the bevy of aides air force liaison me sir richards richards doug richards by god i thought you were dead someone told me you got an assful of shrapnel up around nampo just half an assful general loud laughter filled the plane well richards can we get a tomcat fanything fast enough for this gentleman and i dont mean those ladies around itaewon barracks think i can dig one up sir a plane i mean good because this man wants to shoot communists doesnt like the idea of being fired on without being able to fire back reasonable enough seems to me and by god we can help him partway at least flew cover for us at pyongyang in that case ill guarantee it sir said richards he called through the narrow passageway to shirer see me after debriefing major yes sir said shirer even though richards a captain was a full rank below him making their way out of the plane toward the gangway colonel norton thought it prudent to remind the general that his impetuous ad hoc order to let shirer get his hand back into fighters might not go down well with the pentagon brass whod had him transferred for taj mahal duty hell jim freeman responded dont be such an old woman i know its a risk could lose him but if we dont let a man like that fight he wont get the shame of turning tail out of his system i know exactly how he feels its everything to a warrior that was his job his raison d√™tre he gets a crack or two at those commies over the yalu the next few days hell be back to his old self come back and drive this monster without resentment method in my madness jim the president said norton has specifically ordered us not to antagonize the chinese i mean that goes for our pilots as well as our men on the ground were only supposed to push them back to the manchurian border and thats it not to go over the yalu and let em shoot at us with impunity from the other side said freeman shaking his head with incredulity no jim last time we tried pussyfooting around with those sons of bitches we had our boys freezing to death all along the yalu facing chinese regulars thousands of the bastards sitting across the river and we couldnt fire by presidential decree and our boys died by the bushel no jim he caught his breath in the icy blast that funneled its way up from the tarmac as they started down the steps freeman buttoned up his coat and saluted the assembled dignitaries below dont worry jim itll be all right we are going to launch air reconnaissance patrols in force across the yalu purely reconnaissance you understand course if any son of heaven shows his ass were gonna shoot it off jim weve got to maintain the yalu as a moat if they get close to ushe stopped as he saw the provisional president of south korea rah moving forward to greet him freeman was all smiles and diplomacy thanking the president for his personal greeting and genuinely touched that he had come out himself but freeman was really only interested in general kim the commander in chief of the nka army now recouping and massing troops behind the protection of the north koreanchinese border along the yalu and tamur and attacking mainly at night the most forward american line he was told had collapsed and was now no more than a series of outposts while general creigh continued to fall back to kusong with over percent casualties it had been the worst american retreat anywhere in the war tomorrow morning the south korean president was informing the general we have arranged an official reception mr president freeman interjected i thank you kindly but im afraid i wont be able to attend ill send a representative of course but ill be heading for the front but surely began president rah the general will need to rest with all due respect mr president my boys arent resting on the yalu front my place is with them i thank you all the same and mr president ive been told by president mayne to convey his best wishes to you and madame rah thank you general of course i freemans car had arrived as regulations demanded the s debriefing was attended by shirer the copilot and all console operators as well as by jim norton who joined in watching the boeings infrared video replays of the attack with a strange combination of relish and exhilaration that owed as much to the safety of the underground bunker they were viewing it in as to nortons euphoria at having come so close to death and surviving though he would have been loath to admit it he had never experienced such a high there they are said one of the console operators through the haze of tobacco smoke you were right freddie migs definitely fulcrums another fighter was blurred by the heat wash of the missile it was firing shirer noted hrs registered in the bottom righthand corner of the video frame the time the copilot had told him a missile was inbound hold it shirer called out can you run that back the hazy number on the fuselage under the fulcrums wing was due not only to angle of the s camera but to the fact that the mig had been on full afterburner further blurring the image but running the frame back freezing it and going in with the zoom you could see it was number nine russian cyrillic lettering next to it ubiytsa yanki what the hells that asked one of the operators number nine you hayseed i know that i mean that other crap jimmy jimmy one of the s four russianspeaking intercept operators had nodded off but said he couldnt see because of the guy in front of him they ran back the video he walked up close to the screen come on professor someone urged im thirstier than a um means yankee killer that fuckers mine it was shirers voice unusually profane bit late major someone hollered probably home now in vladivostok giving the missus a bit of surfacetosurface well put in richards the liaison officer theres a good chance youll see him if they send fighters back across the fortieth parallel old buddy or if old freeboot sends you across said someone cant do it countered another operator not allowed says who says the prez thats who shirer glanced at richards through the flickering light cast by the video you serious captain he asked i mean about it being possible wed run up against that mig again hell yes if youre on the eastern corridor patrol from kimpo here to wonsan over on the east coast then the highaltitude run over vladivostok they dont like us taking snapshots of em mind scramble every time thought you werent supposed to cross the yalu well it isnt the yalu is it richards smiled i mean its out to sea a bit right his hand was making a sidewaysslipping motion anyway on occasion we get to fire a few bursts fore we head home with the recon shots that all that happens sometimes we mix it up the two men were silent for a moment the operators cheering the explosion of one of the fulcrums richards waited till the hurrahs died down shouldnt let it get personal though thats dangerous shirer said nothing someone trying to kill you whether you were in a or anywhere else was about as personal as you could get look said richards i dont know how youll react to this but that number nine weve run into him before hes taken out three of our guys already our computer intelligence enemy basepilot profile has him down as an ace whered he get his kills asked shirer western europe or eastern theater both why because ive seen that slogan once before in the aleutians i splashed him well said richards i wouldnt put too much on that i mean the aleutians comes under eastern theater all right but id guess yankee killers bout as common as commie killer on our birds what was your guy flying the guy you took out in the aleutians a fulcrum no did he eject asked richards dont know didnt see could be the same guy conceded richards he sure as hell wouldve needed a new plane right whats his name asked shirer from the printout number nine richards called out to the sergeant in charge of the debriefing records fulcrum out of vladivostok got a handle for us hang on a jiff replied the sergeant yeah mar chenko said richards yeah thats right marchenko he turned to shirer ring a bell shirer shook his head we didnt have time to swap autographs richards laughed well ole buddy you see him again make sure you do tattoo the fucker i will richards added a cautionary note be careful though major whoever he is hes no slouch i know that if hes the same guy who gave me a bath then youre oneall said richards no answered shirer he damn near got me tonight shirer made a face whats that damn smell kimchi said richards sour cabbage koreans love it youll get used to it dont plan on being here that long said shirer chapter thirtythree as sergei marchenkos bulletsplattered fulcrum came in its braking chute deploying less than a hundred feet from the runway puffs of steam could be seen caused by the friction of its front and two side wheels coming in at over a hundred miles an hour onto the icy runway the ground crew were already calling marchenko kot cat nine lives not only had he and his aircraft once again escaped injury this time from the burst of american gunfire from the tomcats escorting the big but his fuel gauge was registering empty when the ground crew rolled it into the hangar his ground captain was already on the phone telling khabarovsks kgb chief nefski that marchenko had survived but that he was lucky the ground captain estimating the fulcrum probably had no more than twenty liters of fuel left he was mistaken there were only ten gallons remaining and so it was that as he stepped out exhausted and disappointed that he had not ne ulovilbaggedthe american general marchenkos legend with one more f to his credit grew even more nefski wasnt pleased about the new accolades for the cat it might make it more difficult for the kgb ace to convince the fighter ace that he should assist them in suborning his girlfriend alexsandra moscow had called nefski yet again within an hour of comrade marchenkos departure pressing him for more information about the sabotage ring nefski was sure that alexsandras brothers and she were involved in at the khabarovsk munitions factory but nefski like marchenko was not a man to panic under pressure in any case he was encouraged by marchenkos honoring his agreement to dine with him at the bear inn one look at the menu and sergei marchenko wished he hadnt come it was all stodgy fattysounding fare what marchenko called eastern siberianby which he disparagingly meant anything east of lake baikal the big favorite apparently was pigs trotters done with a variety of buryat sauces with exotic names most of which sounded to marchenko as if they might be prepared solely to cover the lack of meat if you wish nefski said you may order the vyrezka svininypork tenderloin marchenko scanned the menu there isnt any ah nefski said knowingly and snapped his fingers a waiter scurried over his drooping walrus mustache so prolific that in the dim candlelight he appeared to have no mouth andre began nefski and marchenko burst out laughing not bothering to hide his contempt for the provincial snobbery that would pretend to have a genuine french waiter in khabarovsk the fighter pilots laughter puncturing the respect shown the kgb chief nefskis smile was a forced grin you dont like pork tenderloin i love it well then be glad youre not a jew like that little whore of yours youre jealous not at all ive released her from prison for the time being give her a taste of how it can be for her if she cooperates marchenko was unimpressed what nefski no doubt meant was hed released alexsandra hoping shed lead him to whatever he thought she was involved with obviously she hadnt led him to anything nefski poured the vodka and raised his glass its oily liquid turning to amber in the candlelight to mother russia to mother russia said marchenko it was as natural a toast as next year in jerusalem would be to alexsandra tell your little jew girl that if she doesnt tell us whos involved with the sabotage ring we will put it about how her family changed its jewish name to ingratiate themselves with the soviets and how now that mother russia is at war they have turned on her how they seek to stab her in the back and that youve already put that about said marchenko contemptuously that wont budge her im not finished said nefski but its interesting you say it wont budge her your tone suggests she should be budged i dont approve of sabotage no but if you dont approve its your duty to help tell her if she doesnt cooperate i will have her entire family grandparents everyone all sixteen of them shot marchenko laughed you invite me so you can have your pigs trotters and ask me to pass on your threats why dont you tell her yourself because colonel we have another message for her if she doesnt cooperate well arrest her again and put her in the tranzitnaya kameraholding cell not one of her own you understand he poured another vodka the holding cell is a mixed mag common criminals rapists all three sexes im sure you can inject more concern about that than we ever could nefski raised his glass again mother russia marchenko pushed his glass away his tone low angry leave her alone when she tells us what we want to know perhaps she knows nothing dont be stupid marchenko shes a dirty little jew all the jews know something they cling together like maggots in our belly we have to shit them out he smiled except the ones we want to keep for our amusement of course nefski paused honestly now colonel would you marry one thats not the point ah ha the waiter returned the tenderloin surrounded by small baked potatoes and fresh saut√©ed greens the bread so fresh it was still warm from the oven a long french loaf marchenko was astonished nefski was already attacking the pigs trotters slicing off the crisp bubbling fat consuming it quickly washing it down with more vodka and adroitly mopping the fat that dribbled over his bottom lip look comrade im not going to fuck around with you any longer i try to be nice but being an ace has gone to your head he jabbed his fork laden with fatsoaked bread toward marchenko we are fighting a war down here as well as you are in the air he gobbled the bread and downed another vodka i heard you missed the american therell be more you come to the point readily said nefski turning full onto him how do you mean there wont be any more opportunities for you if you dont convince her to spill her guts marchenko sneered with derision at the threat though his reaction was mitigated somewhat by the tenderloin done to perfection the best hed ever tasted oh said nefski with his interrogators unnerving ability to predict his victims next response you think you are so important i wouldnt dare that daddy would protect you he stopped eating for a moment and wiped his mouth using his thumbnail to push a small sliver of bone from his teeth listen colonel hero i too have connections if push comes to shove we could all get bruised but comrade chernko swings more weight than your father any day of the week are you so stupid not to know that a fighter pilot is important but if the rail lines and munitions keep getting hit your fighter pilotsll have no gasoline with which to fly he pointed his knife at marchenko besides i dont have to bother with any of this official nonsense crawling around cap in hand like we did for a while in gorbachevs time thats all finished my friend he tore off another piece of the baguette you know about lieutenant yablonski never heard of him no because he wasnt around long enough thats why transferred here from the western tvd we asked him to help us too when he was here he didnt so a truck the brakes failed one night on the base you threatening me im telling you a story said nefski mopping up the residual fat marchenko fell silent took another vodka and smiled what if i told you id been wearing a tape recorder nefski belched and wiped his mouth again with the stained napkin dont be childish fighter man youre out of your depth completely he turned to marchenko it is the first thing we check youre bluffing nefski sat back and opened his jacket to reveal a small black box covered with perforated black leather like a transistor radio less than half a cigarette pack in size mike detector he explained standard equipment as necessary to us comrade as oxygen to you when you fly if you fly again nefski closed his coat and resumed eating ive tried to be nice to you but always you want to play the big man so now im telling you hero pilot i give you fortyeight hours if that little cunt of yours doesnt start telling us what we want to know ill let her loose among the other scum theyll fuck her dead and you wont fly again ever ofitsiant waiter sir the walrus was by his side telefon next minute the waiter was frantically unraveling a phone cord like a man readying to abandon ship nefski pushed the phone toward marchenko call your base commander tell him i want to talk to him nefski was still chewing staring at marchenko daring him marchenko dialed and when the base commander came on his tone was terse clipped authoritarian asking marchenko what he wanted nefski grabbed the receiver identifying himself brusquely to the commander then held the receiver far enough away so that marchenko could hear as well the change in the commanders tone upon hearing nefski had been instantaneous marchenko was disgusted the man was senior fighter commander tvd yet his tone was cloyingly subservient nefski smiled and spoke brusquely to the commander i want you in my office within half an hour yes colonel came the response of course ill nefski put down the receiver and stared at marchenko and i want that slut talking in fortyeight hours with that he left marchenko sat the vodka cupped in his hands his eyes fixed on the little oily sea inside the glass and waited for what he thought was nefskis final insult leaving him to pay the bill when it didnt come he called over the waiter to hurry it up but the walrus informed him monsieur there is no bill for colonel nefskis guests oh marchenko said feeling momentarily like a naive schoolboy and grabbing his cap and coat made his way out into the blinding snow he hailed a troika more of them about now that gas rationing was even more severe than normal with the harness bells jingling the outer two horses nostrils flaring the steam of their breath almost instantly frozen to icicles marchenko sat back into the troikas deep embrace pulling down his cap and the collar of his greatcoat and the rough serge blankets up about his ears as the shushing of the snow like the threshing of wheat cut through the silence of the dark streets the old grizzled driver his beard a clump of watery ice snapped the whip driving marchenko fast toward the jewish sector chapter thirtyfour thank you all for coming said sas major rye his voice surprisingly soft so much so that brentwood in the third row of the platoon could barely hear him as usual we like to bring you in on a monday rye continued so those who wont be staying with us can rejoin their units next weekend the aussie put up his hand yes mr lewis asked rye quietly the australian was as surprised as everybody else that the major knew his name straight off and mr lewis stone the crows said lewis you blokes dont waste any time whats your question mr lewis asked rye politely you mean the course is only a week long asked the aussie no replied rye again not as if he were answering an nco or other rank but speaking to lewis more as an equal a member of the same sports team there were obviously no lords and others entrances to sas cricket grounds the course explained rye normally takes several months naturally weve had to streamline this to a matter of weeks because of the difficulties over the water but most of you have already gone through some sort of specialist training in part i do emphasize in part however as a prerequisite for volunteering for sas tryout you must have all seen action and be considered mature we are not looking for nor do we want young men who either have not been under fire or who have what we deem to be romantic notions of combat in all our screening process allows us to reduce the course to five weeks including a sort out first week he paused for more questions sir thelman asked are we being trained for any specific missions yes and no thats bloody helpful said lewis the major had no difficulty hearing even if he spoke softly it means lewis that if you and your colleagues succeed you will form a pool or i should say add to a pool albeit a relatively small one from which we can draw from time to time should we receive specific requests but as it is a small pool and only those of you who pass tryout will learn the organizational structure necessitated by our limited number we are rather particular about what requests we respond to in short if we think they can be handled by line regiments we say so our intention here quite frankly is to be the unit of last resort we do what others say cant be done or is overfraught with risk we do not counsel immodesty gentlemen but i think it fair to say sas has a long and i believe distinguished tradition youll hear more of that as you proceedif you proceed the major paused to make sure everyone was giving his full attention lewis didnt understand some of the words the major was using but most poms he concluded were like that all sounded like theyd swallowed a bloody dictionary anyway lewis got the general drift one of the things well be looking for in the first week continued major rye is what we call crossover ability our basic unit is a fourman one in which each man is a generalist but also a specialist in a particular field so that should you be on a sticky op you will have the ability to step into one anothers shoes as it were and quickly first week however will be devoted to weeding out those of you who are not up to it you will discover this yourselves i want it clearly understood that there is absolutely no stigma for failing sass first phase youve been chosen because youre the best in your own regiments but we do aspire to the very best and physical fitness forms the basis though by no means all of the criteria rye paused his gaze casual yet at the same time searching one more thing chaps if and when you return to your units after this week or later after youve served with us and can no longer cut the mustard as our american cousins would say we do expect absolute secrecy about sas methods and organization if you do not keep it to yourself we will kill you sarmajor sir responded the rsm saluting briskly and turning the platoon platoon dismissed charming said lewis while making up his bunk david brentwood and thelman taking the second and third tier respectively bloody charming well ill give the old bastard one thing he gives it to you straight the aussie drew over the blue military blanket tucking it tightly beneath the mattress still cant be too bad ive done canungra whats that asked thelman folding his kit bag aussie dope oh spare me said lewis pulling out his khaki tshirt and socks from the chocolatecolored bag canungra in aussie jungle warfare school dont you blokes know anything its a real bastard there im tellin ya lewis dropped his blanket snakes this fuckin long and this small one bite and youre a gonerless you got the old razor and condies crystals into the wound dont see any snakes around here said david eh dont come the raw prawn with me mate you know what i mean these bloody hills are nothin compared to jungle got nothin but a few bloody sheep on em could run over em which is precisely what lewis and the other ninetyseven volunteers did the next morning without breakfast at am loaded up in the freezing darkness aboard the threeton lorries the trucks dropping them off at quartermile intervals between senny bridge and brecon on a twelvemile front each man having been issued a waterproof storm suit regulation sas bergen rucksack loaded with twentyfive pounds of bricks a tenpound rifle a map of brecon beacons national park compass and yelled out to him by the rsm a sixdigit number for the latitude and longitude instructions to reach an abandoned chapel at merthyr tydfil fifteen miles from the beacons as the crow flew but much longer up the beacons north face and down the southern side the only other order given them before they left was not to make notations anywhere on the map an enemy could use the pencil marks to backplot they were to reach merthyr tydfil by hours any later and they were out in the pitch blackness of that morning it was minus five degrees when each of the ninetyeight men began his private trial heading across rainswollen creeks and sodden slippery slopes up toward the beacons for the first two hours many of the men made good time but by hours the crest of the beacons buffeted by sixtykilometerperhour winds and aswirl in a snowstorm several men were wandering blind by noon only seventeen had made it to merthyr tydfil most of these troopers from the coldstream guards regiment twentyodd more a number of them close to hypothermia despite the storm units straggled in around hours all totally exhausted and near frozen because they had not packed the storm suit properly in the rucksack preventing zippers from being fully closed allowing the rucksacks to become sodden the damp transmitted to the storm suits small details but sas captain cheekdawson knew they could be deadly mistakes on an op and none of them escaped cheekdawsons eye or that of the rsm david brentwood staggered in at only twenty minutes to spare lewis fifteen minutes behind him and thelman barely making it falling against the chapel door followed in by an angry flurry of snow cheekdawson was looking disgustingly dapper in full battle dress patiently waiting as lewis flopped to the floor it was several minutes before he could speak he nudged david when did lord cheek get here ten fortyfive said one of the engineers he and one of the scots guards bullshit said lewis must have got a ride the engineer shook his head no he was dropped off from the truck just before me bugger kept me going yelling at me come on swain put your back into it come on swain no loafing real pain in the bum i can tell you that your name asked lewis barely able to prop himself up on his elbows swain yeah mate why how the hell can they remember all our names cause they bloody like us said swain they do their homework said another man eyes shut stretched out on the cold dusty floor of the longdisused chapel know us all bettern our muvvers they do im starving said lewis opened me bloody pack and you know what i found bricks said brentwood yeah said lewis fuckin bricks and they number the bastards thats thelman began but had to stop for lack of wind he looked close to total collapse his bloodshot eyes in stark contrast to his black skin he accepted the water bottle offered him by the rsm and continued his explanation they number the bricks a guy told me cause they have to account for them thats right said a cockney accent the man wearing a coldstream guards patch which surprised thelman hed always thought from their pictures that the tall bearskinhatted guardsmen would speak in an upperclass accent see continued the guardsman ministry of supplys very touchy about losing bricks there was a ripple of tired laughter sarmajor asked cheekdawson hands akimbo on his battle dress smock how many still out six sir very good call the back markers on the blower and let them go in and round them up they dont find them by fifteen hundred hours better call brecon police station army and air force mountain rescue yes sir professional pride counseled against calling in army or raf mountain search to help the back markers but cheekdawson was obliged to do so two men having died from exposure several months before the six men who were still out it was understood by all would be returning to their regiments as would anyone else who wandered into the disused chapel after hours when the final tally was in fortythree out of the ninetyeight volunteers had already failed phase one and would be returning to their units not bad sarmajor said cheekdawson cheerily his bonhomie somehow making the mustysmelling chapel even more depressing and cold just over half made it said the sarmajor quite jesus lewis told thelman who had made the silly mistake of taking his boots off at this rate well all be dead by sunset david agreed he was astonished that was the only word for it at the sudden change of weather and drop in temperature on the brecon beacons and at the equally sudden hatred he now held for any lyrical notion hed had about wales wales was where you died and youd volunteered for it everyone he noticed was complaining bitterly of hunger righto chaps said cheekdawson youve not done too badly given the rapid change in weather conditions now all hand in your maps and then well have a spot of lunch thats bloody more like it said lewis im for that good man lewis we like initiative first in line then map lewis unzipped the chest pocket that served as an extra thermal layer extracted the folded map and handed it to cheekdawson the rsm had poured two cups of steaming hot coffee oh dear said cheekdawson oh dear what said lewis alarmed turning back from watching the coffee face tight with hunger and fatigue no lolly for you old chap he meant no candy no prize what you bloody mean look lewis did look at the map now unfolded and spread out on the table suddenly he remembered the warning about not marking it up with starting coordinates et cetera lest the enemy as cheekdawson had cautioned could backtrack on it he peered closely at the map hang on here let me have a gander with this lewis bend down looking closer at the map at that moment another man one of the missing collapsed in the doorway two men lumbered to their feet went over and dragged him in lewis was still staring at the map theres no bloody writing on it look not even a pencil impression he held the map up like holding a sheet to dry ave a look cheekdawson turned him about to face the class prostrate before him anyone see it everybody gazed up at the map some of them looking like stunned cows still not recovered there was no writing on it just as lewis had said david brentwood reluctantly put up his hand poor old lewis looked as if hed collapse if they didnt give him something to eat soon folds said david you can see the square where the maps been folded and pressed down top of the class brentwood folded square said cheekdawson taking the map from an incredulous lewis enemy interrogator sees that hed know precisely the grid you started from reduce his search pattern by a factor of ten at least and you and your group wouldve had it brentwood pulled out his map i did the same thing he said looking up at cheekdawson the officer smiled so did i first time out dont do it again keep folding it different ways confuses the dickens out of themif youre caught can we eat now said lewis unrepentantly of course said cheekdawson then after lunch you lot take a stroll down to avergavenny well pick you up there with the lorries and take you back to senny bridge everyone clear on that why cant we go back now asked a coldstream guard yeah added lewis lorries are tied up im afraid answered cheekdawson besides a stroll after lunchll do you good otherwise youll get sleepy where is this aber avergavenny said cheekdawson noting the coldstream guards name anyone who couldnt get a verbal instruction right the first time could put a troop or an entire sas squadron of seventytwo men at risk foreignsounding names were no excuse scotland and wales were full of them its just east of us continued cheekdawson follow the road its clearly marked how far sir oh what is it sarmajor twentythree twentyfive miles round that sir there was a surly silence in the cold chapel right you are said cheekdawson ill not hold you up any longer you can have lunch pipes are frozen no joy with the taps im afraid so youll have to do the best you can on that score he handed the map back amicably to lewis and headed for the door with the rsm toward their land rover outside wheres bloody lunch asked lewis joined by a discordant chorus in the bag said the rsm pointing to a kit on the only table in the hall whered you think with that he and cheekdawson left lewis opened the kit bag and staggered back it had been tied tightly so that only now could they smell it it was full of dead rats and a note you must learn to live off the land but well give you a head start this time from now on youll have to fend for yourself one man began throwing up thelman said he felt sick so did david one of the brits a sapper rose and kicked the table leg fuck this for a lark i quit david rose slowly from the floor every muscle and tendon in his body throbbing with pain made worse now because of the cold the temperature in the disused chapel only a degree or so above the minus five centigrade outside he was looking back at the last man who had come in someone said the man was so cold he was turning blue and all david could see was the blinding snow of stadthagen the dogs chasing him the guards screaming and the cold so cold it was unimaginable all right he called out to several of the troopers at the back of the chapel take turns cuddling up to him thaw him out or well lose him that cheekdawson said lewis hes a fucking sadist david knew it was just as tough in the us special forces no doubt to separate the men from the boys when everyone was exhausted cold morale at rock bottom yet for david this was worse than anything hed seen in special forces intellectually he understood but emotionally he was furious but fury just fucks your mind a black instructor had wisely told him at camp lejeune fury gets you nowhere man clouds your judgment when judgment was already clouded because of the cold hunger and resentment david walked over to the table and called out anyone got a knife several hands went up lighter matches he asked next yeah i got one all right lets get the fire going where theres no grate no stove tear apart the altar rails david said pointing to the front of the chapel stick by stick christ therell be trouble for that said someone you want your meat raw david asked there was a loud crack a plank coming away all right said david turning to the two men with the knives start skinning one man came forward the other not moving shaking his head his mouth twisted in a mask of repulsion ii cant brentwood walked over to him listen chief you want to eat or not the man shook his head then youll starve give me the knife he turned to lewis aussie take this guy and a few others outside tear off the guttering waterll be frozen in that we can melt it over the fire okay davey boy said lewis youre the boss come on fellas get the lead out whos that asked cheekdawson now sitting in the land rover parked a quarter mile down the road out of sight listening to the parabolic mike feed on the land rovers radio that the american chap brentwood yes sir didnt say much before you think hes a goer the point is sarmajor can he hack phases two to six this is kindergarten true enough sir well then shall we join them very good sir when cheekdawson reappeared with the rsm everybody stopped what he was doing enough for two more asked cheekdawson no problem said lewis you can start if you like captain cheekdawson didnt hesitate pulling his sas dagger from its scabbard he pulled the rat from its spit sliced a piece off and using the dagger as a fork raised it to his mouth blew on it to cool it then began to eat true what they say captain said lewis with relish taste like chicken taste like rat aussie said cheekdawson he turned to brentwood course you made a bad mistake with the fire old boy oh retorted brentwood you couldnt see it could you we jerryrigged a canopy blackened out the windows you couldnt have seen it besides its snowing so whats the beef the rats the beef said someone brentwood ignored it waiting for cheekdawsons response he had him cold didnt he cheekdawson took another slice and began to chew it pulling a long stringy piece from his teeth balling it up and popping it back into his mouth smell old boy he said looking straight at brentwood while still chewing smell it for bloody miles so what would you have done asked brentwood bristling at the criticism cold old boy cant go pratting around with ruddy great fires can you might as well send up a ruddy great flare tell em where you are you wouldnt eat it bloody cold said lewis pull the other one cheekdawson walked over to the bag pulled out a rat threw it on the table beheaded it with his dagger and bisected the rest pushing one half forward silently cutting up the remaining half jesus someone said cheekdawson kept chewing wiping the blood from his lips he waited can i borrow your knife it was brentwood looking straight at the englishman by all means old chap said cheekdawson handing him the sas dagger chapter thirtyfive heading out from the murmansk sub pens on kola peninsula an alfa the fastest nuclearpowered attack sub in the world passed beneath the stednaja nuclear and conventional weapons arsenal the alfa was one of the zolotaya ryba or golden fish socalled because it was the most expensive sub ever made in the soviet union diving as soon as she could she set her course along the relatively shallow sevenhundredfoot dip in scandinavias continental shelf no longer patrolled by nato awacs since the russians had overwhelmed the norwegians the shallow exit was as safe as the alfa could hope for before reaching the deeper waters that lay off the continental slope west of the north cape once it had reached a point four hundred miles south the alfa under the command of nikita yanov would be in the sixthousandfootdeep norwegian sea and then turning to the southwest would head for the sector of the spitsbergen fracture zone toward the pole searching for american sea wolfs the footlong us nuclear attack and ballistic missile subs that moved from station to station within easy striking distance of the soviet union for the sea wolfs the distance from the deeps around spitzbergen to moscow was farther than from some sub pens on scotlands west coast but yanov knew as did all soviet sub captains that though moscow was closer to the scottish sub pens the zhostkiehardstrategic targets for americans the big sub bases on the kola peninsula were much closer to the spitzbergen trench still yanov and his crew knew there was another reason for the lurking sea wolfs the main incentive for the americans to head high into the arctic was not to hide their ballistic missile subs in the protection of deep water but to seek the protection of the ice cap of course it was possible to blast the ice cap first then send in depth charges and acoustic homing asw charges but such tactics were the theoretical dreams of the experts ashore the reality was that blowing holes in the ice would make such a noise that before the alfas antisubmarine missiles could reach the target the enemy alerted by the tremendous explosion of the ice blowing up would have already begun countermeasures no yanov knew that the only way was to find them as quickly as you could under the ice and destroy them there it took skill and some luck but yanov had something else to help him the benefit of the soviet unions unprecedented developments in submarine warfare even the us navy had admitted that the soviets increasing speed higher reserve buoyancy and titanium hull on the alfa heralded an astonishing advance in soviet submarine warfare capability it was even more impressive given the fact that contrary to what many nato commanders believed the soviet union had not stolen most of her advances from the west but developed them herself the exception was the spectacular kgb coup in obtaining western technological breakthroughs in sonar detection and in quietening the subs prop an intelligence coup made possible through the secrets sold to the soviets by the walker family spy ring in the united states yanov took particular pride in the fact that compared to the footlong footwide american sea wolfs and the soviet unions tyfuns or typhoonsat twentyfive tons the biggest subs in the world his alfa at twentynine hundred tons and only feet long and feet wide was so sleek it was like a shark among whales yanovs alfa built in the sudomekh shipyard in leningrad had already proved herself many times yanov glanced at the three red combat efficiency stars mounted above the planesmen in control one of the stars with the black letter t printed on its white center was for torpedo excellence the second with em at its center was for propulsion efficiency and the third a red star within the four black lines testified to superior antisubmarine warfare awarded to yanov personally by the northern fleet commander most impressive of all above the three stars was the goldringed white circle which contained the blue and white naval ensign of red star hammer and sickle this told anyone who saw it and they could hardly miss it in control that yanovs submarine had been acclaimed outstanding ship of the soviet navy this was the reward for yanovs sub having sunk twentythree nato merchant vessels each over fifteen thousand tons and for the destruction of two nato nuclear submarines one a british trafalgar the other a french rubis it was an enviable record but one that yanov was not satisfied with what he wanted what he yearned for so much that it invaded his dreams was to sink an american sub and not just any american sub but the best they had a sea wolf ii yanovs progression from kapitan to kontraadmiral would then be guaranteed the war while bemoaned by so many others had been a godsend for officers like yanov a chance for him to cut out of the herd before he was too old if you retired from the submarine service as a kapitan these days youd stay a kapitan forever as there were over eighty attack submarine captains alone vying for admirals row yanov ran a check of his sticks including the highfrequency mast the park lamp df loop and the searchandattack periscopes the cluster of five sticks atop the alfas streamlined sail was similar to that of the victorclass nuclear subs but there any comparison ended alfa wasnt only the worlds fastest attack sub it was also the deepestdiving its titanium hull capable of withstanding the enormous ocean pressures to a depth of three thousand feet in addition the alfas twentyonefootlong twentyinchwide torpedoes fired from the alfas covey of six tubes mounted forward could reach fortyfive knots faster than most american subs in addition to all this the alfa carried twotofifteenkilohertz lowfrequency towed sonar arrays and a markedly improved snoop tray radar but technology aside his alfa yanov knew had another distinct advantage over the americans one that not even yanovs colleagues in the other alfa had it was the experience of his fortyfive man crew yanovs crew had logged more time in arctic waters than any other attack submarine in the soviet navy they were icetrained yanovs sonar operators having become extraordinarily sensitive to the sounds that emanated from the proximity of unseen but huge subsurface ice creating the impression that an enemy sub was nearby when in fact it was not but if you fired at that noise you gave away your greatest weapon your silence and every enemy ship within a hundred kilometers would hear you and come homing in on you chapter thirtysix after lunch cheekdawson rapped the bare table for attention all right chaps ive got an announcement bad news im afraid sarmajors just received a radio message that the lorries arent at abergavenny some cockup at the regular army motor pool apparently always happens when you deal with outsiders let this be a lesson we can only rely on ourselves you mean we have to walk all the way back to senny bridge sir asked a sapper thats fiftyodd mile yes said cheekdawson gawd blimey muttered one of the cockneys thats diabolical that is bloody diabolical you still plan on staying with the group thelman ribbed lewis i know what sas stands for said lewis special army sadists you told us that before said david the australian stood up sir yes lewis lot shorter back over the hill the beacons a cockney voice shouted youre off your uncle ned cheekdawsons expression was fixed on lewis finally he nodded then shifted his gaze to the rest of the volunteers the member from down under has a point gentlemen tougher going but half the distance that right sarmajor easily sir very well announced cheekdawson enthusiastically its back over the hill then very nice aussie said the trooper next to him well done bucking for sergeant but cheekdawson noted the troopers mock derision of lewis was only that mock nothing mean about it and if its one thing the sas rated higher by nato than the us seals or even the israeli commandos had learned during its long and distinguished commando years it was that contrary to the publics dirty dozen view of such groups a convivial sense of humor was essential as the men rose checking their bergens as theyd already begun calling their sas rucksacks lewis tightening his straps suddenly experienced a surge of intuition about where they were going the rats were the clue he told brentwood the tropics you daft asked a tommy why ave they got us in bloody wales then because retorted lewis theyre bloody comedians thats why like to watch us suffer besides doesnt matter where they train us its how right now the rats rats are everywhere said the tommy i dont think even cheekdawson knows where were going yeah agreed thelman you heard him last night said were on call not so fast thelma said lewis we havent qualified yet you know what i mean aussie you tryin to tell me theyve got no idea where well be going i didnt say that answered thelman there you are then i tell you its the tropics a quid says youre wrong challenged the tommy youre on said lewis thats a quid gone west mate lewis looked around anyone else cheekdawson was standing by the door opening the rucksack and counting out the requisite number of bricks the sergeant collecting the first batch of those men who had failed and who would have to be taken back to senny bridge by the land rover buckling up the rucksack cheekdawson called david brentwood over your service record says youre para trained yes sir halo as well as regular by halo he meant highaltitude lowopening jumps highaltitude to avoid aa and radar detection in free fall lowaltitudeopening for steering to a pinpoint landing it was the kind of thing sky divers did except they didnt carry the enormous load commandos were required to the difference was like that between one man swimming in a pair of trunks the other in full gear and rifle only regular chute training replied david at camp lejeune with thelman no halo not to worry shouldnt take you too long once youve had the basics he paused shifting the weight of his pack if youre game when do we start said brentwood i admire your confidence replied cheekdawson zipping up the nylon storm suit but you have a few hoops to pass through yet david said nothing the truth was that despite his bravado in front of cheekdawson he had a blister on his left heel that was about to burst if he was to get back over the beacons in the snowstorm with a windchill factor of at least minus ten itd be a pure case of mind over matter when cheekdawson opened the door flurries of snow flew through stinging his face if this is phase one said thelman slinging his rifle id hate to think what the next five are like so would i mate said lewis and its not five more thank god said thelman its six said lewis cheekdawson looked back at the fiftyfive men who had earned the right to more pain first man back gets free beer he announced heartily thats me shouted lewis oh ja it was a west ranger commando i was the champion drinker in my einzelk√§mpf unit einzelwhat said lewis winking at brentwood and thelman sounds like a flamin disease you want to bet on it aussie asked the german aw dont waste your dough fritz youll need it for an oxygen bottle there was some hearty laughter despite the impending trek never mind said the german in correct if heavily accented english i will bet you twenty marks all right fritz rejoined lewis but lets make it real money dollars us gambling was strictly against queens regulations but cheekdawson and the rsm were quiet on the matter what major rye had in mind for this lot those who were left at weeks end would require more than top physical fitness their morale as the us marines were fond of saying would have to be outstanding and if a wager here and there helped so be it some of them would never get to spend it by hours that evening major rye watched them straggle in after the killing pace set by both the german ranger and cheekdawson who had led most of the way as well as checking for stragglers rye noted there were seven more three us marines and four british who decided it was too tough for them rye spoke gently to the seven as he had to the cot cases brought in earlier by the sergeant major in the land rover rye not only thanked them all for coming but spoke individually to each man as he signed out asking the failures what they thought had been the hardest part of the trek for them and telling every one of them that they were welcome to reapply for sas at anytime confidentiality he told them would be assured apart from their respective commanding officers as far as their regiments were concerned they had merely been seconded for other duties for a week major rye then told them he had failed in his first attempt it softened the blow visibly what did you in sir asked lewis out of breath but with his usual bluntness intact crosscountry march answered rye without hesitation full pack and weapons somewhat heavier than youre carrying now i should add forty miles rough terrain timed us at twenty hours when do we do that sir asked thelman oh early on phase two stone the crows said lewis but before he could say any more cheekdawson was telling the fortyeight men remaining that in half an hours time he wanted them in fourman troops or fire teams as you americans call them two men were assigned to be on the blackboards as each of the eleven fourman troops was to submit a plan of attack against the hypothetically heavily defended chapel at merthyr tydfil whence theyd just come apart from judging initiative and organizational abilities on short notice the purpose of this exercise was to have each groups plan rubbished by three regular sas ncos from the air services oldest regiment the twentysecond based in hereford in the main this consisted of picking the plans apart and ridiculing each groups suggestion as either daft or bloody stupid while the men were mentally and physically exhausted many of them disoriented by the sudden shock of the total immersion of the beacons caper as it was known in sas if they couldnt stand having in the lexicon of the sas the piss taken out of em then they were dropped in sass experience bad temper was as fatal to an operation as bad planning a line unit could put up with misfits but misfits in the sas had to fit together you owe me twenty dollars the tall german ranger said approaching lewis brentwood and thelman the four of them forming one of the fourman troops whats your name sport lewis asked the german wilhelm schwarzenegger yeah well listen willie im a spot short now fix you up on payday ja ja sure no problem hey you any relation to arnie who you know old arnie schwarzenegger used to be a big movie star years ago muscles like chickens insteps no i do not think so maybe way back so aussie david interrupted how we going to take the chapel ah said lewis putting his rifle on his bunk and then walking back to the group like willie here says no problem piece o cake bracket the bastards with a mortar and while theyve got their noggins down move in not too wide a front though wed end up shooting one another lewis everyone stopped talking the regimental sergeant majors voice echoing bulllike through the barrack yeah said lewis yes sergeant major yes sergeant major in this regiment you may hate your mother you may not pay your taxes but you are neveri repeat never to be out of reach of your weapon do you understand yes sergeant major carry on sheepishly lewis walked over got his rifle and returned for the first time since hed met him david brentwood saw that the australian was embarrassed though he wasnt at a loss for words old fart im never out of reach of my weapon you were then said thelman i mean my cock thelma jesus youre rude okay said david what size my cock said lewis wilhelm was shaking his head the mortar said david cant be too heavy eightyonemillimeter weighs a hundred pounds shells around fifteen not very effective aussie most we could carry is six rounds i meant a light job explained lewis sixtymill fiftypound barrel rounds weigh in at less than ten you must be joking said one of the sas ncos wandering among the groups snowing to beat the band and youre talking about mortars youd get moisture in the barrel and poof unless youre a good infielder mate youll end up with your family jewels blown across five acres were not that stupid said david wed make sure the barrel was no cut in another nco you fire a mortar round and next minute youd be on their infrared scopes big blobs against the snow youd be you blokes might as well hang out a shingle tell em where you are stop screwing around with mortars said the british nco go in fast dont give em time to think china we have any artillery backup asked thelman the british nco exchanged an incredulous glance with one of the american ncos pathetic isnt it absolutely pathetic he squatted down next to thelman if we had artillery that close you ningnong we wouldnt need special air service right christ what did you blokes have for lunch fairy floss was it thelman glowered at the british nco david quickly cut in youre assuming theyve got infrared scopes he put to the ncos what were assuming said the british nco is that you blokes dont know your ass from a hole in the ground artillery jesus selfreliance amigos thats what its all about no one else there but you as the two ncos moved on to the next group thelman was still steamed what the hells fairy floss candy floss said brentwood yeah said lewis encouragingly dont let em get to you thelma david snapped his fingers ive got it the ncos turned around tell them to surrender david explained give em two minutes tell em weve got the place completely surrounded bluff its worked oh said the british nco his voice dripping with sarcasm oh thats brilliant init got your berlitz tape with you have you brentwood no said david steadily but one of us would speak the language my said the british nco would e now yes chimed in aussie sas troop of four always has one man who speaks the lingo of the opposing force and who told you guys that asked the american no one replied brentwood but aussie has a point seems your recruiting offices placed a lot of emphasis on a second language yeah said aussie daves right your bloke was very interested in knowing i spoke malay so continued david i figure theres one guy in every troop who do you now cut in the british nco yes the american nco couldnt contain a smirk and his british colleague gave in all right sherlock holmes youre right but how do you know what language youll be using you find out that by asking the other three in the troop whether they speak a foreign language carry on the brit said and walked over with the american toward cheekdawson who was picking the plan of another wouldbe fire team apart i told you said lewis looking around triumphantly at the other three in the group the bloody rats were being trained for the tropics my malay how about fritz here asked thelman indicating schwarzenegger he speaks german as well as english right fritz could be were going to germany aw rats said aussie dismissively not noticing his pun old freemans lot ave gone through germany like a packet of salts its malaya southeast asia boys communist insurgency i can smell it hell thats where the sas cut their teeth fighting the commies in malaysia i say its germany said thelman rushing out spets maybe no way retorted lewis absolutely no way brentwood was feeling the blister thawing out hurting like hell it told him that he wouldnt make phase three and he was struck once again how sometimes such small things could change your destiny look he told the others four of us came together by chance first only two of us are probably going to make it through the course theyre the odds and those twoll end up in another group of four so we dont know where anyones going so lets drop it schwarzenegger nodded good point brentwood ja good point yeah dave conceded lewis guess youre right hell i dont think even old cheek knows but brentwoods real reason for not wanting to speculate was that schwarzeneggers mention of spets reminded him of lili chapter thirtyseven time to think it was something that ray brentwood excommanding officer of the guided missile frigate uss blaine had plenty of time for ever since that misty early morning in the sea of japan in the very first attack on an american naval ship in the war when he was engulfed in flame the exocet slamming into the blaine forward of the bridge at san diegos veterans hospital the socalled restorative operations were over but despite laser weld plastic surgery the tight polishedskinned ugliness of burn unit surgery remained it was so severe that upon meeting him people made a point of chatting with him and looking at him longer than they normally would any other acquaintance in order to prove to him and to themselves that it didnt really matter when it did beth and the children had been the least of his worries as it turned out at first hed been afraid that john four and jeannie seven would albeit unintentionally shy away from him but they like beth adapted faster than ray thought he had any sight to expect the worst of it for the children wasnt the long trip down from seattle to san diego veterans they welcomed these but the teasing by other children the frankenwood jokes who was it ray wondered who had said children had become more sensitive in america because of the experiences of so many minorities in the melting pot it was a lie children no matter what their nationality all lived in the same country in childhood it was the world of survival of the fittest the most natural instinct to pick on the weak even so for ray brentwood his childrens burden at school caused by his disfigurement was not the worst of it for him much more damaging for the family as a whole was the undeniable fact that ray brentwood captain us navy had been fished up out of the water by rescue craft while many of his crew had perished aboard the frigate fighting the fires that had finally been extinguished ray had gone over his testimony to the naval board of inquiry a million times he remembered one moment hed been standing on the bridge there was an explosion of glass as the missile had hit and then hed been thrown back the second officer or was it the third covered in blood was screaming something at him and the next thing he remembered was thrashing about in the water the crucial question for the board and for his peace of mind which had never been answered was had he been pushed over by the officer of the watch or somebody else who had thought the ship was irretrievably lost or had he quit the ship voluntarily in vain his courtappointed lawyer searched for testimony that would answer the question but all the others on the bridge were dead within minutes of the missile hitting or had died shortly thereafter before any exonerating testimony could have been collected the fact that the blaine one of americas topoftheline oliver hazard perry fastguided missile frigates was the first ship hit in the war had made it the focus of enormous public attention the navy was reluctant in the extreme as the prosecuting lawyer had advised the board to lend any solace even the merest suggestion of it to any idea that a captain could abandon his post under duress the brentwood case wasnt simply a matter of naval pr for the pentagon but was seen as a crucial case not only for the navy but for all the services with thousands of young officers raised in peace not having received a baptism of fire it was considered vital by the chief of naval operations that benefit of doubt which might properly be extended in a civil mercantile marine situation should not be extended in the case of capt john raymond brentwood usn ray brentwood was then named an interested party to the inquiry it was an innocentsounding phrase but one that spelled terminal paralysis if not outright rejection for the hopes of advancement in any career officer the decision of the inquiry was to immediately relieve captain brentwood of his command over the blaine which was now being virtually rebuilt from the hull up where the exocet had blown a bankvaultsized hole in her forward section brentwood was now dubbed lord jim after conrads character who had deserted his ship and passengers during a typhoon only to arrive in port on another vessel to find his had weathered the storm after all ray brentwood was also told unofficially that he was damn lucky not to have been courtmartialed the scuttlebutt had it that two things had saved him from this first his family connections that is string pulling by his father retired adm john brentwood senior now serving on the new york port authority as director of convoys and by his younger brother david one of the heroes of the pyongyang raid second it was rumored that the navy because of the increasing convoy losses due to the unexpected successes of the renewed soviet sub pack offensives in both the atlantic and the pacific needed anyone who could tell a bow from a stern the first part of the scuttlebutt about his family connections was untrue adm john brentwood was the last man to interfere to pull strings for kin he abhorred it fought it all his life the second part of the scuttlebutt was correct the us navy was desperate for trained men if not to man new ships then to train younger men who would and it was this fact upon which ray brentwood now released from the veterans burn unit and waiting at home in bremerton washington state had pinned all his hopes either that or as his wife beth had suggested he could opt for early retirement because of his facial disfigurement retire to what hed snapped whod have me anyway the seas the only thing i know anything about only thing i care about how about the family ray hed turned on her the bright sheen of what had been his cheeks stretched tighter than usual over the reconstituted jawbone theyd wired together for ten weeks all his nourishment had had to be taken by straw you know what i mean elizabeth i am thinking of the family he walked away from her and looked out from the living room of their bungalow toward the clutter of gantries gulls and noise of traffic below the latters diesel and gasoline fumes so thick that only now and then could he hope to catch a whiff of the sea thank god the burn hadnt taken away his sense of smell if theyd only send me to sea again i he spread his hands in utter frustration goddamn it i have to get back my pride a coast guard cutter patrol boat anything all i need beth is a command again he sat down on the love seat tossing his cap on the coffee table running his fingers through his hair which by now had all returned except for a mangy patch above the left ear he was glancing anxiously at his watch in ten minutes three oclock washington said it would ring with the pentagons decision make a difference to the kids too wouldnt it to say i had a command again yes said beth softly i guess it would but youd still be away from us he looked across at her her love was genuine he could see it in her eyes and it constantly amazed him she saw right through him right to the heart to his desperate longing for things as they used to be and knowing they couldnt be the same ever again it was she he remembered who had made the first move in bed on his return from the hospital before they had begun he had asked her to turn off the lights no shed replied her hand cool calmly stroking him over the hard unfeeling scar looking only at his eyes i love you shed said you understand ray i love you hed cried and she held him and he wept like a child theres plenty of time shed assured him and at once hed felt humiliated as low as hed ever been and grateful and angry that he should be grateful and overwhelmed because she meant it the phone rang she looked at him to answer it you take it he said not wanting to grab it sound as if hed been anxiously hovering over it all day hello yes hes here just a moment please she placed her hand over the mouthpiece and held the phone out to him i think its the pentagon she waited as he spoke biting her nails damn it why couldnt he ever give any indication of what was being said the old navy macho cool yes sir was all she heard him say his tone neutral yes sir i understand yes sir he put the phone down slowly well tell me said beth hi mom where are you it was jeannie home from school then they heard john quickly beth urged ray wait till the kids simmer down he told her ray tell me he looked down at his cap theyve given me a command dont know what yet have to report to san diego in fortyeight hours and hi dad jeannie called out then stopped letting her school bag slide to the ground whats wrong nothing said beth quickly your dad got one of those darn gnats in his straight in his eye here she handed ray a crumpled kleenex ah said ray turning around to face jeannie full on little buggersscuse me little beggars so tiny you cant see em flew right into me he blew his nose then suddenly clapped his hands hey how about we go out for chinese thought the chinese were fighting us said jeannie not these chinese said beth weve been eating there for years they could be spying on hood canal watching uncle bobs ship ray had developed a particular sympathy for outsiders since his days in the confinement of the burn unit theyre not spying for crying out loud hell if they were spying how about all that water poisoning stuff and continued jeannie hey tiger said ray seeing johnny walk in are you ready for liberty john hadnt seen his dad in such a good mood since he couldnt remember when yes sir said john saluting ray straightened and returned the salute very good officer of the deck whatll it be chinese or hot dogs jeannie knew john would opt for hot dogs if she didnt move quickly chinese cookies she said yummy yeah chinese cookies said john enthusiastically very well said ray now all hands hear this liberty boat departs in exactly he glanced at his watch frowning authoritatively ten minutes go when the children had left the room beth ran over and hugged him im so happy for you i he said nothing he couldnt so they didnt tell you what it is not on the phone no but he did say it would be a command ten to one its a pt boat i dont mind theyre fast beth and they carry a wallop i dont mind at all he closed his eyes and hugged her thank you uhoh called out jeannie my little cooing turtle doves ray batted her with his cap whered you hear that kid old movie at school w c fields you know him wasnt he some admiral oh daddy without further ado she turned to her mother mom can i tell you what happened at school now this is an equal employment facility said ray shoot guess who won the spelling bee oh jeannie said beth thats great honey hey hey said ray atta girl give me the killer word uh lets see beth was bursting with it all she hadnt seen the family so exuberantly happy since cacklebladder said jeannie what in hells that asked ray right put in young john its when spies pretend to kill someone but they dont really jeannie explained thats dumb said johnny it is not dumb it makes the other guys think the guy is really dead when he really isnt what for said johnny combatively to fool them silly thats dumb it is not besides youre too young to all right all right said beth moving in to referee no arguments lets go or we dont eat heading out to the car arm in arm beth was laughing cackle what was it ive never heard of such a word have you no said ray its all theyre hearing at school now i guess with all this espionage business god knows its real enough you mean youve never heard the word asked jeannie ray turned surprised nope never im not a spy im a sailor jeannie yes said beth and for a second they savored everything that meant before the kids started fighting about whether it would be chop suey or chow mein rays fortune cookie told him your expectations will be exceeded a destroyer said beth reaching over and holding his hand or maybe shush he told her dont tempt fate then smiling lowering his voice besides jeannie might be right the cook might be listening it was the fortune cookie he was thinking about two days later when after a night during which hed been too excited to sleep he reported to san diego and in the gray morning light passed ships from a carrier in for refit to a missile frigate like the blainewas it the blaine he looked more closely through the maze of electrical cables and oxyacetylene torches no it wasnt it was muster and ships companies were quietly quickly assembling on deck for morning assignments by the time he reached vessel designation ixe the uss grace it had to be a mixup he saw a sailor in oily overalls coming down slowly along the pier against which the low tide was slopping the smell of the intertidal life all but lost under the stench of oilfouled water he hated the smell of diesel and considered that the greatest single advance in the modern nuclear navy was doing away with the fumeladen oilfired steam propulsion of the old days sailor he called out to the man in the overalls the sailor stopped should have saluted but didnt instead he looked affronted staring at brentwoods face angrily yeah you tell me where the grace is youre looking at er with that the sailor walked on farther down the pier ray felt his stomach go to ice the enormity of the disappointment hitting him with the speed of a rushing locomotive the grace a surface vessel was designated ixe ix indicated unclassified miscellaneous indicated sludge removal barge selfpropelled he didnt know what the e stood for dazed as if hed been poleaxed he walked down the bowed plank onto the creaking apology for a deck it was all wood old wood wood that looked as if it had been cut from waterlogged trees eons ago and grimy it was feet by feet or so the lone sailor aboard who was awakened cursing told him whats the ships complement brentwood asked his voice strained barely audible twenty ah maybe twentytwo captain you mean you dont know think its twentyone sir propulsion ah this here barge is selfpropelled sir not pushed i know that but what pushes it sailor an eggbeater ha ha no sir we got a gm down below horsepower couldnt tell you that capn two shafts though yes sir one of the boys told me that the man frowned looking deeply troubled i think its two ray brentwood excommander of the fastest guidedmissile frigate in the united states navy took a deep long breath and immediately regretted doing so all he could smell was thick sinusplugging diesel how many officers uh never had one of those sir youre the first whos been in command then uhpetty officer beamish sir hes ashore with the rest of the guys they come on around ten whats your name and rank able seaman jones sir guys call me jonesy what are your duties jones uh now that i can tell you sir see we go out suck up any oil thats leaked from the bilges in transit up and down the coast then that derrick there in the middle midships said brentwood appalled yeah well we lower the suction hose down over the aframe and slurp up she comes then we trundle back here to port and dump er in that old scow the elaineup yonder by the big carrier theresalt lake city sometimes folks up the coast see a bit of oil and give us a call so we go and mop er its filthy said brentwood well captain diesels dirty stuff course sometimes we get a few eggheads uh sorry sir i mean ocean scientists down from la jolla and we let em hang some stuff off the stern they keep track of the oil spills see like every oil cargo is different sort of isotope stamping brentwood cut in its called fingerprinting it was a longstanding pollution control device to track down whoever flushed oil from bilges in transit up and down the coast yeah i reckon thats what they do said jones whats the e stand for joness gaze followed ray brentwoods finger pointing at the designation ixe in faded paint on the barges port side oh yeah thats e for experimental you mean the oceanographers stuff no sir i mean this is the first selfpropelled sludgeremoval barge in port used to just push er around with a tug jesus said brentwood and right then and there he decided he was going to resign from the navy if they thought they could push him out quietly with this insult the bastards were right what saved him changed his mind was robert mitchum an actor his dad used to like whom hed seen in an old late show one night watching kvostv out of seattle mitchum was playing the part of a destroyer captain in world war ii being hunted by a sub and the destroyer had been hit it wasnt out for the count but was well on the way old bob as rays dad used to call mitchum as if they were brothers ordered everybody to abandon ship except essential crew the officer of the deck had the job of making up the list of the nonessential personnel and had put down the garbage balers name a lowiq eccentric who was in charge of garbage disposal old bob sleepyeyed had said no the garbageman had to stay everybody disliked the man because he stank and had a weird passion for his job but old bob told the ood that the mans dedication to balingcompacting garbage making sure it sank out of sight instead of breaking up and acting as a trail for the marauding sub to spot and follow could save the ship ray remembered that on this foulsmelling misty wharf and what his father had always told him to swallow his pride and think of the navy that it was bigger than any individual had to be ray ordered the lackadaisical jones to round up the vessels full complement by hours or hed fine every man jack of them they were going to scrub her down stem to stern and the engine room crammed box that it was was going to be so clean that any one of the ships company could eat their dinner off it was that understood yes sir said jones saluting and wiping dirty hands on his dirty dungarees as ray brentwood watched him walk up the gangplank along the wharf he felt the barge shift and strain against the hawsers the tide was coming in he saw a forlornlooking sea gull perched atop the greasestained derrick well forward of the wheelhouse the latter looking like a box plonked on a slab of tired wood well bird ray told the sea gull i dont think gracell win the war running up and down the coast sucking up bunker c but at least we can give the lady a little respect in all the annals of war never had a man so unwittingly belied the role of the vessel under his command sludgeremoval barge ixe propelled the gull rose squawking depositing on brentwoods cap what the graces captain took to be appropriate comment on his career prospects chapter thirtyeight beside the crackling warmth of the oval office fireplace the president of the united states felt cold with the chiefs of staff press aide paul trainor and national security affairs adviser harry schuman sitting on the white leather lounge chairs behind him he read the message that had been relayed directly to him by the us trade legation in taipei poison gas used by prc forces against rok positions near manpo on yalu stop poisonous gas not yet known for certain but has been confirmed as nerve gas type similar or identical to that used in nineteen eighties iraqiran war stop obvious danger is that if beijing has authorized use against nka we must assume they andor nka general kim will not hesitate to use against us forces in korea message ends mayne stared into the fire as he finished reading the message and saw the red coals collapsing as he imagined ancient pompeii must have disappeared in vesuviuss molten sea of lava has freeman been told yes mr president answered army chief of staff general grey whats he doing about it he asked general grey only thing he can sir replied the chief of the army making sure each man has cbw clothing and masks how about europe were doing the same thing there sir so are the russians and chinese if our intelligence reports are accurate those dumb bastards said mayne his right hand massaging his forehead the message from taipei dangling from his left hand like a white flag mr president said air force general allet we cant say for sure that beijing ordered the use of the gas it could have been a local decision by one of the commanders might have panicked when he saw rok forces coming at him good christ said mayne turning away from the fireplace well lets find out we cant get through to beijing on normal hookup mr president general grey informed him mayne was incredulous why dammit several microwave relay stations have been knocked out the cno chief of naval operations admiral horton held that the question of who authorized the use of gas was more or less an academic one now that the genie as he put it had been let out of the bottle no ones going to care who started it mr president point is whatre we going to do about it now warn them said mayne beijing and moscow that this is a nowin situation for all of us mayne caught the quick glance between admiral horton and harry schuman his national affairs adviser who shifted his cane uncomfortably from left to right a sign that his usual southern aplomb had been undone well demanded mayne isnt it a nowin situation mr president answered general grey moving forward uneasily in the plush lounge chair the army marines and the other two services all have supplies of sarin and vx nerve gases despite the agreement to reductions signed by bush and gorbachev it was clearly understood by both sides it could never be a total ban when at least fourteen other nations had similar chemical and biological weapons including libya iraq so we get the message through to beijing and moscow through geneva if necessary that we can play this game too god knows we dont want to but if any us troops are attacked with gas then well retaliate in kind we couldnt pin this goddamned water poisoning that swept the country on them for lack of evidence but this is clearcut gentlemen and as churchill told the nazis we didnt ask that the rules of the game be changed but if they want to play rough we can play rough too agreed he waited impatiently for the consensus afraid not mr president it was general grey again who dared broach the harsher reality what in hell do you mean general asked mayne tapping his breast pocket as if looking for his reading glasses and asking his press aide to bring him a glass of water a sign for trainor to get the abm antiballistic missile as he called the migrane medication often having told trainor in lighter moments that migrane is like an icbm if you didnt start defensive measures quickly youll lose general grey was now sitting uncomfortably on the edge of the lounge seat hands clasped but looking directly up at his commander in chief this was no time he decided to play pussyfoot or to assign blame it was the moment for an unsparing truth not known by the american public at large and not even by many senior officers sir grey began the treaty between gorbachev and bush was unable to cover all kinds of chemical agents only those known for sure as potential weapons at the time later the british were the first to notice a problem a new type of chemical called pfib i believe its chemical name is perfiuoro i dont want a lecture general just give me the bottom line well sir this pfib is ten times more lethal than hydrogen cyanide easily deliverable and thermally stable make the damn stuff by superheating teflon problem is it permeates our gas suits which are essentially activatedcarbon based its only a fairly recent development the pfib i mean but even against the known nerve gases vx for example our m respirator isnt very satisfactory satisfactory said mayne angrily you mean the damn thing doesnt work uh providing the concentrations arent too high its youre telling me the damn thing doesnt work mr president interjected admiral horton general grey is pointing out sir that the cbw suits we have for our troops are markedly inferior to those of the soviets as with their space program its one area that theyve been remarkably mayne was stunned by the information grey and horton were giving him he looked at air force general allet and harry schuman to contest the issue to tell him they were wrong but it was schuman who delivered the final blow mr president im afraid theyre correct theres been a lot of intense interservice rivalry on this one as with so many contracts schuman turned to the chiefs of staff am l right gentlemen there was an uncomfortable murmur from the leather lounge the three chiefs of staff of what they believed was the most powerful nation on earth caught out like guilty schoolboys schuman continued we do have some better suits the mcup has very good visibility trouble is it has what they call a butylrubber nylon hood its like a sauna impossible to fight in in certain situations and besides we havent nearly enough to mr president cut in grey bridling at the prospect of the army taking the full rap we had to decide where best to spend the money especially after the gorbachevbush lovein cbw defense has not been put on high priority not only because of the competition for sophisticated defense of icbms allowed by the treaties but because quite frankly we put our faith in the triad bombers subs and our landbased icbms nuclear forces now we do have most of our m tanks fitted with good antigas airconditioning units and theyre pretty safe but for the infantry you see sir a drop of vx anywhere on the skin can kill you its very difficult to design a suit one that you have to actually fight in to satisfy the then how come the russians have done it shot back mayne there was silence until admiral horton spoke because sir the sovietsve put a hell of a lot more of their gnp into defensive capability cbw defenses in particular moscow had miles of tunnels built in the cold war and also utilizes its extensive subway system as a shelter network in that regard theyre like the israelis i mean in how theyve prepared for it israeli defense forcesve run gas drills every day since the iraqis bought the eighteenhundredmilerange chinese east wind missiles capable of delivering cbw warheads soviets have the same kind of drills as often as we have fire drills the russians might be backward as hell in making shoes or running a consumer economy but not in cbw warfare theyre infinitely more prepared than we are mayne walked over to the oval office desk his back to the chiefs and took the three headache pills lying on his blotter swallowing them in one gulp before returning glass in hand to the fireplace aware that there had been a subtle but terrifying shift in the conversation one minute they had been talking about teflonproduced gas combatants in chemicalbiological warfare now the three service chiefs seemed to be talking about the vulnerability of the american population at large and not only its soldiers youre telling me said mayne that not only are our boys equipped with inferior cbw suits but that those to be used for the civilian population are just as bad admiral horton was staring at the fire air force general allet carefully flicking off a piece of invisible fluff from his knifeedged trousers i think put in harry schuman grasping his ornate cane in both hands that what the chiefs are saying mr president is that we have no civilian cbw contingency plan to speak of thats not correct put in general grey quickly every city has emergency plans for yes rejoined schuman for earthquakes fires but weve no comprehensive cbw strategy or protective clothing correct essentially thats what the hell does that mean general pressed mayne have we or do we not have effective cbw defenses for our civilians we do not mr president except for you and your battle staff in washington should the occasion the commander in chief took another long draft of detoxified water well gentlemen we screwed up on that wouldnt you say yes sir replied grey but theres nothing we can do about it now except try to stop them using it on us if they attack us with gas well lose not necessarily cut in admiral horton a cw attack wont affect our subs at sea or even our surface vessels wherever possible our ships have undergone contoured refitgot rid of sharpangled pockets in the superstructure all the vessel has to do is head into the sea and it in effect washes itself down that goes for nuclear radiation or cbw attacks we just seal em up and they can continue to fight in that condition with air conditioners and filters you cant seal a carrier can you challenged mayne acidly if you want to use aircraft well that is an exception mr president a rather large one i would have thought admiral the cno did not respond i trust the logic of this situation hasnt escaped you pressed mayne throwing the remaining water from his glass onto the fire the coals sizzled for a second but then just as quickly were flaring again the situation gentlemen is that because we dont have any significant cbw defensive capability we would have only one alternative if so attacked nuclear war god forbid mr president said general allet but the air force is ready for that are you general well im not replied mayne the elderly schuman used his cane to help drag himself forward and up out of the lounge mr president none of us in a sense is ready for a uh nuclear exchange lets call it war harry shall we said mayne icily very well mr president but if moscow was to use such a weapon and i must tell you that moscow is surely now aware of beijings action against the rok forces ill give you any odds that their advisers will see the sudden window of opportunity they now have namely that this is one area in which they are unquestionably superior to the united states suzlovs not that mad retorted mayne but it was said more with hope than conviction you might be correct mr president said harry schuman but suzlovs not the only one running the show now his chiefs of staff including chernko are no doubt pointing out that while nuclear arms destroy everything chemical biological weapons destroy only the people and leave everything intact for the victors all they have to do is wait till the gas does its job dissipates then they move in and suzlovs generals have much more say in making policy these days mr president than we do with you im not complaining about that but that is the fact of the matter remember too were now on russian territory for them the temptation is much stronger than for us its one thing for us to sit thousands of miles away across the atlantic but with nato forces on their front lawn and freeman on the chinesenorth korean border i must concur with general grey however distasteful it is mr president if we cant win a chemical war we will have to be prepared for a nuclear war yes said mayne but if that starts who stops it harry schuman sighed heavily both hands resting on the silver knob of the cane mr president contrary to those on the extreme left who are always talking doomsday i believe that it is possible to contain it one or two air bursts on soviet territory siberia will demonstrate the point adequately no said the admiral his tone tense with urgency sir if were talking about it risking a nuclear war because we have to then our first shots should at least hit vital military targets the kola peninsula for example one air burst there could knock out three major military bases including one ssbn base hell one burst over siberia unless it hits an icbm site right in the middle of the bullseye will only kill a few reindeer and wipe out a village or two in the boonies and what in hell do we think theyd be doing in the meantime in moscow no the way we do it mr president is to launch an icbm landbased or sub and not have it head for some outlying area that muscovites dont give a damn about but aim for a highly strategic target thatll show em were not fooling around if we have to do it we should go for a hard military target the bigger the better not a wild shot somewhere in the boonies the admirals quite right sir said air force general allet if were going to use the stick might as well show them we can put our missiles where it hurts them most why not moscow then asked mayne because theyd all be in the shelters explained general grey yes confirmed the chief of naval operations theyd be down there well out of air burst range many of the deep tunnels are nuclearrepellant superhardened perhaps said president mayne we could give them a message some other way any suggestions not at the moment sir answered grey then put your backs to it enjoined mayne meanwhile i want you to send the word out that no commander is to use any chemical or biological weapons without my personal directive sir said press secretary trainor we could have a problem with doug freeman on this hes a brilliant field commander but if the chinese pour everything theyve got into north korea he might be tempted to cross the yalu use millimeter a tips goldarn it said mayne turning on grey general you tell freeman that he is not to cross the yalu he is to stay this side of it and do what hes damn well told yes sir mayne leaned forward shaking his head letting a pencil hed been twirling fall from his fingers what a mess war usually is commented harry schuman the president could feel the migrane getting a stranglehold on him despite his preemptive strike chapter thirtynine it was bitterly cold the yalu river taking on a strange ethereal blue though it was still an hour till sundown despite the piercing cold and the exposed forward position of outpost delta norton felt much more comfortable in the hills overlooking the yalu than hed been in the claustrophobic warmth of the boeing they wont try gas here he proclaimed confidently what makes you think they wont pressed freeman looking down through deltas field scope moving it through a degree arc west to east over the valley below where the ground tumbled away to flats a quarter mile from the frozen river and the wild snowcovered mountains of manchuria beyond you think theyre more afraid of us than they are of the rok no sir answered norton but theyre too close to us sir up here the major says the wind can change because of that valley below quicker than you can blink freeman was worried delta had barely been blooded and morale was rockbottom all along the korean front following creighs humiliating defeat jim said freeman still looking through the scope you know the prime tactic of the chinese infantry lets see if i can remember my little red book said norton when the enemy attacks withdraw when the enemy withdraws attack always seemed pretty much like common sense to me general freeman stood up from the scope hands on his hips resting on the two leather holsters yes i know and put the door back on the house when you leave he turned to norton that was old mao cow dungs way of teaching his peasant army not to act like occupiers when they went through a village get the peoples backs up and they turn against you instead of helping you often used a door for a table in a village only damn thing big enough youre right though most of its pretty much common sense at least when youre not in the thick of battle freeman squinted for though the sun was starting to dip down to the mountains behind him there was a glare coming from the broken china of whitecovered peaks beyond the yalu as the mountains of manchuria reflected the suns dying rays but some of their tactics arent so obvious jim ever figure out why they attack en masse logistics plenty of em i guess one mans there to pick up anothers rifle if they havent got enough arms dont pick up a dropped weapon you could lose it especially in the snow true answered freeman still looking at the mountains trying to detect anything that might signify the chinese positions it looked snowbound and deserted attacking in numbers like that also panics defenders said freeman unless theyre veterans but the main reason jim is that the chinese infantry commanders more than any others want to close with americans more than with any other army want to get as many men in and around our positions as they can with our firepower general seems a pretty crazy tactic freeman said nothing for a moment looking through the scope again know what they used to say at the movies when i was a boy jim whats that general freeman swung the scope to the northern sector of the field of fire overlooking the valley and the big bend in the river too quiet and thats what im feeling now too damned quiet he turned about and briskly drew deltas hq bunker curtain aside major how long you say its been since the last engagement yesterday morning sir about nothing since then not even sniper fire the major emerged from the bunker pulling his collar up against the wind that was blowing snow off the crests of the hill you figure theyve gone back to beijing general the hell i do those riceeating sons of bitches are over that river dug in somethings brewing i can smell it maybe theyre going to hit us in another sector general proffered the major now theyve pushed creigh back and driven a wedge between first army in the west and ten corps further east maybe theyre moving west to reinforce the wedge spread it out between us i havent seen any sign of them moving major replied freeman not in daylight general chinks are night birds intelligence put in norton havent reported any movement west intelligence snorted freeman his breath steaming in the air thats cold comfort jim intelligence with all that damn satellite gear didnt see any of them when they first hit us they came over that river and were butchering creighs men before he knew it i realize that said norton but the intelligence boys were having trouble with their thermal sensors then general sometimes when the weather gets they had trouble with their sensors jim when our boys were hit in the middle of the night at the beginning of this war by two chinese divisions by god we flew over the changsong road yesterday creigh didnt even have time to bury his head littered along the highway like he turned to the major ill tell you the first thing were going to do here major is mount reconnaissance patrols in this area right across the front day and night until we find out what the hell those bastards are up to i dont want another chinese breakthrough here and another thing major i want all cooking fires put out c rations only and a fortyeight hour ban on smoking and start digging z turns and star trenches put all the dirt at the end of the trenches not over the top otherwise the chinksll see the fresh soil itd stand out a mile in this snow right now my hunch is those sons of heaven are sitting around and having more than a political meeting theyre dotting their maps with our positions for a night attack making sure they know where we all are so they wont lose their way in the razor wire gazing across at the now iceblue fastness of manchuria freeman shook his head not at something seen but as norton could tell out of respect for his enemy say what you like gentlemen those bastards are geniuses at burrowing under the earth he paused ever been to china major no sir i was there in the nineteen eighties before tiananmen went to see the clay warriors they dug up in xian fullsized all in full battle order theyd been there thousands of years longer than the pyramids and nobody knew about them till the nineteen seventies completely hidden imagine an entire army emperor qin wanted his army to guard him in death hadnt been for some peanut farmer kicking up a bit of clay with his plow theyd still be hidden no wonder we cant spot the tunnels from the air its a contest who is better digging tunnels chinese or the vietcong jim norton rolled his eyes at the major freeman was good for a half hour on tunnels anytime day or night the ingenuity of construction the ammunition dumps built off to the side the traps for the unwary happily for norton the generals lecture on the enemys art was interrupted by the rolling thunder of the sonic boom from four fs thundering high above the bleak white humps of the snowcovered hills that tumbled down toward the flats in front of the yalu by the time the jets had passed overhead the delta hq major had been called in by a signal corpsman with an urgent transmit from seoul freeman stood watching the fighters contrails as they went into a tight bank to the northeast following the snaking line of the yalu to the tamur and the sea of japan might be shirer up there jim said freeman beautiful things arent they yes sir but im just as happy to leave them to the flyboys well commented freeman as the delta major reappeared well be off strategys straightforward enough change your internal placements mortars machine guns that attack yesterday morning was probably just a probe to pinpoint your positions you shift things about like i told you and well give em a big surprise when they come up this hill again the major was looking worried preferring that the general had said if the chinese came up the hill again the mens morale was bad enough after creigh s humiliating withdrawal without confronting them with the prospect of another battle you and your boys are going to have to hold these ridges major till we can mount a counterattack chinese get up here with their artillery overlooking the next valley theyll make mincemeat of us thats what happened to creigh so i dont want anybody falling back understood yes general as freeman and norton walked down from the snowy crest toward the snowcovered sandbagged chopper pad the rotor slap of the black hawk was already fibrillating the air curling up snow on the rim of the hill the general heard a voice complaining above the roar of the motors yeah well shit man freemans same as creigh wont see im do it freeman stopped turned back into the trench walked around the z bend and found himself looking at a dozen or so blearyeyed and unshaven gis what wont you see me do soldier there was silence what wont i do repeated freeman a gi using his rifle like a staff hauled himself reluctantly to his feet his voice low almost drowned by the sound of the chopper sorry general wont see me doing what soldier norton saw the soldier visibly gulp trying to find the spittle to answer freeman well bellowed freeman taking out a patrol answered the soldier sir freeman was sniffing the air like a bloodhound whos wearing fairy water the gis looked at one another perplexed several clearly frightened a few not giving a damn leaning sullenly against the trench behind the general norton was making a quick pantomime for the gis as if he were applying deodorant beneath his arm ah me sir said one of the younger more hapless gis by god said freeman i oughta have you skinned you know how far a chink can smell no one answered from here to beijing youre endangering the safety of the whole position a position taken out soldier will break the whole line a line breached and you could cost a battle a war you understand y yes sir the private saluted you bury that fairy stick right now and wash out your armpits growled freeman freeman saluted turned to go stopped and asked them why havent you shaved no hot water said a private sir since when does one of my soldiers need hot water to shave freeman challenged derisively where the hell you think you are soldier at college no sir you shave that fuzz off that goes for all of you understand there was a murmur of yes sirs no one was looking at him his anger seemed to sear them as he stalked off toward the helo pad norton increased his pace to keep up going down the hill jim norton tapped the general before they got too close to the chopper for freeman to hear him general sir what freeman shouted above the noise sir the deodorant stick fine sir they needed to be told about that but the shaving sir norton said nothing more his tone carrying implicit criticism damn it jim their morales rockbottom they start to lose respect for themselves their appearance the next is a slide into lack of selfconfidence no matter what the weaponry jim you know well as i do low morale loses wars good god if vietnam didnt teach us anything it taught us that i realize that sir replied norton his voice rising to overcome the chopper one hand holding on to his helmet but you told me once the chinese have a thing about facial hair remember any body hair other than where it should be see it as the sign of a barbarian barbarians scare them you said general freeman grunted youre telling me i overreacted before norton could answer the general waved to the chopper pilot to shut her down he was a stickler for setting the example about not wasting gas or anything else at the front creigh had lost over a hundred tons of supplies along with howitzers which hadnt yet been replaced besides he didnt want the chinese picking up too much of the blown snow from the choppers wash to better pinpoint delta yes sir norton told him straight uncomfortably but fearlessly you did overreact and you said if ever you did i had your permission to yes yes said freeman grumpily walking away from norton and the chopper pad hands clasped behind him head bowed trudging below the line of the hill it reminded norton of a painting hed seen of napoleon on the eve of the battle for austerlitz when freeman returned from his solitary walk his hands were on his holsters youre right jim i did overreact but he sighed looking over at the iceblue hills those men in there think im a damned coward he looked at norton a goddamn yellow belly no sir im sure higher up the totem pole you get confided freeman his gaze taking in the long frozen snake of the yalu more you lose touch commanders got to lead jim this whole front is moribund you could smell it in there that wasnt sweat that was the odor of fear creighs defeat has passed through the whole front like diarrhea thatll get more men killed than chinese bullets he cast his gaze in the direction of the scattered american positions on the hilltops to the west by god thats whats wrong here jim its a defeated army well maybe now sir but when we counterattack with what freeman growled troops with that kind of morale wont do it hell why should they creigh gets stressed out and runs leaderships gone sir they know you were at pyongyang that no jim that was last season old coach like me knows better than that all they see now is someone flying around in this eggbeater giving em the old rah rah rah he was walking away from norton again no jim it wont work this team wont attack on the basis of my old win last years pennant besides chinese werent in the game then our boys have got goddamned dragon disease freeman was staring ahead but norton could see it wasnt the north korean fastness that arrested him but memories when i was a youngster freeman confided my parents would take me into frisco to see the chinese new year celebrations i remember the very sight of a dragon in chinatown was more terrifying to me than anything else i could think of fire coming out of its nose damned thing snaking all about these boys are scared shitless of the chinese see it in their eyes he turned around to norton gloved hands on his holsters one second right arm sweeping toward the yalu the next they dont need me for strategy here blind man could figure out the attack plan in five minutes theres the yalu beat the bastards back any first lieutenant worth his sam browne could figure it out what we need is esprit de corps and fast thats why they havent been sending out enough patrols up here to get the information we need you cant fight an enemy if you cant see he stopped there was fire in his eyes that norton knew was unstoppable you know freeman raced on why the chinks want to get so close to us freeman answered his own question because jim they know we wont call our artillery down on our own men theyre frightened of our artillery were the best and fastest in the world at setting up and bracketing an enemy attack we can rain down millimeters on them within ten minutes of an attack sooner if were already in place you know what they do if we close with them hand to hand norton didnt have to answer thats right said freeman theyll bring down fire on their own men thats why they want to close with us and the sooner they do it the less time we have for our artillery to break up their attack and once they close theyll use our boys those that are left alive as hostages against our artillery he paused his breathing slowed as if by will thats why weve got to beat them to the punch find out exactly where their assembly areas are and bring air support and artillery down on their rat tunnels before they can move out in the fading light there was still a quarter hour to sunset he called out to the delta major yes general youre a witness freeman informed him his voice lowering so as not to be overheard by the men i know why the chinese havent attacked in the last twentyfour hours and now i know why its too damned quiet jim the major looked at norton but the colonel was as perplexed as he was nka have already used it on their own people those bastards have withdrawn across the river because theyre going to use gas before norton could respond freeman raced on jim this is an order first whiff you get you have weapons release from me as cic korea to reply with millimeter atomic warhead artillery you hear that major yes sir but hell major i want eight men grenades and a squad automatic weapon general began the major alarmed thats an order major now yes sir norton spoke quietly sir washingtonll have my hide if anything jim i want it known that im taking out a patrol and i mean i want every son of a bitch from here to seoul to know i want them to know that their c in c isnt afraid of some ricepicking comrade and i want that nuclear artillery release written down on a message pad so i can sign it in front of you and the major and send it in plain language to seoul hq i want those commie bastards to intercept it the general lowered his voice glancing about to see whether any gi was nearby jim you and i know that those cbw zoo suits theyve issued arent worth a pinch of coon crap and the commies know it christ this weathers perfect for it goddamned visors on our suitsll steam up for a start if i had my choice id rather the in two minutes in the open from a gas attack than shit myself to death for ten inside one of those damned contraptions now you make sure you get a kraut car up here on every battalion front within the next twentyfour hours if their spectrometers signal cbw presence you let loose with those a tips there wont be any time to screw around then i want you to flash saceur brussels hq and tell them that operation merlin is to go yes general freeman signaled the chopper pilot to start her up as norton using his thigh as a table wrote down the order to have a kraut germanmade fox nbc nuclear biological chemical weapons reconnaissance vehicle moved up immediately from kusong to delta after the general signed it norton held out his hand for an embarrassing moment the general thought it was for his pen then he realized norton was saying goodbye freeman shook hands norton asking i suppose theres no way i can talk you out of this general course not said freeman grinning you know better than that yes sir freeman smacked norton affectionately on the shoulder god go with you jim the colonel tried to answer but couldnt instead he saluted then turning to the major gave him the second copy of the message for transmit from delta outpost hq to seoul lest the chopper be hit in transit lowering his head left hand holding his helmet down norton ran to board the chopper as the black hawk took off in a bluishwhite swirl of snow freeman turned and saw eight white figures the gis in their white camouflage overlays straggling out from the trench you boys volunteer asked freeman as he clipped on the grenades and took the squad automatic weapon and pack from the major you kidding general replied one man but there was a new tone a respect that freeman knew would spread like wildfire down the line as the reconnaissance patrol left major sir it wasnt a peanut farmer but it was a farmer it took a second for the major to remember the generals story about the chinese farmer who discovered the massive chinese army underground you ever miss anything general very little major very little then freeman walked to the front of the section to take the point all right boys follow me in the chopper colonel norton was gripping his seat tightly but added to his fear of flying was the haunting terrible response of the chinese general lin biao who when macarthur had once threatened the chinese red army with the abomb had replied so we lose a million or two chapter forty in seoul or what was left of it after the pulverizing it had taken during the nka invasion of the south and again when the americans breaking out of the pusanyosu perimeter had counterattacked before being bogged down by the massive intervention of the chinese there was no hesitation in sending the choppers loaded with atomictipped shells to the forward positions overlooking the yalu news of the chineses use of nerve gas had sent a shiver down the spine of every allied commander from the yalu to the russian front outside minsk and the failure of enough supplies getting through the soviet sub packs only fueled the apprehension of frontline commanders as presidential adviser schuman warned that the russians seeing a brief window of opportunity before the allies could build up enough support for the final push into russia might strike with cbw weapons of their own all along the nato front in beijing china radio was broadcasting charges that the ultimate degradation of bourgeois capitalism was evident in washingtons criminal use of chemical weapons from napalm to the gas supplied by america to the rok lackeys and pirates who had on the orders of washington attacked the freedomloving people of the peoples republic of china with nerve gas as kiril marchenko stepped out of his zil limousine for the emergency meeting of the politburo and presidential advisers in the council of ministers building snow had stopped falling but one glance at the heavy metalliccolored sky told him it was only a brief lull in the latest arctic storm sweeping down from murmansk to moscow and on to the polish plain as president suzlov moved from his desk to the conference table of his enormous office under the gaze of marx aides carried piles of the redstriped green folders of war reports distributing them to the politburo and stavka members less than half of whom had been able to make it on such short notice marchenko was worried by the implacable expression worn by kgb chief chernko who he noticed had been seated immediately to the right of the president both suzlov and chernko were quintessential apparatchikibureaucrats efficient cool but marchenko thought lacking the human dimension a deficiency evident in chernkos argument that a gas attack was now sovershenno mozhnymquite feasibleagainst the nato front given the strong prevailing southwestward flows of arctic air that wouldnt endanger soviet troops suzlov opened the emergency meeting to questions a meeting that marchenko quietly noted to his aide didnt have enough members present to constitute a legal party quorum marchenko already leaning against the highly polished table his reflection melting like all the others into a blur of khaki and red collar tabs of the general staff asked mr president i wish to point out that whether a southern wind southwest put in chernko pedantically but without the slightest malice southwest then continued marchenko the supposition that this will protect all our troops from the gas is rather hypothetical given i can assure comrade marchenko chernko cut in but was himself interrupted by suzlov let comrade marchenko finish thank you mr president as i was saying no matter that the prevailing winds at the moment may favor our deployments across the brest front this does not take into account local conditions local eddies which could engulf some of our forward units my wife who as you know is comrade in charge of moscow cbw defenses is very concerned by this we have seen in moscow that the existence of internal heating and certain structures produces totally unexpected results windy places where you would expect the point i am making comrade is that its very unpredictable im sure replied chernko dryly but we arent concerned with very many buildings on the front general yes yes a few cities perhaps but we must surely look at the macro situation comrades he made a face of grandfatherly regret admittedly a few peculiar local air currents conditions whatever you wish to call them may interfere with some forward troop deployments but on the whole the allies would suffer a crippling blow all across the front of the attack marchenko seemed to chernko as if he was about to cut in again and so chernko avoided his gaze addressing the rest of those present as if even those absent from the empty chairs were listening and one thing in which im sure that comrade marchenkos wife would concur is that our chemical biological warfare suits as well as our shelter defenses are far superior to those of the enemy with the possible exception of some recently issued to a few german regiments but as a part of the whole comrades this consideration is nothing what we have here is not only the chance to stop the allied invasion dead in its tracks but to buy us vital time for our submarines to cripple allied resupply indeed far from defeat comrades chernko was looking directly at president suzlov now i see the very definite possibility of victory comrade marchenko isnt taking into account the fact that within america my agents and spets cells long in place and recently activated have created havoc now comrades now is the moment you dont think asked suzlov that the americans will retaliate with chemical weapons chernko shook his head no mr president as we know the great weakness in the democracies is that they have to talk about everything for a month congress checking with their constituencies before they decide which toothpaste to use there was some laughter but marchenko was shaking his head telling chernko then comrade you havent got a clear grasp of america at war she is slow to respond at first yes but once in gear her production capacity is enormous and in crisis americans empower their executive to act swiftly if need be as comrade general responded chernko i agree wholeheartedly with you but i tell you they are not ready for this the logistics of warhead conversion to chemical warheads on their missiles is no small thing even for the americans and in two weeks it could all be over but we mustnt give them any longer this is why we have called this meeting its those damn chinese who got us into this interjected general arbatov in charge of moscow missile defense if ifs are quite pointless now put in chernko sharply yes said suzlov quickly comrade chernkos quite correct who started it the chinese or the north koreans though i suspect beijing is of no account the fact is gas is being used in any case beijings charging the americans with it anyway china radio broadcasts tying it in with napalm are very clever for what are fuel air explosives like napalm if they arent chemical but surely mr president said marchenko we cannot equate fuel air explosives with gas napalm dissipates so does nerve gas chernko replied challengingly but it is something comrade that radioactivity doesnt do the murmur of approval told chernko hed made a telling point this is true marchenko conceded but you are assuming that the americans wont answer a chemical attack with nuclear weapons they wont fire nuclear weapons first said suzlov ever since hiroshima the american presidents have made a fetish out of not being the first to fire a nuclear weapon public opinion in america will not allow washington to press the button what about their submarines asked admiral smernov of course this is a risk said chernko so is getting up in the morning it is war comrades and here again thanks to the expertise of comrade marchenkos wife and others like her in the moscow defense brigade we have not only a sustainable chemical defense plan for our capital but a nuclear one as well new york has no such comparable defense everyone would get mugged on the way to the shelters general arbatov commented there were a few snuffles of restrained amusement yes said suzlov if they had enough shelters which they dont well put comrade president said chernko the point is that americans have no shelter systems anywhere as good as ours they know this oh the american public have it in their heads that because weve had lineups for bread were as inefficient in everything else they do not realize as their scientists do how sophisticated our space and missile developments have been but washington knows it also knows were far better prepared for nuclear defense than they are far better this is deterrent enough for them suzlov nodded are we preparing our people for this chernko deferred to the junior politburo member in charge of the propaganda ministry comrade president the radio and tv chief began we are showing as much footage as we can of the americans using gas against their own people the chicago and los angeles riots have been particularly useful plus the recent footage of american troops in the philippines using gas to defend clark base against demonstrators and of course a lot of riot control gas from south korea we have so much to use its difficult thank you marchenko interceded not because he thought it was inappropriate to use such footage but because he wanted to point out that after gorbachevs brief fling with glasnost the russian people would surely be alert to the distinction between canister tear gas and nerve gas here the minister for propaganda fairly bristled with pride we have skillfully spliced the film of the american police in riot control using the gas with casualties from the bhopal chemical disaster from the american plant in india which killed hundreds and also other footage of american marines firing canisters so you not only have tear gas clouds fired by americans interjected marchenko but nerve gas victims as well is that correct yes comrade can you match color locale such things the minister for propaganda couldnt suppress a smile at the war ministers na√Øvet√© on such technical matters we have the best canadian documentary techniques comrade and west german technology to implement and splice marchenko bottom lip protruding nodded approvingly he wasnt one to hold grudges and he had to admit that chernko and the propaganda ministry had done a fine job in presenting their argument the propaganda minister added that they were getting much mileage from footage of the yellow rain defoliants the americans had used in vietnam together with napalm victims american peace activists and brushedup footage of an american actress in hanoi complete with vietcong pith helmet denouncing american fliers on hanoi radio as war criminals marchenko himself had a sudden and he thought convincing argument for chernkos position of course if the americans fired chemical weapon missiles in europe the west europeans would be furious the danger is obvious any winds that carry the gas to the allied front will certainly sweep further west over germany exactly said chernko seizing the moment comrade marchenko is exactly right on this point suzlov had said little and now all eyes were on him he was a man who had risen to power on party consensus and in a sense a decision on chemical warfare was not more or less important than any other requiring party solidarity we will come together again comrades i want a full vote it must be unanimous i can assure you mr president began chernko suzlov interrupted that the comrades not here will concur are you so sure comrade personally i find your argument a strong one but it must be unanimous from every stavka member this i insist must be on record he looked at his watch and announced given the urgency of the matter comrades we will meet here again tomorrow evening midnight waiting thirty hours will not scuttle your plan comrade suzlov assured chernko and it will give our other comrades time to attend how long would it take to launch the gas attack if we give it unanimous approval within the hour said chernko our frontline commanders are already on standby then we cant wait thirty hours chernko knew bureaucratic immovability when he saw it and suzlov wouldnt move until he got unanimous support yes mr president we can wait thirty hours good then notify all members well meet here tomorrow twentyfour hundred hours yes mr president suzlov nodded and walked back to his desk do you think well get unanimous support tomorrow night asked marchenko thats if we can get a forum chernkos smile was like that of an alcoholic asked if he could manage another drink it was a smile that told marchenko all the kgbs ious and power would be used to make sure that everyone who should vote would he wondered how much pressure the kgb chief at khabarovsk colonel nefski was applying to his son who apparently was persisting in his liaison with the jewish woman chapter fortyone sonar man emerson wasnt sure he liked the blue glow of the sonar room forward of roosevelts control he was used to working in the reddedout subs and in his view the argument that blue light around the sonar consoles made it easier for the operators to see the blips on the digitized display screen was debatable different strokes for different folks as he had told the chief of the boat the chief suspected however that emersons quandary over the light was really a cover for a much larger concern namely that this was emersons first trip under the ice it was for operators like moving to a different neighborhood lying in bed at night you knew it was traffic outside but familiarity with the different sounds took time to get used to unfortunately the war didnt allow you much time to learn especially given the rate of sub sinkings and sonar operator stress syndrome or sos as it was known among the operators many had spent up to sixteen hours at a stretch on seventyfiveday war patrols as the soviet subs lay in wait in the deep ocean ravines of the midatlantic ridge it was these ravines sounded and plotted by prewar soviet oceanographic research ships that had proved such a boon to the new soviet sub offensive no matter how good the nato warships depth and profile sounders were many of the ravines profiles were so jagged often near upwellings and other thermoclines that probing sonar signals were merely scrambled such sonar profiles revealed nothing more than the tops of the mountain ranges that formed the atlantic range despite the hours off watch that he had devoted sitting listening to the roosevelts librarytapes of enemy noise signatures and the types of sea noise to finetune his ability to distinguish between background sea clutter and heavy concentrations of arctic phytoplankton emerson still felt uneasy about this his first long war patrol in the high arctic while the rest of the crew actually felt safer below the roof of frozen sea the constant grinding of the pack ice was particularly disconcerting for a sonar operator the noise having a tendency to bully out all other sounds a fact that soviet subs had taken advantage of using their big cargo ships prop noise to drown out that of their subs as they broke out of their home ports just before war had officially broken out adding to emersons apprehension was roosevelts mission to remain as an undetected submarine launch platform for the fortytwo warheads atop the six trident missilesthe weapons of last resort roosevelts greatest defense its silence meant eschewing its active sonar whose outgoing noise pulses would give its position away as well as pinpointing the enemys this meant that unless emerson received a specific release order from either captain brentwood or the officer of the deck to go active all he could do was to stay in the passive mode however in passive there was no timespace ratio during the duration between an active sonars pulse and the return of its echo in short it would be impossible for him to tell accurately how far away a noise source was or in any icefree zone whether it was on the surface or submerged experienced sub hands often made fairly accurate guesstimates of the distance but this was based purely on experience not formula the fact that survival at sea was as much art as science had been brought home to emerson during the russian cruiser attacks against the american subs early in the war captain brentwoods advice to a colleague had once saved that mans sub and his crew when acting quickly in an evasive maneuver he had simultaneously ordered that the bodies of two men who had died due to flooding caused by a previous depth charge attack be cut up and blown to the surface in several of the torpedo tubes along with diesel oil and assorted garbage convincing the russian sub chaser that theyd done their job emersons sense of responsibility the knowledge that he could mistake a biological noise such as the sudden turn of a tightly bunched school of fish for an attacking sub weighed heavily on him it would mean life or death for the entire crew for if he didnt identify an enemy sub quickly enough thered be no time for brentwood to get a fish off and yet if he mistakenly identified a noise as a sub when it wasnt and brentwood fired then at that very moment of the torpedos release any enemy sub listening would hear the highpressure ejection and the cavitation of the torpedos propeller and would know exactly where the roosevelt was the responsibility on emerson was made worse by the crews wellintentioned assurances to him that now they were under the ice he wouldnt have to worry about cvs surface vessels oh no emerson thought what if he heard a sudden crackling noise would it be the sound of a soviet sub icepicking through the twelvefootthick ice cap to fire a cruise missile or would it be simply the ice pressure sounding off as great bergs calved off one section of the ice pack came up against another ice sheet if you got too close to the sound layer next thing you might hear could be a triple three enemy torpedoes vectoring you even as you dived emerson devoutly wished they were back in the good old plain dangerous north atlantic and not up here in the depths of the greenland sea to make matters worse emerson could hear a crew member a new planesman being reminded by one of the chiefs that beneath the sea sound traveled in excess of miles per hour compared to the mere miles per hour in air the sound in the seas racing through the more tightly bunched molecules of water but now at least the roosevelt was traveling at ten miles per hour and quietly courtesy of her anechoic soundabsorbing paint and her antivibration quotient engines furthermore emerson took some comfort in knowing that because of the slow speed it would be more difficult for the enemy to pick up even the noise of her pumps which had to be kept on constantly in order to cool the subs nuclear reactor which provided not only the superheated steam for generators to drive the prop but power for everything else aboard the sub it was at that moment two hours into the dogwatch that emerson while watching normal pop bottle fizz electronic panicles jumping in uniform sine waves on his sonar computer heard the sound of what he thought must be massive schools of shrimp clacking bearing one six three degrees from the size of the blip and the direction he guessed it was about ten miles from molloy deep and worked back the vectors it was also at this moment that able seaman arthur g leach a steward was changing the bed linen on the executive officers bunk in the relatively tiny stateroom seeing a walkman on the bed he bent over picked it up and for a moment seeing no one was around slipped on the earphones and pressed the button some old pop singer called buddy holly was singing a peppy song called peggy sue leach hadnt heard the song before but it had a nice peppy beat to it bout some guy head over heels in love kinda mushy but catchy reminding him of his high school dates after finishing the linen change emptying the wastepaper basket and putting the walkman back on the captains bed leach headed down toward the galley for a coffee break he walked behind the serving counter took a mug out of its antiroll hole and lifted the threequarterfull silex pot of coffee out of its antiroll cradle then it happened whether the thing that started it was leach still moving to the beat of the song hed just heard or as he was to claim later thered been an alteration made in the trim of the ship which had caused the ship to yaw slightly the fact was it happened some said it was a spot of butter on the galleys decking that had probably caused him to lose his footing other than leach the first to hear or rather to see it was emerson in the blue glow of the sonar room one deck above suddenly he saw the steady hiccuping of ice grind and shrimp clacking interrupted by a burp a rounded sine wave on the trace at zero seconds which told him immediately that it had come from within the sub he pressed the button for officer of the deck in control zeldman ood emerson could tell from zeldmans relaxed tone that they hadnt heard it in control but even now he knew that the lowfrequency thud in the onehundred to sixhundredhertz range was radiating out from the hull at over three thousand miles per hour what have you got asked zeldman easily noise short sir from the sub christ how long emerson had already run back the tape it was one point two two seven seconds duration sir where in the sub any ideas galley maybe short in one of the pumps insulation shot i dunno for sure hold on zeldman said pressing the intercom for the chief of the boat chief weve got a noise short take a party of six quickly quietly for a visual check im calling all compartments now were on our way sir said the chief next zeldman pressed the engine room intercom they reported nothing wrong he went to the next most likely possibility the galley a bread mixer or some other piece of equipment that may have shorted out or not been seated properly before someone had had a chance to switch it off galley seaman leach weve had a noise short any of those mixers been on no sir ah sir yes uh sorry sir i dropped the coffeepot sort of busted against the bulkhead i guess busted must have exploded for sonar to pick it up on the passive now tell me straight sailor and dont frig around did it kind of bust or did it explode was it full or empty uhit was kind of full sir dont you touch another thing stay right where you are yes sir sorry zeldman had already turned to the diving officer take her to two thousand feet it was approaching their crush depth two thousand sir said the officer of the deck the order repeated again by the planesman who gently pushed the control column forward as a pilot would in a shallowangled dive theyd been running near the surface hiding in the ice clutter and if the angle of dive was too acute too fast the stern of the foot sub was in danger of slamming hard up against the ice creating an even bigger noise short watch the bubble zeldman heard the diving officer caution calmly in the background zeldman shot a quick glance at the chart at the same time instructing the diving officer to call the depth three hundred feet three fifty four hundred zeldman quickly computed a new course away from their original tack and the moment the diving officer informed him they were at two thousand he ordered change of course steer zero five two change in course zero five two speed ten knots speed ten knots and if any other son of a bitch makes a noise ill have his guts for garters no one spoke until zeldman leaving the reddedout control walked forward into the more comforting blue glow of the sonar room but he knew the psychological effect of the color change was merely an illusion pray to god emerson no one heard us yes sir but praying was no good one point two two seven seconds was an age for someone whose digitized innards registered a noise lasting only milliseconds the russian alfa had seen the ikotahiccupclearly on its sonar screen and in any case even if the operator had not actually seen it a tone alarm on the console would have alerted him to the incoming noise short cutting into the otherwise steady pattern of incoming sine waves captain yanov ordered the alfa to alter course heading straight along the noise source bearing and ordered all torpedo tubes which were situated forward ready for action he did not want to switch on his active pinger for this would alert the other sub nor did he wish to increase speed too quickly for even though his was the quietest class of soviet submarine his cooling pumps did not make him inaudible and all they had was a heading a bearing on the noise no measure of distance yet he had no intention of losing the sub whose distance despite the lack of any accurate electronic means of measuring it without using an active pinger was estimated by yegor petrov his best sonar operator purely on the basis of his long experience in the arctic as being probably plus or minus fifteen kilometers nine miles from them yanov looked down at his chart overlay covering the spitzbergen fracture zone any of our subs in the area he asked his ood apart from us that is officer of the deck ivashko had already anticipated the captains question checking their position against the colored strips of the other russian hunterkiller patrol routes should be no interdiction with any of ours captain spitzbergen trench is all ours then he must be american or british said yanov could it be he asked sonar operator petrov theyve found a soft patch in the ice run out their trailing antenna and taken in a vlf signal from their headquarters or possibly a location check to headquarters a transmit or a noise short from the surface maybe not a sub at all one of their asw choppers smashing through the ice to dunk a listening buoy no said the sonar operator doing his best to contain his amusement at the captains hypothesizing yanov was undoubtedly a great captain the sonar operator had no doubt of this otherwise he would not be commander of an alfa but the control room officers never understood the nuances of the passive arrays no sir he repeated nothing from the surface besides radio muster for all allied ships is hours sir its now given the frequency i think someone dropped a wrench or something what would he do mused the soviet captain if he knows hes given off a noise short he turned to the sonar operator petrov you think he knows if he doesnt captain his sonar man was asleep id go deep said ood ivashko yes of course concurred captain yanov but will he hover or keep going its too deep to sit on the bottom if he hovers captain answered the ood and he thinks he might have been heard then he must expect his pursuer to reach him sooner or later if he stays on the same heading if i were him id keep moving slowly zigzagging backtracking which direction asked the captain its an eastwest trench said ivashko thinking aloud if he runs south or north hes going into shallow water no one likes that ah but canyon walls would help him eh number one a lot of sound comes off canyon walls right sonar deep feeders rock falls noise from ice running down the cliff faces scuttling and bouncing off a canyon wall can bury a lot of other sound even so said ivashko id shy away from the canyon walls captain the racket from them could smother his passive arrays as well as hide him hed be running deafened by canyon noise the captain conceded the point yes personally i would go up closer to the ice away from the canyon there you have the ice noise but can reel out your passive array well below you you would still pick up the ice noise but its much steadier than in a canyon its a static you can recognize right petrov petrov gave a conditional nod the kind that irritated ivashko damn sonar men always thought they belonged to a higher priesthood to which mere mortals such as officers of the deck neither had access to nor aptitude for then said captain yanov i think its time to release a jonah this was a quiet buoygirded tearshaped container of approximately liter capacity about half the size of a gallon drum but designed to create the least possible resistance as it quietly moved through the water inside jonah was intricately designed to contain microtape and speakers with a mechanical timer of ten minutes to two hours duration once released from the hull powered by a quiet batteryrun plastic prop and preset to travel to a point approximately twothirds along the bearing of a noise short the tearshaped container would rise until it was approximately three hundred feet below the surface in this case within three hundred feet of the ice here activated by its timer it would emit a powerfully amplified sound usually that of a whale the sound waves racing out from the jonah would deflect off the russian submarine as well as off the american but because the alfa would be farther away from the jonah the noise source jonahs sound reflected off the american sub would reach the russian sub sooner than the sound from jonah reflected off the russian sub would reach the americans the alfa would then not only have the american subs heading but also because of the time lapse between the emission of the sound from the jonah and its echoed return the alfa would now also know exactly how far away the american sub was it would be toward this position that the alfa would now head not at flank speed lest its pumps be picked up but at fifteen knots until it was within torpedo range but this would only work if the enemy kept proceeding on its last known heading to be absolutely sure where it was and to verify that it was still within the alfas torpedo range a second jonah would be released this noise box again with a preset capacity of between ten minutes and two hours would emit a much different noise the sudden whoosh of a torpedo launch once this was picked up by the american captain he would have to make a splitsecond decision either to make an evasive dive hoping to shake off what he would believe to be an attack of metallic homing torpedoes or to fire his own mark radar homing torpedoes to hopefully intercept the more quickly fired russian torpedo captain yanov looked at his watch the american could have increased speed pulling away from the jonah he checked with sonar anything on screen nothing but shrimp and ice captain stand by to release the second jonah ordered yanov standing by to release second jonah release released sir torpedo room ready said yanov bending low his finger still on the intercom button ready sir it would be another fifteen to thirty minutes before the second jonah would be far enough away from the alfa if the bait of the firing torpedo sound was taken by the americans the alfa would be far enough back not to be caught in the pressure of the americans exploding torpedoes the alfa nevertheless still in torpedo range itself in any event if the americans fired the alfa would have an exact fix on them using the noise of the americans torpedoes exploding around the torpedosounding jonah the alfa would then race forward at full speed approaching fifty miles an hour slow stop fire its tubes and wait if he fires instructed captain yanov it will likely be one or two of his fortyeights range fortysix kilometers twentyfive meters a second wire trailing until its radar homing takes over and so if he fires we go immediately to attack flank speed understood understood confirmed the torpedo officer were ready captain good said yanov he then turned to the officer of the deck if we fire well wait five seconds to clear then go to maximum depth understood understood captain good chapter fortytwo the white cottages of scotland were tiny dots far below the weather outside the hercules fine but windy inside however all david brentwood and the other twentyseven sas trainee finalists were aware of was the thunderous roaring and vibration of the engines remember shouted the sas sarmajor you arent jumping to entertain the crowd at a county fair civilian jumpers dont have full military kit on their back so in order for you to maintain starfish posture you must i repeat must control turns and cross tracking by keeping all extremities extended in starfish pattern until three thousand feet when your chute will open automatically do not repeat do not grab air unless as a last resort wait until you are positive something is wrong with your automatic altimeter release before you attempt to open it by hand under your belly the danger was that trying to grab air directly in front of the helmet in order to maintain stability while using the free hand to pull the reserve chutes grip could send you into a tumble like a plane out of control during which arms and legs could become entangled by the chutes cords there was a loud whine and the ramp was going down yawning over the purplish blue of scotlands western highlands the glens between the hills no larger than the size of a penny from eleven thousand feet the red light went on stand up shouted the sarmajor goggles on the stick of twentynine men seven groups of four the basic sas unit with cheekdawson leading was about to go out for their first halo for brentwood lewis thelman and schwarzenegger who were in the same fourman unit and who had stayed together through the grueling three and four phases of sas training the highaltitude lowopening jump was almost a relief anything was a relief after phase twos killing fortymile fullpack crosscountry march each man alone with full seventypound pack and weapon having to complete the forty miles in under forty hours thought scotlandd be covered in snow in early january shouted lewis scottish people like being different aussie said the german he pronounced aussie with a slow deliberateness that belied his alertness and agility in training east africa said aussie looking down at the wild folds of scotland thats where ive seen hills like that before thought we were going to southeast asia thelman ribbed him well somewhere in the tropics said lewis wanna bet no thanks the sarmajor felt good about the group as hed seldom heard them talk with such easy banter before their first halo even when theyd done regular para jumps before the camaraderie came from the special cohesiveness formed among the four men who were theoretically leaderless but who had a group confidence that had grown steadily after the exhausting sorting out hardships of the first few weeks green light go called the nco tapping the first man as he went out looking like a combination of some great bird of prey and a stuntman going for a belly flop the difference was they were now in full battle kit and would reach miles per hour in the first sixty seconds of the free fall until their chutes would open automatically they hoped at three thousand cheekdawson the first out immediately slid off to the left to avoid the possibility of midair collision with the men in the stick coming after him he did not expect them to keep any kind of tight formation in this early jump but was mainly concerned with seeing that they kept their starfish stability as they dropped toward the purple smoke spiraling up wispily from around the landing zone he saw the third man in trouble almost immediately and going into a slip roll gaining speed he glided laterally reaching the man he kept four to six feet away from him taking his left arm the man almost in a tumble his bergen pack though tight enough had not prevented a dangerous shift of weight on his back once he had got the mans starfish under control cheekdawson gestured to him to keep his arms fully extended cheekdawson moved on to the next man he saw wobbling one of brentwoods group he thought the german twentysix seconds had gone and by the time he had assisted the german it was fortyseven seconds twelve seconds till the chutes would automatically open he looked over the stick of men who now looked more like a scattered flock when be saw the first man hed helped get steady going into a tumble the mans left hand shot out in front of his helmet to grab air in an effort to steady himself while pulling the manual release with his other hand two things happened simultaneously the mans chute opened and he tumbled into the cords and cheekdawson immediately went into a fast lateral slide with ten seconds to go it was too late for cheekdawson to help despite the expresstrainlike roaring of the wind rushing past his ears he nevertheless heard the crisp snap of his chute opening at three and a half thousand suddenly stopping him the other mans chute a roman candle its black silk a streamer second on the ground was david brentwood he saw cheekdawson swiftly and expertly folding his chute while he david released the parachute harness and ran over to the fallen man the man had struck soft moorland but his head had burst like a coconut a hairy mash splattered on the turf the mans body strangely flat an illusion created by the fact that hitting the ground at over one hundred miles per hour his body had penetrated six inches into the turf every bone broken brentwood bawled out cheekdawson sir go and fold your chute man see it for bloody miles the only thing david could think of was that this was only their first halo there would be two more daylights this same day and then a night halo from twentyfive thousand feet full kit and oxygen masks chapter fortythree as the ixe sludgeremoval vesselselfpropelled puttputted out of san diego harbor the carrier uss salt lake city towered above the tiny vessel like a skyscraper and even the men on the hangar deck one story below the flight deck looked toysized to brentwood while the carriers anchor chain alone would have sunk his barge one of the sailors high up on the hangar deck holding a bucket gazed down at the small slab of wood that was the barges deck and at the butterbox wheelhouse mockingly he saluted the tiny apparition there was a roar of laughter from the carrier made louder by its echoing off its enormous steel sides as ray brentwood and his nine men the other two of the crew of eleven in the engine room or rather engine cubbyhole returned the salute brentwoods face was flushed hot with embarrassment as more and more of the carriers sailors and yardbirds working on the great ship lined up stem to stern to watch the joke sail by one of the salt lake city crewmen part of the onehundredchef contingent aboard the fivethousandman carrier grabbed a loudhailer calling out dont you go bumpin into us now what is it hollered another man smitty you drop that garbage overboard it was light relief for the men on the carrier who were in for refit after the salt lake city had been attacked a thousand miles north of the hawaiian islands en route to launch carrierbased attacks against the russianheld aleutian islands more islands had fallen to the russians as they drew ever closer to unalaskas dutch harbor two blackjack tupolev x bombers swooping in low on afterburner at mach had released their sixteen tons of ordnance including a cluster of airtosurface kingfish missiles two of the pound missiles coming in at the salt lake city at over meters per second had been shot out of the air by the carriers phalanx radarguidedmillimetermachinegun batteries firing dense sprays of highvelocity depleteduranium bullets two of the missiles were struck at three hundred meters from the ship exploding raining whitehot debris onto the sea the fireball from one streaming from a hundredpound fragment of the missiles midsection kept going hitting the carriers island wiping out prifly control and demolishing the backup ops board seven sailors had been killed outright eight others badly burned of the remaining two russian missiles one was taken out a mile from the carrier by a fivethousandpound sea sparrow though it was the men on themillimeter fiftyroundpersecond vulcan antimissile gun batteries festooning the carriers side who claimed credit for downing the missile the remaining kingfish was a dud but unstopped did the most damage of all its pounds traveling at seventeen hundred miles an hour striking the carriers starboard side above the waterline on the starboard quarter with the impact of a heavyhaul locomotive hitting a metal garage door the missile disintegrating and though not exploding tearing through ten bulkheads the resulting shrapnel killing men and injuring scores of others leaving a gaping jaggedtoothed hole twenty feet long and fifteen feet high the friction of the impact started several fires one of which its flames shooting up airconditioning ducts ignited three grumman intruder bombers the resulting explosion killed fifteen men and destroyed over million worth of airplanes and spare parts as well as scorching the forward starboard side of the hangar the fumes from the paint downing several maintenance crews and getting into the pilots ready rooms sandwiched between hangar and flight deck it was little wonder then that the crew now safely back in port thought that a little levity at the expense of ixe sludge removal was in order but for ray brentwood and his hapless crew it was a humiliation that not even the gregarious and convivial seaman jones could forget or forgive shortly a deck officer aboard the carrier came down to the edge of one of the lower loading flight decks ordering the jeering crew back to work and when they had gone in the worst humiliation of all the officer cast a brief pitying glance in brentwoods direction before disappearing from view the ixe started to buck in a chop coming in from the direction of point loma a chop that would not even be discernible to the dozens of warships and the carrier high above flying the pennants of battle honors won while the warships crews were readying again for war ray brentwood had the decidedly dull and uninspiring task of plowing up the coast fifteen miles off the beach where a hysterical member of the la jolla chapter of environmental watch had reported another massive oil spill when they got there seaman jones estimated it was an iddy biddy spill of no more than a hundred gallons probably burped out by one of the warships or one of the coastplying cargo vessels the barge nudged about in the increasing swell its very motion seeming to brentwood as resentful as the harsh coughing of its engine while the flexible polyethylene hose that served as a boom trailed off the stern with all the enthusiasm of a sullen snake flopping into the water to contain the rainbowstreaked chocolatemousse oil that stained the cobalt blue of the sea down with the hose ordered brentwood then seconds later suck er up oh sweetheart murmured one of the crew what was that sailor snapped brentwood nothing sir then get to it i want all of it oooohli groaned an oiler he wants all of it cmon said jones poor bastards already had the shit kicked out of him yeah well jonesy hes still alive said the oiler not sure id wanna be said the winch operator with that kisser yeah hes still kicking aint he added the oiler hell of a lot of guys from the blaine were deepsixed he got off shut up said jones hell hear you so what come on called out brentwood from the wheelhouse i want it up before it goes to a tar ball if the oil did coagulate and sink it would be pushed up later on the beach by the tide and over the next few days hed have every retiree in la jolla going into cardiac arrest and calling their congressman never mind the poor bastards on the west coast of southern alaska and british columbia where one of the russian subs had sunk both a huge freshwater carrier and oil supertanker spilling millions of gallons theyd be cleaning that up for years it was this thought that started ray brentwood wondering as he knew they had been in ottawa and washington how the hell the russian subs had gotten in so close to the coast without detection sure there had been a lot of surface interference gale conditions but still the sosus hydrophone arrays on the sea bottom monitored by the canadian navy out of esquimau on vancouver island should have picked up a sine wave or two of the subs cooling pumps of course once theyd sunk the tankers the subs had had no trouble getting out under the cacophony of torpedoes exploding and ships going down such noise completely overwhelming the sosus network providing cover for the russian subs to hightail it out of the area at maximum speed the noise of their cooling pumps racing flat out lost in the death throes noise of the dying tankers there yare sir said jones got er all in the tank very well up hose up hose mimicked the oiler christ think he was still captain of a missile frigate or something well once a captain always a captain i guess said jones of this bucket sneered the oiler shoot he might as wellve stayed home played in his friggin bathtub hes not gonna impress anybody down here with all his orders so why dont you put in for a transfer asked jones though knowing that none of them would get it ixe was the bottom of the barrel to the navy they were all losers on this barge aboard the roosevelt sonar operator emerson didnt have to tell zeldman about what hed seen on the screen as the listening sonar was on amplification in the control room everybody hearing the telltale whoosh of a torpedo being fired incoming shouted emerson submerged hostile by nature of sound bearing zero four seven battle stations ordered zeldman the yellow chime alert already pushed its softtoned urgency filling the sub speed asked zeldman pressing the captains cabin call button fortyfive knots replied emerson it was almost faster than the roosevelt could run hard right rudder to zero three five degrees ordered zeldman right rudder to zero three five degrees came the confirmation even as the roosevelt was turning its rudder control and trim closely watched by the diving officer bearing mark zero four seven came the response from the fire control party sa tube one fire moss sa tube fire moss a light tremor passed through the roosevelt as the mobile submarine simulator shot out from one of the two fivedegreeangled starboard abaft tubes situated below and abaft the sail the simulator traveling at over forty miles per hour on the same course as the attacking torpedo and emitting an identical noise signature to that of roosevelt forward tubes one two three four ready with warheads as he spoke zeldman could hear the easy metallic slide and click as the mark wireguided radarhoming torpedoes slipped from racks to tubes the latters lids closed the ropehung warning warshot loaded signs now slung from the spin wheel lock on each tube tubes one two three four loaded sir warheads armed warheads armed sir very well stand by three flights down the torpedo rooms chief petty officer was watching the enlisted men carefully since the bigger and much heavier trident ii d ballistic missiles had been put aboard replacing the trident i cs and upgraded markc torpedoes had been introduced to roosevelt the firing orders were at times quite different from those of the old sea wolf routines and this was no time for a mistake whats up pete it was robert brentwood looking somewhat disheveled eyes still blinking adjusting hurriedly to the reddedout control under attack sir torpedo on zero four seven speed fiftyfour knots brentwood looked at the computer for distance and estimated impact time but wanted the sonar teams independent assessment as well tti sonar time to impact six minutes sir how longs the moss been under way asked brentwood one minute sir answered zeldman live ones in the tubes in case the moss cant fox em out of it whatve we got in forward tubes markcs sir wireguided radarhoming very well said brentwood pulling down the fiexicord mike informing the ships company this is the captain i have the con commander zeldman retains the deck zeldman saw they were at two thousand feet just above the subs crush depth though this was always a safeside depth a sign to discourage any recklessness or undue risk taking the sea wolf he knew could dive deeper but then the digital readouts would go from green to red as they entered the danger zone we have a new contact said emerson and zeldman was immediately by his side where emerson pointed to the top of the three sonar screens in series first contact zero speed new contact bearing zero four two first contact seems dead in the water jesus said zeldman turning to brentwood captain first one must have been a feint or a dud either way he suckered us without a word of reproach or the merest suggestion that zeldman should have waited a bit longer before deciding to release the moss brentwood turned his attention to the tracking vector to see if the russian torpedo was changing course curving away toward the simulator zeldman had fired maybe the russian fish was a lineofsighter its computer nose not radarhoming but merely compensatory set to adjust its heading according to sea wolfs speed and heading but not an electronic lockon but then sonar reported a blip coming through the subsurface shrimp and ice clutter the blip now being received aboard roosevelt the russian torpedos active pulse shooting ahead the torpedo homing in on the bounceoff from the target tti he asked sonar again five minutes forty seconds sir definitely a homer then said zeldman it was his way of suggesting they should fire their warhead torpedoes now brentwood was thinking so fast that a dozen images simultaneously jostled for attention in his brain the most bothersome that of the soviet captain firing at such long range surely the russian must know a sea wolf would hear his torpedo coming and immediately change course to avoid he mustnt be homing on our hull said brentwood suddenly sobs locking onto our prop signature if hed been close enough for that sir suggested zeldman we wouldve been hit by now damn it zeldman was right it had to be hull lockon the surface area of the moss too small not giving off the same echo as the sea wolfs larger displacement hull the only chance was for the sea wolf to go to maximum speed despite the increasing noise her pumps would make and try to outrun the russian torpedo but no sooner had brentwood given the order for burst speed than emerson reported two other torpedoes racing for them in fan formation one fired to intercept at a point forward of the sea wolfs present position the other aft of it brentwood knew he could turn tail and run and the geometric and trigonometric vectors spewing out of the computer told him that even if the russian torpedoes were of their fastest class with a maximum range of thirtyfive miles the roosevelt might be able to evade the middle of the three torpedoes at this point he still had a fivemile head start but it would be as theyd said at balaclava a close run thing it would mean he couldnt weave but would be committed to a straightline retreat not only directly from the approaching middle torpedo but also in front of the russian sub and if the russian was faster than the sea wolf though only the alfa class was then the russian would outrun the roosevelt but then if the russian was an alfa and fired another one at closer range even the sea wolfs burst speed would be unable to evade him tti five minutes reported emerson all right replied brentwood switch on our active lets try to see what he is might as well use it he knows where we are anyway but even as emerson pushed the button and heard the distinctive ping of the active pulse passing out from the roosevelt he felt guilty that he was betraying her so ingrained was the operators code of silence it was as if a priest had been ordered to break a sacred rite the sea wolfs mission to listen only on passive not to betray their lethal load by making their own noise it was a catechism drilled into him from his very first days in bledsoe hall in groton but if emerson had doubted the order zeldman didnt brentwoods decision to go active was the right one with its awesome missile load the roosevelt couldnt preserve americas nuclear seastrike capability if it couldnt survive tti four minutes thirty seconds said emerson the moss was long gone out of play none of the russian torpedoes curving off to go for the bait now the pongs the echoes of roosevelts active pulses coming back at over three thousand miles per hour were registering in highpointed sine waves on the computer screen that emerson had now linked to the chinese library this was the sonar operators name for the library of pingpong sounds that taking into account water salinity thermal inclines hot vent upwelling temperature and currents sought to match sound peak ratios to hull size looks like a small one to me sir a hunterkiller plus or minus four thousand tons brentwood could now see the digitized speed readout an estimate that the active pulse made possible emerson was shaking his head in disbelief hed never seen a sub coming in at them at over fortythree miles an hour it was at once terrifying and aweinspiring goddamn it said zeldman an alfa tti four minutes said emerson his voice now tauter than before still watching the sonar screens brentwood informed the firing control and tracking party target designations as follows bravo charlie delta three fish got it target designations bravo charlie delta brentwood shot a glance at the russians incoming vector it had changed slightly to zero four nine bring the ship to zero four nine zero four nine sir four seconds later roosevelt was on the zerofournine heading the new vector for target bravo brentwood called for the range then announced angle on the bow starboard one seven firing point procedures master one zero tube one firing point procedure master one zero tube one came the confirmation immediately followed by solution ready sir weapons ready ship ready brentwood was watching the bearing final bearing and shoot master one zero the bearing and speed of the target were confirmed and brentwood heard the firing control officer take over stand by shoot fire one fired and running shift to zero zero five brentwood ordered as the roosevelt was brought about onto the vector for the second torpedo zero zero five sir very well fire two fire two two fired and running sir shift to one seven three this took a little longer as the footlong roosevelt turned through almost degrees in an eastwest semicircle to bring her on line with target delta the third torpedo fired by the alfa clearly meant to interdict aft of her should she try to run that way easy dont want to stretch the wire brentwood heard the diving officer say referring to the wire that the mark the top of its line in the us torpedo arsenal would trail behind it via which the torpedo would receive fire control and tracking party guidance until it got close enough to the target for its radarhoming computer to take over on one seven three sir very well fire three fire three three fired and running sir zeldman was now ready for the order to turn and run and go deep but it wasnt given instead brentwood ordered diving officer were going up take her to three hundred feet maximum angle thirty degrees take her to three hundred slowly said the diving officer minimum incline dont snap the wire the diving officer repeated the instructions but the man on trim and one of the planesmen couldnt believe their ears and it got worse though it wasnt evident at first because the direction in which they were going was taking them away from the alfa toward the northern side of the spitzbergen trench it was at eight hundred feet roosevelts up angle increasing beyond ten degrees in a slight upwelling current from the sea bottom causing zeldman and brentwood to hang on to the scope islands rail the diving officer held on to the roll bar above him closely monitoring the planesmen watch the bubble watch the bubble he advised fatherly calmly slow her down dont want to slam up against the ice thatd be a short to write home about what the planesmen couldnt figure out was why in hell brentwood would take them off to the shallow waters on the north shoulder of the deep trench the seabed sloping gently away to the top of the trench three hundred feet sir reported the diving officer suddenly everything was blurred instruments tightly secured as they were rattling like cutlery then the shock wave grew in intensity the sound of the explosion that had occurred several miles away but not close to the alfa sub now shaking roosevelt violently either the mark from the roosevelt had taken out the first torpedo fired by the alfa or the latter had taken out the first fish fired by the roosevelt in any case the alfas first torpedo was no longer a threat to the roosevelt and the roosevelts first fish had not sunk the russian holy livin emerson began he had never seen anything like it on his screen the explosions creating a frenzy of lines that made no sense overload he said in an understatement that was lost in control crews attempts to keep the roosevelt steady zero speed ordered brentwood and only now could emerson see his three sonar screens returning to something like normal the muffled sound of the pumps that never stopped could now be seen registering on the hash of ice grind and clacking shrimp kuda on uskol wheres he gone petrov yanov asked his sonar man their screen too was fuzzy wheres the bastard the sonar operator was still getting floodover from the explosion of the first torpedo that the alfa had fired at the american or was it sound wave residue from one of the americans torpedoes then came a second explosion as loud as the first but again it barely shook the doublebottomed titanium hull of the alfa the sub merely yawing slightly in the concussion waves hell dive to near crush depth predicted yanov brentwood was waiting it would be another four minutes before the last of the three torpedoes he had fired was due to make impact with target bravo with two fish exploded he could only hope his third would be lucky he was also wondering if hed done any damage to the alfa through concussion though he knew that unlike the sea wolf whose hull could be ruptured even if a torpedo didnt actually hit it but exploded some meters away an alfa was more resilient to being punctured by the massive pressure waves its stateoftheart double titanium hull the envy of every other submariner tti for target delta cut in emerson picking up a trace three minutes perhaps we should have fired another one said zeldman it wasnt a question more a suggestion and the only time brentwood had ever heard his executive officer even slightly nervous except possibly when zeldman had confided that georgina spence had proposed to him rather than he to her no pete we did all right with three we fire another one now were in cover of ice grind we negate us being up here im banking on them thinking weve gone down deep into the trench to hide looking for somewhere to hole up let ivan think weve gone deep under the sound smother of the explosions hell be listening for us away down there and were up here only three hundred feet from the roof nice and cozy in the ice clutter and he never finished suddenly roosevelt yawed violently hard left then right and she was sliding the control room crisscrossed with the hissing spraying of leaks that suddenly exploded into vapor jets under the pressure of pounds per square foot flooding in the engine room flooding in the engine room see to it chief called brentwood wheres the alfa sonar dont know sir called emerson his voice rising scared keep it down brentwood counseled him watch him find him for me son yes yes sir behind him brentwood could hear the damage reports coming in on the intercom as zeldman tried to steady the motion of the sub via trim and rudder control amid the chaos emerson realized that the roosevelts third torpedo hadnt knocked out the last of the fish fired by the alfa but must have been thrown off course its thin control wire to roosevelt inadvertently severed in the subs turn as theyd headed up the result was that the roosevelts third torpedo away and running its radarhoming head now uninhibited by wire control had probably overshot the oncoming russian torpedo and zeroed in on the alfa instead either this or the russian torpedo homing in on roosevelt had exploded against subsurface ice creating the concussion now causing the leaks which were not only flooding the engine room but which were making it impossible to see in control emerson heard a tentative cracking sound and in a sudden gutwrenching moment was sure they were breaking up until the sensors at least those that were still in operation told him it was the ice above that was fracturing and breaking up from the thwacks of the explosions but then he felt the sub sliding backward down the slope for a split second brentwood was tempted to order the engines near full power but resisted creating a giveaway vibration that would give the alfa if the explosions had not got her the roosevelts precise position on the shelf hopefully though the alfa was well away by now hunting for him somewhere in the deep of the spitzbergen trench watching his men running fast but each man clearly knowing what he was doing he took a momentary pride in how well they had been trained as within minutes the fierce spray of water that had seemed like an icecold steam shower in control was subsiding but then he felt the sub still sliding almost imperceptibly to start with but gathering speed like a heavy trunk on an incline of gravel it stopped slid a little more and halted again it was difficult to tell exactly just how far they were from the edge of the slope where it plunged away in the sudden drop into molloy deep that was fifteen thousand feet straight down emerson switching to earphones because of the noise of the hissing water tried to gauge how far they were from the edge by the sound of what seemed like rock debris tumbling down the slope scraping the hull then suddenly disappearing on the sound curve he figured they were less than four hundred feet from the dropoff brentwood was already getting the good news that the leaks had been stopped in the engine room and that now everything seemed secure the reactor seemed fine when a damage report told him that a number of hydraulic lines had been severed so that ballast tanks couldnt be blown to evict the water with air and thus make them lighter it meant the sub couldnt rise and the integrity of the safety hatches as the video display informed him had been breached no one spoke for several minutes as the full implications of their situation sunk it they had evaded the hunterkiller only to sir it was emerson excitement jolting him out of the sudden gloom who do you mean said brentwood sharply injecting a shot of discipline after the chaotic moments occasioned by the blast of the explosion do you want me or the officer of the deck sorry sir ood very well mr zeldman sir shes breaking up you sure said brentwood yes captain its amplify ordered brentwood there was the most awful sound brentwood had ever heard coming in from the hydrophones and filling the roosevelta sound like a great whale groaning in agony her bulkheads said zeldman theyre giving way we got her sir said emerson exultant looking around at the faces clustering anxiously around him or is it a feint asked brentwood emerson brentwood repeated what do you think i they could see the doubt taking over his face iim not sure sir keep listening dont think its a feint sir that groan i mean the amplitude is too brentwood felt someone bump him and looked sharply at the men gathered around the sonar what the hell is this the county fair everyone back to his post theyre going down sir said emerson more confidently now think theyre goners like us said someone in control brentwood looked about ready to tear a strip off the sailor but said nothing naval officers were supposed to be able to handle the truth with aplomb yes sir theyve definitely had it said emerson triumphantly ive got distance as well as speed sir its no feint this time he seemed to be right the groaning of the alfas hull testimony to the brutal fact that double titanium hull or not every sub had its crush depth and the alfa was now well below hers over six thousand feet below the sound of crunching steel that would soon be squashed flat rising up from the deep like the death throes of some great leviathan dying the most horrible death a sailor could imagine go to screen ordered brentwood take it off amplify yes sir as emerson reached for the knob there was a last sound a highpitched scream that though obviously from some of the electronic equipment rather than the bonecrushing sound of metal being crushed sounded eerily human like a newborn and for a moment brentwood thought of rosemary and the child she was carrying chapter fortyfour korea pronounced lewis upon looking down from the hercules ramp at the moonlit snow blanketing the scottish highlands that were flitting like white islands through churning cumulus over twentyfive thousand feet below i knew it theyre sending us to bloody korea the red warning light came on and the sas troopers stood up lumbering slowly forward weighed down by halo packs oxygen masks infraredgoggled helmets and the sas weapon of choice the us ingram macmilitary armament corps submachine gun lewis making it clear to anyone who could hear him above the hercules sustained roar that he certainly hoped this would be the last bloody night halo theyd have to practice it is responded cheekdawson his face all but invisible in the greenblack camouflage paste and helmet sprouting bracken as he checked that each man had spat in the infrared goggles to help prevent condensation and that they had all checked their wrist altimeters in sync with that of the hercules remember the drill the sarmajor told them his voice tinny through the hailer when you land unhitch but never mind the chute wont have time to drag in fold or bury it this time you must expect patrols both inside and outside the drop zone lowering the megaphone the sergeant major looked about aussie sarmajor if a flare goes up take off the if glasses correct now we have fifteen minutes to take out a divisional hq target this man he took a blowup of an asianlooking officer and held it high with cheekdawson shining his flashlight on it brigadier general said cheekdawson insignia epaulets and shoulder tabs yes but the face gentlemen go for the face remember it he then passed it around i dunno said lewis they all look the same to me what do you reckon fritz the german looked at the photo no aussie i think the nose is very definite you see and the jaw is stone the bloody crows fritz said lewis winking at thelman and brentwood just a joke strike a light you krauts take everything so seriously lewis turned his head to cheekdawson whats after this sir through the house once more for final selection to the squadron it wasnt so much a house but a canvas mockup of an enemys divisional hq near hereford complete with booby traps whole squadron going sir can tell you that much yes all eighty of us providing we get asked apart from that as you know our job is to keep fit on standby you have any ideas sir pressed lewis sorry lewis i cant be of any assistance to your bookmaking prognostications but you know the drill sas securitys so tight has to be that wed only be told fortyeight hours in advance in any case thats why we have you cover the field youre supposed to be ready for anything right sarmajor right sir you will lose a lot of money if it is korea eh aussie teased schwarzenegger aw shuddup you kraut four of the eighty men were killed during the jump one in a tumble one whose emergency chute failed and two who overshot the zone going down in one of the lochs drowned before they could get out of the harness with the pound battle packs weighing them down in the frigid water cheekdawson took it harder than anyone but was determined not to let it show they had lost a dozen men in accidents either going over the brecons or on the hereford forced marches and in the jumps but it had to be done if you were to be the best nevertheless he was growing as impatient as the rest of them for a mission though here again he couldnt let on and so it was with a sense of both exhilaration and measured apprehension that upon returning to the base he received the news from major rye that operation merlin was on runthrough time asked cheekdawson twenty hours said rye enough if we have all the maps paraphernalia et cetera said cheekdawson we do good show first briefing early morning asked cheekdawson though it was already near pm well after lightsout yes said rye very good sir good night good night said rye but first he would have to write letters immediately to the families of the four men who had died that night contrary to what was generally thought rye did not find the task particularly onerous it was one of the few times when he could talk quite unsentimentally about brave men besides because he was constrained by sas security requirements he could give no hint of where they had been or where they would have been going and this allowed parents and loved ones to gain some solace by thinking the men had already partaken in a highly secret operation and had therefore been killed on active servicewhich was technically correct chapter fortyfive rosemary spence woke up from a fitful sleep of storms and monstrous waves and of men cast upon an angry ocean that was at once majestic and terrifying in its power but robert was nowhere among the men she saw passing her in the dream but could be seen on a distant pebbled shore the shore pounded so incessantly that the moment she woke and found georgina by her side she still felt bound to the faroff island the pebbles as in dover beach which shed been discussing with the sixth form the day before still roiling in dreadful unison as they were sucked out and flung back by the surf every pebble in the dream a lost soul as insignificant to the sea as a grain of sand you all right asked georgina holding her sisters hand i rosemary began and fell back exhausted onto her pillow im sorry was i making a racket not really said georgina but i could hear you from my room sounded like a nightmare she paused robert yes answered rosemary still finding it difficult to tear herself away from the dark yet transparent symbolism of the dream isnt the first im afraid i worry about him all the time these days she looked up at georgina in the quiet of the room it was as if the two were meeting in a place where they had never been before but now each confronted by her own fears rosemary for robert and georgina for peter zeldman it was a place they both knew the other understood until this moment they had carried their own fears stoically and in silence but in the sharing of them now there was a mutual understanding and compassion that neither had felt for the other since their childhood you dream of peter very much rosemary asked all the time but its all so terribly vague in my case i think it might help if i could remember the details after but i cant i try sometimes i dont even realize ive had a dream about him until later in the day then something i dont know something quite unrelated it seems will remind me of it do you think of him being on the submarine no at least i dont think so but its always a very confined space i do know that like a cave the entrance closing rosemary shivered its always the same island for me and ice as far as i can see and the closer i get the further it recedes the more i hear the surf crashing on a beach a cruel hard beach of stones quite unknown to herself rosemarys hands were moving protectively over her stomach as she was talking georgina squeezed her hand i wont be foolish and tell you you shouldnt worry about the baby i guess every mother does but try not to fret too much rose rosemary didnt answer it was the first time georgina had called her rose in years oh lord said rosemary how can they do that go down there for weeks at months said georgina oh thank you said rosemary in mock reproach youre a great help it eased the tension and they began to laugh and soon the laughter had turned to tears and they were embracing what a pair of ninnies snuffled rosemary really theyre probably telling obscene jokes and drinking cocoa coffee corrected georgina wiping her eyes from the hallway richard spence saw them thought of going in but instead withdrew walking softly back to bed richard whats the matter asked anne her voice dopey with the sleeping pills she had found necessary since young williams death nothing he said and switched off the light but he lay awake the sight of his two daughters so close together filled him with a warmth he hadnt experienced in years yet he felt it shot through with his own fears about his soninlaw and his doubts about the advisability of georgina marrying young zeldman anne continued to be all for it but the war situation was so grave and getting worse each day that richard wanted to spare georgina whatever angst he could most people he believed including anne simply didnt realize how bad it really was in europe unable to be supplied with as much as they needed because of the soviet sub offensive was bad enough for the nato forces but now it was widely reported that more and more soviet subs like those which continued to attack american west coast shipping were still getting through the sosus network as he drifted off to sleep richard spence said a prayer for the two boys and for all those other men who went willingly and not so willingly down to the sea in ships and he sought comfort in the words of the ancient anglican prayer for those who go down to the sea in ships we give thee humble thanks for that thou hast been pleased to preserve through the perils of the deep chapter fortysix sonarman emerson was not the first aboard roosevelt to detect the deadly danger they were in this unhappy distinction fell upon seaman leach the steward and cooks helper the cook had been trying to cheer up the crew by telling a story about how he used to play his date line trick confusing new shipmates by serving a breakfast twice a day whenever the sub crossed the date line but the story fell flat after roosevelt her starboard ballast tanks ripped open as she lay bottomed and still taking in water sat stranded unable to rise leach grunted no one had said a word of reproach to him about the exploding coffeepot that had started the chain of events that now left the sea wolf trapped its escape hatches inoperable and several hydraulic lines severed the diving plane fixed in an up angle but the sub unable to rise the three hundred feet to surface a ruptured ballast tank completely flooded leach couldnt bring himself to look straight at any of the men as he doled out scalloped potatoes and green peas and steak limiting his line of sight out of shame to their name tags and dosimeters on their belts it was because of this hangdog expression unable to look any of his shipmates in the face that he was the first to notice the danger everybody else had been too preoccupied with their individual jobs and besides no one had noticed because they were working in the much dimmer light of the subs emergency battle lanterns until the blown circuits could be fixed the men in most trouble he noticed were those from the engine room which along with control had experienced the worst flooding by the time hed finished serving leach felt ill and breaking out into a sweat despite the chilly fiftyfive degrees of the sub he went to crews quarters slid into the sixbythreebytwofoot slot that was his bunk and pulled the twofoothigh curtains shut the man below him thought he heard a whimpering sound and when he asked leach whether he was all right leach said he was fine but his voice was strained now and then he could hear the hesitant but persistent tapping throughout the ship as the various department chiefs supervised timber reinforcements against the leaks tightening cclamps on the joints and trying to reinforce the big flange joint in the engine room there were already over nine hundred gallons that had poured in in just over a minute the sound of the tapping monitored by emerson wasnt too loud and wasnt standing out from the ice clutter in any case some of the men argued there was no point in worrying about making sound as they had no choice but to try to mend the damage and extrude the water as quickly as the damaged pumps would allow either that or let the sub fill slowly and drown like rats but soon leach couldnt stand the noise any longer the blue curtain across his bunk space swished back and he dropped down in his underwear tearyeyed looking at the other six men in his section a chief petty officer passing through immediately sensed something was wrong the tension fairly crackling in the air whats going on leach was zipping up his fly permission to see the captain it wasnt so much a question as a demand before the chief could say anything leach bellowed please in a tone at once so pleading and threatening that the cpo knew the man was literally on the edge sure leach isnt it sure ill take you up wait here the chief told leach who had seemed to calm down a little on the way to control the chief pulled back the curtained door of control inside the reddedout room robert brentwood was surrounded by ships charts the chief engineer and several other technical officers the chief knew it was the wrong time to interrupt brentwoods face lined with the strain but the chiefs expression spoke volumes clearly conveying the message to the captain that they had a possible section eight on their hands besides which brentwood had made a point of being accessible to his mens concerns brentwood saw leach wildeyed nodded at the chief and invited leach aft of control closer now to leach brentwood could see what he took to be the classic signs of claustrophobic panic it was unusual but not unknown among submariners sometimes even the toughest among them caught coffin fever after extreme stress what can i do for you leach brentwood asked trying to strike the right attitude between concern and the obvious need for expediency sir i dropped the he stopped looking down his chest heaving robert brentwood thought of his earlier days in the navy of how it was for all young men of how it might be for his son if they won this war to have to face a moment of devastating truth listen sailor any one of us could have dropped a clanger it was an accident a serious one you know that everyone aboard does cant be undone you look at it straight in the face resolve to do better and go on but you dont roll over and die thats no good to us its no good to you there was silence apart from the cautious tapping throughout the sub and the oppressive smell of diesel oil which brentwood hated with a passion and which was seeping out from some of the severed hydraulic hoses listen son first time i was in bledsoe in the tank we had a flange ring separate out shot a wall of solid water never seen anything like it every time i tried to get near it it just kept pushing me back couldnt see a darn thing leach was still looking down at his feet but i finally made it know what happened leachs chest seemed to collapse then suddenly heave again robert put his hand on the mans shoulder cpo was yelling at me to stop picking my nose and get in there the whole ship depended on me so i had to grit my teeth charge in and get the monkey wrench on turned the damn thing counterclockwise opened her up further i tell you that water was roarin in like niagara but i could hear the chief above it all right face redder man a fat admiral purple said i was a disastersaid a few other things too which i wont repeat robert grinned i thought my life was over career down the tube but i got through it well get through this one leach no one bought it did they how we gonna get up asked leach im working on it said brentwood now if youll let me get back to the blueprints and were all going to die robert nodded thats a possibility leach but right now lets stow that where it belongs you and i have to get to work and radiation said leach brentwood shook his head listen leach if thats whats bothering you you can relax reactor room officer and his boys have been over the coffee grinder with a finetooth comb not even a hairline fracture even if there was weve got the outer shield they build them tough in groton leach so thats one thing you cant blame your their reactor sir said leach he was now looking up directly at brentwood ive been watching the mens dosimeters as theyve come through the chow line color changes hard to pick up under the different lighting in the sub brentwood felt his stomach tightening instinctively he bent his neck to look down at his own belt dosimeter there was only a slight change if any that he could notice its not all the men said leach not yet but its only a matter of time what the hell do you mean that alfa sir we all heard it going down split wide open their reactor squeezed flattern a pancake i reckon robert brentwoods tone changed utterly who have you noticed i mean which men guys from the engine room mainly where there was a lot of flooding and in the torpedo room a lot of leakage in there i think he hesitated as well as control you told anyone else about this no sir leachs confidence was growing in direct proportion to brentwoods discomfort well hold your horses leach wed better have a good look at everyones dosimeters before we rush to any conclusions well do another shield check just to make sure if its here well seal it if it isnt sir then youre correct leach were in a lot of trouble brentwood made to go but stopped at controls curtain and looked back i wont cover this up if its true but i want you to keep quiet until were sure understood yes sir very well said brentwood and with that he knew that a load had fallen from leachs shoulders onto his when he reentered control the chief engineer was poring over the blueprints of the ship for its size it was the most complicated of any vessel ever designed more intricate than the space shuttles captain yes chief rro wants to see you down in the reactor room very well you come up with any ideas about how were going to refloat this baby chief not so far captain any way we can get that ballast tank selfpatching the chief shook his head no hope there captain goddamned cavein holes too big drive a truck through it damn lucky the pressure hulls intact as brentwood walked down through sherwood forest aft of the subs sail where the six fiftyseventon trident d missiles stood a row of three towering either side of him resting in their fortytwofoothigh sevenfootwide tubes he could hear the steady wash of the fortyton ventilator like a gentle breeze through a copse of birch droplets of condensation beaded the tall chocolatecolored tubes as if they were sweating enough deadly power in their fortytwo warheads each reentry vehicle with a sixthousandmile range and independent navigational equipment to take the three hundred kilotons to within a circular error of probability of plus or minus two hundred yards from a target and yet trapped beneath the ice what good were they unless roosevelt could rise and break through to make matters worse the pound ds were heavier than the old pound cs meaning the sub was even more firmly weighed down on the shelf than she might otherwise have been when he reached the anteroom of the reactor brentwood took off his shoes slipping on a pair of the yellow feltlined plastic bootees so that any odd piece of radioactive dust that he might conceivably pick up would remain in the reactor room when he changed back to his regular softsoled deck shoes what have we got leo he asked lieutenant galardi who despite his white coveralls looked more like the family dentist than a reactor room officer he was also a man of few words captain weve been rapped and its not coming from this baby that goddamned alfa we sank tore apart including her reactor with everything else going on only a few boys have reported it but soon as we get normal lighting back everyones going to notice theyve got a dose of gamma radiation how big a dose not exactly sure galardi paused id like to call in all dosimeters if thats okay with you go ahead what are we up to now in rads weve passed greenpeace recommended dosage said galardi with a rare smile that brentwood found distinctly unsettling hell leo even gods passed greenpeaces recommended dosage how bad do you think it is i mean if the rate youve seen so far doesnt decrease whats the prognosis if it goes up come on leo dont dance youve always given me straight answers lets keep it that way if it keeps climbing sir were all going to lose some hair when will you know for certain brentwood realized hed left himself wide open for a joke when your hair falls out but neither of them was in the mood ill need a half an hour captain even then wed have to hear what the experts in the oxford rad lab say to know for sure well leo there arent any of them around at the moment i noticed that captain brentwood took off the bootees and glanced at his watch it was by he would have a rough idea of whether leachs fears were fully justified surely to god it isnt that powerful that it can come straight through the hull oh its not that leo assured him its in the water the leaks were swimming in the goddamned stuff chapter fortyseven the jumbled ice of the yalu proved better cover than freeman could have reasonably hoped for and up close what had seemed looking down from outpost delta like chunks no more than three or four feet high were in fact enormous shards of ice over ten feet in height the moonlight throwing the jagged landscape of the river into sharp relief the patrol could easily see their way across and so freeman knew could the chinese if they were in the area he was determined to move slowly for though he didnt fear land mines the shifting ice too precarious to plant them due to the changing pressure of the ice he was nevertheless alert to the possibility of booby traps on the point freeman would go ahead checking the immediate area about him before waving on the patrol high overhead the dot of an eagle crossed the moons face passing through the aura of ice needles that was clearly visible as a golden ring finally the patrol eased its way off the frozen river toward the black humps of hills that faded into the snowcovered foothills of manchuria all this time freeman was calmly surveying escape routes should firing suddenly erupt around them his nose as much a guide as his eyes alert for the smell of wood smoke which while it mightnt necessarily signal an nka or chinese position would warn him of a village where the chinese might be storing arms and other supplies as a forward base there was a sudden ice fall freeman flicked off the safety catch of his squad automatic weapon its triangular box magazine pressing in firmly against his side but soon all was quiet again and in another little while they came upon a track or rather series of tracks leading up from the river where the grass in the flood margin had been stomped down frozen like coarse hair prone to crack underfoot freeman knew he had only two options to go on where they couldnt help but make some noise or to head back it might be freeman realized that there were no chinese or nka units anywhere in this section but with the northsouth valleys running down to the river offering natural revetment areas for armor the general couldnt believe that the chinese wouldnt use the manchurian side as a staging area and if the north koreans had successfully dug tunnels all along the dmz the last one being discovered in despite american groundmovement sensors this area could be riddled with underground supply dumps the chinese divisions waiting for the next snowstorm that could nullify us air strikes and blind the us artillerys forward observation posts he knew that if he were the pla commander hed sure as hell be using the sector after pyongyang freeman figured he understood something of kims strategy telling jim norton once that kim was a korean montgomerywouldnt move until he had a fourtoone advantage in toilet rolls it wasnt his freemans way but he knew that it too won battles ironically he felt safe the farther the patrol penetrated the hillocks on the northern side providing they didnt find any evidence of chinese or nka presence following the last attack on outpost delta his patrol would be left alone and if there were troops in the area they would only attack if discovered unlikely to reveal themselves saving everything for a surprise attack he motioned the squad to stop waited and listened some more hed known of more than one patrol who in their eagerness to get the nail biting over with had kept moving forward without pausing long enough each time and when you didnt rest the sound of your breathing your heart thumping drowned all other noise including the enemys freeman could smell both his and his mens sweat and thanked god the wind was blowing against them from the north it was a small thing in the moonglow a depression no more than a few feet wide and an inch or so deep but with the intuitive sense of the experienced soldier freeman was already leery of it cradling his saw in his left arm he lay down and crawled within a foot of the depression its outline like that of a big serving dish drawing the knife from his calf scabbard he gently probed the edges of the depression the blade sounding as if it were passing through coarse sugar he waited for the click of metal on metal that would signify a mine there was none instead the knife was stuck he waved the patrol back several yards and signaled for them to cover up helmets down tight but no chin strap if it was a mine nonmetallic or not and went off the concussion beneath the helmets would lift the chin straps so hard itd snap their jawbones he tried pulling the knife again and this time it came out it was a circular canewoven dish that the blade had sunk into the kind hed seen villagers using tossing up the rice grain during the harvest but much firmer than the grain platter he had at first thought it was as he drew it closer to himself he saw the black hole that it had been covering and knew he was looking at a tunnel entrance slowly he replaced the cover then eased his way back through the snow to the squad now he knew why the trail wasnt mined it was a pathway from the tunnel to the river his whisper was soft distinct and as wezlinski first rifleman in the patrol noticed freemans instructions were remarkably unhurried its a tunnel entrance he told wezlinski if its active we know my hunch is right and we can call down artillery on these gooks quietly he turned his arm to see his watch give me twenty minutes he told wezlinski if i dont pop back up or you hear one hell of a racket then youll know ive found the bastards then you get the hell out of here and zero in the artillery he took a handful of snow to moisten his mouth in the cold dry wind next he took out a plastic muzzle protector slipped it over the end of the saws barrel so as to keep out the snow laid it down by the path then drew both pistols checking the magazines when i come out he whispered softly ill stick a glove on one of theses you see it sticking up hold your fire if i dont find my way back here or have to come out somewhere else ill fire a red flare thatll give your buddies up in delta a position for artillery fire youll have to move fast back across the river understand now synchronize your watch but said wezlinski in amazement you arent going down there general freeman tapped him fatherly on the shoulder our boys did it all the time in nam only way to find out whether its an old tunnel or if its loaded to the gills but general said wezlinski his voice tight with fear why dont we just throw in a bunch of grenades general wont tell us a damn thing son way they make these ratholes they twist and turn got vents in them blind corners the whole shebang even use bamboo screens across to deflect shrapnel like goin down a mine son got to see it for yourself freeman pushed the saw back to wezlinski the big weapon too unwieldy in a tunnel he checked the six grenades he had clipped to his belt took off his helmet put on the tear gas mask from his pack and moved toward the hole a shaped flashlight in his left hand the from his right holster in the other hand wezlinski heard a shuffle of ice as the general slid down into the hole when wezlinski passed the word back the tailend charlie facing the river shook his head no way youd get me down there man he whispered hes nuts slowly extending his arms out in the pitch darkness the first thing freeman noticed was that the tunnel was no more than four feet wide and about six feet high though now and then he felt his hair brush the icecold dirt of the roof so that he was forced to stoop after five yards he was careful to keep count he felt the tunnel veering sharply to the left then going straight for another two yards before it swung hard left again then right he thought he heard something up ahead stopped but if it had been something moving it was gone now then he heard it again at first it seemed to be going away from him but then was coming toward him a faint scrambling he resisted the temptation to use the flashlight then there was a fast rushing movement a furry rat racing over his feet he could smell them now a stream of them the fact that the rats had apparently turned back toward him indicated he was coming to a culdesac he heard another sound a tinkling he brought his wrist up close to his eyes so he could read the watch face hed been down only three minutes it had seemed like an eternity the thought of rats gnawing his face if he should fall turned his stomach he waited for ten seconds or so hoping that his eyes might adjust to any faint moonlight that might be penetrating a vent if there were any but if anything it was blacker than before he heard the tinkling again up above the tunnel in the world of moonlight and fresh air wezlinski cursed silently to himself someone in the squad had broken wind and the odor of putrefied baked beans engulfed him and he thanked god for the breeze that whipped it downwind toward the river chapter fortyeight officer on parade called the sas sergeant major attenshun there was a crash of rubberized vibram boots from the eightyman squadron that shook the hall at ease gentlemen said major rye gather round as they all crowded in about the twelvefootsquare table cheekdawson at the adjacent corner ready upon major ryes word to take off the cover rye announced another halo jump gentlemen thats why weve been giving you lots of practice up in scotland this however is not an exercise gentlemen you have been requested code name for the operation is merlin there was silence following a few joking comments such as bout timecomments that would immediately have been withdrawn had they foreseen what now lay before them as with a flick of the wrist rye and cheekdawson removed the green cloth cover from the model of the missions target the scale on the accompanying map cheekdawson was pinning on the wall showed the target was no more than an hours flight from the allies most forward airfields no farther than the walestoscotland exercises but even david brentwood who in the australians consistently gregarious presence had adopted a selfprotective nonchalance could not suppress his surprise the very air seemed to quiver as the new sabre squadron crowded around the model son of a bitch aussie said thelman youve just lost a bundle bloody hell retorted the australian the fix is in it is indeed said major rye looking up at them as you gentlemen will appreciate the location of this target had to be kept from you till the last moment now however the request has come and you have a full twentyfour hours to walk it through inch by inch he paused any sas target gentlemen is important the very fact sas is called in makes it so but i can tell you quite frankly that this is the most important in our history i have it on good authority both from downing street and for you american chaps from pennsylvania avenue that if we do not succeed in he paused in adjourning a meeting which intelligence tells us is scheduled for tomorrow night the war on the european continent will suddenly shift to chemical and possibly allout nuclear war the redstartopped byzantine spires were at once familiar and unfamiliar to every man in the room while they did not know the names of all its salient features there was no one who didnt recognize the grim and forbidding grandeur of the kremlin the cluster of gold cupolas that were atop the once proud yellow brick imperial palaces and cathedrals of the czar of all the russias and amid them the high ocherred walls that now contained the seat of soviet power in thirtysix hours they were told in the council of ministers building the politburo and stavka of the supreme soviet would meet to put their signatures to what the kgb had already decided to launch nerve gas attacks against the entire nato front the three troops of sabre squadron explained rye will be designated a for alfa b for bravo c for charlie each troop of sixteen subdivided into your fourman modules fluent russian speakers from among the twelveman hq group will attach themselves to any of the troops as necessary during the operation lieutenant laylor leading a group will be the first out of three hercules were using for the operation group as job is to establish and provide a perimeter of fire group b will eliminate the politburostavka and group c will provide backup and detonations for retreat and for pickup which ill get to in due course one hercules per group second group b i must emphasize again will concern itself only with getting into the council of ministers and eliminating the enemy war cabinet those of you in this group may require more of the russian translators than a or c but i dont expect therell be a great deal of time for conversation anyway there were a few awkward grunts the objective is simple doing it not quite so easy he took the pointer as you can see the kremlin is an odd shape five sides none of them the same length but we are only concerned with the northern triangularshaped section up here the pointer moved to the top of the map this is made up of the arsenal tower at the top left of the triangle trinity tower and gate further left to the west spasskaya or saviors tower and gate on the right on the eastern side of the triangle whatever you do try to avoid the onionshaped domes down here south of the triangle the domes are not your target no reason you cant abseil down from them but this will consume precious time and we estimate youll have twenty minutes maximum from point of landing to complete the mission rye paused questions so far everyones eyes were fixed on the map as rye waited a few seconds then continued for the last month us second air force and raf have been flying bombing missions out of our most forward airfields around minsk hitting kolomna fifty miles east of moscow this has diverted the mobile sam and aa batteries away from moscow as well as drawing off moscows fighters at the same time weve been flying two or three hercules very high under radarjamming protection dropping propaganda leaflets usual kind of stuff from nato psychological warfare unit telling the russian population at large that while you are fighting the war your leaders are living in luxury the russians already know that of course personally i think that this sort of thing is highly overrated and indeed counterproductive but in our particular case it does serve a very real purpose by running these propaganda flights over the central moscow area on a fairly regular basis its caused the russians when their radar does manage to penetrate our jamming to pay less and less attention to the hercules theyre used to and instead to concentrate their mobile sam sites and aa defense units around outlying industrial targets like the likhachev works that once produced zils and are now busy turning out armor et cetera in any event theyre understandably much more interested in having their expensive sams and aa batteries engage our bombers not three transports that have been dropping leaflets over the last few weeks which weve been using as a decoy for your drop even so once you land inside the kremlin youll be up against spets elite guard units david brentwood suddenly looked across at the major we have any idea how many sir he interjected three companies we believe in all plus or minus three hundred men whew thats all right then said aussie thought there mightnt be enough to go around the major grinned politely but quickly returned their attention to the triangular section at the kremlins northernmost end which was roughly wedgeshaped the arsenal that would contain the spets on the lefthand side of the wedge the council of ministers where the stavka meeting would take place on the right in between them a relatively open section of several acres with some tree cover tapping the open area at the bottom or widest part of the wedge rye told them thisll be your landing zone remember too far west and youre on the roof of the palace of congress too far southwest and youre into a thicket of spires landing atop the palace of congress wouldnt be so bad for laylors troop a it has a very good overview of the open area below it the middle of the wedge as well as a view of the arsenal on its left and the council of ministers to the right but troop b and troop c on the other hand must avoid wasting time by landing on the palace and having to rappel down oh yes too far south altogether and you could find yourself over the wall in queue for lenins mausoleum have to pay to get in sir well im sure quipped rye that whatever currency was required lewis youd have it rye turned back to the map before i discuss the job of the other two groups b and c a few more points you all need to know the major paused to make sure every man of the threetroop squadron was watching him before going on the raid gentlemen is to cut off the head of the snake it must be a quick and decisive operation very fast very hard now some of you are probably wondering why not a bombing run good question easy answer the kremlin complex covers well over sixty acres furthermore after the us smart bomb attack on qaddafi years ago knocked out everything else but failed to get qaddafi which was the whole point of the raid nato hq correctly in my view have shied away from delegating this kind of task to a bombing run bombing looks all very impressive from postraid aerial photographs it appears that youve taken out everything when in fact half of it remains operational we learned that with the ho chi minh trail and do remember gentlemen the day after the abomb landed on hiroshima trolley cars were running in the city no the only sure way is to actually go in and do the job on the ground then youve got a much better chance of taking them out whether theyre in the upper chambers of the council of ministers or in the bomb shelters below understood sir put in the guards officer laylor in command of a group but if the shelters are sealed off then even if we get some members of the stavka hq upstairs what happens if the rest scurry to the shelters before we can good question laylor so now we come to groups b and c the major was looking around at the eighty men ah brentwood there you are i do hope you dont object to leading bravo troop you were chosen because of your experience in the freeman raid on pyongyang good now your job is to get into the council of ministers hereafter designated com while laylors alfa group is securing the perimeter hit them before they know what the dickens is going on remember theyve at least two companies of spets billeted in the arsenal just two hundred yards west of the com thats in addition to regular kremlin guards stationed at building entrances et cetera the major turned back to laylor in any event laylor the drill will be that whether or not the stavka and other members of the politburo do scurry to the cellars your job is to secure a perimeter within which brentwoods bravo troop can clean house brentwood your sappers will plant enough plastique to bring down the entire com if necessary whether the stavka are shot or asphyxiated by thousands of tons of concrete coming down on their shelter is neither here nor there to us your job is to kill them before they get a chance to unleash allout chemical and biological warfare on our troops and on our civilians before your departure all of you will be doing walkthroughs many in fact of a mockup of suzlovs office et cetera on the top floor of the coms eastern wing remember all you are concerned with is the area bounded by the triangle the kremlins northern end you should land within the triangle hopefully in the more open space between the arsenal and the council of ministers when you open your chutes at low altitude even with cloud your infrared goggles should allow you to make out the landing zone area clearly for a reference point look for the line of cannons lined up all along here the eastern side of the arsenal facing the council of ministers well be practicing orientation here sending you up on the mezzanine and looking down on the model youll be issued flares short fuse but hopefully youll have the element of surprise and wont have to use them as youd only be presenting yourselves as targets most critical phase will be the time it takes the spets in and around the arsenal to realize whats going on but no matter where you land within the kremlin complex remember youll never be too far from your targets so regroup quickly next rye turned to cheekdawson who was designated leader of the remaining twentyodd sas c troop under mr cheekdawson will surround the council of ministers building to help laylors alfa group bottle up the spets in the arsenal while brentwood is cleaning house c will also provide a squad of sappers to plant the timedelay plastique which will bring down the com covering its shelters in rubble should mr brentwoods group not put pay to everyone at the stavka meeting no use doing only half the job captain youll also provide fire teams of two no more than four men to plug any weak holes in the perimeter understood sir said cheekdawson good everyone else clear so far rye was wearing such an encouraging smile that for a moment it occurred to the australian lewis that to anyone walking in it might seem as if they were merely being briefed for yet another practice halo jump except the atmosphere in the room was electric with excitement laced through with the fear that they were going into the bears den ill hand this over in a few moments to mr cheekdawson for your detailed walkthroughs but i do have a few closing remarks we have i should say mi and cia have provided us with enough information to arrange a mockup attack set in our hereford house you will all do six runthroughs each fifteen minutes maximum before you take off tomorrow afternoon for our forward airfields around minsk remember the whole thrust of your training is that above all sas adapts to any situation faster and better than anyone else apart from those weapons and techniques that youve spent the last weeks honing to a fine point your greatest weapon will be speed and surprise if we had thought we could have relied on any other means to do the job we wouldnt have asked you that indeed was my first consideration when former c in c general freeman who originated this plan and kept it on standby initially presented it to me in brussels and if we thought we could get you in by low radarevading choppers we would have also tried that but im afraid the perimeter defenses of moscow area simply made that unfeasible the only way is to go high and drop you in so far as getting you out something i venture a few of you at least are interested in doing the laughter was short royal air force will launch a harrierescorted flight of four sea stallion choppers for pickup he turned to the map here at narofominsk its thirty miles out closest we can possibly hope to get but we do have surprise help for you on that score a bloody compass called out the australian a little better than that mr lewis replied rye easily sarmajor will fill you in on that as far as the choppers go we would have liked to have used something with a smaller silhouette than the stallions but each stallion can carry enough fuel and can get thirtyfive of you out in one haul providing you can reach them the fourth stallion will be manned by american medical personnel i believe they have everything aboard except the kitchen sink another smarter of laughter again verticallanding harriers the only fighters we can put down without an airfield will be with them waiting for you i wont insult your intelligence gentlemen by pretending that even if you reach narofominsk the evacuations going to be any picnic within five minutes of you hitting the drop zone i estimate that all spets outside as well as those inside the kremlin will be alerted hopefully they will also be confused for a minute or so at least when you go in and that should give you a vital edge best of luck with that major rye let cheekdawson take over it was unstated but the men drew confidence from the fact that the spearhead of the mission the job of carrying out the flushout in sas parlance of the enemy commanders from their various offices along the eastern wing of the council of ministers building had been assigned to a veteran of such a raid the american brentwood and not automatically assigned as often happened in line units to the most senior officer in this case captain cheekdawson every leader despite his generalist sas training had sensibly been chosen because of his experience as well as sas training and not his rank very nice said aussie looking down at one of the lists of russian phrases several of the ncos were handing out very nice twenty bloody phrases to learn off by heart but whos the russian specialist in our group may i ask why said schwarzenegger surprised that lewis didnt mow i am i speak russian as well as german you know many germans do its lewis turned on him you boxhead you never told me that christ youve cost me a bloody fortune you never asked me schwarzenegger repeated unruffled besides i thought you were so sure that we were going to malaya then korea ah piss off david brentwood didnt join in the ribbing the full realization of his awesome responsibility was now upon him like a backpack twice the weight of the pound load hed take with him out of the aircraft and now too he was confronted by the memories of how he had lain petrified in the shelled moonscape during the botchedup drop of the airborne outside stadthagen how he had been unable to move too afraid to move until the spets bayonet appeared before his face and hed surrendered oh hed escaped from stadthagen all right but that like the actions of so many others had been motivated more by fear of what would happen to him if he didnt escape physically he felt fit and ready enough for operation merlin but that had all been training now it would be the real thingagain cheekdawson was taking the roof off the model of the council of ministers indicating to the sappers the points of the building where charges would exert most stress with the least resistance the man in laylors group passing out the list of russianenglish phrases to be memorized and practiced by morning wondered aloud what the word kremlin actually meant fortress cheekdawson answered without looking up oh lovely said aussie does that tell you something fellas yeah long way from korea aussie commented a cockney who turning to his mate continued poor buggerll owe over three hundred quid i reckon less than that said the welshman they called choir williams how come work it out lad fortress an all how many you thinkll make it in more to the point how many of usll get out youre a cheery one said the first cockney just facing facts ducky lewis listening in depressed by the ribbing directed his way was suddenly seized with an inspiration as if in a vision he rose took out his everready purple indelible pencil knowing its imprint on paper wouldnt run in either snow or rain and licking it he wandered about the hall making bets on how many would make it back if any for david brentwood the worst of it was that thelman schwarzenegger and the australian lewis along with the other sixteen men of his troop thoroughly approved of his selection as leader of b troop his experience on freemans pyongyang raid now made him feel as he had once at college when unexpectedly having achieved high grades in several subjects he was automatically expected to continue to lead the field adding to his apprehension was ryes mention of freeman in the past tense as former c in c approaching cheekdawson with a nonchalance the very pretense so unlike him it only further fueled his anxiety he asked casually whether the general had bought it cheekdawson didnt glance up from the model of the kremlin like gulliver he was still peering down at the lilliputian world making notes on precisely where the charges would have to be placed suspect so old boy he answered apparently the general went mia somewhere up near the yalu chaps at brussels hq say it was typical though i mean doing his own reconnaissance from all accounts he was some general yes said brentwood with a heartfelt sincerity he doubted anyone else in the room except perhaps thelman whod also served directly under freeman could fully comprehend yes david stopped unsure as to whether he should say he was or he is somehow he had always thought of the general as invincible the regimental sergeant major was on the hailer before they were due to leave for lunch and then on to the house for the dry runthrough with live ammunition and full pack the rsm was holding an extra roll above his head which he explained would have to be put atop the pound pack that would be carried by each man into the drop zone there was a collective groan steady on girls he responded breezily no need to get your knickers in a knot youll like this one the roll of white plastic was no larger than a tightly compressed hand towel and he assured them no heavier this little charmerll go atop your main pack with deliberate flourish he unraveled the plastic along the floor it was a white plastic overlay the shape of a boiler suit elasticized at the waist a fly running all the way up from the crotch to the neck where two white cord drawstrings were attached to the hood its design quite different in its hip and shoulder cut from the nato winter overlay the men had used on all the halo exercises weve already got overlays said lewis thats for the attack aussie this is standard spets overlay issue compliments of captain cheekdawson momentarily brentwood felt better it was simple yet quite brilliant during the withdrawal it would be pitch darkness because of moscows air raid curfews but there would be spets everywhere after the attack identification of sas if they were dressed as spets would be difficult and might buy valuable time aiding escape how bout me it was thelman the white overlay a stark contrast to his black skin yer own bloody fault thelma shouted aussie told you blokes to quit suntannin fuck you replied thelman not to worry mate rejoined aussie put cold cream on thatll do the trick smell like a whore countered thelman in the same easy yet slightly forced banter lewis turned to schwarzenegger hey fritz five to two thelma doesnt make it back verriickt said schwarzenegger what the hells that mean it means you are sick in the head said schwarzenegger all right all right eight to two but thats it unbeknownst to any of the troops including laylor brentwood and cheekdawson when the troops filed out for lunch the sergeant major with the assist of the other hq ncos moved through the weapons racks with pliers here and there slightly crimping in the magazines this would cause those weapons to jam during the dry runs the troopers monitored via the television cameras it was a random check to make sure every trooper could clear a jam and as required by sas change magazines on the roll not only their lives but the entire mission and in this case the entire war might depend on it chapter fortynine the tinkling noise freeman had heard was that of water at the bottom of a well shaft that formed one of the tunnels exits the exit hole in the wall of the well shaft six feet in diameter and a good eight feet above the water line the exit ladder was a series of deepset iron handholds moving with extreme caution he discovered that about thirty feet in from the exit whence he had come there was another branch of the tunnel leading off to the left to a large twelvebytwelvebysixfoothigh storage room which using his flashlight he saw was packed high to its roof with everything from binary shells binary mortars heavy eightyonemillimeter mortars aks stick he and phosphorus grenades dozens of boxes of belt and magazinemillimeter andmillimeter ammunition as well there was a pile of ingeniously built assault ladders which were made of bamboo and which with canvas strips for cross struts collapsed like the supports of chinese tripod clotheslines into one long light and easily portable shaft beside the ladders there was a pile of worn brass bugles and a clutch of starter whistles then he discovered the room was connected to others of the same size several of them bisected by timber supports seven rooms in all which seemed to radiate out from the well shaft in a spoke pattern and which had the smell of acrid cordite that came from wooden casks of gunpowder refilling jacks and reloading stampers in four of the rooms there were dozens of tightly packed rice bags that had been set on bamboo woven palettes footwide trenches running about them filled with barbed wire presumably to dissuade rats and other rodents from getting at the rice in all freeman estimated that the complex of tunnels and rooms held enough ammunition and arms and sundry supplies to equip an attack of at least battalion possibly regimental strength enough for between fifteen hundred and two thousand frontline assault troops he was in the fourth big storage room reached by a thick rightangle bend and over a small pyramid of earthen stairs more steps on the up than on the down side and leading into a deeper tunnel the rightangled turn hed just passed through and the difference in the tunnel levels potential impediments against any attack by enemy troops on the tunnel complex only under earthshattering artillery would these tunnels cave in and even then it would have to be a pulverizing barrage as otherwise the various levels and cunningly devised exits and entrances would act like watertight bulkheads aboard a ship preventing any fullscale destruction though he was using the flashlight sparingly only flicking it on for less than a second at a time to take it all in his attention was immediately attracted by the large number of binary poison gas shells along with the bugles and whistles a binary was a natural for the chinese relatively cheap using otherwise fairly harmless domestic cleaning chemicals which when combined would form the deadly nerve gas the bugles and whistles told him the chinese were massing for a closequarter attack on the american positions across the yalu his greatest wish was to defeat them but the chinese and the north koreans though the latters cruelty was an abomination to him aroused in him the respect of a professional soldier he held the chinese particularly in high regard for not only were they brave even if they were brainwashed but they were extraordinarily adept at combining the old with the new and if they didnt have the new then improvising with what they had in this case it was the bugles and whistles the plas answer to the exorbitantly expensive for them and often temperamental modern microchip radio backpacks the battered bugles and whistles not only saved on radio and avoided technical foulups so prevalent in frontline fighting but along with lots of screaming in the last hundredyard run of a night attack more often that not created a dangerous confusion in the opposing ranks among fresh american and other allied troops who had not seen action before the result was invariably one of panic and on occasion mass retreat entering the sixth of the seven rooms this one piled high with binary shells he turned toward a sifting sound and tripped over some kind of wire or cord the flashlight on rolling revealing the room seething with rats turning in panic in the culdesac formed by the room and trying to race out of it swarming over him one attacking his face there was an enormous crash from a pile of pots and pans no doubt used for a double purpose to prepare the rice rolls with which chinese and north korean troops could march for days and again typical of the chinese to act as an alarm against any potential pilferer tripping over the cord within seconds freeman was on his feet blood streaming from his face its warm metallic taste in his mouth as he moved as quickly as possible out of the room toward the main feeder tunnel of the hubandspoke complex his fingers trailing the doublewalled turns toward the well shaft exit as soon as he reached it he heard the quick babble of voices suddenly silenced by the barking of sharply delivered orders korean rather than chinese he thought and then shapes appeared one already on the ladder freeman fired the flare saw its red light blossom high above the well shaft then fired the heard the echo of his shot and saw the shape on the ladder fall back without a sound splashing heavily into the water below a light hail of dirt and stone splattering after the body he heard several shots and the bullets thudding into the well shaft then as suddenly as it had begun the firing ceased and freeman knew why a grenade or any heavycaliber machinegun fire could penetrate the earthen wall of the supply rooms and set off the whole complex in a series of gigantic explosions if he moved fast he might make it to one of the half dozen or so manhole entrances hed noticed along the main tunnel about a quarter mile back where hed left the patrol gripping the flashlight firmly in his left hand keeping it low he used his elbow as a touch guide on his way the in his right hand he heard the voices behind him receding then suddenly after a turn in the tunnel they increased which meant that either they had passed one of the rightangle turns or false earthen walls or were coming in from some smaller tunnel that he wasnt aware of his right hand struck cool damp earth the butt of the poking him in the chest before he realized hed come up against another abutment in the tunnel quickly feeling his way around it he stuffed the in his waist belt pulled the pin from one of the fivesecond grenades stepped out from the abutment and rolled the grenade hard back down the tunnel before jumping back behind the wall the roar was deafening followed by screams and a pattering sound as dirt kept falling in the tunnel the acrid smell of the explosive causing his eyes to water as he moved farther on away from his pursuers hearing an ak rattling in the background the dull thud of bullets and then the sound of footsteps drowning the groans as others kept coming suddenly up ahead of him about fifteen yards he saw a shaft of moonlight it disappeared but not before hed glimpsed two figures dropping down softly from it into the tunnel without breaking his stride freeman pulled the pin and rolled the grenade forward going down on one knee like an indoor bowler to keep it as centered as possible continuing his drop and covering his head there was an enormous purplishwhite flash a whistling sound and he felt a sting or rather several as if hornets had bitten him in several places along the right arm which had been protecting his forehead and he knew hed been hit by shrapnel but what the shrapnel had done to the two enemy soldiers both chinese was much worse one lay dead in the glow of his burning clothing while the other staggered about like a drunk hand clasped to his face freeman went to squeeze off two more shots but nothing happened his finger wouldnt obey his brain by the time hed reached the wounded chinese hed transferred the into his left hand the man ran at him stumbling freeman fired the man crashing into him knocking him against the wall before falling dead at freemans feet it seemed to take freeman an eternity to extract his left boot from under the corpse and finally he was moving again down the tunnel but something was happening to his vision he was confused and could hear nothing but the high whistle of the grenades explosion still reverberating in his ear drowning all other noises another shaft of moonlight blurred and a sparkler like the kind hed waved around as a kid he stopped shook his head as if this might clear it and tried to replace the in the left holster until he realized that it was the right holster he needed shoving the flashlight in his left pocket and leaning against the wall of the tunnel he moved his hands as quickly as he could to put on the gas mask against the spitting phosphorus grenade that was now lighting up the tunnel in the dancing ghostly light he felt better clearerheaded and pulled the headband tight as he raced on through the white choking cloud a redhot needle sensation in his left leg no doubt a fragment of phosphorus burning its way in he could smell his flesh then the smell was gone and he knew that as long as he kept moving down the tunnel tossing a few grenades back whenever he made a turn he might just make it to an exit before they did he felt the gas mask crumpling like cellophane and suddenly his feet were gone from under him the rifle butt smashing bone everything stopped the reconnaissance patrol now under the command of private wezlinski retreating as theyd been ordered after seeing the red flare fired by freeman were cut down on the ice heavy mortar rounds exploding about them sending great shards of iceshrapnel whistling through the air one of which decapitated wezlinski as a radioman frantically begged air support screaming that charlie depots had been found by freeman who had obviously been too far away from them to return in time and so had fired the flare whether or not freeman had been seen by the chinese before or after hed fired the flare and whether or not hed been killed or captured by them was not known the only thing anyone could be certain about was that freeman had found the chinese even though the lory low radioactivity yield atomic shells were on the way however it was by no means certain that they would stop the chinese if the chinese had tunneled in seoul knew that with the radiation yield and explosive power of the atomic shells being far less than abombs they would not necessarily thwart the attack only ten shells being fired initially in an effort to convince the chinese that if they did not stop using gas the americans though poorly equipped insofar as cbw defenses were concerned were prepared to escalate to fullscale ashell attacks in seoul hq col jim norton his face reflecting the soft hues of the operations board kept hearing lin biao so we lose a million or two he closed his eyes and prayed it would net escalate out of control and prayed for the safety of douglas freeman the millimeter chinese shells ripping open the moonlit sky over the yalu were binaries these consisted of two harmless liquid chemicals separated by a membrane that upon rupturing during flight allowed the two liquids to mix so that when the shells struck the american positions a deadly aerosol of nerve gas was released the gas was not detected by any of the enormously expensive and advanced cbw kraut detector wagons moving up to the yalu nor by any of the camsprites small remotecontrolled helicopters equipped with laser altimeters and onboard chemical processors capable of detecting gas as close as one meter above ground instead the gass presence was witnessed by a gi at outpost delta who after seeing all nine men in a section falling after the first explosions a hundred yards to his left donned his cumbersome cbw suit and ran or rather waddled over and used the oldest detector of all a strip of litmus paper stuck on the end of his knife as he dragged it through the snow around the corpses the paper changed color from a navy blue to a salmon pink some of the bodies lay crumpled arms outstretched hands more like claws stiff others looking as if they had been tearing at their chests in the final moments of paralytic asphyxiation the remainder of the bodies were in the fetal position faces buried in vomit the gi as quickly as the cumbersome suit would allow returned to outpost deltas bunker and informed the major who in turn donned his cbw suit and went over to verify the gis report as the chinese artillery barrage intermixed with shell flares continued as the major headed back picking his way through craters that moments before had been an outlying network of trenches the gi began vomiting uncontrollably tearing at his suit which like tens of thousands of others provided by the lowest bidder failed to keep out the gas and became his tomb even as the major signaled to seoul hq that delta was under nerve gas attack what he did not mention because he did not know was that in snow conditions the dispersal of the gas was delayed more than normal increasing its persistency and therefore making it even more deadly the major got the call through to retaliate with atomic shells and died in a violent spasm of diarrhea and vomiting as he in turn was asphyxiated by the gas only dimly hearing the first atomic shells of world war iii whistling through the wintry night into the chinese artillery positions across the yalu from his tunnel position above the yalu general kim supreme commander of nka forces and his chinese cohorts reported to beijing that the americans were using nuclear shells this information though encoded for transmission to beijing was picked up by soviet satellite and chernkos sinosoviet kgb units already knowing the chinese code informed moscow the information convinced suzlov that seeing pandoras box had been opened if at the meeting that night the politburo and stavka agreed he would order a first strike of nuclear as well as chemical weapons in europe before the americanasian policy could be adopted by nato and it would not only be atomic shells but missiles for no other reason than that is what soviet forces had most of this suzlov told his aides was a direct result of the cutback of conventional arms during gorbachevs disastrous tenure for such cutbacks had meant that without enough conventional weapons to stop natos advance the use of chemical and nuclear weapons became inevitable if the americans were to be defeated cautious though he was an apparatchik through and through suzlov also told his aides that if at the meeting the politburo and stavka endorsed him and decided to go nuclear he wouldnt pussyfoot like the americans in vietnam who procrastinated and who could have won the vietnam war in a day had they had the smelostballsto drop an abomb on hanoi he suzlov would go all out and with the indisputable advantage his people had with nuclear bunker defenses he would have the decisive edge chapter fifty ray brentwoods ixe chugged back into san diego harbor as the sun was sinking in a tangerine sky the great towering silhouettes of the warships even more impressive than when ray and his barge crew had left that morning in the distance he could see the sleek black lines of a fast frigate heading out to sea her bow slicing the water like a knife and the phosphorescence of her wake the only visible sign of her progress to war as they tied up ray took the sample bottle of the spill as he had done more than a dozen times since his sludgeremoval barge had been mopping up small spills here and there up the coast while the environmental protection agency in washington wasnt overly concerned with chickenshit spills as one washington official bluntly put it epa had a master data bank into which all oil companies were required to register their cargos fingerprints in the form of having particular isotopes added to each cargo so that polluters could be identified but epa was loath to press either imco the intergovernmental maritime consultative organization or tovalop the tanker owners voluntary agreement on liability for oil pollution to discipline their own members when the oil being spilled by enemy subs sinking allied tankers was astronomically larger than that of local spills the problem was that epa hadnt taken into account what they later dubbed the np or nagging power of local residents up and down californias more affluent coastline who demanded the names of the offending companies and captains who had vented bilge oil at sea so that they could be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and so it was that once a week ray brentwood took his sample bottles of the spills his barge had sucked up to the harbor pollution control office where he could clip the bottle into the analyzer flick on the switch and wait for any matchup with the epas master computer isotope list when the matchups occurred the terminal beeped and like an accusing finger pointing at an overdue library book borrower it kept up until it had stopped spitting out its printout of the matchup between sample and master list this day however two of the twelve samples would not match ray ran them again with the same result next he called epa in washington though with the phone networks still in a mess from sabotage it took him fifteen minutes to get through was it possible he asked that there was oil not fingerprinted with isotopes the answer was a definite no all refined oil and crude was fingerprinted by law and supervised by government inspectors yes answered ray but was it possible that the government rules and regulations had been relaxed because of the war to make it easier to move oil more quickly hell no was the bureaucrats answer doesnt take any time at all to seed the cargo a few drops and its done if you have two that arent matching there must be something wrong with your terminal if you like ill authorize one of our electronic technicians out there to check it out weve got a couple on the base yeah i know them ray brentwood answered thanks the technician took ten minutes to tell him there was nothing wrong with the terminal ray ran the two samples again in the technicians presence aware as he did so that the technician thinking ray couldnt see him was staring at rays face in the kind of fascinated horror that children exhibited upon first seeing him still no friggin matchup ray snapped at the technician master data bank mightnt have all yes it has said ray just as grumpily as before somethings wrong well it aint that terminal man its aokay ray took the two samples down to the privately run yard laboratories and asked the chemical lab technician there if hed do him a favor and run them through the spectrometer after what the navy brass had done to him in their inquiry about the blaine ray was going to play it by the book too and nail the big brass of whatever warship had opened its bilges and caused the ruckus in la jolla and environs the lab technician told him it was his coffee break look said ray im due back at the ship im in a hurry the technician couldnt suppress a smile hed heard about frankensteins boat not a bad guy brentwood they said but man his face was a weapon should send it into north korea get the bastards to surrender in no time okay said the technician magnanimously wouldnt want to delay your sailing what are you on destroyers not at the moment said ray quietly how long will this take whoa there you just got here mac five minutes can you wait that long he flashed a friendly grin ray nodded destroyers screw him its the sulfur content thatll tell us whether its navy or civilian fuel said the technician tell you by the smell its diesel i know that said ray irritably destroyers smartass when the computer slave hooked up to the spectrometer the printer started chattering and the technician his hands thrust deep in the pockets of a scummylooking acidholed lab coat started rocking on his heels announcing knowingly yep whatd i tell you dieseline lets see he leaned closer sulfur content coming hmm thats funny what is asked ray sulfur content the technician answered what about it the technician had stopped rocking and was now frowning it brought a twisted smile to rays face so he was right after all one of the navys big ships had spewed out the oil in the sample or both samples hed get his own back holy toledo the technician said slipping in the second bottle it too was from a diesel load he told ray all right said ray you have a us navy master sheet here the technician was running the sample again i dont need a us master sheet he said he turned around and looked worriedly at ray captain thats baku prime grade were looking at russian oil here how the hell began ray submarine grade said the technician this crap is from diesel subs two different lots cant be said ray brentwood they couldnt get that close to our coast christ even their nuclear jobs are noisier than ours in their silent running mode you can still hear their pumps come in like a heartbeat on the underwater hydrophones and suddenly he stopped listen ive got to check something out real fast but you sit on this until i get back to you understand if were wrong about this well get our butts kicked from here to norfolk what are you going to do asked the technician told you gotta sort something out first ray brentwood was walking quickly down along the docks turning right at one of the submarine tenders toward where hed seen five los angeles attackclass subs tied up overhead in the fastfading twilight gulls screeched and the only parts of the subs that were visible were the white depth numbers painted on the rudders which served as perches for groups of brown dimly silhouetted pelicans now thought ray if only robert were here instead of flitting around the atlantic hed have the answer to his question he tried to think back to the conversation he had had with robert about the subs but his older brother like most submariners had been tightlipped about even the most mundane matters aboard a sub and especially about where they went and what they did the brotherhood of submariners in a nuclear age giving new meaning to the silent service who goes there it was a marine guard his m looking straight at ray brentwood captain ray brentwood check his id it was another marine approaching from the dark shadow of the subs sail ray put his hand up to turn his id tag which had flipped over in the wind dont move ray mumbled a flashlight blinded him instinctively he turned away from it jesus the guard began then shifted the beam to the id tag ixe he called out to the other guard check the board said another voice and now ray was aware that it came from high up on the subs sail from the bridge the officer of the watch a black dot against the rapidly darkening sky sir called out one of the guards ixe is a sludgeremoval barge propelled his id number checks very well said the ood what do you want captain i want to ask a question about subs theyre very well guarded said the ood so i see look its not classified as far as i know but isnt it true that a nuclear subs quieter than the old diesels or any diesel for that matter of course most of the time why ray answered him with a followup question what do you mean most of the time well cooling pumps on a nuclear sub are going all the time have to because of the reactor on a diesel you can shut the engines right down go on batteries no pumps at all no noise then a diesels quieter than a nuclear ray wasnt aware of saying thank you though he did but as he turned back along the pier his pace increased born out of his spite he now knew the answer to the navys riddle of how the russians were getting so close to the convoys and he was now convinced they were close in off the west coast no doubt the east coast as well he was running flat out heart thumping the diesel boats were the key the diesels which in the nuclear age had been relegated to the museums hell the united states no longer had any but they could carry missiles as well as any nuclearpowered ship and they were cheaper he knew that much for every ssn or sea wolf like the roosevelt you could build half a dozen diesels equip them with snorkels the only difference was speed and the time they could stay submerged but if they were on battery power and shut down the engine they could drift and youd never hear them if the war went nuclear in europe and the russians decided to launch having subs close in to the american coast would have an enormous advantage and breathless he arrived in the san diego base commanders office sweat pouring unevenly from his mottled burnpatch face terrifying the wave secretary on duty who screamed bringing two burly shore patrol men in from the duty room ive got ray began but had to stop to catch his breath ive got to see the base commander at once sure buddy said the smaller burlier of the two linebackers you just simmer down now and come with us look said ray jerking his arms but they were locked in the shore patrols grasp call the lt will you sue said the smaller one lt was the shore patrols lingo for loony truck with the stress of this war a lot of the guys and some of the women too just plain flipped their lids chapter fiftyone standing back to front with him alexsandra felt her hair fall softly across sergeis chest her hands plying behind her cupping him squeezing him he felt so hard he could penetrate steel then she would relax her grip kneading his groin with her clenched fists and turning to face him would kiss him all over as they fell on the bed then suddenly she would sit upright hair swinging back her breasts thrusting nipples engorged like dark cherries her hands behind her again pulling him slowly with mounting strength and squeezing it at the same time until he groaned and mumbled nonsensically in his pleasure suddenly she was off the bed getting dressed his favorite tease verniscome backhe demanded then pleaded no yes no sandra slowly she advanced toward him now he gasped i cant stand it any longer its long enough already she giggled she didnt love him but he was fun she was sure it had been his influence that had got her released from the kgb jail if she worked on him maybe if god wished her two remaining brothers alexander and myshka might be set free it was a vain hope she knew but so long as there was any possibility she must try do anything if it would help it meant that she had to pretend a lot faking an orgasm for his manly pride when she had wanted to choke him but after pretending so long she had begun to enjoy it and the rougher he was with her as he approached climax the more she liked it it helped to rationalize what she was doing it was gods way she decided of helping her get through it sit on me he ordered quickly quickly as she slid down upon him the storm outside seemed to grow stronger uncontrollable the wind smacking the bare branches of the beech tree against the ancient windowpane making a scratching noise like a cat trying to get in his nostrils sucked in her smell as his hands and wrist muscles tensed his body moving up and down beneath her her breasts rising and falling faster and faster her loins pressed hard against his sweatslicked thighs until she too began moaning with pleasure ray brentwood asked the chief petty officer in charge of cells at the san diego base if he brentwood wrote a note would the petty officer deliver it to either the base commander or the bases director of naval intelligence as soon as possible the chief petty officer read it you sure about this captain look chief im not nuts bit too excited i guess when your guys picked me up thats all and i hope youre not nuts either because if you dont get that to someone fast theyre gonna do a pearl harbor on you what dyou mean i mean in fortyone there was a message in the hopper warning pearl of an impending japanese attack the day before it happened but some jerk back in washington decided to use western union instead of calling it through ive got evidence here that there are at least two russian subs close inshore and i mean close in closer than anyone believed possible because all we could think of was nuclear and he paused as the cpo his jaw clenched looking like he was grinding his molars read brentwoods message again chief said brentwood you deliver that now and youre going to be part of history a hero you dont deliver it and your namell be shit in every textbook ever written about this war course if you dont do anything about it well all be dead so there wont be any history for you to worry about anyway the chief looked at brentwood and then staggered him hell i cant take it anywhere i cant leave my post hey ill use a walkietalkie link to patrol get em down here to run it up for us brentwood sat back on the hard cell mattress letting his head roll against the cold brick you keep this up chief and theyll make you an admiral the chief of naval intelligence for san diego base was down in the cells fifteen minutes later he listened to brentwood and told the shore patrol to get the lab technician out of bed to verify it drag him here if you have to when the patrol knocked on the technicians door he had just convinced his wife to give him some relief he swore a lot when they barged in on him and told him hed have to go back with them right now he asked incredulously damn near midnight my god said his wife whats he done cant say maam then you cant take him if theres no charge its all right norma i know what its about what tell me cant tell you hon said the technician struggling to get into his pants and nearly falling its classified whats her name called norma when they got him out to the humvee it was ten after midnight and norma was sure he was mixed up with some other woman an admirals wife he was always telling her he needed it more than most men maybe she should have let him have his way more often lord maybe it was drugs she phoned her mother whatd i tell you norma i told you hes a bum but oh no you knew better hes a bum norma on the other side of the world frank shirer was flying as left wingman in a fingerfour formation of four f tomcats out of kapsan air base thirty miles south of the yalu he was regretting he had broken one of the cardinal rules for combat pilots in not having a substantial breakfast before going up on the border patrol but the problem was he had never been a breakfast man early mornings not his forte but normally he would have grabbed at least a continental juice toast and coffee it wasnt enough for a pilot who might have to go into a sustained high gturn and he hadnt slept well during the night hed had dreams of the russian fighters out of vladivostok attacking the in which he had flown freeman to korea he was also a little nervous and almost regretted heresy for a pilot having accepted freemans offer of a few days of combat patrol to keep his hand in before flying the repaired back to the states tomorrow the skills of the fighter pilot never left you but the sudden switch from the big to a tomcat was like going from a bus to a sports car and the morning before hed been a little slow as the tomcat leaders left wingman hed been only a fraction of a second late in a breakaway but a fraction of a second could mean you were dead when you were flying over the fence the yalu more and more mig as had been seen in manchurian air space riding range on the other side and sometimes they looked identical to us planes on the radar two f eagles and an f had been splashed off the coast by fellow us navy fighters because iff identification friend or foe had been made on radar alone as a result the american rules of engagement now stated that all us pilots could not engage before iff had been established by visual fixa radar blip insufficient to assume a bogey or unidentified aircraft was in fact a judyan enemy plane even the normally swashbuckling freeman before hed disappeared across the yalu had endorsed the rule but the necessity of having to make a visual fix imposed a serious tactical disadvantage on the american pilots it meant that the longrange missiles such as the ninemilerange infrared homing sidewinder which needed time even though this was measured in milliseconds to lock on to an enemys exhaust or side heat patch couldnt be used to anywhere near their full effectiveness at shorter ranges the missile could be evaded by the tightturning migs before the sidewinder had time to lock on for this reason the sparrow missile was preferred ironically it had a longer range at twentyfour miles than the sidewinder but did not require heat exhaust to lock on and could be fired from any angle but at pounds it was more than twice as heavy as the sidewinder and this meant fewer missiles could be carried bogeys two oclock high it was the wingman right side of the fingerfour formation of tomcats the four blips coming out of the northwest behind and to the right as the tomcats headed southwest over the yalu the blips were fourteen miles away the tomcats leader had a choice to either break left south away from the yalu into the us andsouthkoreanheld north korea or to go north for a visible fix with the possibility of engagement if the bogeys turned out to be judys the tomcats had already consumed half their fuel go for iff announced the tomcat leader and the fs turned tightly pulling seven gs shirer already feeling the effect of his heart literally distending under the pull of the g forces wishing now more than ever that hed had the toast behind him his radar intercept officer had gone to warning yellow weapons hold status his active radar frantically hipping and the northrop tcs longrange television camera set unable to identify the blips because of heavy cumulus which the blips were now entering the four tomcats had split into two combat pairs shirer still on his leaders left and back covering him the tomcats wings now coming in from the extended fuelconserving position to the tight v for greater speed at the cost of increasing fuel consumption shirer heard the pratt and whitney turbofans screaming as he and the leader went to afterburner bandits it was the leaders radar intercept officer and now shirers rio was telling him that from the computerenhanced radar crosssection image the bogeys were in fact russian fighters fulcrums he advised shirer as shirer still close to his leader saw a puff of smoke and the two tomcats broke leader to the right shirer to the left the soviet missile passing between them the next instant shirers rio was yelling tallyho one behind us behind us telling shirer a fulcrum had been sighted penetrating their cone of vulnerability shirer went into a knifeedged turn and dropped the fulcrum passing over him and down shirer slowing trying to go into a scissors trying to reverse fee situation putting his tomcat behind the fulcrum master arm on said shirer readying to fire a sparrow were behind him were behind him called the rio centering up the t centering up the dot said shirer the fulcrum on afterburner was already two miles ahead still on the tomcats radar the other tomcats having broken up into individual dogfights with the remaining three fulcrums fox one fox one shirer announced then felt the tug on the plane as the sparrow missile streaked ahead the fulcrum now only miles away hes climbing said the rio then suddenly hes gone the rios voice was incredulous shit hes gone his tone was one of utter astonishment cant be said shirer we had a lock on yeah but hes gone man sergei marchenko was in a nearvertical eightytwodegree climb going up the wall on afterburner in the plane that even western experts acknowledged had no unnatural positions after two seconds he had climbed another two thousand feet suddenly he reduced thrust to idle on the two eighteenthousandpoundthrust tumanskys bleeding off speed the planes attitude a hammerhead stallslide in the vertical plane the effect of this on the enemys doppler radar calculated to be one of utter confusion for without relative speed measurement no target would appear on the enemy planes screen shirer remembered the russian maneuver reduced thrust went into a climb broke cloud and glimpsed the fulcrum still above him sliding backward into his hud sight it was only for a fraction of a second shirers thumb pushed the vulcan button the burst only a half second but in that time twentyfive of the machine guns twentymillimeter bullets hit the fulcrums spine the burst finishing its run in the cockpit the fulcrums perspex exploding in whitishgreen fragments the fulcrum kept sliding tail first its number nine in front of the box jet intake and the slogan ubiytsa yankiyankee killerseen only briefly before the fighter quickly went into an uncontrolled spin the big slab tail fins a gray blur obscured momentarily by the sudden opening of the cruciform braking chute but now the plane was burning and in another second the chute was a black smudge against the snow of the yalus foothills the explosion as the fulcrum hit a silent orange blossom good kill good kill the rio was shouting any pilot chute asked shirer negative confirmed his rio no chute great now i can go back to the bus by this time tomorrow night ill be heading back to andrews the rio was perplexed the only bus he knew about was the reentryvehicle dispenser used on intercontinental ballistic missiles by now the four tomcats were too far apart and their fuel too low after the afterburners greedy consumption to regroup and so they made their way individually back to kapsan field south of the yalu in washington president mayne was sitting quietly behind the oval office desk as he and the four chiefs of staff security adviser schuman and press secretary trainor listened to the chief of naval operations so gentlemen mayne asked the migrane that had threatened him thwarted not only by medication but by sheer will what to do tell the russians said the cno admiral horton if they go nuclear well fire everything weve got dont by silly said mayne the admiral was stunned as were the other chiefs of staff and press aide paul trainor though trainor with long experience in front of the press did not betray his surprise adviser schuman however was not surprised and sat holding his cane calmly gazing down at the plush carpet observing the intricate design of the new great seal of the united states at war the eagles clutch of arrows in the right rather than the left claws the presidents correct said schuman you people were telling us only the other day admiral that whatever their deficiencies the russians are infinitely better equipped to have at least a quarter of the population avail themselves of extensive nuclear shelters we however are out to lunch as far as thats concerned because as you correctly pointed out gentlemen my learned colleagues in congress have long accepted mr sagans view that a nuclear war is unwinnable never mind the limited radiation yield for example on our atomic shells et cetera mr billions and billions and his disciples convinced us that civil defense was futile now were paying the price for our gullibility on that score and because of that the only thing we can really threaten them with is our submarinelaunched missiles we have a few icbms operational in the midwest but communications are so generally fouled up because of continuing sabotage we cannot depend on any realistic coordinated or widespread missile offense from our landbased silos or from sac sir i think began allet oh yes yes said schuman you may get a few planes off providing the spets cells in this country who we already know have used surfacetoair stinger missiles dont bring them down as they take off besides it will take only one or two air bursts and the resulting electromagnetic pulse would scramble whatever networks we have remaining theres not enough sheathed wire in the country to prevent a wholesale screwup mayne had never heard schuman use anything approaching foul language no continued schuman morosely yet emphatically using the tip of his cane like an exclamation point in the last analysis we can really rely only on our submarines he turned to the cno can we get a message to them about the korean situation vis√†vis the use of chinese nerve gas and usashell retaliation perhaps tempting the soviets to go nuclear in europe admiral horton pointed out it would be difficult to raise all of the submarines as even in the best of circumstances there were problems with thermal inversions atmospheric conditions et cetera though he conceded submarines would certainly be alert to any massive nuclear engagement in progress air bursts above most targets especially those on the seaboard such as new york and boston and in europe above such vital ports as portsmouth and hamburg would be picked up all over the world by some sub via the sound channel then concluded a somber schuman seeing as our civilian population is without shelters of any kind against an allout exchange the only option well have if things become unraveled is tit for tat instant retaliation target for target the president nodded they could hear the clock on the mantel above the fireplace finally it was mayne who broke the silence of course if merlin succeeds we might be off the hook prevent europe from turning into another yalu the chiefs were split on this the army thought that if the sas could eliminate the moscow leadership it would certainly buy time the navy and air force however were still worried about the ialindependent launch authorityof soviet submarines surely to god said mayne we must know where most of their subs are and so be ready to intercept any most of their nukes yes sir answered horton that is we can pretty well tell you the general areas where all the nuclear subs are but the problem is that if this exhausted the admiral tried to think of the mans name but the more he tried the more it receded captain ray brentwood said trainor yes well the problem is if his hypothesis about two dieselelectrics being close in somewhere on the west coast is correct we could be in a lot of trouble now that weve managed to repair the severed hydrophone arrays on the east coast weve got the situation in hand in the atlantic of course thats where weve had our greatest concentration of asw forces because of the nato convoys the problem in the pacific is that they dont have to go through anything like the greenlandicelanduk gap where we managed to sink a lot of the russian subs early on the assumption made by this ray brentwood and i think hes correct is that the two dieselelectrics unaccounted for probably came out of vladivostok snorkeling in bad weather when its hard to spot them even by satellite and when prop noise is difficult to pick up coming down from the japanese current into the southbound californian current theyd be able to drift a ways and come in close on battery power their silent running unlike that of the nukes is really silent at least with their nukes our hydrophones can pick up the sound of the pumps how big are these dieselelectrics asked the president assuming these are the ones whose signatures we had prewar but cannot account for now wed say theyre probably converted golf vclass dieselelectrics around twentyseven hundred tons three hundred and twentyeight feet long carrying either one ssn or two ssn icbms and ten torpedoes this brentwood thinks theyre probably carrying the two ssns each warhead a reentry vehicle with seven hundred and fifty kilotons not very fast subs compared to the nuclear boats seventeen knots surface twelve to fourteen submerged but they can fire intercontinental ballistic missiles yes sir this brentwood in san diego thought at first that the oil was accidentally discharged as an enemy sub wouldnt deliberately leak oil but now he seems to think its the old russian problem good at quantity they made at least thirteen golfclass subs that we know of but theyre not good at quality that is the leaks were probably from either poor design or lines squeezed by the pressure on the hull you think we can find them admiral the cno exhaled slowly we can put everything in the area saturate the coast with asw drop hundreds of active sonar buoys which will send out pulses unlike our sosus arrays on the bottom should be able to get echoes but we need it carefully coordinated mr president if we dont know exactly where all our asw ships are at any moment one of our ships could mistake an echo from one of our own for one of the russian subs one thing i would recommend mr president is that we shift as many mobile surfacetoair missiles from the midwestern states to the west coast as possible fly them in if necessary on galaxy transports so that interjected the president if either of these soviet diesels wherever they are do fire we stand a chance of intercepting them thats the general idea sir yes but hopefully we can corner them before they get off any shots if we find them im sure we can sink them their speed cant outrun us ive already ordered a cluster of surfacetoair mobiles around san diego bangor washington state and norfolk sub pens brentwood believes san diego is the target and id go for that i mean with their slow speed and limited battery power theyd have to start up engines if they were to go further north to attack targets up there if these dieselelectrics fire from close in whats our response time i mean how long would we have to intercept response time would be just about zero mr president if theyre going for targets like san diego right on the seaboard has this brentwood any suggestions yes sir he wants overlapping airborne patrols up and down the coast looking for diesel oil patches have you done it sounds like a good idea theyre on patrol now sir reported air force general allet will they be able to spot anything at night yes sir infrared and patch color distinguishers are aboard as well as mad magnetic anomaly detectors and sonar buoys weve also got the satellites on the job but unless the subs are near the surface emitting heat for thermal patches the satellites are only of limited use in this case now gentlemen said mayne i dont want any foulups here from what youve told me we need firstrate coordination between the navy airborne asw and were already working on that now mr president what maynes outburst was so sharp that trainor thought the migraine must be winning the battle but it was plain anger straight from the heart now dont you boys go jurisdictional on me there isnt time to play bureaucratic parlor games about whos going to be cock of the walk i would think this brentwood is the man for the job seems to me hes made some pretty sound deductions so far hes been in on the ground floor what say we appoint him there was an awkward silence ended by trainor ah mr president captain brentwood was the commander of the uss blaine mayne nodded readily remembering the ship for it was the attack on her as well as the nka forces pouring over the dmz in korea that had been the flash point that had started the whole war yes yes i know he answered fished him out when some of his men were still aboard as i recall suspected cowardice we cant say that for certain mr president began admiral horton but i would advise against appointing someone who has been named an interested party in the inquiry that followed but as i understood it the evidence was circumstantial replied mayne that is he could have been helped pushed overboard or whatever by a member of the crew who had every right to do so if he felt the ship was going down yes sir it could bear that interpretation benefit of doubt gentlemen said mayne besides he followed this oil business with some diligence i say give him a boat the cno flushed maynes persistent use of boat instead of ship annoyed him intensely particularly as he suspected that mayne deliberately used it whenever he was being particularly dismissive of naval tradition give him a boat and put him in charge said mayne hes johnnyonthespot the admiral wasnt agreeing or disagreeing keeping his options open i should point out mr president that if we were to do this brentwood couldnt retain his present rank and it might send out an ambiguous message to admiral the change in maynes tone was icecold as your commander in chief i order you to assign coordination of this operation on the west coast to captain brentwood and to assign him without delay command of the fastest most uptodate asw ship afloat do you read me yes mr president i want to know by dispatch rider if at and t cant get this goddamn phone service back in shape within fifteen minutes the name of the ship to which this brentwood has been assigned its vital he have no bureaucratic hindrance whatsoever so hell have to be put in overall command of west coast naval defense as well now if this means slapping a few more gold rings on his sleeve do it and do so without delay make him an admiral if you have to the president turned to trainor paul yes sir have an executive order typed up to this effect immediately ill sign so the admiral here can take it with him and i want it done in five minutes get rosey onto it shes the fastest yes mr president then get me san diego on the shortwave relay if you have to and the admiral can inform the base commander there verbally i cant use plain language on the phone mr president interjected the cno i mean if the russians know what were up to have you a verbal code asked the president yes sir i can read out a letterforword code have you a bible my glory admiral isnt that the most logical book the russians would expect for a lettertoword code we dont use the king james version mr president we use one of the modernized versions oh all right said mayne in that case youre quite safe no onell understand it while they were waiting for typed authorization mayne told the chiefs one thing the british wont do is promote quickly in the field class system you see he paused by god i hope we havent lost doug freeman now theres a general whod promote in the field made a private a captain once in the dortmundbielefeld pocket to get the job done the base commanders office in san diego was in a flap frankensteinhe of ixe had suddenly been propelled to no less than admiral bullshit roared the base commander adm roger d rutgers the second must be a code screwup he informed the wave secretary no sir weve had it confirmed well ill be sir it was the wave trying frantically to signal with her eyes that someone was right behind her ah admiral she spluttered sir this is captain i mean its all right sue calm yourself said rutgers as he saluted and coming around from his desk offered his congratulations to ray brentwood brentwood returned the salute shook hands relished it and wasted no time with small talk he had a list a short one which he presented to rutgers point one he wanted all commanders of asw ships in port to report to his office immediately two all asw ships in port that were seaworthy were to be fully loaded and ready for sea by only a few hours away the base commander pointed out with all due respect which brentwood knew was without any respect at all that the large number of civilian longshoremen involved in the loading of stores would have by union regulations to be given at least fortyeight hours written advance notice of any such change in the agreedupon working hours admiral rutgers said ray brentwood under the power invested in me through the presidents executive emergency war order d any longshoreman refusing to load american warships at any time will be shot under the conditions which apply to all alien andor indigenous saboteurs and if you dont have the ships loaded ill shoot you the wave was speechless in all my years began rutgers admiral rutgers if you dont do what i tell you and get those commanders to my office right now none of us will have any years left where thundered rutgers barely under control is your office it was the only time that ray brentwood had smiled since arriving in san diego ixe what the hells ix rutgers asked sue so incensed he could barely speak the wave ran her finger quickly down the long list of auxiliary vessels its its a barge sir a what barge sir sludge removal she replied frightened adding timidly propelled propelled they said rutgers sounded like a sea lion bull in the san diego zoo chapter fiftytwo the chief engineer aboard the uss roosevelt had managed by raising more pressure in the lesserdamaged port ballast tanks to force out more water for a while as the sub rose to just over two hundred feet below the ice roof of the surface it seemed as if with her flaps downdiving planes reversed in the vertical position ready to pick the ice survival was near at hand but then she stopped rising the damage sustained by the ballast tanks under the alfas attack too great to allow further lift the emotional roller coaster of depression after the near fatal miss by the alfas torpedoes the belief that they were trapped then the mounting excitement as the ship had slowly risen a little and then the plunge back again into depression as she lay there was almost too much to bear but bear it they did without histrionics or ill temper but quietly now and bravely as if all the world were watching when they knew the world was not that they were alone each submariners doubts and fears battened down in the watertight compartments of his soul not one whined about the contaminated atmosphere they now breathed as a result of the radioactive water that had poured into the sub depending on where they were in the sub at the time they had received between and rads which in the cold undeniable statistics of radioactivity meant that more than percent of these men would the within weeks or months depending on their individual metabolism those whod received between and rads were already doomed to shorter life expectancy through longerterm cancer and any children they might have would be subject to the risk of genetic defects even if old bing as they referred affectionately to robert brentwood could perform the impossible and get them out of the sub within the next few hours for some given what they saw as the utter impossibility of brentwood ever getting them out of it it was as if the gods were merely playing with them for their sport for while monitors showed that the steel hatch covers of the missile tubes were unaffected the escape hatch covers remained jammed shut robert brentwood and the chief engineer the pile of blueprints before them turned pale gray in the reddenedout control room light as they pored over the subs intricate systems brentwood posing possibilities the chief listening but confronted by the sheer logic of physics the chief was forced to reject all the captains proposals as unworkable due to some irreparable malfunction caused by the alfas attack both acutely aware of the supreme irony voiced disgustedly by the chief that the only thing still in full working order was sherwood forest and its firing control system rifles in fine working order eh chief said brentwood but the rifleman is down thats about it behind them peter zeldman kept moving from the red of control to the blue light of the sonar everyone in the ship knowing that after the explosions both enemy air and sea vessels could be moving toward them to investigate zeldman stared at the fathometer willing its recorder needle to move upward from two hundred feet for one breathless moment he saw the needle registering only to see it fall back to the momentary rise due not to any increase in buoyancy in the subs ballast tanks as hed hoped but rather to a cold updraft or column of water rising locally because of differences in the seas salinity if i didnt know better zeldman told sonar operator emerson id say some joker was up there trying to get us mad emerson didnt reply despite the small cross he unabashedly wore about his neck he rarely spoke about his religious beliefs but he believed unreservedly in the goldfishbowl view of god that the creator made the world put us in to swim and after that it was up to the goldfish that divine intervention came only at the beginning and all else was a matter of accident in which only a persons will and courage could alter the outcome if it was their fate to die then they would all enter gods other domain in which judgment would be revealed sonarman link emersons colleague and backup on the shift thought all religion bullshit and the two were the best of friends their bond mutual tolerance for each others weird beliefs and their love their passion to be what they were americas point men in the earths largest domain any change in the ice growl asked zeldman nothing sir replied link knowing that zeldmans question was to verify emersons evaluation that there was no singingsignificant sound amid the cacophony of ice growl shrimp snapping and other ocean noises in control the light from the reactor room lit up con acknowledged brentwood captain we have a minor steam leak can you contain it asked brentwood calmly no problem at the moment sir very well acknowledged brentwood you in foil he was referring to the bright silver heatreflecting suit with airbreathing hose attached which was required by regulation for any repairs in the reactor room yes sir keep me posted yes captain brentwood turned back to the blueprints of the sub enter it in the log pete yes sir replied zeldman brentwood stood up ran his fingers through his hair and arms akimbo rotated his torso to rid himself of the stiffness of having been hunched over the blueprints for so long going aft to stretch my legs chief you come up with anything call me immediately aye aye sir what brentwood meant beneath the mundane exchange was that it was time to walk throughto see how each department on the four levels of the sub was holding up as he passed the galley he could smell hamburgers frying sliders cook yes sir suits me said brentwood easily farther on he saw two stewards coming toward him from sherwood forest laden down with bags of onions and potatoes that had been strung up from the maze of pipes that surrounded the six missile tubes next he passed a man coining up from the stern ballast area and noticed the sailors yellow thermoluminescent dosimeter was missing from his belt wheres your td sailor the man looked down guiltily sorry sir loosened my belt on the off shift and go get it said brentwood patting him on the shoulder and passing on into the cool clean polished smell of sherwood forest the ventilators fans like a running stream it made no sense to him but compared to the rest of the sub in sherwood forest for all its electronic wizardry he had the same feeling of tranquillity that he had experienced as a boy in the woods of washington state and oregon standing close together against the missiles firing control panels were two technicians the first checking the twentyfive rows of circuit indicator lights on one of the tall bluegray consoles the other man checking the first mans every move verifying the sequence another pair were checking the missile tubes monitors making sure the humidity and temperature in each of the six chocolatebrown missile tubes were within operational parameters as robert walked down the starboard side the big white numbers on the chocolate tubes indicating missiles one three and five passed him like slow tracer as he kept moving through the forest that took up a full third of the sub his sense of frustration at not being able to get his men out of harms way unable to maneuver except for the two paltry fiveknotmaximum props set in the afterballast tanks while the six multiwarhead missiles were safe grew until he had to caution himself to calm down if only they could get to the surface rising fast enough to smash through sonaridentified thinner ice they might stand some chance but unless the sub could rise the hope of getting the men out airlifted off the ice to spitzberg or south to iceland or even west to greenland was just a dream realistically however robert brentwood knew their only prospects now were that the sub would in fact go deeper if any more leaks occurred and each inch she fell increased the taffythe effect of increased water pressure over her entire hull after reaching the reactor room and satisfying himself that the steam leak was in fact minor he passed on to the engine room noting along the way that some of the green rubberized tile on the walkway had curled at the edges it was down here that some of the worst leaks had occurred before the pumps had got them under control you boys enjoy the dip he asked yes sir answered a gingerheaded young auxiliary room mechanic who looked to robert brentwood as if he must be no more than nineteen or twenty about the same age as rosemarys younger brother whose bones now lay scattered somewhere on the bottom of the atlantic brentwood saw the mans dosimeter had exceeded the twohundredrad mark and the young man saw him notice but smiled goodnaturedly before turning away busying himself with the oil pressure gauges robert brentwood was so moved by the young mechanics quiet bravery that as he headed back through sherwood forest he took out a kleenex pretending to blow his nose using the tissue as a cover for the overwhelming tears of pride and the sense of honor it gave him to command such men seeing another pair of missile technicians working the portside monitors he quipped lightheartedly hope you boys arent getting bored down here no sir captain answered one these ds are more temperamental humiditys it came to him in a flash he could have hugged the technician name patch sayers except they would have labeled him as a sectioneight as it was the two technicians saw brentwood do something that no one had ever seen bing do he began running through the sub the alternate numbers of the missiles on the port side two four six flashing by him halfway along he heard the soft gong captain to control captain to control howd he know they were gonna call him asked sayers dont ask me man replied his checker sixth sense sub captains got to have it i hear bullshit no way he couldve hey man watch it you missed a step back up in the sequence as brentwood entered control he was told by zeldman they had a contact hostile asked brentwood catching his breath too far away as yet answered zeldman the estimate is fiftyfive thousand yards about thirty miles brentwood had always made it a habit to be overly conservative when it came to estimates of contact distances and decided to act as if the approaching submarine as it certainly couldnt be a surface vessel was closer to them whats your guesstimate link brentwood asked the other sonarman well sir its a bit fuzzy but that may be because some of our sensors were ruptured during the alfa attack but its definitely coming towards hes gone said emerson shut down his active all eyes in control were on the monitor panels brentwood seemed as alarmed now as he had been excited when he entered control very well he said the phrase and his tone gathering them all together he gave orders for the emergency props to be extended from the belly of the sub if they couldnt rise they could at least turn roosevelt to face the lastknown bearing of the sonar contact and try to defend headon rather than sitting like a sunken log offering their flank next he ordered all torpedo tubes loaded advising the torpedo officer to be ready for snapshot two one or informing him as they were under possible attack they might have to get a quick return shot away within forty seconds during this time the torpedo crew would have to flood the tubes open their caps and maintain tandem communication with the mark firing control system either way torpedo room brentwood advised i want you to load one sa tube one pa tube with shortrange contact fuse fish one tube starboard abaft with contact fish one port abaft with contact fish came the confirmation shortrange fuse man battle stations missile ordered brentwood standing by the raised podium of the control rooms attack center his arms folded the small of his back touching the brass rail that girded the search and the attack periscopes housing set condition one sq they were now on highest alert set condition one sq aye aye sir repeated zeldman and upon seeing the various departments punching in ready he confirmed condition one sq all set very well answered brentwood neutral trim in neutral trim now sir very well prepare to spin several men in control looked across at each other in alarm stand by to flood tubes two three and four ordered brentwood and they could hear the faint rushing of water filling the torpedo tubes tube one already contained the mark with contact fuse the remaining three torpedoes now sliding forward from their railtracked dollies into the tubes assuring that roosevelt was now ready to fire at any enemy sub if thats what the contact had been which might try to run interference with the missile launch inside missile control the weapons officer was waiting anxiously for the order to complete spinup entering the local orientating corrections into the missiles computers so as to assure the best possible trajectories for the marved maneuvering reentry vehicle warheads but as yet no targets had been given given their present location there were any number brentwood could choose under the us policy of counter force that is against military targets only and not cities it wasnt as if brentwood didnt have enough to choose from in fact the nearest and most worthwhile targets would be the forty highpriority military bases clustered along the kola peninsula but still the designation of targets had not come and instead brentwood requested missile status report sir the spinups not complete do as i say snapped brentwood prepare missiles for launch yes sir preparing missiles for launch very well prepare for ripple fire yes sir prepare for ripple fire all over the ship men were moving to their firing positions within two seconds of the operator squeezing the yellow handle and the soft but persistent musical gong sounding the ripple firing sequence they were readying for one that would eject missile six first then missile one this staggered sequence would offset starboard and port yawing when water would rush into the fourstoried missile tubes after each pound missile had passed through its blue asbestos phenolic dome the dome would shatter first its symmetrical destruction being achieved by small explosive charges under each dome a split second before the steam pressure expelled whichever missiles brentwood would select sir said peter zeldman we have no radio message to launch have you reason for independent authority to launch it was the first and as it would turn out the last time peter zeldman would ever question an order by robert brentwood dont worry mr zeldman brentwood said so all of control could hear the missiles i select will not have their warheads armed zeldman exchanged a quick glance with the chief was brentwood cracking up like zeldman and others the weapons officer looked worried too and it wasnt missed by his assistant who with wire trailing from his headphones was moving back and forth head bent like a priest at prayer along the narrow blood alley the reddedout corridor of high computer banks where he checked out each missiles status verifying for the weapons officer that each of the six trident d missiles was ready to pass through its four prelaunch modes missiles ready the weapons officer confirmed to control very well said brentwood prepare for ripple fire while the weapons officer his forehead beaded with perspiration waited for the designation of targets in control robert brentwood doublechecking the computer screens that all missiles were as hed just been told verbally ready for launch held his key ready to click into the mark missile firing control system the weapons officer waiting below his black flexihose trailing snakelike behind him from the plastic red firing grip in his hand his thumb was now on the transparent protector cap ready to flip it up and depress the red button six times in rapid succession the moment brentwood gave him the order the ice it was a hoarse whisper from the bloodcolored face of the assistant weapons officer if we fire weapons officer called brentwood his voice calm resolute weapons officer sir disarm missiles one and six stand by the weapons officer hesitated but only for a moment disarm missiles one and six yes sir missiles disarmed very well stand by what the hell began the assistant wo be quiet said the wo brentwood turned toward emerson sonar any further contact no sir brentwood knew that if it was a hostile it would be in torpedo range within thirty minutes in that moment he envied his brothers and sister far away somewhere on dry land solid ground beneath their feet high over the english channel beneath the heavy throb of three combat talon iiis the fast upgraded versions of the hercules carrying the sass sabre squadron to its mission the occasional flashes of blue forked lightning illuminated the sas troopers blackened faces and their coldweather khaki greenwhite winter combat uniforms the allwhite spets overlays were to be used only after the attack for as the rsm had no need to point out the overlays would be dead giveaways if they turn on the searchlights and fire parachute flares wont be any said aussie its a surprise remember if there are searchlights et cetera the rsm happily corrected himself as he walked or rather shuffled beneath his pound pack between the two rows of ten men each which formed david brentwoods b troop the plane carrying a troop a quarter mile ahead that carrying c the same distance behind wish hed sit down said aussie stop motherin us givin me the bloody pip he is conscientious said schwarzenegger hey dave aussie asked brentwood his voice rising above the sound of the engines rolling thunder what dyou reckon think therell be a reception party we know there will put in thelman spets two companies aw said the aussie dismissively i dont mean them bastardsll be asleep time we make the big jump well past their bedtime no i mean the aa boys think theyll be onto us when we make the jump youre a cheery son of a bitch said thelman not talkin to you thelma dave whaddya reckon possible commented david who having been one of those who picked at random had had his gun jam during the dry runs through the house was now checking his ingram mac submachine gun the ninemillimeter short weapon which on a quick glance looked like an uzi its pistol grip doubling as the housing for a thirtytworound magazine had a barrel only half the length of the uzi with a folding stock and effective range of fifty meters this was less than the uzis twohundredmeter range but in closequarters housecleaning it was considered more than adequate by the sas troops and the ingrams shorter range was more than compensated for by its overall weight of kilograms less than half that of an uzi besides the sas liked the american gun better because it produced a wider spray pattern much preferred in general housecleaning than in the terroristhostage ops when a wider spray was as likely to cut down a hostage as a terrorist above all in an operation of this type the americanmade ingram inculcated what the sas liked best about the american disposition the desire to get things done quickly achieving a rate of fire of over eleven hundred rounds per minute twice the number that the ubiquitous uzi could deliver in the same time bad weather is in our favor going in commented the rsm reassuringly play merry hell with their radar and no way theyll hear us over all this ruddy thunder anyway these talon ii transports have more electronic countermeasures gear and infrared gear than you can shake a stick at besides were too high how about the weather over the target asked thelman clear so the pilot tells me answered the rsm dont worry lads youre in luck youre in luck he says commented aussie laconically throwing his head up pushing his helmet back against the cargo net and turning first to thelman on his right then schwarzenegger to his left and then back up at the rsm you going home then after we jump return flight is it all right said the rsm were in luck suit you better then matey said aussie suddenly producing a small indelible pencil the flash of lightning reflected from the heavy cloud cover illuminating the bizarre contrast between his dark camouflage paint green khaki uniform and pink tongue put your money where your mouth is come on you blokes i believe the sarge four to one says theres no reception committee youre crazy said thelman goddamn nuttier than a fruitcake the rsm feigned disgust but whatever else he was the aussie was an entertainer and whether the men realized it or not by being willing to take wagers about what kind of interference they might expect over the drop zone the australian and his outrageous obsession with gambling kept the others eighteen not counting the rsm in brentwoods troop from dwelling on their own fears even the taciturn brentwood the rsm noticed who had seemed unduly subdued more so than most of his men and not a good sign in the man leading the troop couldnt help but shake his head at the australians willingness to bet on anything the rsm flicked the aussies indelible pencil where the hell did you stash that he asked for there didnt seem to be a spare centimeter in the pound pack they were carrying the aussie lifted his right magazine pouch showing a piece of blackened sticking plaster which hed used to attach the pencil all right step up the ladder the aussie called out to them whos game a quid there are no lights on us said cpl choir williams a stout welshman of tough mining stock who in addition to his standard troopers load of eight of the sass own flashbang magnesium stun grenades was also carrying three french light and disposable arpac antitank launcher missile packs hopefully they wouldnt need them but if they came up against russian armor during their withdrawal rye wanted them to have something other than the normal heavy antitank weapons given the fact that they were already loaded to the hilt with abseiling grappling equipment as well as ammunition and grenades hey said choir are you marking my bet down then aussie sorry sport a quid hardly worth the trouble im looking to retirement minimum bet ten quid or you yanks twentyfive bucks aw ill be generous twenty bucks up yours said williams with brass knobs on promise said aussie twenty for me said schwarzenegger no reception committee okeydokey fritz youre covered with that lewis licked the indelible pencil and carefully entered the bet on the palm of his left hand what if you lose your mitt said thelman morbid thelma very morbid i wont be losing anything the amber light came on and they heard the pilots voice twenty minutes to the drop zone right lads said the rsm final check david squeezed his canvas side holster until he could feel the browning ninemillimeters hard outline at the same time his left hand beneath his right felt the light but strong kevlar sportsman crotch protector he was sure that if he was going to be hit anywhere it would be there he thought of melissa and stacy and let his memory of lili evict them from his mind as he flipped up the cover on his compass watch holding his arm up the signal for everyone to synchronize from now on nine minutes to target he not the rsm was in total command of troop b chapter fiftythree president maynes idea of going to camp david was as his press aide paul trainor knew militarily unwise the shelter there wasnt as good as that below the white house and it was farther from andrews where in the event of a nuclear exchange the president would need to go to board neacpkneecapthe national emergency airborne command plane but politically the president going to camp david was a smart ploy all three evening news networks despite the lead stories of deepening gloom about the possible escalation of the war in europe because of the korean situationshowed the president smiling confident even relaxed waving as he stepped aboard the presidential chopper on the south lawn heading off to spend the weekend at camp david another bevy of television reporters was on hand to watch him being piped aboard camp david it being a naval establishment the cameras still showing mayne smiling above all from the moment he left the white house alighted from the chopper and entered the bulletproof limousine which soon eased to a stop in front of the aspen lodge he conveyed the impression that the president and commander in chief of the united states had matters firmly in hand if things were bad mayne had never seen any point in making them seem worse especially to the public accordingly he had insisted that the air force colonel who shadowed him as custodian of the footballthe black vinyl briefcase containing the nuclear war codes should it come to that must not be in service uniform but rather in civvies and should not get out of the limousine until the press were well out of the way they had been in the lodge for only two minutes when the phone rang cno admiral horton informing the president that following the chemical weaponsashell exchange in korea two longrange eas earlywarning radar dome aircraft had already been dispatched one from the naval air station at patuxent maryland the other out of reykjavik iceland the planes were trying to make contact with two hunterkiller sea wolfs neither sub had clocked in to saclant either at northwood england or norfolk in the united states and were presumed either sunk or in deep hiding lying in wait for soviet subs in the deeps between the spurs in the undersea mountains running off from the global spine of the atlantic ridge the plane out of patuxent maryland was concentrating on the huk vermonts last reported position the ea out of iceland was trailing its fivemilelong vlf wire antenna attempting to contact the roosevelt which following the sabotaging of the wisconsin sub signal farm could not be reached and it was thought might be hiding somewhere near or in the spitzbergen trench approaching the cyclonefenced compound of romeo a one of the underground launch control silos in wyoming melissa lange had two shifts to go before she would take a weeks holiday and she was keen to complete the next twentyfourhourshift as efficiently as possible looking smart in her striking blue uniform with red cravat she scanned the slip of paper containing the days entry code placed it in the burn slot where it became instant gray ash then she entered the carpeted elevator descending sixty feet after punching in the code she waited for the eightton blast door to open inside she saw that her crew partner shirley cochrane was already readying herself for the shift pushing her long brunette hair up into a tight rather severe bun so that it wouldnt get in the way of any of the silos console switches melissa stepped out of the way of the two crew members who were coming off shift everything was cordial as usual cantankerous types werent suited for ground zero bullseye or the first goodbye as the silos were unofficially referred to you had to be able to get on with people of course there was always the danger of someone becoming distressed because of personal pressures such as that melissa was undergoing rethinking rick stacys marriage proposal after hed found her and killerton having it off in the bungalow stacy had forgiven her which made melissa madder than if hed gone berserk it was supposed to be nobler on his part she guessed showing how controlled how civilized he was the kind of cool that had got his promotion to sac headquarters down in omaha but his lack of anger angered her and made her feel even guiltier for the sudden uncontrollable passion shed given way to as killerton had wordlessly stridden over from where hed been fixing the leak switched off the tv and quite literally lifted her off her feet holding her hard up against the bungalow wall she trying to fight him off until the moment she felt him penetrating her and she yielded telling herself it was rape that she had no option yet only seconds later she gasped with sheer pleasure urging him on for several moments at a time hed pause fondling her breasts suckling them with a tenderness so at odds with the brutal fullness of his entry despite the guilt that at times would sweep over her in drowning waves melissa was confident she could keep the lid on any personal pressures during the twentyfourhour shift if you didnt youd be on report and if you ever did freak out your partners side arm would take care of it as romeo as other shift handed over the two keys melissa tried to put rick out of her mind the green strategic alert light was already on and her concentration would have to be total when she and her partner went through all the checks and double safety procedures for every minute of the twentyfourhour shift there was the everpresent probability that one of the sixteen million possible warorder codes might well require them to launch romeos cluster of ten icbms each of the ten missiles carried a threewarhead load of multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles or mirvs and each of the thirty warheads carried kilotons this meant that each of the thirty missiles from the romeo silo cluster alone carried over twentytwo times the explosive power of the atomic bomb dropped on hiroshima during a newsbreak on abc a reporter revealed that the military officer usually carrying the football had been in civilian clothes fueling speculation that the change from military uniform to civvies signaled not a lessening of the world war tension but rather an attempt by the president to downplay an escalating crisis in response press secretary trainor stated there was no special significance in this that as you know the president doesnt stand on ceremony no one believed him over seven hundred miles southwest of romeo complex rick stacy in omaha nebraska was en route to his monitor station walking through the unimposing front office of sac hq pausing to brush the snow off his furlined blue parka before passing the bust of general curtis lemay stacy waited as two bereted guards checked his id and only then escorted him down through the no lone zone deep underground to the bank of tv monitors and consoles below sacs command balcony here gen walter g carlisle sat in a dark stained leather chair by the yellow phone with which he could order a massive sac b bomber attack each aircraft carrying twentyfour alcms each of the air launch cruise missiles dropping from the bs hard points armed with a twohundredkiloton warhead sacs readiness however had been put in some doubt because of the bases vulnerability to electromagnetic pulse in the event of a nuclear air burst above them for this reason alone the old prestige of sac being the foremost defense arm of the united states had long since passed to the submarine fleet it wasnt only sac hq that would suffer an air burst wipeout of all the electronics including much of the vaunted sheathed circuits for hundreds of miles around soviet air bursts could also sever the vital connection to norad control deep in colorados cheyenne mountain stacy and all other operators on duty in sac had heard of the nerve gasatomic shell exchanges in korea and were especially alert their readiness was not evidenced in any kind of frenetic activity but ironically in a lowerkeyed gentler and wellmannered approach it was as if these electronic warriors as general carlisle had called them were very conscious of being alive at a historic moment in the nations history as they studiously watched and monitored the six big screens in the soft blue light stacy liked the whole ambience of the place particularly the smell of command center apart from its generally calming atmosphere it always had the pleasant odor of the old movie theaters he remembered as a kid a polished leather upholstery smell normally staffed by eleven men situated beneath the balcony sac now had fifteen working the consoles as stacy took his position message lights began streaming in on the blue screen beneath the big clocks marked omaha zulu washington and moscow the message informed them that communications were temporarily down in the aleutians general carlisle did not issue any orders but waited calmly for the explanation was it atmospheric in nature or some kind of enemy jamming within five seconds the reason given was ionospheric anomalies carlisle asked one of the operators for the computed position of looking glass the sac battle command plane it was reported to be at twentythree thousand feet above utah carlisle ordered it higher twentysix thousand feet to hopefully get it out of the atmospheric interference stacy was thinking about melissa he hoped they could work it out he took a strange comfort knowing that if they couldnt resolve their problems and she refused to marry him he would in any case stay on in sacs hq the prime target of the soviets in any nuclear war more important even than washington or new york because it was a nerve center of americas retaliatory capability if he died shed be sorry he knew it was childish but nevertheless it made him feel heroic more lights signaled a new incoming message in romeo a melissa and shirley checking procedures were interrupted by incoming letterforletter code in groups of five both of them buckled up in their highbacked redupholstered chairs and slid forward on the glide rails hands on keys ordered melissa key them on my mark three two one mark both she and shirley cochrane watched the long white second hand sweep around to hours light on confirmed shirley light off another ten seconds passed hands on keys instructed melissa hands on keys came cochranes confirmation initiate on my mark said melissa five four three two one now ill watch the clock ive got the light said shirley light on light off release key ordered melissa key released now they waited their onecrew keyturn having initiated only one vote in the launch process they needed another which would take the litany further melissa prayed it was another drill waiting for the ilc inhibit launch command to be activated instead of the wordnumeralword sequence that would give them a valid message taking them closer to the first goodbye chapter fiftyfour you still have a contact sonar asked robert brentwood no sir hes still hiding in the ice scatter or hes gone away very well angle on the bow sixteen degrees sir answered zeldman very well contact fuse torpedo in tube one ready contact fuse torpedo in tube one ready sir angle on the bow sixteen degrees sir very well it would mean that with the sub at two hundred feet below the ice roof the contactfused mark torpedo leaving it at fiftyfour miles per hour should hit the ice roof several hundred yards away at plus or minus six seconds fire contact fish contact fish away there was only a slight tremor through the sub in five seconds emerson and link turned down the volume having no intention of being deafened for life the explosion was loud enough the sub trembling while the preparation for the missile firing sequence continued torpedo room you all ready to go yes sir sonar i want you to send out active radar bursts to the surface ahead of the ship the ping of the active mode and the hollow almost singsong sound of the return echo could be heard by all in control and emerson and link could see the fragged or fragmented echoes the middle of the arcs missing or segmented as the echo returned it told the sonar operators that the sound from the active pulse was not returning in the middle of the band telling them an enormous hole hundreds of yards across had been blown in the ice the segmentation of the return echoes indicating that some surface ice was floating back into the hole blown out by the torpedo the roosevelts missile tubes were now open water rushing in through the narrow spaces between each of the six pound d missiles and the elastomeric shock absorber liners that would help stabilize trajectory sonar to control came emersons voice contact bearing twosevenniner distance fifteen thousand yards speed thirty knots it was approximately nineteen miles away twelve minutes con to sonar said brentwood i hear you next he called missile fire control weapons officer here sir i want warheads deactivated i say again deactivate warheadarming circuit enough gassteam to clear interface he heard the confirmation from the weapons officer if there was alarm in zeldmans or anyone elses mind they did not show it everyone was too busy sonar sir contact confirmed hostile by nature of sound i say again hostile robert brentwood didnt hesitate he ordered firing point procedures convinced that it was more than likely that the hostile whether it previously intended to or not would now certainly fire its torpedoes within range interpreting the sound of roosevelts icebreaking torpedo as an attack upon it if and when the hostile did this brentwood determined he would fire four of his mark wireguided homing torpedoes at the hostile hoping to triangulate him so that no matter which way he turned roosevelt would get him unless he got roosevelt first chapter fiftyfive in the three sas transports high above the cloud cover the red get ready light came on stand up ordered the jump masters secure oxygen masks adjust ir even without the infrared goggles the troops could see flashes of light not from the storm which they were now well clear of but from the manmade storm of antiaircraft missile and gunfire opening up on the lowerlevel diversionary f fighter bomber attack that was under way on the likhachev works and the factories beyond over moscow itself a rain of allied propaganda leaflets drifted down with the flakes of snow the people rushing out of their homes occasionally risking the wrath of the upolnomochenny vozdushnoy okhrany air raid blackout wardensin order to collect the propaganda leaflets these were prized by the civilian population whose shortage of toilet paper was the most acute in years so much so that children fought over the leaflets not only for their families but in order to sell the lettersized leaflets for several kopecks many customers preferring the smooth albeit printcovered surface of the leaflets to the coarse nazhdachnaya bumagasandpaperof the severely rationed sovietissue toilet paper in the cockpit of the lead transport carrying laylors troop a the navigator was watching the flicking green bar lines of his computer square moving closer together over the approaching drop zone he pushed the magnifier button and the lines spread out again to the periphery of the screen the square looked much larger now but was in fact covering the smaller area of the drop zone and taking into account wind speed and direction temperature and humidity in order to allow the troops the best possible chance of landing not simply in the drop zone of the kremlins sixtythree acres but within the bullseye of the thirtyacre triangle that formed the northernmost corner on the lefthand side of the infrared screen the copilot could see the long brutish outline of the arsenal across from the com the council of ministers on the eastern righthand side of the screen the partially treed and opened section in between them the designated drop zone to the south lay the spires of assumption cathedral the kremlin palace and the moscow river a quarter mile farther south in the cockpit the navigator saw the infrared square screen closing on the rough triangular shape now he said the pilot acknowledged and behind the flight deck the red light went to green and the eighty sas troopers fell black starfish into the night for all their practice the blast of freezing air always came as a shock the cold hitting their faces with the force of a blow screaming about their oxygen masks infrared goggles and huge backpacks like a wild banshee each man seeing the others in his troop clearly as white shapes moving against the gray smear of cloud cover ten thousand feet below as clearly as they spotted the pingpongballsized blots of whitish light to the southeast as reddishorange bomb blasts ran in strings of explosions their sound unheard until several seconds later the odds were only one in over four million but a trooper in david brentwoods stick of twenty struck in the chest by either a stray machine gun bullet or shrapnel from the air battle miles away went limp going into a tumble through brentwoods infrared goggles the blood sucked out of the dead trooper looked like the spiraling vortex of a tornado then the wounded mans weapon load probably the ninemillimeter shorts began popping off david knew the sound wouldnt be heard as they were still too high but if the mans automatic altimeterrelease chute controls were damaged the chute wouldnt snap open at four thousand feet and the man would hit the ground before any of the remaining fiftynine troopers david humped his back and went into a righthand downward slide to catch up with him it was a move sky divers used to form handholding circles but not under the weight of a pluspound pack and with the hard buffeting of the arcticborn air further increased by the corrugatedroad like concussions of air caused by the multiple ackack explosions away to the southeast david saw a white blur through his infrared goggles another trooper moving in from the other side toward the tumbling man the white infrared blur was broken by a black patch that david recognized was the bump of the mans colder backpack now at fifteen thousand both men closing in on him the wounded mans body kept plummeting uncontrolled when in a move that david right there and then knew was one of the neatest hed ever seen the other trooper closed against the tumbling mans body and they became one the next moment david brentwood was below them having overshot the trooper releasing the wounded mans emergency chute still clinging to him david brentwood was swearing the mumbled words resounding back at him inside his oxygen mask the drill wasnt for the trooper to pull the mans chute but to stay with him until the fourthousandfoot level for while there was lots of cloud cover one chute opening before they all got to four thousand could be a sixtysecond giveaway if the big chute was accidentally caught in one of the periodic searchlight sweeps from the city the beams crisscrossing bunching and crisscrossing again like enormous bunches of white celery off to the southeast thank god thought david they would have good cloud cover to six thousand below which the last weather report said it would be clear but now falling at over feet a second a glance at his wrist altimeter telling him he was at twelve thousand with just under eight thousand fiftynine seconds to go before all chutes would be pulled david saw the wouldbe rescuer desperately trying to cut himself out of the tangle but now falling out of starfish pattern and tumbling himself dangling by one foot from a maze of twisted nylon two seconds later david saw the wounded mans chute thin to a roman candle and lost sight of both of them suddenly frighteningly everything was black he had a sensation of hurtling into the stark vortex of some gigantic wind tunnel his face mask hissing under the onslaught of granular snow stinging his face and drumming off the ir goggles like hail on a metal roof looking down for the blobs of infrared heat emission they said he should see coming up from the drop zone particularly from the two domes on the council of ministers building the smaller one on the western side the larger on the eastern he saw nothing then suddenly bursting out of the snow cloud he could see the two blurred orbs and other traces of heat emission from the roofs of the kremlin complex though from the fuzz veiling the infrared he could tell it was still snowing on one hand it would make spoton landing difficult even given the relatively large area between the buildings on the other hand the snowfall would soften the impact the real key however was whether the spets guards would have any forewarning he glanced at the altimeter needle saw it was fortytwo hundred feet a gust of wind pushing him hard left quickly he corrected going into a righthand drop and before he was ready for it he heard the whiplike crack of the chute opening above him the sudden deceleration so that now his descent seemed to be taking forever and he felt that the whole of moscow must be able to see them all about him the white blurs of starfish flipping changing into men there was another crack then another a trooper so close to him that he had thought for a second it was the crack of rifle fire he had no idea who the two men were who had gone down in the tumble all he could hope was that the trooper whod gone to help had freed himself from the chute foulup and that the other had plummeted to earth either in the trees southward in the taynitsky garden or into the river itself well away from the drop zone in fact both men had come down in red square just to the north of st basils not far from the redstartopped spasskaya or saviors gate one of the two gate guards hearing a snowsoft thud moved forward but unable to see very far in the falling snow and forbidden to leave his post he rang for two other guards in the warming room beneath the gates barbican to go and investigate suspecting it might be a piece of equipment from the snowplow now working the square the plows halfslit yellow headlights were barely visible in the blackout as it worked to keep the square as clear as possible for the members of the politburo and stavka for when they left the emergency meeting now under way in premier suzlovs office the plow also had to keep the square clear for the twenty or so t tanks parked in the lot behind the corner arsenal tower should they ever be needed quickly in the square loose unpacked snow particularly annoying to the machine gunners who unlike the main gunner did not have laser sights a minute later one of the investigating guards pulled out his walkietalkie parashyutistyparatroopshe yelled parashyutisty protivnikaenemy paratroops the guards at the spasskaya gate alerted the kgb guards officer and the commander of the arsenal spets troops thirty seconds later men were pouring out of their barracks within the arsenal quickly donning winter battle smocks snatching arms from the racks the general alarm whooping at all gates all entrances and exits to the fortress closing sas already landing in the area between the arsenal on the western side and the com a half dozen or so running forward from the old tsar apartments five hundred yards south the snow roiling in beams of searchlights that began crisscrossing the sixtythree acres like enormous headlight beams sharply defined in the frozen snowthick air david brentwoods mac was already spitting flame as he with six other troopers who he could see were also firing came down in the large open area between the council of ministers on his right and the church of the twelve apostles to the south suddenly his face was smacked violently to the left there was a ripping tearing sound on his mask a flurry of some enormous bird its talons into his neck as he hit the ground before he had time to realize it had been one of the kremlins goshawks he heard a tinkle of broken glass somewhere behind him a searchlight died next there was a stuttering burst of ak fire and david saw two of his troop snow flicking up about dead but not before the sas troopers from a troop landing on the broad flat section of roof on the palace of congress had killed four spets as the russians emerged from the southern end of the arsenal trying to make it to the trees in front of the com another spets was shot mistaken by a plainclothes kgb for one of the attacking allied force but if the spets had moved fast and were in action within seconds as became their elite status then so had the sas all expertly trained in olympian condition and superbly practiced in what to do and above all how to adapt with ingenuity as well as rapidity when confronted by a plan that david brentwood recognized was off to a bad start the spets had begun engaging them albeit in poor visibility before a good many of the sas were even out of harness but against losing the edge of complete surprise brentwood knew his mens adrenaline was up and racing in a way that that of men however good just hauled out of bed could not be zdesover herecalled aussie in one of the russian phrases zdes he repeated to three spets making heavy going of it near a wind drift of snow as they cleared the end of the park between the arsenal and the com aussie pumping his forearm in the russian infantry signal for hurry up hesitating for only a second they turned toward him when they were seven yards from the australian a flare changed night into day but it was too late in two quick bursts lewis felled them crouching low running for the com door and calling out to three members of laylors a group and choir williams like himself from b group to cover him lewis quickly pushed three balls of playdoh plastique from his left pouch against the lock of the big door the tenseconddelay detonatorfiring unit inserted like a small matchbox in putty the searchlights were nearly all out now easy targets for sas men especially those on the palace of congress roof clear called aussie choir williams and the three men from laylors group moved quickly to the protection of alcoves on either side of the door now there was a veritable rain of parachute flares fired by the russians brilliantly illuminating the yellow sides of the com building the trees fifty yards or so in front of them and beyond the roof of the arsenal where a parachute had wrapped itself around a chimney the sas trooper crouched behind the chimney raking the trees below the dull thump of the plastique was followed by a tremendous crash as one of the doors buckled its falling weight ripping out its hinges as it slid down the marble stairs into the snow black acridsmelling smoke pouring out of the building rising quickly billowing into the snowy air like some abandoned locomotive the echoing sound of ak fire erupting from inside the building another two sas men using the explosion as cover were sprinting through the kneedeep powder now one of them david brentwood who without so much as breaking his stride went through the snowcurtained smoke returning fire shooting down the two guards not spets he noticed who had been blasting away at the door with more panic than accuracy probably kgb auxiliaries aussie had started to move into the building with brentwood but seeing a rush of six or seven spets and these were not auxiliaries dashing from the trees he had stayed to provide covering fire for three men from laylors troop who were setting up the light machine gun which quickly cut down two of the spets three more hitting the ground behind them another two still charging full bore when aussie brought one of them down in the final burst of his magazine choir williams felled the remaining spets or at least the one still advancing as aussie kneeling by the fallen door quickly slipped another magazine into the macs handle housing hey it was brentwood signaling him and choir no time to play in the snow aussie lets go cheeky bastard mumbled aussie covering brentwoods left flank choir williams on the right the three of them now in the foyer the echoing bootsteps behind them those of thelman and schwarzenegger wordlessly with no time to be relieved at having found only two men and these obviously not spets in the foyer the five sas men brentwood leading began heading up the redcarpeted stairway as another half dozen or so sas some of these cheekdawsons c group entered the foyer quickly pairing off with the other three members in each of their sas modules several of them in brentwoods troop down to threeman modules already not counting the two hed lost in the tumble drop there was a firecracker tempo to the increased firing that was now coming from outside among the trees across from the com fire returned by laylors light machinegun crews and other members of cheekdawsons sapper troop the air outside coms ground floor zinging with marble chips knocked off by the smallarms fire most of the sas had now taken off their ir goggles not so much because they were a dead giveaway for any spets who got close enough to see them through the almost zero visibility of the falling snow but rather because while they indubitably conferred an advantage during the landing and had cost twentythree spets their lives before they got more than ten feet beyond the arsenal entrance the peripheral vision of the goggles was a hindrance on the ground and indeed could reflect and so draw fire beneath the intensely bright light of the flares sapper mod called out david here came an answer but therere only two of us lieutenant never mind said david do it within two minutes they had found the coms main switchboard seven seconds later the entire building was in darkness david heard the whine of an elevator stopping abruptly outside spets fire was increasing in a way it was reassuring the ts had not yet entered the complex the russian commandos no doubt confident that three spets companies could easily deal with the sas besides which the tanks whose brutish shapes david had glimpsed before touching down couldnt do much at the moment any cannon fire into the east wing as likely to kill suzlov and his war cabinet as the sas moving quickly but cautiously up the staircase david could smell the surprisingly heavy musty smell of the huge old world building and for some inexplicable reason it gave him a surge of confidence as he aussie thelman schwarzenegger and choir williams moved from the secondfloor level toward the thirdfloor staircase without opposition the ubiquitous fourglobed chandeliers along the hallways lifeless now the main switchboard had been taken out in the same power cutoff that would prevent the war council from using the elevators some chandeliers began to shake their crystals casting crazypatterned shadows in the dim brooding light of the emergency battery packs that had come on at the end of each of the long narrow redcarpeted hallways davids target which he could see clearly in his minds eye was on the third floor of the east wing there another hallway leading from the wings hub would take him to suzlovs office to the meeting where as allied intelligence told them the decision would be made that could lead to a chemicalnuclear holocaust not only for natos forces but for all its noncombatants as well brentwood glimpsed other sas a dozen or so from cheekdawsons c troop totally ignoring brentwoods troopers as they quickly went about their business three men in each sas module hurrying to place their charges on the irish j beams and other supports the fourth member of each module providing covering fire the detonators were set for twenty minutes outside they could hear the chattering of an m millimeter machine gun from one of laylors a troop mobile fire parties who were holding off the spets while brentwoods b troop and cheekdawsons c troop kept moving up the com stairwell david heard a series of steady muffled thumps in the background two of the sass lightweight millimeter esperanza commando mortars which as well as laying down several kilogram smoke rounds in and about the arsenal were also firing kilogram highexplosive bombs with a fiftymeter damage radius it was one slight edge that the sas enjoyed the spets understandably unwilling to lay mortar fire on their bosses in the com approaching the third floor schwarzenegger aussie lewis thelman and choir williams behind him david heard the scream of an sas man hit somewhere behind them but not for one second did david look back suzlovs office was all he cared about number six on the right side of the third floors east wing the mockup in the hereford house as vivid to him as the first time theyd run through it it was a long room four or five times the size of a western executives office with a highly polished light wooden floor dark wood desk and grapered persian carpets to the right of the desk and its neat row of four ivory phones there would be high scalloped and ruffled white curtains behind the desk a communist flag and a fifteenfoothigh beige panel between the window and the far door a door that might connect to the next room and above the door he would see the burnished brass emblem of the soviet union and though it should be out by now a large multifaceted chandelier below which suzlov and his merry band as cheekdawson was wont to call them would now be clustered behind elements of the elite guard on station during politburostavka meetings david heard a bumping like a heavy ball somewhere on the stairs above him grenade he shouted dropping to the stairs firing the mac into the darkness the grenades explosion a crimson flash its shrapnel taking out a window and zinging against the high walls in the light of the grenade he saw two figures above him and fired they both dropped his group having paused for only a split second was virtually untouched by the grenade as it bumped past them exploding on the secondfloor level at the top of the stairs david saw one of the fourbulb chandeliers reflecting light from an emergency battery lantern he gave the lantern a burst and there was no light he knelt to put in another clip suddenly a door flew open along the hallway david flattened thelman shot dead taking the full impact of the spets burst which now stopped snuffed out by aussies return fire schwarzenegger bent down by thelman leave him shouted brentwood keep moving he waved aussie schwarzenegger choir and another man from b group forward from outside came the approaching rotor slap of a hind chopper either bringing in reinforcements or possibly trying for a rooftop evacuation of suzlov and his crew the fire from the spets told brentwood he wouldnt have time to play safe and clean out each room but that theyd have to run a possible gauntlet straight through suzlovs office he was also wondering whether laylors troop had managed to fight off the determined spets attempt to break through the cordon of fire with which laylor had secured the coms northern entrance there was an enormous explosion a shattering of glass and a gust of deserthot air the hind e disintegrating above the com sending down a golden liquid rain of gasoline and huge charred segments of what had been the choppers engines falling down the side of the building laylors m machine guns now in a steady rip their gunners using the light of the burning chopper to better rake the shapes that tried to make it from the old cannons and trees that flanked the arsenal across from the com in what was now kneehigh snow watch for more grenades brentwood cautioned as his party split either side of the corridor that led to suzlovs office about sixty feet away the cacophony of sound was so deafening outside as laylors fire teams kept changing their position and the spets counteroffensive grew that brentwood had to shout to be heard as he prepared them for the rush quite suddenly he realized he hadnt had time to be frightened because of the noise he didnt hear the sound of the opening door second down on the left but the light from the chopper lit up the spets the moment hed opened the door to get his line of fire schwarzeneggers burst literally punched the russian back into the room they heard a high terrified please and saw some kind of cloth being waved from the second office and then hands high above them one woman in uniform the other a civilian in a yellow dress came scuttling out david cursed ordered aussie and williams to frisk and tape them it was thirty seconds lost but for a fraction of a second in that time brentwoods action delineated the fundamental difference between the two elite forces joined in battle it was a microcosm he realized of what they were fighting about about how the trainload of nurses and women like lili and wounded men would be treated by one country as opposed to another god knew the sas were no angels but david knew from bitter experience that a spets team would have simply blown the two women away he glanced at his watch they had been in the com seven minutes theyd have to be out in another fifteen minutes allowing three minutes at least to get well clear of the massive building before c troops charges blew but there was no point in the building coming down until they could confirm that suzlov and friends had been dealt with suzlovs office he reminded the group sixth on the right suddenly the silence of the building was deafening and for a moment all he could hear was the ringing in his ears caused by the fierce battle still raging outside and through one of the shattered west windows he glimpsed small dark figures of sas men four or five of them who had landed on the palace of congress three still pouring down deadly fire into the arsenal one crumpled writhing in the snow to his right david could hear the creaking of tanks in red square beyond the kremlins east wall as more man twenty or so ts positioned their millimeter cannons and machine guns for the maximum enfilade of fire all the way from the historical museum at the top of the square down past st nicholass tower gate to the island that was st basils outside the walls the variegated hues of the churchs onion domes flickering in the light of the spets flares no doubt the entire kremlin was surrounded now by armor the cannons had laserguided fire control but aiming david knew would hardly be a problem for the russian gunners it would all be pointblank if a millimeter hit you as aussie had once told williams in a cheery aside thered be nothing left to identify the hydraulic punch and superheated shell exploding blood and bone in effect cremating you on the spot as schwarzenegger quickly finished frisking and taping the two women the other man from troop b joined him in covering brentwood who was now moving along the right wall of the corridor quickly ducking across into what had been the office of the two secretaries to make sure it was clear before moving farther down the hall as he did so schwarzenegger pushed the two secretaries back inside the office and moved ahead of brentwood taking the lefthand side of the hallway followed by the new man from troop b with choir williams behind williams taking up the rear could hear a squeaky sound like unoiled carts it was the sound of more tanks wheeling into position in the vast square choir realized that refusing to take up aussies bet about how many sas would get out after the mission had probably been one of the better decisions of his life not that hed get to spend what hed saved david glanced back seeing that schwarzenegger the new man from b troop and williams were right behind him fritz he whispered motioning to the new man and williams behind you three go forward aussie and ill take rooms three and four with you covering from halfway down he indicated the two offices on the right which unlike the two on the left still had their doors shut and so were unknown quantities everybody joins for the party at number six got it no grenades until six dont waste time on the doors automatic fire keep em or kill them inside we havent got time for housecleaning aussie and ill zip open six you two as backup ready ja said schwarzenegger he and the new man moving forward williams as tail gun charlie making no attempt on three and four until they had covered schwarzenegger and cos advance along the left side brentwood and aussie waited till schwarzenegger was halfway down away from any direct line of fire from the two closed offices before they opened up with angle fire their ninemillimeters chopping through the partys utilitarian plywood doors that had been used to segment the older huger rooms of the tsar schwarzenegger and williams were already renovating the third office on the left just to make sure but no one was in it coming out as quickly as theyd gone in schwarzenegger the b trooper and williams moved farther down the hallway the explosion was like a whoof of gasoline the hallway engulfed in smoke schwarzeneggers legs hitting the roof falling amid the debris the blood from his severed thighs spurting from them like hoses the smell of his burned flesh mixing with the stringent afterfumes of the astrolite the liquid mine which sprayed onto the ground or in this case on the red hall carpet had been detonated by foot pressure schwarzenegger was still alive barely a grotesque dwarf slithering in his own blood and intestines that were oozing out of him the moment the astrolite a mine of american invention which the sas did not know the russians possessed had exploded the door of the office before number six was flung open three spets so big they completely blocked the hallway stepped out and fired but aussie with the long sas hours of nondistraction training had resisted the natural temptation to immediately look down at his wounded comrades and instead had gone for the target with a full burst its backwash searing the hairs on his hands the burst cutting down the three spets the man who had been immediately behind schwarzenegger miraculously saved from the blast because of schwarzeneggers taking the full impact of the mine was now reeling back already dead from one of the russians shots the bullet having passed clean through him clipping choir williams on the shoulder into the rooms brentwood yelled back to aussie as he fired a long burst to dissuade any more spets from coming out of number six as a blur of two or three of cheekdawsons c troop having come up from the second level now joined lewis and williams in the last office before number six bloody carpet was mined david heard the australian yelling out at more members of troop c who were now reaching them from the second floor and about to run down the hallway stay where you are aussie warned fucking carpets pressuretriggered his mac in his right hand as he backed into the cleanedout office now occupied by the australian choir williams and the other men from troop c david not putting down the mac for a second and still watching the hall reached across with his left hand pulled out his browning pistol from its holster and shot what remained of schwarzenegger through the heart lets go for six shouted aussie one or two of usll negative said brentwood in pyongyang some of freemans troops had found connecting doors between several of the offices in mansudae hall and the nka regulars had used the connecting doors to backtrack through the offices and bushwhack americans in the hallways from behind david decided that given the short time remaining and the further delay any astrolite explosion would cause there was only one way but he had to raise his voice loud enough to be heard over the battery fire alarms that were now screaming all through the hallway their beams boiling with toxic smoke suddenly another fire alarm started screaming above them in the office fish is done said aussie but no one laughed all of them knowing they only had at most five minutes to do the job and get out of com one man visibly in shock shaking violently unable to look at schwarzeneggers remains all right said david we havent got time for musical chairs c troopers plastique on the far wall five of diamonds if we start taking fire through the wall hit the deck got it yes sir right go by this time several more troopers from c group had entered the room fucking traffic jam said aussie grimly tensecond delay david called out to the sappers placing the charges in a threefoot square the fifth lump of plastique in the middle the detonator wires connecting the sappers turned signaling to one of their colleagues who ran forward with another khaki vest load feels like brick the sapper nearest the wall said quietly quickly packing double the amount of plastique into the square blow us into the fucking river said aussie standing next to brentwood ten feet back from the wall their macs at the ready the newly arrived troopers from group c making a line of seven sas ready to charge through to number six the moment the wall blew if it did how many in all asked one of the troopers besides suzlov i mean twentynine said brentwood dont sweat it therell be plenty of targets plus spets added aussie theyre the pricks i want calm down brentwood cautioned him cant help em now aussie the australian said nothing knowing that brentwood meant schwarzenegger thelma and the others with whom theyd shared the indissoluble bonds of the sas all set announced the corporal whod directed setting the charges behind the desk ordered brentwood but there was no need the long desk of dark highly polished hardwood that reflected the flares streaking up from the tank columns outside was over on its side in seconds the sas men down behind it chin straps undone lest the concussion lift their kevlar helmets on safety ordered brentwood a precautionary order against accidental discharge from weapons hit by falling debris aussie you the room blurred the sound like a cracking iceberg an avalanche of plaster falling on them the snap of one mans collarbone distinctly heard followed by the shattering of the long rooms chandelier its fragments lacerating the portraits of lenin the politburo and kgb chief chernko into thousands of pieces go shouted brentwood and within seconds after the blast the line of seven sas moved into the choking fog of dust macs erupting in an enfilade of orangetongued fire none of them knowing whether the wall had in fact been penetrated but taking no chances as they ceased firing their bodies still tense as compressed springs they moved forward over the rubble brentwood had prayed that a hole at least the size of the threefootwide pattern would allow them an attack point in fact almost the entire brick wall had disappeared a great gaping hole appearing in the eerie light afforded by the burning soviet flag behind the desk a pile of rubble looking like the steaming remains of an earthquake then david brentwood saw three shadows a sparkle of light the fire from aks before them it was a brave attempt but the three spets with the loss of one of the c troopers were dissected by the hail of sas bullets then quite suddenly all was deathly quiet except for the low moans of the sas trooper whose broken collarbone made it impossible for him to move two other troopers coming into the room dragging him out after one of them had given him a shot of morphine in order to get him downstairs and out of the building as soon as possible for a reason no one could explain the rooms fire alarm was still screaming though its light had gone out lewis reversed his ingram using the butt to silence it flashlight ordered brentwood two of you by the door whats left of it struth said aussie the bastards theyre gone said one of the troopers looking around disbelievingly at the rubble brentwood blinking hard eyes gritty with dust spotted a shoe by itself over near the desk behind the desk its dark teak split asunder by the explosion he saw a man whose face and eyebrows were plasterwhite dead eyes staring heavenward a neat bullet hole midforehead only a faint trickle of purplish blood made dark by the dust congealed on the lapel of his suit where the blood had dripped from his chin but no more bodies were found in the rubble who is it asked one of the troopers suzlov yes answered david its him weve got three minutes said the sapper corporal his voice devoid of panic but insistent wed better move lieutenant where the fuck to asked another glancing out at all the tanks all right said david redgreen flares aussie out the west window over there and watch the carpet the redgreen sequence would be the signal for the sas troops to don the spets overlays and withdraw as best they might aussie took his popsicle so called because the red and green selfpropelled signal flares were no bigger than two frozen juice sticks as he clipped a new magazine into the grip housing of his mac the flare pack in his left hand and moved toward one of the coms west windows one of the troopers covered him shining the flashlight low its beam a few inches above the carpet so they could see any indication of an astrolite patch a few more men from c troop now passed through the hole that only a minute or so before had been a solid brick wall one of them cheekdawson with a tourniqueted bloody left arm in a strap sling his kevlar helmet split down the left side and a hemorrhaging leg wound come on lieutenant he told brentwood time to go brentwood was bending down making absolutely sure for the record that suzlov was dead feeling for the slightest trace of a carotid pulse hes cold he said lets go echoed another trooper nearby as the australian crossing the carpeted hallway in two steps worthy of a danseur made his way to the west window and fired the flares everybody out of the building ordered david assumption cathedral now in less than a minute even the wounded cheekdawson had reached the ground floor the order to clear out shouted and repeated down the stairwells as they hit the cold dark air the snow now falling more heavily they glimpsed dark humps of bodies in the light of the spets flares some halfburied in the snowdrifts by the trees to their right as they headed south for the short desperate run to the cathedral near where several goshawks lay dead having been caught in the crossfire wheres laylor asked david as the fourteen men all that remained of his and cheekdawsons forty troopers headed for the assumptions golden domes which capped with snow formed a perfect symmetry on his way said one of the troopers as they ran david suddenly called out to cheekdawson suzlov was cold what the devil are you on about stone bloody cold shouted david adopting the englishmans swear word to drive home the message his own voice drowning now beneath the rattle of a machine gun opening up from the top floor of the arsenal two hundred yards behind them red tracer arcing gracefully through the blizzard kicking up snow about them he wasnt killed by us david explained they murdered him cheekdawson stumbled david grabbed the englishmans collar propelling him forward toward the steps of the holy refuge cheekdawson was trying to fit it all together but nothing would fit with his arm hurting so badly near to the point of him blacking out only sheer will kept him going that and brentwood who he thought must be as addled as he himself was from the unbelievable noise and shock of the short fierce battle and now the thundering roar of the com collapsing all he could think of was that all the other russian henchmen general marchenko the kgbs chernko et cetera must have gotten out via some tunnel from the com or possibly through some other secret exit that western intelligence hadnt twigged to chapter fiftysix still too heavy unable to rise the two hundred feet to the surface the uss roosevelt was crawling at a mere four knots provided by her twin slitrecessed props in her aft ballast tank moving toward the area directly beneath the fourhundredyarddiameter hole that her torpedoes had blown in the ice roof at five knots it would take her another nineteen minutes even with the assist of the local current before the broken echoes of her active sonar would tell her she was beneath the icefree hole within another half hour however the heat generated by her torpedos explosion would be completely dissipated and the ice hole would be starting to crust and freeze over again meanwhile the enemy sub adjudged hostile by sound was closing having fired three torpedoes in response to the roosevelts firing of one of its mark torpedoes to break open the ice in response brentwood had launched the four marks toward the hostile and they were now running meanwhile the men in missile firing control remained as perplexed as the rest of the crew by the captains earlier order still in force to man battle stations missile and to begin the missile firing procedure sequence they had received no authorization to launch and no one aboard had received any indication of conditions that would justify brentwood exercising his ial independent authority to launch our fish closing reported sonarman emerson watching the blips of one of the four ms from the roosevelt moving toward one of the blips that had been fired from the hostile wire disengaged advised emerson informing control that the roosevelts torpedo was now in automatic homing mode three thousand yards two thousand to go fifteen hundred one thousand veering veering enemy fish closing in the three blips on the sonar screen two enemy one from rooseveltmerged the luminescent dots becoming one swelling then gone from the screen emerson swung about excitedly to link we got emwe got be quiet it was capt robert brentwood disturbingly calm to those in control his words more like an older mans dismissal of a younger emotional wife its implication behave yourselfstartling to zeldman who was not only waiting anxiously for the three remaining s now about to go off the wire into automatic but who was also envisaging him and brentwood on the opposite sides of a courtmartial over brentwoods order to man battle stations missilethe order continuing the preparatory procedures dangerously close to the point of no return all zeldmans instincts were against interfering but was he he wondered permitting his and brentwoods relationships with rosemary and georgina spence to mislead him holding him back from a higher responsibility to the crew if brentwood could no longer suddenly brentwood while simultaneously monitoring the verification sequences of missile control sonar and the helmsmans report of the subs painfully slow progress to the area directly beneath the hole turned to zeldman you heard the order to disarm yes sir replied zeldman his anxiety increasing with brentwoods apparent clairvoyance problem is sir that you didnt order all missiles disarmed we still have four with seven marvs apiece thats twentyeight warheads each of three hundred kilotons sir the new d tridents we took aboard at holy loch cut in brentwood are a hundred and fourteen thousand pounds each the c tridents were sixtyfive thousand pounds each zeldman couldnt see it nor could anyone else in control so what if you fired a deactivated missile the tube still filled with water besides wasnt brentwood telling him the ds no higher at fortyfour feet than the cs which also rose two feet proud above the fairing of the fortytwofoot pressure hull were almost double the cs weight but then with sonarman emersons voice telling them the second two marks were closing in on the next hostile torpedo coming at them just over seven miles away at a depth of feet zeldman now realized what brentwood had over an hour before though the ds were almost twice as heavy as the cs that they had replaced when the ds were released the volume of water replacing them would be insufficient in weight to make up for their loss it meant that rather than the sub being required to increase its buoyancy by having to pump out more water as it would had it been firing the lighter c missile in the case of the d the volume of water pouring into the tube would weigh less than the missile it replaced this in turn meant the sub would actually become lighter after a d firing and would naturally rise the damaged ballast tanks not needed overhearing the conversation between brentwood and the executive officer sonarman link still didnt get it but emerson did and it wiped away any umbrage emerson had taken from brentwoods curt injunction to be quiet old bing brentwood was clearly a genius there was no doubt in emersons mind that if they survived the war robert brentwood would become vice admiral in no time and probably like jfk would become president enemy torpedo destroyed announced link matteroffactly hostile vessel still closing at the hostiles speed of fortyfive miles per hour it would be in very close range within eleven minutes and by now its active radar would have confirmation that its target the roosevelt was traveling at no more than five knots the hostile hadnt fired any more torpedoes suggesting to brentwood that it was now going to rely on its superior speed to outmaneuver its slow target the hunterkiller would try to stop him reaching the hole unless roosevelt could increase speed and so buy time brentwood unclipped the hand mike torpedo firing control stand by for snapshot two one standing by for snapshot sir very well itll come in a rush added brentwood minimum range one mile understood sir one mile just keep him away from me intoned brentwood you give me the angle sir repeated torpedo control and well get im chief engineer called brentwood sir possible to turn our main prop at all sir its bent to hell and gone itd shake the guts out of her too much torque in half an hour maybe less wed have leaks popping up what can you give me brentwood cut in maximum chief five and a half said the chief resignedly but not liking it maybe six with the help of the current but well wake up every son of a bitch from here to the south pole captain weve already done that chief give it a burl hold on to your dentures the chief advised its gonna shake em loose it was an understatement and as if that werent enough a report came in that not only was the oxygen generator down but no attempts could be made to bleed oxygen from reserve bottles because of damage sustained to their valve heads and regulators also the damage report seaman was shouting above the boneshuddering noise of the main prop oxygen and freon gas scrubbers closing down very well light candles shouted zeldman as brentwood hooked back into missile firing control verification procedures i hope brentwood yelled out to the weapons officer those tube liners can take a bit of vibration no sweat came the weapons officers report his voice loud over the intercom practically blasting the headphones off brentwood starting a throbbing hot needlelike pain in his left ear the prop though bent only a few thousandths of an inch was turning the pressure hull into what felt like an unbalanced spin dryer out of control the torque creating mayhem in the kitchen where hamburgers became airborne coffee shot from pots in marblesized globules the crew hanging on to every hold bar nook and cranny they could find the men in control buckled up while the ood gripped the back of the planesmens chairs but the chief as chiefs were wont to do lived up to his promise and delivered six knots which together with the four knots of the emergency bring it home twin screws in the after ballast tank were pushing roosevelt at ten knots chopping her eta in the area beneath the hole from what was a minute ago twelve minutes to less than six the burning of the perchoate candles mixing with the stench of sweat that was pouring out of the men emerson gave up on sonar echoes the subs din overwhelming its hydrophone sensors after three more minutes brentwood shouted orders to stop all engines in order to take an active sonar pulse emersons screen showed the hunterkiller was now at eleven thousand yards any fish yet brentwood asked emerson no sir brentwood estimated the roosevelt would have to stop in another three minutes if he was to engage any torpedoes the attacking sub might fire leaving him only three minutes to retaliate and hopefully blow the huks torpedoes out of the water he called for full speed ahead and again they were assaulted by a kind of shaking none of them had ever known sir cried emerson alarming everyone who heard him so ingrained were they with the idea of being quiet on the sub that despite the tremendous roaring of the ship itself shouting in control was a noise short violation as alien and upsetting to them as any moral dilemma they could possibly imagine emerson was cupping his hands about his mouth flow robert brentwood leaned down straining to hear emersons words but it was no use suddenly emerson leaned forward tapping swiftly on the computers keys the screen reading hole in ice has shifted now above us brentwood shouted again for stop engines someone shouting in the relative silence thank christ wheres the hostile emerson asked zeldman bearing zero four one sir speed forty knots brentwood gave the helmsman the order to bring about roosevelts bow on the screen they could see the hunterkiller had fired one more fish at sixtynine hundred yards torpedo firing control stand by for snapshot two one ordered brentwood angle on the bow zero seven angle on the bow zero seven shoot when ready final bearing and distance were given and brentwood heard the firing control officer announcing solution ready weapons ready ship ready stand by shoot fire brentwood turned to peter zeldman unravel the vlf i want to be ready to receive the moment we surface the planesmen were so tense the ood told them to take a deep breath that itd be okay they werent comforted this was definitely not by the book brentwood told everyone to hang on cautioning the crew that with the damage already sustained they were unlikely to be able to slow her down much on the rise the mark missile firing control system was all systems go except for tube three whose humidity control had gone haywire during the severe vibration beneath the hum of the missile verification sequence they could hear the steady roll of the vlf drum unwinding the antenna that would trail for over a thousand feet behind them if the hole in the ice was wide enough after the missile verification procedures and sequences were completed brentwood inserted his key to complete the circuit the gassteam generator ignited the small exhaust rocket at the base of number one tube the sudden buildup of steam pressure from the rocket pushed the missile out of the tube the blue protective membrane cap atop the tube shattering concentrically the missile rising above the fairing of the pressure hull the solid propellant of the firststage booster ignited the missiles needlelike aerospike which would extend its range if necessary slid out of the nose the missile now clearing the surface of the icefree hole backflooding beginning immediately the weight of the sub decreasing the sub rising as the first icbm burst clear of water its orange tail flattening momentarily on the seaair interface its feral roar heard in the sub and soon seen on radar screens all over the world including those in sac and on the kola peninsula rising high over the vast ice cap in as straight a trajectory as could be attained then falling back crashing immediately clearly unarmed onto the ice pack and disintegrating this was followed by the second missile lightening the roosevelt further and also viewed on the radar screens of both sides as unarmed like the first it went up and fell in like fashion crashing harmlessly into the ice miles from the roosevelt which was now broaching bursting through the ice hole in the arctic sea the sub was hidden in a frenzy of gossamer white her bow angle at fortyfive degrees water streaming off her into the churning sea made more turbulent by the fierce bubbling of the torpedoes exploding a half mile away breaking the spine of a rubisclass hunterkiller a french nuclear sub that had attacked roosevelt after failing to get either prop or cavitation matchup because of roosevelts damaged prop the french sonar operator running blind with only sound to guide having misidentified the american sea wolf as a russian alfa within five minutes of the roosevelts surfacing her vlf aerial was receiving the message from the ea tacamo aircraft out of reykjavik iceland informing her that limited chemical and nuclear war had broken out in korea and that nuclear engagement might soon occur on the european front with this in mind the president had authorized retaliatory strikes should the russians the message broke off then resumed a few seconds later as murmansk launched three icbms on north american trajectories despite the fact that murmansk hq as they had seen clearly on their radar screens and as the tacamo aircraft had advised them knew that the roosevelts icbms had not gone into intercontinental trajectory had clearly been disarmed and had been tracked to destruction on the ice cap the tacamo aircraft also advised the roosevelt there was reason to suspect the soviet leadership was in disarray which zeldman pointed out meant that no one knew who the hell was in charge of moscow as suddenly as they had picked up the tacamo message it ended the aircraft disappearing from roosevelts sailmounted radar instead what they did pick up were the trajectories of the russian icbms brentwood did not hesitate and ordered two of the remaining missiles the mid pair three and four launched firing control however could not get number three to launch the tubes humidity control having gone haywire during the severe vibrations number four however was fired successfully its launch flame buckling the fairings about the tube hatches increasing the temperature inside the sub by ten degrees in less than four seconds soon the second of its threestage boosters took over the missile streaking into the stratosphere its seven kiloton warheads independently targeted on seven of kola peninsulas major submarine and military bases even given a cep circular error probability of plus or minus two thousand yards the military targets including the superhardened sub pens in murmansk chosen by brentwood in retaliation for the russian launch of the three ss model s were all certain to be destroyed most of the roosevelts crew had been evacuated to the ice through chargeblown exits through the hull their escape was so quick after the long tensionfilled hours behind them that for many it had not yet sunk in yet leaving their submarine despite the fact they had no choice was an emotional affair it was had been their home they had made it so in a thousand little ways that though conforming to regulation permitted them to mark it with their singular and collective humanity and now in the gray darkness of the arctic night rugging up as best they could in their winter issue they wondered if their fate on the ice cap would be any better than if they had gone down with the sub for many submariners the sudden implosion of water was a better death than a lingering approximation of life it was a torpedomans mate who assigned as one of the lookouts while the rest of the crew first those who had been wounded during the alfa attack were taken off first noticed what he thought were ice piles jutting up on the endlessly depressing horizon he was reinforced in this interpretation by the fact that the ice was moving in all about them and locking roosevelt in but after several minutes he realized that what he had thought were four dots moving too low for a radar pickup were heading ominously toward roosevelt shivering in the arctic cold the bridge knuckled with ice the torpedomans mate was struck by the ultimate irony that the most powerful warship ever made now sat as helpless as a beached whale the black dots no longer four but five chapter fiftyseven as the russian icbms sss model s eighteen warheads in all were being tracked on the big blue screens deep in cheyenne mountain the mountain itself one of their targets another being sac hq below omaha president mayne stepped from the presidential helicopter at andrews and boarded kneecap the ton footlong national emergency airborne command post aircraft or doomsday plane piloted by maj frank shirer was capable of staying airborne for seventytwo hours with refueling and with a ceiling of fortyfive thousand feet as the rose above the blue hills of virginia mobile microwave relay and booster stations were being aligned while the phone network into which signals from the planes fivemilelong inch cable could be fed into the silos and other elements of the triad were being repaired from the line of twentyeight sternfaced computer operators in kneecap came the information that the targets of the seventeen missiles almost certainly included cheyenne mountain in colorado omaha nebraska the trident slbm sub bases at bangor washington kings bay and the trident tracking facilities at point magu in california and cape canaveral the remaining eleven kiloton warheads were expected to zero in on the mx silos in the midwest the situation bad as it was became more terrible because of what general carlisle sacs commander who had already launched stealth fighter intercepts to fire spoiler rockets and b bombers with cruise missiles told the president in the last phone call he would ever make that they were faced with the old northsouth problem president mayne and paul trainor sitting before the banks of small tv screens in the presidential command room aboard kneecap knew carlisle wasnt talking about the civil war the old northsouth problem was the fact not generally known among either the public at large or the military that all tests of soviet icbms had for no other reason than the geography of the country been carried out on eastwest axes and not on northsouth axes which in any hostile launch such as the one now on the way would be the axis used in attacking the united states to the man in the street a missile like a bullet presumably operated the same way no matter in what direction it was fired but as the presidents aides explained missiles due to the necessity of accurately predicting trajectories that would leave the earths atmosphere and then reenter it were not only subject to wind and weather in general but were particularly dependent upon the shifts in the earths magnetic field it was the reason why even under the most favorable atmospheric circumstances a missile still had a circular error probability this rather esoteric mathematical consideration translated into a monumental decision for the president because of the fact that unlike the soviet union many us missiles such as the tridents deployed in nuclear sub storage areas such as bangor near seattle were close to if not part of american cities how could the president know given the vicissitudes of missiles circular error probability whether the russians were in fact engaging in counterforceantimilitary or countervalueanticity attacks when so many american bases unlike many in the soviet union were often part of an american city on one level the question seemed purely academic even as the president acknowledged coldblooded but it was nevertheless one he had to entertain for he would not have much time to decide what the russian strategy was and if he made the wrong decision to go countervalue rather than counterforce in any retaliatory strike it could mean an escalation that could result in utter annihilation for both countries industries and most of their people could he confine retaliatory strikes to military targets like those selected by the roosevelts captain when he had fired an slbm in retaliation for the russians multiple icbm launch then kneecap received a flash message that one of the sss had exploded in a nonnuclear detonation during reentry its warheads tumbling down harmlessly before they could explode an intercept asked the president no sir mechanical malfunction pray god the other two will malfunction they didnt intercepts took out three of the remaining twelve warheads of the other two rockets during reentry but that left nine incoming the sac b bombers were disappearing quickly the screens full of swarms of intercept fighters from both sides trainor was shouting mr president goddamn it were down to the wire here if we dont strike back now mayne raised his hand to steady him he felt strangely calm it was now down to a hobbesian simplicity if you use your sword i must use mine and the life of man did indeed appear to be poor nasty brutish and short accordingly he wanted to alert general carlisle to the possibility of allout countervalue cityforcity attack but carlisle was already dead omaha no more the last thing rick stacy saw was the incoming trajectory the computers cold neutrality announcing the incoming missiles cep was plus or minus three miles way off someone in cheyenne mountain said it was but the air burst of the sss kilotons at four thousand feet above omaha produced a multilevel but quickly flattening mushroom cloud its coronas like enormous smokers rings transforming the merely colorful sunset of nebraska into an explosion of astonishing beauty the stunningly vibrant orange core of the mushroom turning the vast undulating snowfields to watermelon pink the circles now rising about the mushrooms stalk vermiliontinted thinning as the red stalk rose through them the circles now fading to purest white like a host heavenbound the overpressure of six pounds per square inch produced winds in excess of miles per hour over an mdz maximum danger zone of fourteen square miles flattening every house in the area pressures on them in excess of tons the supercyclonic winds blowing people out of office towers and buildings not already destroyed by the wind threequarters of the four hundred thousand people of omaha were killed in a hurtling cyclone of debris as it rose higher and higher obscuring the lower rings of the air burst turning the atmosphere a reddish brown much of this shrapnel swirl consisted of thousands of bodies superheated many vaporized the number of outright fatalities estimated by the superhardeneddomed sensors to be percent the remainder fatally injured there were no survivors in a sixteensquaremile area directly below the air bursts center and while beyond the maximum danger zone of fourteen square miles the survival rate climbed from percent to percent at two hundred miles from the zone these survivors were the unlucky ones faces melted all body hair gone and for many no visible injury but all of them particularly given the flatness of the terrain walking receptacles of huge doses of radiation doomed to agonizing deaths caused by radiation sickness and multiple cancers those in sac hq dying through suffocation trapped by the millions of tons of rubble over the venting systems and air intakes the fireballs having raised the temperature so high that emergency oxygengenerating plants either exploded or were too warped to operate the first priority of outside rescuers for whom not nearly enough anticontamination suits were available was to get to the children of the outlying districts for many of these a half hour delay in reaching them meant death as the first tremors of the omaha strike registered on the silo cluster known as romeo miles away in montana melissa lange deep in romeo a

mx icbms with twenty marved warheads each of kilotons per warhead were en route to their military targets in the ussr three targets icbm complexes in kamchatka peninsula were allotted two warheads apiece against superhardened silos the first of the two warheads allotted each of these three targets was set to explode in high air burst in order to prevent fratricidein which one bombs electromagnetic pulse combining with airborne debris could rise as high as sixtytwo thousand feet interfering with the second warheads trajectory every one of the mx warheads unlike those of the soviets had been tested in the united states on a northsouth trajectory in the pacific their circular error of probability reduced to only plus or minus three hundred feet they were ideal for counterforce attacks against military targets chapter fiftyeight in moscow general marchenko already in shock over the news that his sons fulcrum had been shot down over north korea and admiral smernov sat wheyfaced having just scrambled for safety with the rest of the twentysix politburo and stavka members through one of the tunnels once used by rasputin to see the czarina when he was out of favor with the czar the superhardened concrete bunkers below the council of ministers had been ruled out the vips fearing that explosives set by the enemy commando raid in progress would entomb them under rubble inside the lenin library where the secret tunnel exited marchenko found himself sitting close to the admiral he couldnt stand smernovs breath though he had wanted to broach the subject albeit diplomatically several times in his career marchenko had resisted and he did so now for he neither had the courage nor the instincts for political suicide it was a small thing he knew and perhaps with the blood of suzlov still fresh on their hands his preoccupation with the admirals breath was a kind of petty escape an avoidance of the terrible responsibility in which they were now all involved but what other choice had they even before the meeting had begun it was obvious president suzlov had been chafing at the bit to order chemical and nuclear artillery weapons used against the nato front he had been waving reports from beijing of american nuclear aggression and announcing with growing hysteria that he was ready to unleash the entire soviet arsenal against the americans that he wouldnt go down in history as the leader of his nations greatest defeat marchenko and chernko had argued with him but they could see no way out he was set on his course and said he would use his power of veto but above all else it was the sas commando raid still in progress inside the kremlin and not suzlovs ranting that had persuaded chernko the natural leader among the rest that drastic action was called for the sas attack a clear sign that if the enemys conventional forces could reach so far into the soviet union then it was indeed the beginning of the end chernko was a man of unfettered ambition but he was always the realist he knew that they must quickly come to some arrangement what arrangement suzlov had screamed quite deranged by now and having already launched the icbms from the kola peninsula against america reason was beyond him but the ninemillimeter parabellum bullet from chernkos walther p wasnt it settled the matter now even as their spets elite guards were trying to dislodge and annihilate the sas attackers they were under chernkos leadership formulating peace proposals to nato marchenko moved away from the admiral toward chernko who immediately interpreted this as a political move away from the navy and into his camp for the wrong reasons he was correct marchenko who was opposed to suzlov in the final meeting now wanted to disassociate himself despite his military rank from the three chiefs of the armed forces for from the moment he had seen suzlov temyat urncracking upand heard of the icbm launch from kola he knew the soviet union was nearing the abyss only with chernkos power with the kgb at his disposal could they hope to convince the others particularly admiral smernov not to launch from the nuclear fleet and hope to persuade the cocky relatively untouched siberian republic to surrender but the admiral had been stubborn in the council of ministers meeting questioning whether the reports of soviet launches from the kola could not have been merely enemy propaganda to justify an allout attack on the soviet union have we firsthand reports from murmansk hed asked defiantly at that point marchenko had lost patience with smernov are you mad admiral madder than suzlov what do you think reports will tell you is it photographs of the mushroom clouds you want to see or the dust cloud that will obliterate the sun marchenko had remembered the awesome outpouring of the american volcano mount saint helens many years ago its dark cloud darkening entire cities turning midday into midnight and the volcanos explosion was only a fraction of the nuclear arsenals both sides had at their disposal is it the dust of millions of vaporized bodies you wish to see we have no time to lose admiral if we dont contact the americans now they will bury us he paused the trouble is admiral we dont know exactly where most of our warheads will land our propaganda has covered our technological deficiencies for years but you and i all of us here know that the circular error of probability of your submarinelaunched missiles might be as large as twenty miles anywayand here marchenko turned to the kgb chief comrade chernko will attest to the fact that we have reports of shoddy workmanship explosive bolts that dont explode to separate the second and third rocket stages let alone the navigation system our space program is the showpiece of began the admiral defiantly wasour showpiece cut in marchenko and we have hidden how many launch failures in that program even at best including the american challenger disaster and the like we have only matched the americans seventy percent of the time that other thirty percent that inaccuracy admiral said marchenko leaning forward risking smernovs bad breath could mean whole american cities are destroyed instead then what do you think the americans will do he paused and sat back smernovs breath was too much at least when murmansk used the american submarine launch of the deactivated missiles as an excuse to launch they had the sense minimal though it was to go for military targets in the us but if we were to launch from our fleet the more rockets we fire the higher the danger general marchenko said chernko staring at the admiral his tone the most threatening any of the politburo or stavka had ever known is correct the american technological edge will do us in in the end we must tell the american president it is over he looked about at each one of them let us not compound our error comrades how will we let him know asked the minister of transport what about an em pulse if his plane is near one of our targets the presidents airborne command post comrade is sheathed against emp and what if one of our missiles detonates in air burst too close to the plane can you guarantee communication then no said chernko exasperated but we will try comrade chernkos assurance was uttered with such deadly and understated charm that the transport minister fell silent chernko then turned to the admiral we have your word then smernov that your nuclear fleet will not launch yes said the admiral reluctantly beginning to say something else but catching himself deciding against it chernko was still looking at him searchingly go on admiral what is it the admiral mumbled something about suzlov we had to shoot him said chernko brusquely are you not prepared to accept your part in our collective responsibility comrade no no the admiral hastened i mean no im not discussing that comrade director besides history will not know who shot him we will blame the allies dont be an idiot said chernko dismissively the first time marchenko had heard the directors tone move from one of icy calm to undisguised contempt the allies will be writing the history books admiral not us the irony is they will correctly say we killed suzlov but no one will believe them given their commando raid but history will end comrade if you cannot assure us your fleet will not engage the americans goading them into a second strike against us have we your assurance the admiral dabbed the bridge of his nose with his rolledup khaki handkerchief where an ak bullet had scraped the skin when hed tripped in the tunnel and two spets had dragged him to his feet chernko could tell the admiral was hiding something speshi hurry up chernko shouted what have you done admiral iive done nothing the nuclear fleet has been ordered not to launch but well we have several dieselelectric boats weve lost contact with two diesel boats operating off the american west coast chernko saw it at once gospodi u nikh atomnye raketymy god they are carrying nuclear missiles two each said the admiral tactical or nuclear snapped chernko eights said the admiral quietly dabbing at his nose again out of vladivostok the minister of transport was looking from chernko to the admiral what are eights you fool shouted chernko causing several of the members to start with fright he turned to his comrades eights are submarinelaunched ballistic missiles over seventhousandkilometer range only one warhead each said the admiral as if this were some kind of enormous concession yes bellowed chernko one warhead of seven hundred and fifty kilotons twice as big as the american missile and you have four of them what are their targets it was insurance the admiral retorted far from being cowed by chernkos outburst his tone changed from apology to defiance insurance against the americans hitting our cities you chernko began pausing fighting for selfcontrol you have targeted them on american cities not military targets four cities the admiral didnt answer which cities admiral pressed chernko the admiral rolled up his khaki handkerchief even more tightly the bridge of his nose was still bleeding san diego seattlehe stopped as if he couldnt quite remember the rest everyone was waiting he shrugged washington in the room there was utter silence and they could all clearly hear the crackle of smallarms fire from inside the kremlin the faint ticking of the librarys pendulum clock sounded to marchenko like a time bomb thats only three cities admiral chernko said waiting new york said the admiral new york repeated another politburo member the minister of supply gospodimy god he turned to chernko can it reach that far chernko swung on him in displaced fury of course it can you idiot and further over a seventhousandkilometer range you think he would have targeted new york if he couldnt reach it chernkos rage was now directed at the admiral we cannot contact the two subs at all no sir we can only hope the americans find them said chernko if washington and new york are hit we will suffer do you know where they are now the admiral shook his head they are on silent running especially now no further communication is acknowledged once nuclear war is in progress he looked about at the others you must understand the targets were only chosen in consultation with president suzlov can we do nothing pressed the minister of transport nothing at all molispraymuttered someone molis said chernko yes that the americans find them and sink them the admirals professional pride was ruffled the commanders are well trained comrade chernko seized on one last chance what are their instructions upon detecting nuclear war has broken out will they not surface and try to contact us to confirm whether oh no said the admiral thats the whole point you see that is strictly forbidden an enemy could be feeding false messages over any number of bands thats why i said no further communication would be chernkos voice was calm again we should have shot you along with suzlov admiral what are we going to do about the commandos the minister of supply wanted to know we have them bottled up but if we have to go in and root them out one by one it will mean we will have to use tanks itll destroy the cathedral perhaps the whole kremlin lenins mausoleum you want us to worry about a few artifacts when we are on the brink of annihilation retorted the minister of transport angrily for all i care send in the tanks if necessary we wipe them out or they surrender its as simple as that unless he paused unless the two diesel submarines are destroyed pulling us back from the brink then we could use those commandos a good bargaining card the americans are especially vulnerable in such things they worry about losing a few of their own but what interjected chernko if the two diesels arent found their cities are hit and then ours then weve had it comrades completely saving the kremlin wont mean anything but what do you propose meanwhile pressed the minister of transport let these sas gangsters run rampant chernko shrugged of course not move in the tanks what asked another politburo member will the casualties be like for the americans if the four missiles are fired from the two diesel submarines millions answered a stavka member killed outright more millions will the from the radiation dust over a thousand rems for everyone comrade no favorites more not in the immediate area will the from the invisible radiation i dont mean that in the dust cloud but in the food chain water table bone marrow death especially everyone in the whole country comrade will become more susceptible to disease their immune systems destroyed you see the comrade could not see he could not imagine such disaster coming back tenfold upon the soviet union but he knew it was true chapter fiftynine if ever there was to be a churchillian moment in ray brentwoods life it came the moment he so recently of ixe sludge removal propelled was appointed overall commander of the task force set out to find the two dieselelectrics his oil samples had determined must be close in to the american coast and with his command came even more power once the soviets had contacted kneecap giving the americans the information that the two dieselelectric golfclass submarines though they did not know where they were on the western american seaboard were carrying four ssns each of the four warheads carrying kilotons issuing orders so quickly that at times runners with their cellular phones or at least those with phones that were still functioning literally bumped into one another brentwood quickly assembled his antisubmarine warfare force of frigates destroyers mad magnetic anomaly detector aircraft and sonardunking choppers he knew it was not only the most important race in his life a race against time at the end of which lay either glory or utter defeat but the most important race in american history if the four american cities were hit in addition to those already struck but explained away like omaha as legitimate targets by the soviets the public pressure on the president to unleash countervalue strikes against all major soviet cities would be enormous and indeed militarily would be the only thing the united states could do unless it was to be annihilated but for military targets such as the trident bases at bangor washington state and kings bay georgia sac hq in omaha and norad control in colorado springs near cheyenne mountain it was already over the mushrooms from the impacts depressingly the same only over bangor washington and at kings bay in georgia had the mushroom clouds looked different their shape essentially the same but on a bright clear winter day the mushroom stalks above bangor and kings bay were infused with millions of gallons of superheated water evaporated by the tenmilliondegreefahrenheit heat at the center of the fireball the wide vshaped bottom of the stalk before it rose and grew thin had become blindingly white the sun catching the vibrant iridescence of the countless billions of sea creatures that were sucked up in the whirlwinds of the explosions core the radioactive cloud sweeping out to sea the sick and dying overflowed out on the lawns beneath makeshift tents as rain caused by the hot air of the explosion meeting the cold mountain air of the rockies and the cascades poured down washing much of the radioactivity into the water table faster than it normally would have been absorbed and as in the case of those who had tried to get to the children first in omaha wouldbe rescuers were thwarted by an almost complete lack of antiradiation anticontamination suits the hospital budgets having been slashed in the halcyon days of gorbachev high above the midwestern states the most dreadful thing that those aboard the ads antiradioactivesheathed kneecap experienced was that here they were safe at least for the moment high above the earth supposedly in command of the situation while all the distant mushroom clouds told them how helpless they were to do anything for those people who were dying by the thousands the unlucky ones who had not died outright twenty miles off southern californias coast ray brentwood stood in the stiff breeze that had come up since they had left san diego aboard his command ship the uss john t munro an oliver hazard perryclass frigate a sister ship to his first the uss blaine on officers call he instructed his department heads that they were to keep the mission short and simple when describing it to the men our job is to search for and destroy a force of two soviet golfclass v dieselelectric subs which are carrying two icbms apiece the golfs surface speed is seventeen knots and on battery power gentlemen theyre very quiet i repeat very quiet we suspect they have anechoic soundproofing tiles on their hulls and enough battery power to run for seventytwo hours without recharge which is the reason why theyve been able to sneak past our sosus network torpedoes sir asked the officer in charge of the two mark tripletube torpedo launchers on the john t munro ten twentyoneinch diameter six forward four aft radar sir snoop tray and sonars medium frequency now my guess is that given theyre out of contact with their headquarters and their orders are to remain so that is to launch on their own initiative and given the fact that there is no way they cannot know a nuclear exchange has been under way i suspect that for the sake of coordinated action they are likely to stick together in preparation for a short simultaneous attack because they know that if they send those four sons of bitches off together were going to have twice as much trouble stopping them its a pretty good bet that they wont go it alone he paused weve got one thing working for us at the moment and that is that the electromagnetic pulse from the strikes theyve already made is going to scramble communications everywhere for a while you mean theyre going to wait a day or so until they can be sure of proper trajectories thats what im hoping said brentwood but we cant rely on it well have to try to pin em down faster than that how we going to do that captain thats my job what i want you guys to remember is that were going to have sonar pinging out there magnetic anomaly detectors and all the other asw equipment i dont want anybody getting signals mixed up navigators you make sure where your ship is every second day and night i dont want any incoming noise from one of our own search ships to interfere with our sonar either so the distance between shipsll have to be watched closely should munro be attacked i expect the officer of the deck to bring her broadside immediately thisll present a bigger target to any incoming itll free our radar masts and phalanx defense system of upperdeck obstruction last thing from now on were condition four this meant that more than two hundred of the ships complement of men would be on alert at all times four hours on eight off thats all said brentwood he took the salute and made his way to the john t munros combat information center along with his tactical action officer james cameron one of the young officers aboard uss blaine whom he had requested along with several enlisted men who had served with him on the blaine it was to demonstrate that there was no grudge on his part about what had happened on the blaine because he could not truly say how he had ended up in the water after the blaine had been hit he saw in the john t munro a chance to redeem himself can i speak freely sir lieutenant cameron asked shoot said brentwood none of the men i know thought you jumped ship bosun reckons one of our boys picked you up pulled the tab to inflate the preserver and tossed you over then he got it well cameron for what its worth ive gone over it a million times i dont know what the hell happened all i remember is one minute im on the bridge then bam the lights go out the next minute im floating but thanks for the vote of confidence appreciate it no problem sir ah captain if you think their subs are only going to wait a bit until all this electrical fuzz clears from the upper atmosphere were not going to have much time to find them ive got a few ideas such as well first i think we have at least a day it isnt just my guesswork that theyre sticking together the oil patches proved that so i dont think theyll separate by this time they were in the combat information center looking over the charts of the western seaboard ray brentwood using the dividers to measure how far the munro was from the site of the oil spills fair assumption is theyre doing no more than ten knots submerged they wont try to run at full speed too much noise twentyfour hours steaming would give em a twohundredandfortymile radius thats one big area captain yeah well its a damn sight smaller than the whole pacific cameron yes sir besides well have our helos out and our longrange magnetic detector aircraft besides dont forget theyre leaking oil typical soviet construction but wont they have fixed that captain well if they could have they would have wouldnt they i want somebody on that satellite photo reconnaissance console all the time we spot an oil patch like that again were in business yes sir it wasnt until he was by himself poring over the chart trying to think like a submariner that ray brentwood realized that during the debriefing no one had taken any notice of his face theyd all been too busy taking notes to brief their respective departments soon he knew every sailor in the battle group would understand it would be the most important battle of the war if they couldnt stop the russians prevent the american cities from being hit then it would be allout nuclear holocaust no distinction made between city and military targets both countries razed and the living envying the dead chapter sixty for david brentwoods sas men in the darkness of the kremlins assumption cathedral the air thick with the stench of cordite and smoke it seemed the war was over the spets were closing in and some of the sas had seen one of their own from cheekdawsons troop c lying alone about sixty yards beyond the cathedral wounded and out of ammunition he had put up his hands ne stretyaytedont shoothed said the advancing spets beckoned him forward waited until he was halfway between the council of ministers building and the line of old napoleonic cannons in front of the arsenal and shot him down in at least four bursts i thought said the williams they called a to differentiate him from choir williams we were supposed to bloody abseil out hook onto the wall and over we go in all the confusion thats still the idea said david his voice rising above the tearing sound of the sas machine gun opening up from the partly opened cathedral doors put on your spets overlays he ordered sir came one of the troopers voices through the darkness of the cathedral sounds like theyre bringing the tanks up is nothing sacred quipped aussie zipping up his spets overlay bastards are gonna shoot up a flamin church dunno what the worlds comin to david honest to christ i dont itll fall in on top of you answered david if you dont get a move on they heard a scraping noise then a rattle like stones on the roof an sas man whod taken up sniper position by one of the golden domes had been spotlighted by one of the tanks that were now coming toward the church of the twelve apostles just north of the cathedral after having led its column from red square through the saviors gate antitank called brentwood over here sir it was choir williams he of rousing hymns and football songs sung against the english barbarians he was already in his overlay and quickly grabbed the two disposable french arpac antitank missile launchers the launchers so small forty centimeters long with a bore less than three inches wide and weighing just over three pounds with a range of one hundred yards that the joke among the sas troopers during training was that if you werent careful youd lose them in your pocket all right choir said david out the side door and choir yes sir after come straight back were not going out the way we came in yes sir watching the night illuminated every few seconds by flares and the flashes of exploding grenades choir having waited for two seconds of darkness slipped out of the assumption cathedral and within moments was flat against the southern wall of the patriarchal palace easing his way down toward the black hulks of tanks that had come in by the saviors gate on the kremlins east side heading toward the sas at the bottom of the triangle inside the cathedral cheekdawson was groaning slumped against one of the ornately frescoed columns nearby cradling his arm the morphine wearing off david glanced down at him and for a moment aussie thought brentwood was going to try to take cheekdawson out with them but he knew brentwood knew there was no way they could lug out badly wounded it would hold up any attempt to scale the kremlin walls not a formidable exercise at all with the sas training but a suicide mission if you were trying to get over with an injured party best thing we can do said david is to give him another shot of morphine before we leave maybe theyll take him prisoner yeah answered aussie david looked around in the darkness of the huge cathedral its columns and priceless gold icons momentarily lit by a distant flare he called out to the men but his words were immediately drowned by the rattle of spets machinegun fire its tracer arcing into the marble columns and smashing into the priceless wall of ancient icons that separated the nave from the sanctuary it was coming from the first tank now fifty yards away there was another long burst of heavy machinegun tracer smacking and ricocheting in a high buzzing sound about the cathedral for a moment brentwood glanced at the dim outline of the saints the columns reminding him of the marble pillars of mansudae hall and the great statues of the hero workers of north korea all of which now seemed so long ago not for a minute had freeman let them think they were beaten and david could only wish that the general were here now listen he called his voice echoing in the cathedral weve got a chance once we get over the wall well be in spets overlay and its still a few hours till dawn so well be in curfew no civilians to give you trouble so just go through the streets as if you own them as if youre spets looking for us got it once you reach there was a clatter that reverberated through the cathedral an sas man catching a full burst the force of the hits slithering him about on the floor all right everyone go now aussie leads david turned to the australian remember out and down through the hall of facets annunciation cathedral and into taynitsky park lots of tree cover in there they wont know whether its their own or sas even if they see you then use the old hook and one two youre over the wall and were out ill follow on with choir rear guard got it got it and aussie yes sir no gold souvenirs on the way wouldnt think of it not half too bloody heavy anyway see you at the helos right with that in their spets overlays the remaining sixteen sas men all that was left of the three troops were gone moving quickly silently behind aussie toward the hall of facets choir invisible by the wall of the patriarchal palace moved up closer in the darkness then used the side of the church of the twelve apostles for cover he could hear the lead tank about a hundred yards away to the left of the great bell tower choir lifted the arpac its barrel so short that aiming it made him feel as if he were playing with a toy the tip of the shaped charge warhead with its pointdetonating fuse was barely visible as he leaned against the ancient stone of the church of the apostles waiting for the next glimmer of flare light to illuminate the tanks their creaky unoiled sound coming closer but there were no flares there was no light but choir his eyes growing more accustomed to the snowcurtained darkness outside the cathedral began to make out the hump of the first t then its machine gun opened up again and he could hear its rounds cracking into and about the cathedrals door to his far right he needed only a second for the tank to fell the peep sight he inhaled held his breath and fired the sliding barrel recoiled and the missiles motor which gave off no flash blasted from the barrel at over seventysix meters a second less than one second later the tank was belching flame the crew screaming the charge having penetrated the cupola flame from the tank lighting up the snow so that choir feared that hed be spotted in the short sprint back to the cathedral but then the tanks millimeter shells began exploding and as he ran back through the cathedrals side door the lead t and the two behind it exploded sending whitehot shrapnel whistling into the infantry behind the tanks and the jumble of smoking concrete that had been the council of ministers good work choir yelled david fourth of july out there choir didnt get the reference but he understood it was congratulatory as brentwood smacked him on the back pointing him toward the doorway leading from the assumption cathedral to the hall of facets you coming sir be along in a second said david have to give cheekdawson a shot but began choir well we cant take him with us can we said david no sir go see you at the choppers yes sir david knew that choir knew but the welshman didnt linger and did as he was told chapter sixtyone in the arctic grayness around the icelocked roosevelt the sea harrier though having left east spitzbergen two hundred miles to the north well before the five sea king helicopters was having difficulty finding a suitable spot to land the harriers forwardlooking infrared radar showed such an uneven chaos of jagged ice that even for the versatile verticaltakeoffandlanding fighter putting down on the ice would have been a risky venture so that the pilot couldnt justify risking the multimilliondollar plane in any case his very presence circling the sub riding shotgun for the approaching helicopters was message enough in the radio silence for capt robert brentwood and his crew that they were about to be rescued as the five choppers neared two fore and aft of the roosevelt the fifth helicopter starboard midships all five about fifty feet away from the subs hull they began lowering their rope ladders while zeldman and the five chief petty officers their voices battling the steady roar of the rotor slap began dividing the crew into their various departments and then into groups of twenty for each of the sea kings robert brentwood went back aboard roosevelt to control and set the scuttling charges doublechecking that all code books and deciphering coils were destroyed after he pushed the timer he would have five minutes to clear the sail and get on the last chopper while the chopper pilots fought to keep hover position in the unpredictable gusts and sudden shears that were caused by the wind blowing over the jagged serrations of the ice pressure ridges zeldman and several others struggled to steady a stretcher containing one of the men who was too badly wounded to either climb or be winched up in harness the chopper rising suddenly in a gust shifted only two feet or so but in doing so tore the stretcher from the grasp of the ground party who as they stood helplessly by saw the man would have been lost had it not been for the restraining straps after the chopper steadied enough to allow them to snap on the backup safety ring and began to haul the injured man up zeldman walked down the line his furlined parka stiff with ice particles the rising wind and the sway of the choppers combining to create a windchill factor of minus sixty degrees as he shouted above the noise of the rotors making sure every man understood that if a chopper should suddenly rise in a gust or drop in a wind shear they must stop climbing immediately and hang on until it steadied itself otherwise as the royal air force corporal who had climbed down to assist told zeldman a man who continued to move on the rope ladder could start a swinging motion in concert with the chopper resulting in a sudden lurch this could cause a man to either lose his grip or in the extreme case as the chopper tried to right itself create a pendulum effect that could throw him into the rotors soon after zeldman had returned to the head of the line to help the chiefs whose hands like his were frozen despite their gloves one of the petty officers slipped on a rope rung and lost his grip fortunately he fell only a few feet onto the hard ice his worst injury appearing to be a bruised ego from the severe ribbing he got from the waiting crewmen who from then on would forever call him ice man in taipingshao thirty miles north of the yalu the north korean armys general kims personal interrogator made his way down through the deep subterranean tunnel hq into the dank interrogation room or rather the sixfootsquare mud pit with a threefoot boardwalk and bare table mikuk chapnomtulamerican bastardhe yelled you kill our people with gangster weapons his breath was steaming in the frigid tunnel air his short lean frame in the drab olive green of the baggy nka uniform barely visible in the light of the lantern which he placed on the bare table if you do not confess it will make the general very angry the prisoner who had been kept sitting naked for hours lashed to a rough bamboo chair didnt answer he couldnt sleep for then they would wake him with a bayonet he was forbidden to use anything not even a bucket for a toilet so that he was forced to sit chained as he was in his own urine and excrement three of kims earlier interrogators had been women and throughout the questioning and persistent demands for a confession of war crimes they would make derisive remarks about the prisoners genitals warning him that where he was going he would have no need of his member even if he knew how to use it which they taunted was doubtful it was this kind of adolescent brutality that was easiest for freeman to withstand what was far more deadly was the lack of sleep other things were bearable sitting in your own shit wasnt as bad as the gooks thought it was besides no one was as repulsed by the smell of his own ordure as were other people in fact as a young soldier at camp lejeune he had been told by the drill instructor that people secretly liked it in any event this was the kind of humiliation most men could bear at least for the first few days or so lack of sleep was the killer physically and spiritually that and their damned stinking facecloth torture during which a large piece of sodden calico was slapped over his face so that every breath he took sucked it tighter against his face then theyd jerk the chair back to the point of tipping and on the already supersaturated cloth they would drip water from a gourd its rope cradle attached to a hook jammed hard into the semifrozen earth above him the feeling of panic of being unable to breathe the single drops of water creating the sensation indeed the reality of drowning was almost too much for him and the hero of pyongyang wondered how much longer he could last without publicly on tv for all the world to see abjectly confessing his part in the conspiracy of us warmongers to wage chemical warfare on the peaceful loving peoples of the democratic peoples republic of korea ill confess nothing to you scumbags he had told his interrogators it was your forces who started this business you can dish it out but you cant take it is that it but that had been three days ago an eternity in the mind of a captive when stripped his watch taken nothing allowed that might assist him in the organization of his thoughts or help prevent disorientation he had been lashed to the chair and refused all food offered only his own urine to drink sign the drill sergeant had advised the marines we all know its bullshit back home yes they would know a confession was bullshit but underneath in americas heart of hearts after the news clips were over and the outraged eyes of the american public had watched the humiliation of their fellows and after they had voiced their disgust with the enemy tormentors there remained for all their understanding a quiet unspoken shame that an american had shown hed broken already his photo with the caption of war criminal had been circulated throughout china to stiffen resistance among the masses to the increasing usrok attacks which were now pushing the nka and the chinese troops back over the yalu into manchuria using the lowradiation but nevertheless devastating atomic shell artillery fire general kim is coming to see you announced the interrogator if you do not confess you will make him very angry freeman said nothing do you hear me mikuk he shouted again no you you do not be clever people with the general the interrogator was shaking his finger like a schoolmaster cautioning him against disobedience you must confess or you will make him very angry i wouldnt want to do that said freeman wryly excellent you are thinking correctly with that the interrogator barked several orders and two nka guards in full winter uniform ear flaps down came in wearing white cloth face masks against the stench which interestingly the interrogator either didnt seem to mind or took pains to hide his distaste for they untied him and took him away to the cold shower which meant that in half an hour he would have some thin rice soup bread and an injection perhaps of vitamins to help get his color up he would be going on tv again so far they hadnt got a confession but freeman knew the power of the box with all the will in the world to defy them once you were shown unshaven and blearyeyed despite the new change of olivedrab pajamas that were supposed to pass for fresh clothes it would be next to impossible to look anything else but defeated which the nka and chinese propagandists well knew unless you were one of those who had extraordinary imagination and determination it was difficult to beat the medium when it was the message he remembered how years before the chinese had so successfully covered the memory of the beijing massacre among their people with tv confessions and cooked footage that in the end many people believed a massacre had never taken place peter zeldman was the last man to step off the ice onto chopper number fours ladder port aft of the sub as he began his ascent he saw capt robert brentwood starting to climb the rope ladder dangling from the chopper hovering uneasily amidships off the roosevelts starboard side about forty or fifty feet above the ice hummocks and zeldman chastised himself for not having gone down to control to press home to brentwood the chopper crewmans warning about just how powerful the gusts were a few feet off the ground as the chopper hauling him up rose zeldman turned his head to check that brentwood was doing okay when suddenly there was a tremendous jerk the chopper above him buffeted sideways in a heavy gust zeldmans right hand numb with cold tried to hang on as his left hand flew away from the rope because of the jerking motion but he couldnt hold and fell thirty feet onto a hummock below almost instantly the air force corporal though busy in the choppers cabin assigning the men for the best possible distribution of weight came quickly down the rope not only from long practice but with the knowledge that the sub would explode in four now three and a half minutes hed seen zeldmans dark outline on the white ice rebound from the hummock as it hit and while he hoped for the best he feared the worst the worst was what he found though peter zeldman had fallen only thirty feet his head had struck the windcarved concretehard ice of a pressure ridge the corporal felt for a pulse but there was none the warm back of the mans neck lolling as if there was no bone there the neck broken as cleanly as if it had been struck by a steel beam two minutes come on came the voice of the loudhailer barely audible under the frantic slap of the rotors there was no more the corporal could do as it would take more than two minutes to heave the dead body up quickly he reached about zeldmans neck took the dog tags made the sign of the cross and ran for the ladder president mayne without taking precious time to confer with looking glass the ec out of offutt air force base in nebraska or his advisers or the seventeen options of attack that were laid out in the ostensibly simple but in fact very complex seventyfive pages of the footballs black book ordered an mx launch against the massive soviet oil refineries at kuibuyshev ishimbay perm and angarii and via satellite communication he told chernko in a deadly calm tone that the soviet warhead that had penetrated the generally impenetrable abm screen now thrown up along the norad line and which had burst above detroit was the reason for the fourtoone retaliatory attack against the four refineries and that this would constitute us policy until all soviet attacks ceased chernko understood that mayne wasnt threatening him that it was a promise a promise backed by the undeniable demonstration of american technological superiority still very potent despite the enormous damage it had already sustained what will happen if you do not find the two submarines asked chernko trying to sound unflappable but something in his voice betraying tightly reined panic a panic heightened by the unhesitating willingness of the american president to have had the audacity to actually name the retaliatory targets in the soviet union what will happen if we dont find your two subs replied mayne is that if another us city is struck whether it contains a military target or not i will take out four of your cities you may have some difficulty reining in some of your politburo members mr chernko but with four of your cities gone i think youll have the best of the argument to cease and desist wouldnt you say so i am doing all i can snapped chernko if a us city is hit repeated president mayne i will take out four soviet cities trainor stood unusually silent exhilarated terrified by the presidents cold delivery of americas terms mayne was talking unconditional surrender trainor waited several seconds before he spoke and then as the president sat calmly watching kneecaps monitors his aide trying to remember exactly where he had put the presidents migraine medication asked hows the head sir clear on kneecaps monitors they were now receiving the first pictures of detroit in real time relayed by one of the few remaining observation satellites that were still working the hope for star wars rocketkilling beam satellites the biggest single technological flop on both sides of the war the star wars satellites easily taken out by supersonic aircraft firing pebblesclusters of small antisatellite satellites into orbit in japan because of more favorable atmospheric conditions over the northwestern pacific tv reception throughout the japanese archipelago was exceptionally good enhanced by the highdensity japanese screens that were now showing pictures of the onemegaton air burst over detroit eighty times more powerful than the bomb dropped on hiroshima in the japanese people horrified the soviet warhead over detroit was megatons exploding in an air burst at seven thousand feet above the city fifteen miles in from lake saint clair and approximately six miles north of the canadian city of windsor which because of a dip in the great lakes border lies south of detroit the hydrogen bomb detonating miles over the intersection of interstate and interstate about kilometers from the windsordetroit tunnel created a fireball different in shape from a groundburst mushroom the halos spreading about the shock front and fireball were extraordinarily elongated forming elegant ovalshaped smoke rings the fireball passing through their centers there was no crater as there would have been with a ground burst but the air burst unlike a groundzero burst which would have lost much of its energy going into the ground was much more devastating first it created an enormous vacuum over the city then its overpressure collapsed buildings and people alike as the firestormaccompanied pressure rings moved from twelve psi at the center to one psi across a twentysixmilediameter killing zone over a half million died outright from the blast blastrelated injuries and from the fires and thermal radiation which injured or killed another and reduced the automobile factories to ashes not only were japanese tv viewers horrified their industrialists were sick with concern the destruction of americas major auto factories would be a shortterm gain for the japanese auto industry but the americans who could clear and rebuild faster than anyone on earth would unless the nuclear exchange became a total holocaust soon have the newest most modern and uptodate auto production facilities in the world and then japan would be the country with the outmoded and obsolete equipment but they knew as did mayne and chernko that everything depended on whether or not the americans found the two soviet subs should washington andor new york be struck the psychological effect throughout the world would be enormous with the us political and financial capitals in ruins her loss of prestige that intangible yet allimportant quality in the world of realpolitik would be disastrous for america as a ravaged berlin had been for germany america might survive but her influence in world affairs would never again be the same and she would forfeit it in favor of japan chapter sixtytwo ray brentwoods discovery that the oil patches revealed the presence of the two dieselelectric russian subs off the american west coast had propelled him overnight into the national spotlight but he knew spotlights could shift very quickly if you failed they went out altogether you would be yesterdays man the man who got the scent but lost the hunt with this in mind he was concerned that the very size of his twentyfourship armada as vice admiral rutgers grumpily called it while essential to cover the area could be as much an obstruction to the hunt if the sound of every one of the twentyfour ships was not read and understood correctly by each ships sonar operators it could be mistaken for the enemy ray brentwood also realized something that he hadnt dwelt on during the officers call that if any one of the russians four big ballistic missiles exploded in the middle of the task force it would in the parlance of the military neutralize them in seconds chapter sixtythree neither soviet skipper nor their crews could prove it but although the odds of both boats having leaked oil on the same patrol werent beyond possibility given the relatively old hulls of the golf it was still highly unlikely it was they concluded sabotage not of the kind that would have caused noise shorts which would have been quickly noticed in the first hour out of vladivostok and which could have been corrected quickly in port something more subtle a small oil leak slow insidious which wouldnt be noticeable immediately and by the time it was could not be so easily located or repaired there were no dry docks on americas continental shelf and rather than each going its own way theyd had to stay hidden and waited together should mutual assistance be necessary it was the price they were paying for what they believed were yevreyskie sabotazhnikijewish saboteurswho had been known to pinprick oil feeder lines whether it had been done by the likes of the three jewish brothers the kgb had arrested in khabarovsk near the railhead for the eastern tvd they didnt know only that if they could get their hands on whoever had done it they would drown them in oil very slowly ray brentwood sent ships out over the search sea radiating from the position of the two oil spills he had collected as well as those naval vessels assigned to his task force brentwood commandeered every available ship he saw even seconding three coast guard vessels en route to san diego for liberty as well as the twentyseven american ships there were four canadian frigates which though little better than target drones compared to the equipment aboard the american oliver hazard perryclass frigates were typically crewed by seamen as brave as those on brentwoods ships and especially adept at making do and squeezing the best out of near obsolete equipment it was from one of these canadian frigates that a sea king helicopter took off towing its yellow mad magnetic anomaly detector below its tail assembly covering a search grid miles northwest of san diego the sea king thought it detected a magnetic anomaly but the canadian chopper devoid of asw torpedoes could do nothing but radio the americans within twenty minutes us mhe sea stallions had closed with everything as a canadian observer described it from dunking sonar mads and mk acoustic homing asw torpedoes to chateaubriand the graph traces of the mads from two of the fivemancrew sea stallions instantly concurred with the canadians report that there was a magnetic anomaly and that most likely by nature of trace it was a metallic hull that was distorting the earths magnetic lines of force in the same way as a magnet drawn beneath a sheet will redistribute the position of magnetic filings on the paper but whether the anomaly was caused by a submarine hull the traces could not tell sonars were dunked so many of the champagnemagnumsize listening mikes being lowered into the sea that brentwoods executive officer cameron said it looked like a salmon derby still the passive sonar mikes couldnt add any more to the active traces unable to determine whether the hull was that of a sub it could be a wreck the coastal waters strewn with them but then again as ray brentwood pointed out to cameron the two oil patches had been found together so that one would have expected a bigger anomaly unless it was the hull of a sub theyd found the other hiding beneath it the two traces merging into one magnetic anomaly brentwood was faced with a classic subhunters dilemma if he dropped a torpedo and it wasnt the subs the explosion would immediately alert them whether or not they were in the immediate area and they could launch within minutes brentwood ordered sonars dunked to three hundred meters but forbade any active pulses at three hundred meters the sonars would be very close to the crush depth of an echo iiiclass dieselelectric sub at that depth the bulkheads begin to moan there was also the possibility that if the anomaly was a sub it was just thatone sub the other could very well have taken cover in the noise umbrella of the task force running on her batteries the second sub would not easily be detected amid the cavitation noises of the surface vessels think ray told himself think like a man who is hunted like a submariner a man closed in as he had been in the darkness of his own trial when hed gone under anesthesia time and again unsure of whether hed ever surface again would you he asked himself simply lie down there quietly and wait for death no he decided if they had come this far to their american station they too were brave they would fight he radioed all ships to stop engines so that the deep sonar might hear the slightest sound he could tell the officers were itching for him to go active with the sonar but he wouldnt be tempted merely to break their tension to get it over with if he couldnt wait lost his nerve he reminded himself a million faces and more would be melted and disfigured as his had been in the inferno of the blaine and for these as for any victims of a nuclear blast no surgery would save them from the radiationbred cancers that would eat them away inside the officer of the deck checked that all auxiliary machinery and airconditioning were shut off ship secured sir very well now were all quiet lets hear whats down there the sonar operator switched the incoming noise track to the pa sometimes as now the sound from the depths was so much like the noise of frying fish that some men claimed they could smell it and even taste contact bearing two one niner range ray brentwood asked estimate contact gone brentwood was behind the operator and saw the screen himself the amber arm uninterrupted by any blip what was it sonar noise short from a hull sir definitely sir it was the ood yes sir one of the sea stallions didnt get the hook quickly enough it meant that as one of the helos probably out of fuel had come down on the white circle of the munros flight deck a snapperthe seaman responsible for snapping the hook onto the ubolt beneath the chopper wasnt fast enough and in the pitch and roll the chopper had lurched forward thwacking the bulkhead creating the noise short i want whoever it was said brentwood on a charge immediately yes sir that was another misconception ray knew he had to deal with the idea that because hed had a tough run of it ending up with sludgeremovalpropelled hed somehow feel sorry for the underdog the man who made a mistake he also knew if he screwed up they wouldnt even give him sludge removal lieutenant cameron as ood couldnt remember when hed heard a bridge so quiet so much so that he now heard noises the creaking of metal fittings which hed never been aware of chapter sixtyfour the icy wind blowing the spitzbergen howled about the choppers that were bringing in the crew of the scuttled roosevelt because of the radio silence that had to be in effect while they were in the air it wasnt until they landed that robert brentwood and the men in the other four helicopters learned that lt comdr peter zeldman was dead the royal navy liaison officer assigned to the norwegian base expressed his condolences and while the crew were mugging up with cocoa and biscuits he informed robert brentwood in a decidedly oxfordian accent that brentwood and the remainder of his crew had been ordered back by saclant posthaste to holy loch balloons gone up im afraid and he stopped of course you of all people know about that sir brentwood nodded but he was still thinking about zeldman and georgina point is sir saclants canceled all leave and ah the lieutenant for all the firsts hed earned at oxford was suddenly tonguetied realizing that if the world survived the man he was looking at would go down in history as the unflinching american who upon seeing the russian icbms streaking up from kola peninsula toward his country had immediately launched the wests counterattack none of the roosevelts crew spoke much as they filed into the hercules transport that escorted by six heavily armed harriers would take them back to holy loch the next worst thing to having lost your ship was being split up half of them on the orders from saclant were to replace only those crewmen killed aboard another sea wolf ii which now lay waiting for them in holy loch a titanium patch on her hull where a soviet asroc had grazed her hull aft of the sail it made sense to split up the roosevelt crew and they knew it but for men who had lived and worked so closely together knew one anothers joys and failures and shared them it was still a gutwrenching business on top of having to send your own ship to her grave and while they were glad to have survived the ordeal their first view of scotlands cape wrath was greeted with mixed feelings there was too in the hercules an unspoken fear as heavy about them as the steady roar of the great hercules engines the cold scientific fact that no matter how they felt now some of them were going to the within the next few months others having no more than two possibly three years to live if they werent killed in action no one had spoken about it on the way in to spitzbergen the dosimeters still on their belts but hidden beneath their arctic parkas but it was far from a case of out of sight out of mind the hercules pilot said something over the pa which no one understood and robert brentwood went forward to find out what it was below he could see a wrinkled gray sea barely visible in the dawns early light cape wrath just as quickly it was swallowed by cloud holy loch the pilot told him half an hour bet youre pleased to be back yes said robert he wondered how much time he would have with rosemary it might be better if he had none he thought and immediately felt ashamed disgusted by his own despair holding on to the strap webbing for support as the plane hit a patch of turbulence he made his way carefully back from the cockpit he told the chiefs of the boat to instruct each man in their department to take off the dosimeter and when theyd collected them all to give them to him each mans name was on each dosimeter and he told them they would address the problem of radiation through the base medical officer and the radiation lab in oxford meanwhile he didnt want any family or friends if any had been alerted that roosevelts crew were due back at holy loch to see the dosimeters and start worrying thered be enough time for that later when they had the labs reports several of the men those who like brentwood had sustained more than permissible levels of radiation felt greatly relieved and in his concern for them the bond they felt with old bing was cemented even further the spets had completely surrounded the cathedral of the assumption five millimeter rounds had been fired from the third t in the column before the first two battle tanks had been destroyed by the direct hit from choir williams on the first tank which men spewed burning fuel on the spets immediately around it as williams following david brentwoods orders made his way quickly out of the cathedral into the hall of facets the glorious colors of the priceless fifteenthcentury frescoes lit up by parachute flares didnt warrant even a glance from him as he hastened to join aussie and the other sas men only fourteen in all not counting david brentwood and cheekdawson another two men were cut down as the fourteen sas burst out from annunciation cathedral at the kremlins southern end across the snowcovered quad and into the pristine snow of taynitsky park another man died beheaded by the sustained burst of heavy machinegun fire for despite his spets overlay he was spotted in the floodlit park opposite annunciation cathedral because part of his spets overlay had been torn in the next seven seconds however three floodlights and the spets manning them were shattered into perpetual darkness by at least five bursts of sas submachinegun fire as the remaining eleven sas including williams a and choir williams made for the wall there was more firing a hundred yards or so west of them near the high water tower that marked the southernmost tip of the kremlins stronghold where spets mistaking one another for sas troops were unintentionally creating a diversionary tactic that the eleven sas men couldnt have planned better themselves it was the one flash of luck most of them would remember as going over the darkened wall the small band of commandos fell into the soft snow amid the trees that faced the kremlin quay and beyond in the darkness the frozen moscow river in the air raid blackout of the city the kremlin now looked like an island of fire wheres brentwood aussie whispered to choir williams as they headed away from the kremlin eagerly seeking the cover afforded by both blizzard and blackout in the pitchblack cathedral its air choked with the smell of cordite gasoline fumes and the sweet stench of burning flesh from out by the tanks brentwood taking out his own last shot of morphine had dragged cheekdawson up by the altar having had to hold the frozen ampule in his mouth to warm it before injecting it he loosened the englishmans tourniquet for a few moments but then tightened it again and clipped the last magazine of ninemillimeter shorts into the macs grip housing then deftly considering the unnerving shooshing sound of boots in the snow as spets closed in toward the cathedral david snuffed out a tiny candle flame left burning by one of the men who now lay dead beneath it by one of the frescoed columns he heard russian voices coming from somewhere outside by the cathedrals marbeled entrance and racked by fatigue he was momentarily back in the vast marbled hall of mansudae where he freeman and another marine had stormed the stairwell leading up to general kims office but the nka general had fled the cathedral was so huge that brentwood thought he and cheekdawson might luck out that if they kept quiet enough the spets might pass right by them through the doorway into the sanctuary it was the fatigue that was doing it that was making him entertain such fantastic notions of escape as if after the spets passed through there would be no one to discover him and cheekdawson in the morning light the morphine had given cheekdawson new life and with it the clarity that david had often seen in the wounded following a shot though unable to walk by himself the cold stiffening his immobile leg even further the englishman was fully cognizant of what was going on gently he nudged david and whispered get going damn fool david ignored him suddenly there was a horrific bang not of munitions but of the huge entrance doors being thrown back at the far end a sharp order given the spets clearly gathering readying to charge in force here we go whispered cheekdawson think things are going to get a bit sticky old boy theyre cheekdawson winced from pain despite the morphine as he tried to sit up into a better firing position theyre going to light this up like a christmas tree well hell said david at least well see what were doing id take that overlay off if i were you old boy said cheekdawson grimacing why they capture you in that youre technically a spy they dont like spies very much you sound like theyre going to ask me to surrender and if they do youre dreaming dawson morphines gone to your fucking head then if youre going to leave it on old boy cheekdawson whispered tugging the overlay i suggest you make a run for it no point in you staying around and shut up said david they heard a loud hissing noise then a bump the pillars with the saints on them flickering brilliantly then disappearing the flare having presumably hit the edge of the main door bouncing back off into the snow lousy bowlers cheekdawson said pitchers david corrected him theyll get better they could hear loudspeakers and a lot of shouting cheekdawson dragged himself over behind one of the sainted pillars david now behind the pillar to his right dont know what theyre carrying on about said the englishman they can all have a turn chapter sixtyfive the sonarman aboard ray brentwoods guided missile frigate had frozen a pieslice segment of his screen restricting the arms sweep between and degrees where the noise short from the hard helo landing had been picked up by the munros passive sonar brentwood however quickly had him put it back on continuous sweep from zero to degrees in order to prevent the ship from being surprised by an attack from any other segment his insurance against the assumption now held by most of his ships that the metallic anomaly a mile ahead of them was caused by the two subs they were looking for the munro was so quiet as brentwood and the others listened to the steady stirfry of incoming passive they could hear the slopping of water against the ships starboard flank ray brentwood knew they might be losing valuable time but the dunking helos were insistent that the anomaly was within the significant range that it could be a sub the trouble as brentwood well knew through his careful attention to the minutiae of the charts was that while they were on the continental shelf they were very close to where it started to plunge down to form the continental slope the significant anomaly could well be an outcrop of metalrich rock or even mud slowly shifted by the turbidity currents the other possibility was that it might be one of the many wrecks that littered the coast some of them not marked on the charts was he being too cautious the legacy of any captain who had lost a ship inform the helos to fire torpedoes he ordered yes sir ten sleek blue marks dropped from the hard points of the five sea stallions the wrapped control wire unraveling behind them like tightly bundled spaghetti almost immediately the cobalt sea boiled with air bubbles a classic sub antisonar tactic the effusion of bubbles normally blanking any acoustic homing torpedoes but as the marks were being guided toward magnetic anomaly the noise of the bubbles could not deter them for a moment it seemed as if the whole sea had swollen into an enormous green carbuncle then it turned white bursting in an airshattering explosion permanently deafening a sonar operator aboard one of the dunking helos whod forgotten to turn down his volume control there was a series of other explosions the seas foaming surface littered with the torn and shattered detritus human and material alike quiet on the bridge shouted ray brentwood determined not to let either ship or helo crews get carried away with the kill lest the second one had escaped though he seriously doubted it ood cameron summoned by one of the lookouts saw flashes of silver amid the debris indicating that some of the sea stallions torpedoes might have been chaffactivated set off by metal balloons full of fine metal foil excreted by a sub in order to detonate the metalhoming warheads prematurely two miles away from the explosion whose noise smothered all target indicators in ray brentwoods ships and helos the seas surface was broken by what looked like two porpoisenosed shapes seeming to leap from the sea whitishgreen water running down their flanks bearing yelled ray brentwood zero two two fire harpoon fire asroc the ood immediately relayed the order to all ships while in less than eighty seconds the soviet golf had launched its two ssn missiles from its fin tubes two of brentwoods ships fired harpoons within two seconds of hearing his order the american missiles having less than twentyseven seconds to reach the sealaunched icbms after the soviet missiles had cleared their fin housing popping through the water like rubber balls suddenly released beneath the surface their engines already ignited in boost phase one was hit everyone surprised by the lack of flame its debris smacking loudly into the sea other pieces of it spinning away in cartwheels the two halves of its midsection split and dangling like a broken white cigar crashing harmlessly into the sea but in drawing the fire of the americans this missile allowed the other missile from the golf to escape passing quickly from subsonic to supersonic trajectory evading a phalanx of american antiballistic missile defense batteries their radars confused by the sheer volume of information coming in from the task forces firing the russian missile further aided by the usual winter storms above the mountainous coastal ranges in oregon and washington state interfering with advanced radar warning stations minutes later it hit seattle in air burst in president maynes mind the russians had no doubt chosen seattle as a technically correct counterforce or military target as his adviser schuman had told him because of the massive boeing works it was a lawyers point maynes advisers aboard both kneecap and looking glass telling him that though seattle was the most populous northwestern city in the continguous united states this could not be used as a countervalue argument against the soviets who would no doubt correctly claim that because of boeing seattle was a bona fide counterforce military target mayne though in no mood for lawyers points nevertheless had to confront the cold logic of their reasoning in a nuclear world but cold logic also told him the russians who had started the nuclear exchange might well be lying through their teeth in claiming they could not contact their subs was it chernkos test of us will it was only a second in his minds eye but in that second the long memory of what america had forfeited because of russian lies and subterfuge at the end of world war ii lay heavily upon him and what were the russians planning were they moving their slbm fleet closer to attack should america weaken he decided that for the sake of everyone and not just the united states there must be absolutely no question no doubt left in the russians minds he would not order the four retaliatory strikes and as they had not taken out washington he would leave moscow standing but ordered leningrad taken out as payment in kind for the millions who he now knew had died in seattle and would the in the weeks to come as the mx warheads came down over leningrad the overpressure caused the neva to burst its banks flooding nevsky prospekt the rubble that moments before had been a golden glory of imperial architecture housing the general staff headquarters in palace square mixed in a sludge with the ashes of what had been the burnished gold of st isaacs cathedral its vaporized frescoes infusing the sludge with speckles of gold the entire hermitage was razed to the ground rembrandts flora and millions of other exhibits vaporized the docks where only minutes before battle cruisers and missilecarrying destroyers were setting out to sea were now infernos the huge dockside cranes tumbling into the neva boiling it with their heat the fires from the air burst cremated over a million and there would have been many more were it not for the extensive underground shelters in the outlying suburbs now even chernko knew the war was over that america could no longer be resisted in the crude measure of body counts no doubt america had suffered millions more dead than the soviet union because of her lack of nuclear shelters and evacuation schemes but her technology and now it was clear her will were indomitable for his part in detecting the presence of the two russian ballistic missile subs which had it not been for his prescience would have surely increased americas dreadful losses of over six million dead into more than forty and would have turned the radioactivedead zones of several midwestern states and north washington state into an entire country of dead zones poisoned for decades ray brentwood had become an overnight hero celebrated not only in every state of the union but all over the allied world but even at this moment when chernko on behalf of the politburo and stavka delivered russia despite the threat of the siberian republic to secede into unconditional surrender to the united states of america it would take hours in some places days in others before the word was out and in those places men would continue to the as if there had been no surrender and despite the euphoria embracing the return of ray brentwoods fleet he stood alone at the ships stern disturbingly hypnotized by the ships wake at one moment it was a sea alive its effervescence catching the morning sun like an ice cream cloud in summer yet at the same time it seemed to him a massive and evermoving grave its vastness taking him into itself making him feel insignificant and lost what the hells gotten into him asked a jubilant third officer christ hes won the quiet now said cameron who was still officer of the deck his wife and children live lived in seattle as in all modern wars it was one in which the civilian casualties far outnumbered those of the combatants in khabarovsk alexsandra was hysterical her three brothers had come home released by nefski who had apologized saying that there had been a grievous error committed by his second in command that the three brothers arrest had been nothing more and nothing less than a case of mistaken identity he very much hoped the family would understand and as a sign of his sincerity he would be most honored if they would be his guests at the bear restaurantkosher of course what he meant as they well knew was that the allies would go easier on him given his apology and his subsequent treatment of the family but alexsandra didnt hear a word of what he said still crying hysterically at the sight of ivan her oldest brother whom she had seen shot in the courtyard of the kgb prison she kept hugging him pushing him away to see that it was really him pulling at his beard like a small child hugging him again and crying and laughing and weeping as she hadnt done in years ivan had been told alexander explained to fall in the snow when he heard shots blanks or more likely said alexander live ammunition but aimed at the wall away from ivan nefski not wanting to shoot a source of information before he had to hoping to terrify the girl enough before he moved to more drastic measures they did not accept his invitation to the bear for apart from it never having entered their heads that they would do so it would only confirm the suspicions of others in the oblast that what nefski had said about them being turncoats and opportunists was true chapter sixtysix in the pale light of moscows dawn the suns rays grew brighter by the second and despite the air being filled with dust from the rubble of the com the colors within assumption cathedral grew richer david hearing the spets moving outside their boots crunching the tightly packed snow their commanding officer obviously having decided to wait for more light to aid him in rooting out the last of the sas holdouts cheekdawson was in great pain again his left foot so swollen that the boot looked like it was about to split from his position behind the pillar to the left of the altar and from davids position behind the pillar to the right they had the entrance well covered but both knew they could not realistically hold out for any more than a few minutes once the final rush came both of them having donned their masks for what they were sure would be a tear gas attack then they heard the tolling of the bell tower in st nicholas and the very beauty of the sound muted by the snowladen roofs was hardly over when the attack began not with tear gas canisters which would have obliged the attackers to have the encumbrances of gas masks as well but a cluster of smoke grenades which rolled into the cathedral their thick spuming white smoke churning sunbeams and obscuring the cathedrals chandeliers neither cheekdawson nor brentwood fell for the trap of firing to give away their positions but instead quickly rolled four flashbangs into the smoke immediately cupping their ears and pressing their helmets hard up against the pillars there was a purple flash a splintering of glass the sound of someone running off to davids left david wheeled about the pillar saw denser white on white the spetss overlay in the smoke and fired a quick threeround burst the spetss feet shot from under him as if hed slipped on ice and he was dead the moment he struck the floor there was a series of shouted orders and now they all came in cheekdawson throwing two more grenades and david three in quick succession the cathedral erupted in machinegun fire orange tongues darting in the thick smoke a man screaming somewhere down by the entrance david knowing he had only four or five good bursts left sas it was a booming russian voice with barely a trace of accent coming through the smoke of battle and the mist born of the heat from the coms rubble blowing across the snow sas it is useless to resist further surrender now and you will be treated well as prisoners of war cheekdawson his face grimacing from the pain that even the effort of speaking caused him added wryly at the ritz no doubt intourist david said and called out what are your terms clever lad said cheekdawson but davids attempt to buy more time for the sas men who had already left didnt work the russian recognizing davids ploy for what it was immediately and shouting angrily in return come out now or you will die cheekdawson pulled his last two flashbangs closer to him saw david had none slid one across to him then teeth clenched in pain pushed himself up against the pillar of the saints thanks for staying old boy he said to david keep quiet said david and they might take you prisoner i will david smiled at the englishmans transparent lie glass broke somewhere and within minutes the cathedral was filled with more smoke pouring out of two or three canisters suddenly david saw a way of buying a little more time for those of his men already over the wall always the unexpected son had been freemans motto pulling the pin on one of the grenades holding down its lever and dashing forward through the heavy smoke toward the cathedrals entrance david tossed out a grenade hard left then dashed out to the right through smoky mist he heard the crash of the first grenade saw two shapes one of them a man writhing on the ground knocked down by the first grenade the second shape two figures to his left he fired a full burst one fell knees knocked from beneath him as if hit from behind with a club the second man behind him still coming david dropped to the snow firing another burst the heat wash hot on his face his kevlar jacket feeling like ice picks were hitting it a warm sensation flooded his chest shadows flitting by him through the smoke into the cathedral garlic so strong it made his eyes water was the next thing david was aware of and a burning pain as if a redhot poker had been thrust through his abdomen down into his thigh the spets medical officer a woman who looked as if she towed tanks to keep fit was glowering down at him you are lucky her garlic breath made him turn away wheres my friend he asked the english she said he tried to be brave too david stared at her but his focus was blurring he is dead she said matteroffactly comrade malek wanted him too but she shrugged his earlier wounds we could not save him malek comrade malek is the new head of spets said the medical officer he wishes to know all about sas ive never worked said david gasping from his pain for scandinavian air he was a little deranged from the pain and thought his answer hilariously funny cheekdawson would have liked it general malek is in no mood for jokings neither as it turned out was the president of the united states nor the prime minister of great britain nor any of the other allied leaders they demanded immediate repatriation of all prisoners and said they were holding chernko and his politburo personally responsible for any harm that might befall any allied prisoners in the soviets possession including those personnel who have participated in the raid against the russian capital but it wasnt the tough talk that caused the russians to repatriate david brentwood back to london where he would rejoin the few sas men seven in all who had made it out but rather the enormous press coverage now being given to the kremlin raid chernko badly needed a highly visible propaganda act of humanity and davids hurried repatriation became part of it due in large measure to the simple fact that only an hour earlier the australian choir williams and williams a had already been airlifted after being captured in moscow infrared photos from the japanese news satellite had embarrassed the russians by showing the world that the final spets attack against the sas holdouts in assumption cathedral was still in progress after president chernko had agreed to the unconditional surrender of all soviet forces and their allies to the joint allied command it was often said to david afterward that the satellite pictures had probably saved him from being hauled off and shot as a spy and dumped in some unknown russian grave it didnt seem to occur to those who told him this that the satellite pictures hadnt saved cheekdawson and that as aussie would have said his fate had simply been in the roll of the dice davids identity like that of the other members of the raid was protected for a time because of the legendary sas penchant for anonymity but for ray brentwood over ten thousand miles away his ships in sight of san diegos point loma where the crews could see the fireworks streaming up from balboa park and the fighters taking off from miramars top gun school to form an honor overflight anonymity was something he could not hope for only hours before the shouts of recognition and streamers of adulation had been all he craved but now the only thing that seemed in concert with the depression into which hed been plunged by his fears for his wife and family was the sullen smog that hung above the san ysidro mountains reminding him of the deadly fallout that would even now be blanketing the pacific northwest and all of the great plains states as he returned the salute and descended among the biggest crowd ever seen on the san diego naval docks ray brentwood suddenly became the most photographed person on earth the man who through brains and courage had saved millions of american lives and thereby thwarted an allout nuclear holocaust the very ugliness of his face quickly beloved by newspaper editors all over the world who saw it as an ironic and inverse measure of his heroism among the crowd were beautiful women trying to get close enough to touch him others from hollywood to ask if he had an agent manila envelopes with option contracts stuffed inside thrust his way ray bore it as best he could in a silence numbed by thoughts of beth jeannie and john admiral admiral it was a blonde a military policeman was trying to block her for spets like hollywood had been known to employ beautiful women for their purposes and who could be sure that some disaffected sleeper many of them still at large but she wasnt from hollywood or spets and the young mp duty notwithstanding found it decidedly pleasant to feel her pressed hard against him beth and your children she began ray brentwood pushed frantically toward the mp the throng so thick he felt like a man swimming against a riptide the blondes voice all but drowned in the hysteria of congratulations about him the woman he noticed was in uniform a wave her hat apparently knocked off in the crush sir she yelled your wife and children in portland they were on their way down soon as heard your fleet was theyre all right ray yelled yes sir theyre fine theyre fine he hugged her and flashbulbs popped something hed have to explain to beth when the national investigator and the other tabloids of the jay la roche chain printed the photo under the caption admiral making waves chapter sixtyseven it is time for your confession announced general kims interrogator a bowl of steaming rice on the bare table beside him as he stood menacingly a thick bamboo stick tapping his leggings general freeman face hollow eyes down blinking nervously his ravenous gaze fixed on the rice nodded obediently all he could think of was the film he had seen of orwells when in the end winston smith he of the famous first name and common surname the embodiment of all mens strengths and weaknesses had bowed his head in obedience to his interrogator conceding tearfully and irrevocably that two plus two were five remember the interrogator cautioned freeman you must not try any jokings you must only say what is printed on the screen i began freeman i do not require a he had difficulty remembering what it was called cue card i know it tell me insisted the interrogator the bowl of rice still steaming holding freeman captive with its promise i wish began freeman to apologize for my part in the criminal warmongering activity of the united states against the freedomoving peoples of the democratic republic of north korea and the freedomoving peoples of the peoples republic of china the confession went on to acknowledge various other perfidies against freedomoving peoples all over the globe but freeman was so weak he could barely proceed despite the vitamin shots giving him some color the effects of malnutrition were evident in his speech but he knew that before the camera went on he would be given the rice if he agreed and the promise of a full meal of vegetables and fish which was a promise whatever the brutalities the nka inflicted on their victims they had never reneged on he had smelled it after others had confessed the smell a torture and incitement in itself no one freeman knew who had not been starved could possibly understand how quickly ones resolve broke down as they took him up from the tunnel cells a guard on each side helping him he thought of winston smith again and of jeremiah denton the senator from alabama who had been so badly tortured by the north vietnamese in the glare of the lights he looked like an animal out of its tunnel blinking almost continuously general kim unsmiling dressed in immaculately pressed nka fatigues his flat goldstriped and redstarred shoulder boards showing to maximum effect waited patiently smoking contentedly kim cleared his throat and suddenly the bevy of technicians producers et cetera fell silent and in the surreal glare of the kleig lights the smoke of his cigarette rising voluminously about him filling the small studio he spoke to the interrogator though freeman knew that kim spoke quite fluent english from his days as the nkas chief negotiator at panmunjom where he was in the habit of informing the americans that you had better be careful or you will the like the kennedys shot like dogs in the street the interrogator turned to freeman the general says to remind you that this is on videotape and that if you do not say exactly the words then there will be great punishment no food more beatings the interrogator was snaking his finger at freeman you understand freeman lifted his head and nodded the session began and freeman the glare bothering him asked that the lights be turned down they refused still blinking like a frightened spaniel he began i wish to apologize for my part in the criminal warmongering activity astonishing all present by getting the confession wordperfect on the first take the interrogator pointing out to kim how freeman had been celebrated for his attention to detail when it was aired on american networks via a south american neutral country the american public saw the general making his confession on all three networks and the public broadcasting system so did army intelligence they wound back the tape and went forward in freezeframe freemans blinking was a carbon copy of what jeremiah denton had done in hanoi well almost a copy as army general grey explained to the president denton had blinked torture in morse freeman had blinked bullshit freeman got the vegetables and fish hours before beijing caught on by then the surrender of all communist forces had been made and within two weeks douglas freeman was recuperating in the walter reid army hospital regaling his wife and cat whom she had illegally smuggled in about those stupid sons of bitches in pyongyang chapter sixtyeight it was raining in portland but beth didnt care crying uncontrollably though she knew it was very unnavy both of them explained to the children albeit gently that being proud of their dad was okay but not to get any swelled heads oh daddy said jeannie bursting with pride the sad note in their reunion was beths report that the newspapers were listing melissa lange davids old flame beth remembered as one of those killed in the russian icbm attacks against sac in omaha and that their officers quarters house in seattle was presumably gone like so many others meanwhile they would have to remain billeted in the marriot hotel which the children thought was great rays dad was on the line from new york though it had taken him over an hour to get through well son he said voice tight with emotion well done well done well done oh john it was rays mom on the extension sounds like youre ordering a steak let me speak to him ray im so proud im just so now mother began john but his wife catherine took no notice her joy unreined after hearing from the pentagon that david though wounded and robert had survived the war the war office had seen no point in raising the question of roberts radiation dosage this was something that the navy thought would best be kept under wraps for a while largely in an effort to dampen public concern over the number of chernobyls or downed subs which now lay littered about the oceans floor and which would seriously affect the food chain for some time to come the navy also justified its position by pointing out correctly that the effect of an individuals radiation dosage could vary widely and in any case was something best left for those affected to discuss with their families as they saw fit when david arrived at heathrow in the red cross ambulance his stretcher wheeled into the army waiting hall where the other seven survivors of the sas raid were still being debriefed after exhaustive medical examination he was conscious but the painkilling shots hed received on the flight had made him dopey putting him temporarily at peace as they readied him for transfer for the operation to remove two millimeter bullets from his thigh as his stretcher passed by it was the first time david had ever seen the australian genuinely shocked struth whats up with aussie david asked choir williams groggily oh explained the welshman in his basso profundo es lost a bloody fortune that fellow has bet a packet on you he did that you wouldnt make it back or that laylor chappie from troop a very depressed aussie is sorry to disappoint him said david croakily his throat parched from the morphine oh said choir philosophically i wouldnt worry about im sir es probably taking bets from some poor sod that the surrender wont hold or t sun wont come up in the morning almost didnt said david choir williams shook his head as davids stretcher passed on and looked over at williams a you know williams that yanks a nice fellow but terrible morbid sometimes listen said aussie wandering up to choir five to one davey boy comes through the whole operation with flying colors dollars us go away said choir yes said williams a go home you terrible man all right all right said aussie yen how about yen chapter sixtynine the pact between the surviving members of the uss roosevelt was kept and none went public with the knowledge that at least a third of them were probably dying the secret of their invisible yet deadly illness was not a difficult one to keep in a world where the visible horrors of the war were so widespread it was a secret robert brentwood believed he could keep from the moment he and the others had landed in the wild and beautiful highland dawn to the time he and rosemary visited his brother david they took him down from middlesex hospital after the operation to convalesce at the spences in oxshott where mrs spence spared no effort looking after him doubtless seeing in david the chance to repay lana brentwood for her kindness to young william when he had been wounded in the atlantic at times richard spence felt his wifes attentiveness to david brentwood was almost too cloying but remembering the terrible emptiness that williams death had caused in their lives he was loath to interfere in any event he was as much worried about the effect of peter zeldmans death on georgina but she like her mother had rallied and while the loss would always be with her richard could already see in her a sudden maturing she was still passionate about her ideas and at times as argumentative as ever but much more willing now to listen peter zeldman in a way had tamed her forced her to look at her innermost self beneath all the varsitybred and nourished pretensions so that when she met david there was none of the petulant knowing air of superiority she had once held toward soldiers but more understanding of what young william and others like him and zeldman must have been through a new respect for action as well as for intellect would you like me to do that she asked david one morning as he struggled valiantly but in vain with knife and fork his right arm particularly painful yes he said it was the way she did that simple thing smiling as she sat down beside him a wide open smile utterly devoid of connivance or any intent to impress that touched him richard spence interrupting his puzzle in the telegraph watched her and david looking at each other and inwardly groaned for his savings account at the midland bank wondering yet again what unjust and perverse origin lay beneath the pernicious custom that decreed the brides father always got stuck with the bill and georginas taste in champagne exceeded only that of her great uncle geoffrey who never helped matters with his exuberance for the spence family forming as many connections as possible with our cousins across the water it had been only a few days after the surrender when at about am the spences highpitched burglar alarm awoke everyone in the house robert was up and out of bed before rosemary realized it as he made his way down toward the staircase richard spence was coming up in his robe apologizing profusely to everyone gathering at the top of the stairs mea culpa mea culpa terribly sorry sorry everyone went down for a snack forgot to switch off the ruddy second beam oh richard anne chastised him shaking holding the rail for support one hand on her chest as if to slow her heart you frightened the dickens out of us well youd better stay up and answer the police call its your own silly fault yes oh dear i am sorry everyone no problem said robert who went down to the kitchen with richard to wait until the police called richard said the station at leatherhead would either call or send a car already in the area its a knack robert said watching richard preparing the tea you wont believe this but before i came to england i thought the only way you made tea was with tea bags richard was opening a quarterpound packet of bushells the small black india leaves measured by hand before he dumped them from his palm into the brown pot into which hed poured hot roiling water at two oclock in the morning robert wasnt in the mood for anything more profound than a conversation about tea even when we use pots in the states we just dump in the bags he said but richard didnt seem in the mood for small talk he gave the impression that his ritual of tea making was more an escape from something he wanted to say an awkwardness that robert hadnt sensed before in the spence household they say robert continued that when prince charles went to visit reagan in the white house they asked him whether hed like tea or coffee he said tea of course but they brought him this little bag and he didnt do anything with it must have been on old ronnies mind because next day he asked charles at a formal dinner about it and charles told him that he simply didnt know what to do with this funny little bag richard didnt respond merely pouring the steeped tea moving the spout up and down his left hand pressed against the lid something robotic if expert in his movements that indicated his thoughts were elsewhere he handed robert a cup of dark amber darjeeling i didnt trip the alarm he said quietly he pushed the small packets of rationed sugar toward robert there was someone in here two of them i was on my way down for a snack i rang the police just as i saw them take off couldnt get the car number or anything but theres a good chance the police might cut them off at the roundabout he was stirring the tea thoughtfully no use frightening the women no agreed robert was anything taken no thats the thing you see the phone rang yes answered richard oh yes inspector i see yes of course now richard returned to the kitchen table they caught two people not at the roundabout in the culdesac down a bit theyd like you and me to go down to the station me asked robert surprised yes i didnt see them id have no idea richard was handing him the identikit sketches of the charmers that robert had sent him from holy loch oh christ look robert they said we could come in the morning if we liked but i think under the circumstances might be better if we nipped down there ill tell anne youre coming along to keep me company all right said robert robert knew it was them the moment he stepped inside the leatherhead police station the desk sergeant was typing out the pink sheet charging them with breaking and entering and illegal possession of firearms highvels the very make the superintendent at mallaig had supposed spets abroad had been issued with highvelocity quiet and very accurate at short range robert could still see the bullet hole in prices forehead the two charmers didnt look too happy no confetti this time the identification was simple and straightforward there were no lineups given for chernkos people abroad it would be in camera and theyd either be shot or now the surrender was in place exchanged for two of the allies it hadnt taken robert and richard long but it had shaken them both to realize that even after the official surrender the two spets had pursued their mission and they wondered how many around the world were still at largeboth of them agreed to say nothing to anyone else there was no point besides for robert the diagnosis to be given him by the radiation lab at oxford was a much more immediate and pressing concern chapter seventy on his third visit to what hed told rosemary was a special submarine update school at oxford robert brentwood was informed by the specialists at the radiation medicine lab that the initial diagnosis was confirmed he had indeed received aboveacceptable levels of radiation am i dying he asked the doctor simply were all dying old chap come on doc truth is we never know for sure in a case like yours id say the doctor shrugged fiftyfifty we can speculate predict all we want but there are other factors will to live fitness individual metabolism even in a case of radioactive poisoning oh yes though its not generally recognized he gave a warm cheeky smile sounds a bit too mystical for most mds you see difficult stuff to measure the day of the third visit as he strolled back from the radiation lab through oxfords rainpolished streets the golden spires of the ancient university caught the wintry sun with such brilliance that only nostalgia and hope seemed permissible at that moment he was shocked to find rosemary waiting at the station one look told him she knew where hed been her lips aquiver though she was trying to be brave she was wearing a scarf the same one shed been wearing when they had first met a light pastel green covered with the wildflowers of an english spring they held one another before either spoke how long she asked finally they dont know no one does she didnt go on at him about why he hadnt told her she knew his motive though she might not agree with it came from all the oldfashioned virtues of a silent service youd have nothing to worry about anyway he told her you and the bairn as usual his scottish accent was atrocious to her ears but she felt his love all around her like a warm embrace on a wintry day anyway he hurried on ill be here to see the boy she was in tears as they stood hand in hand on the platform oh she said bravely what makes you think its a boy or a lassie he said and he stopped turning her to him rose lets not be sad i see the glass halffull not halfempty she sobbed uncontrollably told him she loved him and that thered never be another man for her and he held her tightly and prayed there would be if he went before his time whenever that might be on the train back the peaceful winter countryside rocking gently outside he went to the bar and ordered a double gin and tonic for her the british rail attendant astonished proclaiming a double youd be bloody lucky mate been a war on you know ah yes said robert then ill just have the single he left a hefty tip not really thinking what he was doing oh ta very much said the attendant suddenly solicitous of the americans wellbeing youre a gentleman and a scholar sir rosemary refused the single gin and tonic said she didnt want to do anything that might harm the baby have it yourself she said he did and looking out at the land flashing by the smell of frozen earth thawing he felt so glad to be alive to feel and see and touch the world about him it was like a longing fulfilled and he was sure that what he was feeling at this very moment was what it must be like for rosemary to feel the warmth of a life his life theirs growing inside her its going to be a boy he said a girl she contradicted snuggling into him youve cheated he said looking down at her with mock accusation you had a sonogram ultrasound she said yes no i dont know but my pulse is faster and ah said robert superstitions anyway i dont care as long as she or he joins the navy or becomes a teacher she countered no really whatever they decide yes oh robert now now he said no tears silent running chapter seventyone outside dutch harbors paradise motel it was twenty below inside it was much hotter shirer already down to his tshirt lana la roche nee brentwood letting him undress her soon he was getting out of control slowly she laughed youre ripping my uniform i cant wait he said frantically i dont care about your uniform im hornier than a toad wellsit toad she instructed him laughing im not ready not ready he challenged that isnt what you said in your lettergram it said landing field ready yes i know she said ready for landing not attack and frank yes please take that awful eye patch off why thought it would kind of remind you of old times he made a groucho marx expression tapping an invisible cigar rolling his good eye if you know what i mean i remember she said but that was before jay i want to forget those days please take it off he did though she didnt know that this time he hadnt meant it as a joke that this time while the electromagnetic impulse of the air burst over detroit had not penetrated kneecaps sheathing the light of the massive explosion brighter than a million suns as the experts were so fond of describing it had damaged his steering eye as well as blinding the navigator he had to fly the plane alone reading the instruments with the eye that had been protected by the patch if it hadnt been for the soft light inside the paradise motel lana would no doubt have seen the faint milky whiteness where the microwave radiation had penetrated the aqueous humor of the damaged eye literally cooking its clear protein turning it white as easily and quickly as a microwave cooks the clear protein of an egg but right now neither the laser operations that might help repair some though not all of the damage the air bursts that had caused it and had injured so many others nor the long wait he might have for any corrective surgery while america struggled to rebuild herself into something approaching prewar normalcy were on his mind as he turned the lights dimmer switch to low lordy he said you look better than a carrier deck on a rainy night oh how romantic she said smiling her loose hair falling about her shoulders as she demurely slipped between the covers do you always sweettalk your lady friends like that i dont have any other lady friends i believe you she said her hand rustling the pillow on the other side of the small double bed in her arms the war jay everything was forgotten hopefully soon everyone would be at peace but if it wasnt to be then for now at least the world was theirs the promise of love so close so urgent they ached for each other as they joined the aching gave way turning pain to pleasure that mounted and grew enveloping them pulling them faster and faster harder until they were free over the cascading precipice falling in timeless cool space where only rapture was certain
