winning several school competitions and returned to britain in to pursue a fulltime writing career prologue on an undisclosed date in september the secretarygeneral of the united nations chaired an extraordinary meeting attended by fortysix envoys who represented virtually every country in the world there was only one point on the agenda the escalating tide of international crime criminals and terrorists were able to strike in one country then flee across its borders secure in the knowledge that pursuit would breach the sovereignty of neighbouring states furthermore drafting extradition warrants was both costly and timeconsuming and many contained loopholes that lawyers could exploit to secure their clients release a solution had to be found it was agreed to set up an international strike force to operate under the aegis of the united nations security council it would be known as the united nations anticrime organization its objective was to avert neutralize and or apprehend individuals or groups engaged in international criminal activities each envoy then submitted a curriculum vitae of a candidate their government considered suitable for the position of un ago director and the secretarygeneral made the final choice un a cos clandestine existence came into being on march one it was dark by the time he reached his destination he got out of the taxi paid the driver then wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand he had forgotten how humid it could get in beirut at that time of year he waited until the taxi had driven off before crossing the road to the windorah a small bar run by dave jenkins an australian who had named it after his birthplace in queensland well he assumed jenkins still ran it he hadnt been back to beirut in four years he pushed open the door and went inside nothing had changed the two large propeller fans still rotated slowly above the room the prostitutes still mingled with the foreign journalists and jenkins was still behind the counter their eyes met jenkins shook his head in disbelief well ill be damned mike graham what the hell brings you back to beirut business graham answered his eyes flickering slowly around the room lookin for somebody yeah russell laidlaw graham turned back to jenkins his eyes narrowed he told you i was coming jenkins shook his head an educated guess thats all hes the only old friend of yours i know who comes in here every night what time did he say hed meet you eight graham replied glancing at his watch it was seven fifty thats when he usually gets here you want a beer while you wait although graham rarely touched alcohol he could do with a beer in the heat if its cold comin up jenkins replied then bent down to open one of the fridges under the counter a prostitute caught grahams eye but he shook his head before she could get off her bar stool she gave him an indifferent look then turned her attention to another potential customer one budweiser ice cold jenkins said placing the bottle and a glass in front of graham he held up a hand when graham reached for his wallet its on me mike thanks graham said forcing a quick smile i was real sorry to hear about what happened to your family mike ill be over there graham cut in sharply and indicated an empty table in the corner of the room tell russell when he gets here sure jenkins replied but graham had already gone he shrugged then turned his attention to a new customer at the other end of the counter graham crossed to the table and sat down he was thirtyeight years old with a youthfully handsome face tousled auburn hair that hung untidily over the collar of his opennecked white shirt and a sturdy muscular physique which he kept in shape with a daily fivekilometre run followed by a punishing workout in his own private gymnasium he had been with un ago for two years and despite his maverick tendencies he was widely regarded by his peers as the best field operative in the organization it hadnt always been that way he was the first to admit that he had been psychologically screwedup when he joined them after eleven years with the elite american antiterrorist squad delta a state of mind that had come about as a result of his last delta mission the mission had been to penetrate a terrorist base in libya and eliminate all personnel which included salim almakesh an advisor to the black june a movement founded by abu nidal in in protest at the involvement of syria in the lebanese civil war and jeanjacques bernard a senior member of the popular front for the liberation of palestine he was about to give the order to advance when news reached him that his wife and fiveyearold son had been abducted by three masked men outside their apartment in new york the men spoke arabic v it had been an attempt to force him to withdraw he refused and although the base was destroyed almakesh and bernard managed to escape the fbi immediately launched a nationwide hunt for his family but no trace of them was ever found a month later almakesh was killed by israeli commandos at his home in damascus bernard went into hiding and was only heard of again when news reached the israeli mossad that he had been assassin ated in a carbomb attack in beirut the information had come from a reliable source and they had no reason to doubt it graham remained unconvinced it had been too easy then the previous day he received a telephone call that vindicated his years of scepticism laidlaw entered the bar looked around slowly then crossed to where graham was sitting graham could hardly believe how much laidlaw had changed since he had last seen him when they were both still with delta laidlaw had always been the units fitness fanatic pushing himself to the limit to keep his lean muscular body in shape and he had always been so meticulous about his appearance almost to the point of vanity now he was overweight with a bloated unshaven face and his unwashed brown hair fell untidily onto his hunched shoulders graham rose to his feet and shook laidlaws extended hand the grip was still firm he indicated the chair opposite and sat down again im just going to get myself a beer i wont be a moment laidlaw said indicating the counter behind him graham pushed his untouched bottle across the table have this one i dont want it laidlaw picked up the bottle then pulled out the chair and sat down youre looking well mike he said at length youre not graham replied bluntly christ russ what the hells happened to you laidlaw poured out his beer then sat back and exhaled deeply its a long story mike ill tell you about it sometime he drank a mouthful of beer then placed the glass on the table how was the flight from new york fine graham replied brusquely then sat forward his arms resting on the table have you found out any more about bernard laidlaw shook his head nothing came of the enquiries i made this morning i did see him mike hes changed though the beard and long hair have gone i had to take a long hard look at him before i was sure but it was him id stake my life on it i wouldnt be here if i didnt believe you graham replied softly so whats our next move barak graham frowned nazar barak laidlaw nodded hes the best informer deltas ever had in beirut i still see him about if anyone knows where bernard is then itll be barak why didnt you speak to him this morning laidlaw drank another mouthful of beer you try pinning him down at such short notice hell be at home tonight about nine i have that from a reliable source im just amazed hes still around i thought someone would have put a bullet in his back by now he knows too much and its all written down and stored away in some bank vault in the city youre joking graham muttered thats the story hes put around i doubt its true but its certainly worked nobodys called his bluff yet graham added laidlaw smiled wryly then drank the remainder of the beer he wiped the back of his hand across his mouth then stood up if we get to the house early we can grab him when he arrives its the only way well get to talk to him tonight graham gave jenkins a wave then followed laidlaw out into the street baraks house turned out to be a small bungalow in west beirut less than a mile away from the mar elias camp it was in darkness laidlaw drove past it and pulled up at the end of the dirt road he switched off the engine then reached into his pocket for his cigarettes and lit the third one since leaving the windorah graham climbed from the car and instinctively ducked as a mortar exploded in the distance when he straightened up he saw laidlaw looking at him across the roof of the car a faint smile on his lips you get used to it laidlaw said closing the door behind him i dont know how you can live here graham said then winced as another explosion rocked the night its become a part of me i could never leave you only see the negative side of beirut on the news back home theres a lot more to it than that laidlaw trailed off when a car suddenly came into view at the other end of the dimly lit street graham looked towards laidlaw for confirmation that it was barak laidlaw shielded his eyes against the glare of the headlights trying to distinguish the make and colour of the car a green peugeot he nodded then dropped his cigarette and ground it underfoot barak parked in front of the house and climbed out of the car locking the door behind him he was a short fat man in his early fifties with greasy black hair and thick pebble glasses the passenger door opened and an ageing prostitute got out having a party barak barak swung round then let out a deep sigh when laidlaw emerged from the shadows of an oak tree on the other side of the road you startled me mr laidlaw he said breathlessly in english and clamped his hand over his heart as if to emphasize the point what are you doing here we need to talk we can talk tomorrow barak replied then glanced lasciviously at the prostitute i am busy tonight you were busy tonight laidlaw corrected him get rid of her a look of concern crossed baraks face i have already paid her for tonight youll be reimbursed the prostitute who didnt speak english demanded to know what was happening barak managed to pacify her then turned back to laidlaw she will need money for a taxi back to the city then give it to her laidlaw said me barak replied in horror why should i pay her ive told you youll be reimbursed laidlaw snapped angrily now pay her and get her out of here barak pulled a roll of banknotes from his jacket pocket reluctantly peeled off a couple and handed them to the prostitute she snatched them from him cursed angrily at them both then strode off in search of a taxi laidlaw waited until the prostitute was out of sight then nodded to graham who had been standing by the tree baraks eyes widened in amazement as graham approached them he looked at laidlaw searching for an answer laidlaw said nothing still as tight as ever barak graham said indicating the notes in baraks hand barak instinctively stuffed them back into his pocket then rubbed his hands together nervously what are you doing back in beirut mr graham lets go inside graham said gesturing towards the house barak led them up a narrow concrete path to the unpainted door and opened it he beckoned them inside and immediately closed the door behind him he showed them into the lounge and drew the threadbare curtains before switching on the light the room was unpainted and the only furniture consisted of a lime green sofa two wooden chairs and a threelegged coffee table which was propped up against the wall to prevent it from toppling over this is very irregular barak said at length i never do business at my house you know that mr laidlaw why did you come here if anyone saw you nobody saw us graham snapped baraks eyes shifted from laidlaw to graham why are you here bernard barak scratched his stubbled chin then sat on the edge of the sofa jeanjacques bernard yeah but he is dead he died i saw him outside the american university hospital yesterday morning laidlaw cut in quickly hes changed his appearance but it was bernard you must have been mistaken barak replied shaking his head bernard is dead if russell says he saw bernard yesterday then thats good enough for me graham said sharply barak removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes wearily i knew bernard well do you not think i would know if he was still alive especially if he was living here in beirut i didnt say he was living here laidlaw replied he could be here on business but it was bernard graham took an envelope from his pocket and tossed it onto the sofa theres fivethousand dollars there in cash find bernard and ill double it barak opened the envelope and fanned the banknotes with his finger he looked across at graham why do you want bernard so badly that doesnt concern you find him and youll get the rest of the money where are you staying barak asked graham you call me if you find out anything laidlaw said any time day or night barak nodded then pushed the envelope into his pocket i still say you are wasting your time bernard is dead for his sake i hope youre right graham said softly then followed laidlaw down the hallway and out into the night barak waited until laidlaw and graham had driven off then got into his own car and drove straight to a white spanishstyled mansion on the outskirts of the city overlooking the sea he drew up in front of a pair of wroughtiron gates where he was immediately challenged by a bearded man wearing jeans and a faded black tshirt a kalashnikov ak was slung over his shoulder i must see mr devereux right away barak announced through the open drivers window the guard eyed him contemptuously is mr devereux expecting you no but its urgent the guard glanced in the direction of the house mr devereux gave specific instructions not to be disturbed tell him its barak i know who you are the guard said with obvious disdain come back in the morning maybe then mr devereux will see you i must see him now barak retorted the guard unslung the kalashnikov i told you mr devereux isnt to be disturbed tonight barak glared at the guard mr devereuxs life is in danger if anything happens to him then ill see to it that youre held personally responsible the guard wavered what danger til tell that to mr devereux when i get to see him the guard turned away from the car and spoke softly into a twoway radio a minute later the gates were activated from somewhere inside the grounds the guard peered through the window at barak follow the road to the courtyard someone will be waiting there to meet you barak put the peugeot into gear and drove the hundred yards to the courtyard he pulled up in front of the stone steps and got out of the car another guard frisked him expertly then led him up the steps into the house barak looked around the spacious hallway in awe the threetier czechoslovakian crystal chandelier was the only reminder of its once resplendent grandeur he could imagine that the walls had once been lined with an array of expensive paintings or tapestries and the wooden floorboards covered with elegant sculpted carpeting the house once belonged to a turkish prince when the lebanon was still a part of the ottoman empire a man said tying the belt of his white dressinggown as he descended the stairs he was a tall handsome man in his late thirties with short black hair which was already beginning to grey at the temples and a neatly trimmed black moustache a faint scar ran the length of his left cheek he reached the foot of the stairs and looked around him slowly some would call it beautiful he said still speaking arabic all i see is decadence im sorry to disturb you like this mr devereux the man held up a hand to silence barak then turned to the guard beside him and dismissed him with a curt nod of the head he waited until he had left then ushered barak into a small study i told you never to come here i had no choice barak replied defensively i had to speak to you in person what is it barak shifted uneasily on his feet youve been recognized mr bernard bernard dug his hands into the pockets of his dressinggown and moved to the window where he stared across the lawn at the empty swimming pool he finally turned back to barak who recognized me an american russell laidlaw bernard pondered the name then shook his head i dont know him who is he a journalist barak shook his head he used to be with delta he lives here now but hes not your problem there was another man with him mike graham he offered me tenthousand dollars to find you for him this has got something to do with the murder of his family hasnt it were you involved bernard ignored the questions wheres he staying he didnt say im to contact laidlaw if i come up with anything bernard took a cigarette from the pack on the table and lit it he exhaled thoughtfully then sat in the armchair in the corner of the room tell graham youve made some enquiries and that youve come up with something arrange to meet him at your house later tonight my house barak stammered i dont want to get involved youre already involved bernard cut in sharply he smiled coldly dont worry i wont kill graham there i cant have the police finding any clues at your house you dont have the guile to talk your way out of it barak knew it would be futile to argue what time he asked with a resigned sigh midnight that gives me plenty of time to make the necessary arrangements but dont call him until eleven thirty that way it will look as if youve been asking around about me barak rubbed his hands together nervously what about the extra fivethousand dollars graham would have paid me bernard stubbed out the cigarette and got to his feet everything you do has to have a price doesnt it barak stepped backwards his eyes flickering between bernard and the floor i have to make a living you make more money than most people in this town bernard snapped barak swallowed nervously i think i should go now we can discuss the money another time bernard grabbed the front of baraks shirt and slammed him up against the wall youre paid a retainer every month to keep me informed on developments in and around beirut i dont know how you negotiate your other deals nor do i want to but you can be sure youre not going to get another cent out of me is that understood barak nodded his head vigorously and bernard let go of his shirt barak dabbed his face with a dirty handkerchief his eyes wide with fear and dont even think about trying to doublecross me you know what hezbollah would do to you if anything were to happen to me i would never doublecross you mr bernard devereux bernard snapped angrily how many times must i tell you jeanjacques bernard is dead im now alain devereux im sorry mr devereux its just force of habit bernard gestured towards the door get out barak left the room leaving the door ajar in his haste to get out of the house bernard took another cigarette from the packet and lit it he had always known that graham would find him again one day it had been inevitable but now he had the advantage and he intended to use it i still say i should go in with you laidlaw urged after he had parked the car outside baraks house graham shook his head weve been through this already barak gave specific instructions that i was to go in alone ive got to play by his rules hes my only chance of finding bernard it could be a trap dont you think thats crossed my mind its a chance ive got to take laidlaw sighed deeply then nodded o k but if you havent shown your face at the window in the first couple of minutes im coming in after you deal graham replied and got out of the car laidlaw watched graham until he had disappeared into the house then touched his bolstered pzzo automatic as if to reassure himself not that he would zo use it he couldnt not since that fateful mission in honduras he had tried several times at a local shooting range but he couldnt bring himself to pull the trigger he knew it was psychological it was why he had been forced to retire from delta but he couldnt tell graham how could he graham was depending on him he wiped the sweat from his forehead willing graham to appear at the window where the hell was he the gunshot came from inside the house then silence laidlaw banged the steering wheel angrily with his fist it had been a trap why hadnt graham listened to him he pushed open the door and scrambled out of the car careful to keep out of sight of the house he pulled the automatic from his holster but stopped short of curling his finger around the trigger sweating he peered round the side of the car at the house it was in darkness just as it had been when they had been there earlier that evening he would have to go round to the back he ran doubledover to the adjoining house it too was in darkness but that was to be expected staying alive in beirut depended on ignoring trouble he vaulted over the gate and hurried up the narrow driveway an overgrown hedge divided the two properties he found a hole in it and squeezed his way through baraks back door was barely ten yards away from where he was crouched he wiped the sweat from his eyes and looked down at the automatic in his hand but he still couldnt bring himself to touch the trigger he cursed himself angrily what happened if the gunman was still in the house could he defend himself he was breathing heavily zi but it had nothing to do with the run he had made from the car it was fear delta had taught him that fear was all in the mind it could be overcome but that was when he could still pull a trigger he swallowed hard and ran to the back door pressing himself against the wall beside it he bit his lip as he tried to thread his finger through the trigger guard it was almost as if an invisible hand were pressing his finger against the barrel he couldnt do it he gritted his teeth and tested the handle the door was unlocked he kicked it open and dived into the small kitchen rolling to the safety of the old battered fridge he remained there for a few seconds then slowly got to his feet and moved to the door leading into the hallway again he pressed himself against the wall and peered cautiously into the hall at first he couldnt see anything in the semidarkness but as his eyes grew accustomed to it he could make out a hand protruding from the open lounge doorway he was about to swivel round into the hall when he heard the sound of a car starting up outside the house he recognized the sound of the engine straight away it was baraks peugeot he ducked into the first door down the hall it turned out to be a bedroom hurrying to the window he peered through a tear in the curtains just in time to see the peugeot drive off heading towards the city there was only one person inside but he couldnt make out who it was it could have been barak or the killer unless barak was the killer he doubted that barak hated violence especially if it involved guns he made his way carefully down the hall until he reached the lounge pressing himself against the wall he looked down at the body it was barak he was lying face down blood seeping from the bullet hole in his back laidlaw checked for a pulse he was dead laidlaw stared at the body there had only been one shot so where was graham he stood up slowly and entered the lounge it was empty he quickly checked the remaining rooms they too were empty he called out grahams name but there was no reply graham had gone and barak was dead it only left one possible explanation graham had been in the peugeot he had killed barak laidlaw couldnt believe it why then a sudden thought flashed through his mind what was it graham had said back at the windorah about barak for a moment he couldnt remember his exact words then they came to him i thought someone would have put a bullet in his back by now laidlaw didnt care that barak was dead what did bother him was that graham used him to get at barak that hurt especially after all they had been through together he looked down at baraks body again one of the neighbours was sure to have made an anonymous call to the police reporting the gunshot and it would only be a matter of time before they came to investigate he left the way he had come he couldnt get involved there would be too much explaining to do two new york was swathed in sunlight temperatures were in the high seventies and with the absence of any wind it felt sticky and humid on the twentysecond floor of the united nations building overlooking the east river malcolm philpott was also feeling the heat a fiftysixyearold scot with gaunt features and fine wavy hair he had been un ago director since its inception in he reached for his handkerchief and dabbed his forehead again a cold clammy sweat that only seemed to have surfaced in the last half an hour was he going down with an infection he wouldnt have been surprised he was a workaholic and he knew his body was run down and in need of rest but how could he rest with so much activity going on at un ago headquarters especially now with mike grahams maverick action in beirut he pushed his handkerchief back into his pocket and looked across at his deputy sergei kolchinsky a russian in his early fifties who had become an invaluable member of the team since joining un ago from the kgb four years earlier he had a brilliant tactical mind and had helped to crack some of un a cos toughest assignments in the past neither man had spoken for the last few minutes both were smoking philpott his pipe and kolchinsky a cigarette three unopened files lay on philpotts desk each had a name typed on its cover mike graham cw whitlock and sabrina carver they made up one of the ten elite strike force teams all top field operatives who had been siphoned off from police military and intelligence services around the world they were able to request anything they wanted from their administrative colleagues which they felt could aid them on any given mission those requests used to have to go through either philpott or kolchinsky but they had recently decided to waive the routine and allow the field operatives a free hand now both men regretted ever having made the decision they had discovered that graham had drawn three false passports in the names of michael green miles grant and mark gordon and used one of them to fly to beirut he had managed to get a beretta from a contact in beirut which was now in the hands of the local police it had his fingerprints on it it had been fired once the bullet which had killed barak and now graham was missing he was a wanted man in the lebanon and unaco couldnt do anything publicly without endangering their own clandestine existence that meant graham was on his own certainly for the time being malcolm are you feeling alright kolchinsky asked breaking the silence youre looking very pale im fine philpott replied tersely then reached for his cane and got to his feet he moved to the window walking with a pronounced limp on his left leg the result of a shrapnel wound in the last days of the korean war he turned back to kolchinsky his eyes blazing i cant believe he could have been that stupid weve made plenty of enemies over the years even politicians here at the un and this will provide them with the perfect ammunition for them to shoot un ago down in flames weve got to find him before the lebanese authorities do if he goes on trial we may as well all start looking for other jobs un ago will be crucified kolchinsky gave a resigned nod what do you suggest weve got to bring cw and sabrina in on the case as quickly as possible but we cant do anything until ive spoken to langley what have the cia to do with this kolchinsky asked with a frown im as much in the dark as you are sergei i got a call from their deputy director robert bailey this morning he wouldnt go into details over the phone but he said it had something to do with bernard hes coming over later this morning to see me do you want me to see to cw and sabrina yes put them on a code red standby i want them here by two at the latest philpott stopped abruptly as a crushing pain seared through his chest radiating out to his neck jaw and arms his cane fell from his grasp and he sagged forward against the wall kolchinsky leaped from his chair and grabbed philpott before he could fall to the floor philpott clutched his chest in agony it felt as if it were going to burst the pain was unbearable his eyes watered as the pain increased he tried to speak but he couldnt get the words out he thought he was about to die at that moment he would have welcomed it an escape from the agony burning through his chest kolchinsky lowered him carefully to the floor then flicked on the intercom switch on the desk sarah call an ambulance and hurry the colonels had a heart attack he switched off the intercom before she could reply and hurried back to where philpott lay he remembered his firstaid training with the kgb always keep the sufferer as warm and calm as possible he took off his jacket and placed it over philpotts chest youre going to be alright malcolm sarahs calling for an ambulance the pain had subsided to a tightness of the chest he suddenly felt cold but he could also feel the sweat running down the sides of his face he had known right away what had happened his mother had suffered two heart attacks before the third one had killed her he knew the symptoms a coronary thrombosis the doctor had called it it was strange he felt perfectly lucid yet he couldnt speak the words wouldnt reach his lips kolchinsky noticed philpott trying to speak and squeezed his arm reassuringly dont try and say anything malcolm youre going to be alright the door slid open and sarah thomas philpotts secretary hurried across to where kolchinsky was crouched the ambulance is on its way it should be here in about ten minutes have you told security its on its way she nodded can i do anything to help she whispered kolchinsky shook his head the worsts over hes going to be alright dont worry he turned towards her get hold of sabrina and cw tell them i want them here by two this afternoon sarah returned to the outer office her hands were shaking when she picked up the receiver and dialled the number of sabrinas flat sabrina wasnt in her flat she was taking in the boutiques on fifth avenue it was her secondfavourite pastime her favourite was listening to jazz either live at one of her regular haunts alis alley or the village vanguard or sitting at home with the headphones on listening to the likes of david sanborn or the yellowjackets sanborn was her idol and she tried to get to as many of his live gigs as possible when he was playing in new york jazz had become a way of life for her she was dressed casually in a pair of faded levi jeans brown ankle boots and a baggy white tshirt her shoulderlength blond hair was hidden underneath a new york yankees baseball cap a present from mike graham she was a stunning twentyeightyearold with a near perfect figure which she kept in shape with regular aerobics classes and she had a friendly outgoing disposition she had given up counting the number of marriage proposals she had turned down over the years her independence was too important to her moreover any serious relationship could well jeopardize her position with un a co as far as her friends were concerned she was a translator at the united nations none of them knew that she had been with the fbi for two years where she had specialized in the use of firearms before joining un ago three years ago she was still the only female field operative in the organization but her gutsy determination and selfconfidence had won over her male colleagues who now regarded her as an equal she could think of no greater compliment she paused in front of barnes and noble and pretended to look at the book display in the window she was sure she was being followed not that she had seen anyone it was just an instinct that came with the job she waited a few moments then turned into east th street still pretending to look in the shop windows as she walked she didnt increase her pace it would only alert her pursuer but who was it she was more than capable of defending herself if the need arose but what if her pursuer was someone who had recognized her from a previous un a c o assignment someone out to blow her cover that did frighten her she stopped again this time in the doorway of a delicatessen and reached into her bag for her sunglasses she slid them on now she could use the shop windows to look behind her without arousing any suspicions a movement caught her eye as she stepped back out onto the pavement but before she could react a black youth shot past her on rollerskates snatching the bag out of her hand he dodged between the startled shoppers none of whom made any attempt to stop him she immediately sprinted after him he glanced over his shoulder and grinned at her knowing she couldnt catch up with him but when he looked round he found himself heading straight for a display of fresh produce outside a delicatessen he swerved sharply to the left but his leg hit the edge of the wooden stand and he fell heavily to the ground spilling an assortment of fruit across the pavement he scrambled to his feet and looked round nervously at sabrina who was closing in fast on him he set off again his face now twisted in pain and flung the bag to an accomplice in an alley twenty yards further on sabrina ignored the fleeing youth on the rollerskates and went in pursuit of his accomplice she followed him through a network of alleyways until he mistakenly darted into a culdesac he realized his mistake too late and when he turned back to the entrance sabrina was already there blocking his escape she was breathing heavily her hands on her hips she met the youths eyes he was a puerto rican no older than twenty with long greasy black hair and a red headband he pulled a switchblade from his pocket and opened it inches from his leg you want some he asked the switchblade extended menacingly towards her i dont want any trouble she said calmly then held out her hand towards him give me the bag and that will be the end of it the youth laughed then spat on the ground you want the bag you come and get it sabrina shrugged and moved towards the youth he dropped the bag then tightening his grip on the switchblade he waited until she was in range before lunging at her the blade slashing the air inches from her face pity to cut such a pretty face but shed asked for it he grinned as he came at her again she waited until he stabbed at her then using her left forearm to block his wrist she followed up by slamming the heel of her right hand against his chin and kneeing him in the groin he cried out in agony and stumbled back against the wall the switchblade fell from his hand as he sagged to the ground whimpering softly his hands clutched between his legs she picked up the bag checked inside to see that everything was still there and was about to confiscate the switchblade when she heard the sound of a police siren in the distance she couldnt be involved in a police investigation the way in which she had dispatched her attacker would certainly make news she ducked into the adjoining alley the siren was getting closer she ran to the end of the alley and was about to scale the tenfoot wire fence when the bleeper attached to her belt suddenly shrilled into life it was un ago headquarters of all the times for them to call she thought irritably she switched it off then clambered over the fence landing nimbly on her toes and walked down another alley which brought her out onto madison avenue she called headquarters from a phone booth spoke briefly to sarah then hurried to the curb to signal a taxi to take her back to her flat afternoon francois the maitre dhotel looked up from his reservation book and smiled warmly ah good afternoon mr whitlock you are looking well i am thank you has my wife arrived yet not yet franqois replied til be in the bar tell her when she arrives of course came the cordial reply whitlock had been going to le chantilly restaurant on east th street since he had first arrived in new york in it was where he had taken a vivacious puerto rican paediatrician carmen rodriguez on their first date a year later to the day he had proposed to her at the same table they had been married now for seven years he hoisted himself onto one of the bar stools and nodded in greeting to the barman who was busy serving another customer the barman smiled back and told whitlock he would be with him shortly whitlock was a fortyfouryearold kenyan with sharp angular features softened by the neatly trimmed black moustache he had worn since leaving university in his early twenties he was photophobic and always wore a pair of tinted glasses to protect his eyes he had been educated in england and after graduating from oxford had returned to kenya where he served with the intelligence corps for ten years before being recruited to un ago as one of its first field operatives he was now the only survivor of the original team what can i get you to drink mr whitlock the barman asked leaning his hands on the counter in front of whitlock the usual rick whitlock replied the barman nodded took a bottle of beer from the fridge and opened it he poured the beer into a glass and placed it on a coaster in front of whitlock how are things in the world of politics mr whitlock he asked referring to whitlocks cover as a member of the kenyan embassy at the united nations carmen was the only person outside un ago who knew about the deception the usual rick the barman sensing whitlock wasnt in a talkative mood left him alone whitlock took a sip of beer then glanced over his shoulder at the entrance still no sign of carmen he turned the glass slowly on the coaster as he thought about her their marriage had nearly ended a few months back well that was when it had all come to a head but it had been simmering for a couple of years before that it all stemmed from her desire for him to leave un a co she was frightened for his safety but he had been adamant he was staying she had finally walked out on him and it had only been the intervention of philpott that had brought them back together again he had told them that whitlock would be promoted to deputy director when he retired at the end of the year kolchinsky would take over as director then after a year kolchinsky would step down and whitlock would take his place other than the four of them and the secretarygeneral tire only other person who knew about it was jacques rust head of un ago european operation based in zurich carmen had then thrown her full support behind him knowing he would be out of the field by the end of the year whitlock knew he would miss working in the field especially with mike and sabrina but he also knew it would be a small price to pay to keep his marriage intact and that meant everything to him cw whitlock looked round sharply startled by the voice behind him he grinned ruefully at his wife then kissed her lightly on the lips how long have you been standing there a few seconds she replied allowing him to help her onto the adjacent bar stool im sorry i was miles away so i noticed she ordered a spritzer then turned back to him her face solemn ive got some bad news rosie was arrested last night whitlock stared at her in horror rosie was the teenage daughter of carmens sister rachel and her german husband eddie kruger the barman placed the spritzer in front of her she waited until he was out of earshot before continuing she was caught buying drugs in times square i dont know what it was rachel didnt say whitlock sighed deeply and shook his head sadly i suppose i shouldnt be that surprised and what exactly is that supposed to mean she demanded come off it carmen you know damn well what im talking about theyve hardly been the best parents in the world have they rachel had that affair with her boss and eddies drinking has been getting steadily worse these last couple of years she had that affair as an escape from eddies drinking carmen cut in quickly thats irrelevant look at it from rosies perspective cant you see this is her way of escaping from them will you talk to her he shook his head no its up to eddie and rachel to talk to her rachel asked if you would wheres eddie he went to an allnight poker game last night she hasnt seen him since some father whitlock muttered talk to her cw youre the only person shes ever listened to in the past im not using un ago to pull any strings carmen lets get that straight right from the start just talk to her she replied softly please o k he replied at length where is she at home rachel put up the bail the bleeper clipped to whitlocks belt suddenly activated and he was quick to silence it he shot carmen a despairing look this is all i need right now i have to answer it carmen i know she replied and squeezed his hand gently i will talk to her i promise you but when i dont know it all depends on whats come up he said patting the bleeper would you like to use this phone mr whitlock the barman asked having heard the bleeper from the other side of the bar no but thanks anyway rick whitlock replied then turned back to carmen ive suddenly lost my appetite i lost mine when i heard about rosie carmen replied come on then lets go sarah thomas had been philpotts secretary for the last five years her sparsely furnished office on the twentysecond floor of the united nations building was an antechamber to the unaco headquarters the wall opposite the door constructed of rows of teak slats contained two seamless sliding doors invisible to the naked eye which could only be activated by miniature sonic transmitters the door to the right led into the unaco command centre a soundproofed room where teams of analysts worked around the clock to monitor the fluctuating developments in world affairs the door to the left led into philpotts private office kolchinsky sat behind philpotts desk his eyes riveted on whitlock and sabrina he had just broken the news to them about philpott will he be alright sabrina asked anxiously breaking the sudden silence i spoke to the doctor before i left the hospital hes optimistic that the colonel will make a complete recovery theyre keeping him in hospital for another few days to carry out more tests unless he discharges himself first whitlock said and eyed kolchinsky knowingly hell want to be back at work as soon as possible you know the colonel w ive already been in touch with the secretarygeneral hes going to see the colonel tonight to tell him to take a months leave after hes been discharged from hospital i wish him luck whitlock said you know just how stubborn the colonel can be when he wants to get his own way i dont think hell put up much resistance this time kolchinsky replied then paused to light a cigarette hes been overworking and he knows it the next attack could be fatal they lapsed into silence again whitlock got to his feet and crossed to the dispenser against the wall coffee anyone they both shook their heads wheres mike whitlock asked pouring himself a coffee thats a good question kolchinsky replied gruffly the last i heard was that hes on the run from the authorities in beirut what sabrina asked in astonishment beirut whitlock said pausing in front of the desk to look down at kolchinsky is he on assignment no he is not kolchinsky boomed angrily stressing each word in turn hes gone after bernard jeanjacques bernard sabrina said her eyes flickering between kolchinsky and whitlock hes dead isnt he sit down cw kolchinsky said waving towards the black leather sofa where sabrina was sitting ill tell you what i know so far and believe me it isnt much kolchinsky waited until whitlock was seated before opening the file on the desk in front of him and outlining the sketchy details philpott had received from their unaco contact in beirut earlier that morning mike would never have shot this barak in the back sabrina said once kolchinsky had finished thats coldblooded murder hes been set up spare the lecture sabrina kolchinsky cut in sharply he placed the cigarette on the edge of the ashtray before looking at her again look i hear what youre saying and if its any consolation i dont think he shot barak either but we cant be sure until we find him and we have to find him quickly what if the person who murdered barak killed mike as well whitlock said and immediately noticed the look of horror on sabrinas face he turned to her its a possibility we have to face why set michael up to take the rap then kill him if the killer wanted michael dead why not shoot him at baraks house kolchinsky shook his head no if michael was set up then its obvious the killer wants him alive what about laidlaw sabrina asked have any of our people contacted him we cant risk it kolchinsky replied the police know he met michael last night they dont have any evidence linking him to the murder but you can be sure theyll be watching his every move thats where you come in how youre going over there as michaels girlfriend and its imperative that you play it all above board contact the police once you arrive to let them know youre looking for him that way youll be able to see laidlaw without arousing their suspicions im not saying youll find out anything but you have to start somewhere where do i come in whitlock asked youll find out soon enough kolchinsky replied then pressed the intercom button on the desk sarah ask mr bailey to come through kolchinsky used a miniature transmitter to activate the door moments later sarah appeared followed by a man in a pale grey suit he was in his early fifties with wavy black hair and a craggy face which was scarred around the cheeks and mouth from teenage acne he smiled quickly at sarah when she withdrew and closed the door behind her kolchinsky came round from behind the desk and the two men shook hands he introduced whitlock and sabrina to bailey who then sat down on the second black leather sofa and took a cigar from his pocket he unwrapped the cellophane then looked across at kolchinsky i was shocked to hear about colonel philpott how is he hes expected to make a full recovery kolchinsky replied that is good news please send him my regards when you next see him we may not have always seen eye to eye in the past but i have great respect for him nevertheless bailey lit the cigar and exhaled the smoke towards the ceiling have you had a chance to look through the dossier i sent you this morning ive read it kolchinsky said unable to keep the disdain from his voice and have you briefed your operatives bailey asked indicating whitlock and sabrina on the adjacent sofa theyve only just got here weve been talking about the events in beirut thats understandable bailey said with the hint of a smile its quite a mess hes got you into isnt it you let us worry about that mr bailey kolchinsky replied icily til let you explain the gist of the dossier to cw and sabrina after all it is your dirty work bailey got to his feet and moved to the window he puffed thoughtfully on the cigar then turned back to face whitlock and sabrina what im about to tell you can never be repeated outside these four walls its one of the cias most closely guarded secrets and i intend to keep it that way any indiscretion on your part there will be no indiscretion on their part kolchinsky cut in angrily his eyes blazing bailey shrugged not altogether convinced by kolchinskys outburst but he let it pass it would never have needed to come out if graham hadnt rushed off to beirut to find bernard he paused to draw on the cigar still loath to reveal what he had come to say when he spoke it was in a barely audible voice as if he feared that his words would carry beyond the four walls jeanjacques bernard works for me bernards cia whitlock said in astonishment bailey nodded was he working for you when mikes family were kidnapped sabrina demanded yes bailey answered then held up his hand to silence sabrina before she could speak again but the kidnapping had nothing to do with him it was carried out on the orders of salim almakesh to give himself time to flee the terrorist base before delta destroyed it and now almakesh is dead how convenient you can drop the sarcasm sabrina kolchinsky said sharply pointing a finger of warning at her she opened her mouth to speak thought better of it then slumped back angrily on the sofa and folded her arms across her chest why was mike never told about this whitlock asked his eyes riveted on bailey hes been through hell these past two years trying to come to terms with the loss of his family had he known the truth it might have made his loss that bit more bearable bernard told us what happened and as he and almakesh were the only two survivors of the attack we couldnt say anything without endangering his cover you bastard sabrina snarled bailey inhaled sharply and glanced at kolchinsky fully expecting him to reprimand her again kolchinsky said nothing what did happen to them whitlock asked breaking the tense silence i dont know the details bailey replied with a shrug but i do know they were killed in retaliation for the attack on the base camp thats all bernard could find out from almakesh whitlock bit his lip pensively then looked across at kolchinsky when i asked you earlier where i fitted into the assignment you said that id find out soon enough theres more to this than just finding mike before he gets to bernard isnt there yes kolchinsky replied bluntly then took another cigarette from the packet on the desk and lit it he indicated towards bailey ill let you explain very well bailey said have either of you ever heard of zimbala sure whitlock answered its a small country in central africa borders chad and niger youre unusually well informed bailey said with thinly veiled sarcasm i am african whitlock rejoined born in kenya but educated in england thats where i learned about zimbala then youll also know that zimbala has been a oneparty state since it was granted independence by the french fortyfive years ago a dictatorship run by alphonse mobuto sabrina said until his death last month bailey said that i didnt know whitlock said me neither sabrina added its hardly surprising his death received very limited coverage outside zimbala whos running the country now whitlock asked his eldest son jamel hes due to arrive in new york tonight for an official threeday visit so where does bernard fit into this sabrina asked exasperatedly im coming to that its jamel mobutos intention to bring democracy to zimbala thats caused a lot of resentment within certain sections of the country especially amongst the rich who would stand to lose a great deal if mobuto has his way a team of four assassins made up from the now disbanded security police have vowed to kill mobuto while hes here in america its a threat weve taken very seriously i told bernard to infiltrate the team so that he can keep us posted on their movements he approached them with an offer to train them naturally they accepted knowing how invaluable his expertise would be to them they now trust him implicitly hell tip us off when he knows where and when the hit is due to take place so that it can be stopped in time thats why graham has to be found if he gets to bernard before we know the details of the hit itll leave us totally in the dark and if mobuto was killed on american soil it would prove a severe embarrassment not only to us but to the president as well after all its not as if we havent been forewarned and im to babysit mobuto whitlock concluded bailey nodded youll work with two of my men hes bringing halfadozen bodyguards with him but theyre all amateurs made up of officers from the zimbalan army if anything does happen itll be up to the three of you to deal with it youll be in charge kolchinsky said looking at whitlock the three of them will be in charge bailey corrected him cw will be in overall charge kolchinsky re torted its important to have one leader ive read the files on your men they may be the best bullet catchers youve got but they dont have cws experience and if you want to take the matter further i suggest you call the president the secretarygeneral spoke to him earlier today and he agreed that cw should be in charge til tell my men bailey said tersely til be in touch so that we can arrange for cw to meet your men before mobuto arrives tonight kolchinsky said then picked up the transmitter on the desk and activated the door bailey left the room and kolchinsky closed the door behind him what a slimeball sabrina said staring at the closed door kolchinsky smiled he could have been sitting here instead of me what do you mean she asked you never knew my predecessor gronskin did you she shook her head he was before my time well when he was deported back to russia for spying the cia suggested bailey as a possible replacement to take over as the colonels number two the kgb put my name forward the secretarygeneral initially wanted bailey which i suppose was understandable under the circumstances but the colonel threatened to resign if bailey got the job as bailey said the two of them never saw eye to eye it would have been catastrophic if bailey had come here so i got the job instead i never knew that whitlock said im sure glad the colonel put his foot down sabrina said glancing at the door again whitlock stood up and dug his hands into his pockets he crossed to the far wall then turned to look at kolchinsky i was at university with jamel mobuto why didnt you say something when bailey was here because we didnt get on whitlock replied why not kolchinsky asked whitlock sighed deeply then returned to the sofa and sat down hed never set foot outside zimbala before he came to oxford it must have been a bit of a culture shock for him but instead of trying to adapt to the british way of life he rebelled against it and reverted to his african heritage he wore african clothes his room was an african shrine and he made no attempt to befriend any of the british students he became a pariah although he did have an avid following amongst some of the more radical leftwing students who regarded him as something of a guru was he a communist kolchinsky asked no strangely enough he was just very proafrican and africas particular way of life he had a younger brother who went to oxford as well and he did become a communist but that was after id gone i dont know anything about him his names remy kolchinsky said and tapped the dossier on the desk its all in here youll both get copies of it you still havent said why you and mobuto didnt get on sabrina said i was born in kenya but educated in england to him i was little more than a traitor id sold out my race and lets face it i am more british than i am kenyan thats what he couldnt accept so we just kept out of each others way why did he stay if he hated it so much sabrina asked because his father had sent him if hed gone back to zimbala it would have brought disgrace on the family africans take failure far more seriously than you do here in the west whitlock dismissed the subject with a curt flick of his hand anyway that was a long time ago i certainly dont hold any grudges now lets hope mobuto feels the same way kolchinsky said does he know im going to be babysitting him when he gets to new york kolchinsky nodded baileys already briefed him on the telephone but he wont know youre in charge of the operation until he gets here youll have to break that to him yourself i look forward to it whitlock said with a faint smile kolchinsky handed them each a dossier which contained details of their particular assignment and in sabrinas case an airline ticket maps of beirut written confirmation of her hotel booking the name of her contact and a sum of money in lebanese pounds she glanced at her watch and immediately got to her feet my flight leaves at four thirty this afternoon she said id better get going send the colonel my best wishes when you see him again sergei i will kolchinsky replied and activated the door for her and sabrina she paused in the doorway to look round at him bring michael back before he gets himself into any more trouble she nodded grimly then left the room kolchinsky closed the door again the colonel might not be coming back the secretarygenerals waiting for the doctors report before coming to a decision he was due to retire at the end of the year anyway perhaps its for the best if he did take an early retirement try telling that to the colonel its not as if hes taking voluntary retirement its been forced on him by his doctor so you can be sure hell want to see out his time here if only to prove a point to his doctor and possibly kill himself in the process kolchinsky reached for his cigarettes and lit one thats why the secretarygenerals delaying his decision hell give the colonel every chance to prove that hes fit enough to return to work and if not ill leave strike force three and join you here you dont sound very enthusiastic about it kolchinsky said im not stuck behind a desk all day isnt my idea of fun sergei whitlock picked up the dossier let me out will you the colonel said you were over the moon when he broke the news to you how did you expect me to react carmen was there whitlock walked to the door and looked back at kolchinsky dont worry i wont let anyone down especially not her three remy mobuto had always lived in his brothers shadow he had known from an early age that jamel as the older brother would take over as leader of zimbala once their father died that had never bothered him he had never had any aspirations to enter politics when he followed jamel to oxford he immediately joined the communist party more as an act of rebellion than anything else his fathers response was not only to stop sending him money but also to bar him from returning to zimbala until he renounced his socialist beliefs he refused to comply and left oxford after the first year to join the guardian where he remained for seven years before taking up a post as an investigative journalist with a leftwing french newspaper by then he had become an outspoken critic of the numerous dictators in africa especially his father his father disowned him publicly and said he would never be allowed back to zimbala in his lifetime he returned for his fathers funeral the first time hed been back to zimbala in seventeen years and jamel was able to persuade him to stay on as the new editor of the countrys leading daily newspaper la voix remy had only been in charge for a month and already he had a major scoop on his hands it concerned the plot to overthrow his brother and form a new dictatorship but he had discovered another side to the story a sinister angle that would make international headlines if it were ever made public but before he could do that or tell jamel he needed proof to back up those allegations and he was about to get it he drove down the main street of habane the capital of zimbala and turned into the basement carpark where he had arranged to meet his informant there were only a couple of cars there at that time of the evening he glanced at his watch eight fiftyseven he had told his informant to meet him at nine oclock he pulled into the prearranged space climbed out of the car then took a pack of cigarettes from his jacket pocket and lit one he looked around him slowly the silence was eerie he took a long drag on the cigarette and looked at his watch again eight fiftyeight he cursed his anxiety there was no reason for it but still the uncertainty lingered he looked round again this time taking more notice of his surroundings then he saw it his informants car a blue fiat it was parked next to the wall and almost hidden from view by the red studebaker beside it he exhaled sharply and managed a faint smile typical of his informant to take such precautions he ground his cigarette underfoot and walked slowly towards the fiat he could see his informant behind the wheel why hadnt he shown himself mobuto dismissed the question at least he was there he reached the fiat and leaned over to peer through the drivers window the mans throat had been cut from ear to ear soaking his shirt and trousers in blood mobuto recoiled in horror stumbling back painfully into the studebakers wing mirror he felt his stomach heave and he retched against the wall he remained doubled over for several seconds before slowly straightening up and wiping the sweat from his forehead then he heard a sound behind him he turned his eyes wide with fear two men stood behind the studebaker both were dressed in blue overalls one had blood on his sleeve the killer he was about to speak when he noticed a movement out of the corner of his eye he was still turning when the cosh struck him behind the ear then nothing zimbalas main prison la tambier was less than ten minutes drive from the centre of habane it took its name from the district in which it was located it had been built when alphonse mobuto first came to power and quickly became known throughout the country as la boucherie the butchers shop because of the number of antigovernment dissidents who were tortured then murdered there by the feared and hated security police jamel mobutos first two decrees on taking office had been to free all political prisoners being held there and the immediate dismantling of the security police now ironically its most notorious prisoner was le boucher tito ngune the head of the security police for the last twentythree years there had been cries for his public execution but jamel mobuto had made it quite clear that ngune would be tried and if found guilty sentenced to life imprisonment he refused to continue the legacy of executions which had been symptomatic of his fathers regime ngune lay on the single mattress in the corner of his cell he was a stocky fiftyeightyearold with grey hair and a small goatee beard which looked as if it had been stuck on to his chin with glue his face and body were a mass of bruises after he had been attacked at his home by a fortystrong mob who were preparing to lynch him in the remains of his once beautiful garden when the military had arrived and bundled him into the back of a police van and brought him to la tambier he sat up gingerly and looked slowly around the cell all those years of unswerving loyalty to alphonse mobuto and this was all it had brought him mobuto had always had one weakness his family although he publicly renounced remy and repealed the law making jamel his natural successor he had always refused to allow ngunes men to touch them but unknown to mobuto ngune had tried on three different occasions to have jamel killed each attempt had ended in failure he certainly had guts ngune had to give him that anyone else who had dared to criticize either mobuto or his government was immediately arrested and taken to la tambier or to the now abandoned branco prison in kondese the secondlargest city situated in the south of the country none of them ever left a jackhammer started up somewhere beyond the prison walls it had become a familiar sound over the last couple of days at first it had been an irritation but now he had grown strangely accustomed to it a break from the monotonous silence that filled the prison he had wondered what they were doing out there digging up the road or tearing down part of the prison it was certainly feasible under jamel mobutos new liberal leadership not that it mattered it was all academic to him now but it still interested him if only to put his mind at rest he reminded himself to ask one of the guards when they brought him his next meal michael sibele had known for the last two days why the gang of workmen was busy outside the main gates repairing a burst mains pipe he had been the guard on duty at the gate for the last week it was his last day tomorrow he would return to his duties inside the prison with mixed feelings he had enjoyed the workmens company but he would also be grateful to get away from the noise of the machines especially the incessant throbbing of the jackhammers the workmen had offered him ear plugs but his commanding officer had forbidden him to wear them so he just had to put up with the noise well only a few hours to go one of the workmen broke away from the group and approached him sibele knew him only as johnny his real name was thomas massenga once ngunes righthand man who had been on the run since jamel mobuto came to power it was only when he got closer that sibele saw the blood on the sleeve of his blue overall massenga pulled a miniuzi from inside his overall and shot sibele at pointblank range the bulldozer which had stood dormant for the past two days coughed into life and rumbled towards the prison gates two guards who had been alerted by the gunfire ran towards the gates both were armed with fn fal semiautomatic rifles massenga shot them before they could fire at the bulldozer it smashed through the gates tearing them off their hinges as though they were made of plastic massenga gestured to the other six men who immediately followed him into the prison compound each carrying a miniuzi the skeleton staff were no match for massenga and his team of exsecurity policemen the fighting was over within a minute and they were able to make their way down to the cells the two guards outside ngunes cell threw down their weapons when challenged by massenga they had no option massenga took the keys from one of them and unlocked ngunes cell door he hurried over to where ngune lay and crouched anxiously beside him horrified at the sight of ngunes discoloured swollen face immediately he ordered two of his men to carry ngune then locked the two terrified guards in an adjoining cell discarding the keys he then led the way back to the front of the prison he glanced at his watch they had made good time although the telephone wires had been cut minutes before the assault he knew the authorities would still have been alerted and were almost certainly on their way to the prison at that very moment a black van reversed through the shattered remains of the main gate and the back doors were thrown open ngune was helped into the back of the van and placed gently on a palliasse with his head resting on a pillow massenga closed the doors then climbed into the cab beside the driver who engaged the gears and pulled out into the road the plan was to change vehicles on the outskirts of habane then continue on to kondese where hundreds of men mostly exsecurity policemen loyal to ngune were waiting to launch a crushing offensive against jamel mobutos inept and disorganized government troops many of whom had only joined up when the new regime was instated and with a team of assassins awaiting jamel mobutos arrival in america it would only be a question of days before tito ngune was inaugurated as the new president of zimbala it was a plan that couldnt fail the new york police department which was responsible for security at john f kennedy airport had drafted in fifty men for the arrival of jamel mobutos delegation in america fifteen snipers each with mi rifles were positioned at strategic points overlooking the runway while another fifteen in plainclothes mingled freely with the crowds inside the terminal building itself a section of runway had been cordoned off that afternoon by the remaining twenty policemen who had strict orders not to allow anyone through without an official pass the authorities were determined not to take any chances not with so much at stake whitlock had driven to the airport a couple of hours before the delegation was due to arrive to ensure that all the security measures had been put into operation he had been satisfied with the arrangements he glanced at his watch the two hours were almost up and according to airtraffic control the presidential plane would land on schedule he looked around to his left were three nypd police cars parked bumper to bumper and behind them a human chain of police officers all armed with handguns and rifles to his right were the four black limousines that would be used to transport the zimbalan delegation around new york the opaque dark windows like the chassis were bulletproof and each of the drivers could activate a row of razorsharp spikes secreted on the undercarriage if any attempt was made to overturn the car every eventuality had to be covered the official welcoming party had congregated in front of the limousines talking amongst themselves the zimbalan mission was headed by their newly appointed ambassador to the un and the white houses chief of protocol was the official representative from the american administration whitlocks eyes flickered to the two sombresuited men standing apart from the others paul brett and jack rogers baileys men both had been presidential bodyguards with the reagan administration but neither of them had ever had to draw his gun in anger whitlock had spent most of the afternoon with them and hed come away with the distinct impression that they held him in little regard although they never said it he knew their bitterness stemmed from the fact that he would be in charge of the operation they would be taking orders from someone outside the cia brett suddenly glanced across at him his face remained expressionless rogers said something and they both laughed whitlock stared back at brett the hell hed be intimidated by one of baileys flunkeys brett looked away whitlock suddenly noticed that a member of the zimbalan mission had been watching them she was an attractive lightskinned african in her late twenties in a blue suit and white blouse the translator the official languages of zimbala were swahili and french and several of the zimbalan delegates didnt speak english he smiled at her she smiled back then looked away quickly as if she had been caught doing something wrong he suddenly thought of rosie hed been so busy that afternoon that hed completely forgotten to call her he felt a sense of guilt but at the same time knew he could never have spoken to her anyway he made a mental note to call her and arrange a time to meet away from her parents someone called out breaking his train of thought the presidential plane was making its final descent he immediately ordered the policemen to take up their designated positions on the runway then crossed to where brett and rogers were standing they glanced at him but said nothing the white gulfstream one executed a perfect landing but it was only when it taxied towards them that whitlock saw the blue red and white zimbalan flag painted on the side of the fuselage with the words air zimbala above it in black lettering it was obvious that the plane had been repainted before its journey and whitlock suddenly wondered if it had been done to erase the memories of the previous regime he let the thought pass as the plane came to a halt less than twenty yards away from the limousines the hatch opened and a set of steps was driven up to it the chief of protocol led the way to the foot of the steps waiting for mobuto to appear the first man to emerge had to duck through the opening whitlock judged him to be at least six foot six he looked around him slowly then disappeared back inside the aircraft he reappeared a moment later and whitlock immediately recognized mobuto when he emerged behind the bodyguard he was a tall handsome man who had an air of confidence about him he was dressed in an expensive grey dior suit and wore dark glasses it was hard to believe he was fortytwo years old he looked ten years younger he removed the glasses on reaching the tarmac and he shook the chief of protocols extended hand rogers and brett immediately flanked him at the foot of the steps and walked with him as he shook hands with each member of the zimbalan mission in turn his grip lingered on the translators hand and he smiled faintly at her before turning back to the chief of protocol who was standing behind him it was then that he noticed whitlock standing discreetly in the background he told brett and rogers to hold back then crossed to where whitlock stood and held out a hand of greeting its been a long time clarence mobuto said in his faultless english whitlock bit back his anger he had never forgiven his parents for christening him clarence wilkins over twenty years whitlock replied gripping the extended hand you look well jamel mobuto inhaled sharply and glanced at the massive bodyguard who was hovering in the background he turned back to whitlock you call me president mobuto in front of my people and you call me cw in front of mine whitlock retorted holding mobutos stare mobuto smiled coldly you havent changed a bit still as insolent as ever and youre still as arrogant as ever whitlock looked past mobuto and gestured for brett and rogers to approach them he introduced them to mobuto then went on to explain that one of them would always be at his side for the duration of his visit and you mobuto asked once whitlock had finished speaking im in charge of security brett and rogers report directly to me as do your bodyguards very well mobuto replied after a moments thought then moved away with the chief of protocol heading towards one of the limousines brett youre taking first shift arent you brett nodded rogers youll relieve him tomorrow at seven am fine was all rogers said whitlock dismissed rogers then he and brett hurried after mobuto brett went to the lead limousine and climbed in beside the driver whitlock caught up with mobuto but remained discreetly in the background while he finished talking to the chief of protocol mobuto spoke briefly to the zimbalan ambassador in swahili then beckoned the tall bodyguard towards him he introduced him to whitlock as masala his personal bodyguard then told masala that he and the other three zimbalan bodyguards were to liaise directly with whitlock president mobuto and i will be in the second car whitlock said to masala you ride up front in the third spread your men amongst the other two cars masala nodded then went off to carry out whitlocks instructions mobuto climbed into the back of the limousine the zimbalan ambassador got in beside him and the driver closed the door behind them whitlock got into the passenger seat and the driver immediately started the engine whitlock looked round at mobuto im going to seal off the back of the car with a sheet of soundproof glass not only is it bulletproof but it will also give you privacy to speak to the ambassador theres a private telephone in the compartment in front of you if you need to make any outside calls and if you need us just dial zero mobuto nodded whitlock activated the switch on the dashboard and the glass slid into place sealing off the back and front seats of the car he sat back and exhaled deeply the driver glanced at him but sensed that whitlock wasnt in the mood to talk he switched on the radio found a music station and followed the first limousine out of the airport onto the grand central parkway heading towards manhattan the convoy led by a police car and two police motorcycles made its way through long island city across the queensboro bridge into manhattan then down first avenue to the united nations plaza the hotel where the zimbalan delegation would stay for the duration of their threeday visit to new york it was situated close to the united nations headquarters as well as being only three blocks away from the african american institute which mobuto had requested to see at some point during his visit and with mobuto due to address the united nations general assembly the locale couldnt have been better the convoy drew to a halt in front of the hotel whitlock jumped out of the limousine and looked around him slowly the press who had been alerted by an anonymous call to reuters the previous day by one of the assassins were out in force waiting and hoping to get an exclusive of an assassination or at least an attempted assassination for the morning papers whitlock shouted at the two policemen on the motorcycles to get the photographers back a few feet to give mobuto a chance to get out of the limousine they immediately set about the task of pushing the jostling photographers away from the limousine brett and masala flanked the back door and the other three bodyguards took up positions on the other side of the car facing the photographers satisfied whitlock nodded to masala who opened the back door mobuto climbed out slowly and turned to wave at the waiting photographers flashbulbs popped in cessantly and whitlock found himself struggling to focus on the sea of cameras his eyes darting about in search of anything untoward suddenly one of the zimbalan bodyguards shouted a warning and lunged at the photographers whitlock knocked mobuto to the ground in the splitsecond before a bullet smashed into the wall behind them the photographers scattered in panic as the bodyguard made a grab for the gunman a second shot rang out and the bodyguard stumbled back clutching his stomach the other two zimbalan bodyguards immediately drew their snubnosed smith wesson and sprinted after the fleeing gunman the getaway driver in a blue ford laid down a burst of suppressing fire forcing the bodyguards to dive for cover by the time they had got to their feet the gunman had jumped through the open passenger door and the wheels shrieked in protest as the car sped away from the hotel whitlock mounted one of the police motorcycles kickstarted it then slewed it violently in an ungainly onehundredandeightydegree turn and took off after the getaway car he unhooked the radio and called for backup giving a description of the car and its registration number the ford swung sharply into east th street mounted the kerb and narrowly missed a couple of teenagers waiting to cross the road the driver managed to regain control and turned into second avenue suddenly he felt the car beginning to skid and in his panic trod on the brakes the wheels locked and the car careered across the road clipping the side of an oncoming greyhound bus the car overturned and ploughed into the side of a stationary delivery van the driver was dead his chest crushed by the steering wheel the gunman managed to unbuckle his safety belt and struggled to push open the passenger door eager hands reached out to help him as he eased himself out of the car he wiped the blood from a gash on his forehead then waved the walther threateningly at the growing crowd of onlookers they immediately stepped back anxious not to alarm him he fired blindly at whitlock as he turned into second avenue whitlock lost control of the motorcycle and fell heavily onto the road the gunman looked around him wildly and the crowd parted as he darted up a narrow alleyway whitlock pulled himself to his feet and winced as a sharp pain shot through his left leg he looked down at it his trousers were ripped and the blood seeped down his leg from the gash inches above his knee it hurt like hell but he was damned if he was going to let the gunman escape he drew his browning mkz and went after the gunman ignoring the pain that shot through his leg with every step he reached the end of the alleyway it forked off in two directions and the gunman was nowhere to be seen he cursed softly knowing hed lost him a bullet cracked inches above his head and he flung himself behind a row of metal dustbins the browning clenched tightly in his hand the shot had come from the left fork he couldnt see the gunman but at least he knew where he was he could wait the gunman fired again but the bullet was well off target he was panicking and panic invariably leads to mistakes he suddenly darted out from behind a metal ladder and whitlock aimed at his legs he needed him alive a police car emerged from the other alleyway and screeched to a halt ten yards in front of whitlock blocking his shot whitlock cursed angrily and got to his feet the policeman got out of the car his colt python drawn he shouted to whitlock to drop his weapon whitlock tried to explain but the policemans grip tightened on the revolver and he repeated the order whitlock snarled angrily and tossed the browning onto the ground the policeman kicked it away and gestured for whitlock to approach the police car i want ten fingers on the hood do it im working with you guys for christs sake whitlock snarled in exasperation sure now put those fingers on the hood my names whitlock check with your superior im head of the zimbalan presidents security team the policeman waited until whitlock had put his hands on the police car then used his foot to spread his legs i was told to apprehend an armed black suspect in this alley i dont see another one do you thats because youve let him get away whitlock snarled but the policeman snapped at him to face the front when he tried to look round the policeman frisked him then reached for his handcuffs whitlock sensing his moment swung round and felled him with one punch he tossed the colt python onto the front seat then locked the keys inside the police car retrieving his browning he hurried over to where he had last seen the gunman he had gone then he heard a noise a metal bin being knocked over he followed the sound and was just in time to see the gunman climbing a wire fence at the end of an adjoining alleyway whitlock purposely fired wide it had the desired effect the gunman tumbled over the top of the fence landing painfully on his back whitlock scrambled to his feet but by the time he reached the fence the gunman had already crossed the twentyyard clearing and disappeared into a derelict warehouse whitlock clambered over the fence and landed nimbly on his feet he straightened up then noticed the gunmans walther lying at the edge of the clearing he must have lost it when he fell to the ground whitlock doubted he would have another gun but he still approached the warehouse with professional caution he reached the open doors and peered in it took his eyes a few seconds to get accustomed to the gloom then he darted inside and ducked down behind a rusty skip close to the door he looked around slowly then carefully scanned the catwalk that crisscrossed the warehouse above him no sign of the gunman he slipped out from behind the skip and moved slowly across the concrete floor the browning gripped tightly in his hand his eyes continually darting about him he reached the other side of the cavernous room and paused to wipe the sweat from his eyes where the hell was he a shower of dust sprinkled his face but before he could react the gunman leaped onto him from a ledge on the wall they both fell heavily to the ground and the browning went spinning from whitlocks hand the man lashed out with a rusted chain but whitlock managed to roll clear before it struck the ground where he had been lying whitlock kicked out at the man catching him on the leg so that he overbalanced and fell against the wall the chain clattered noisily to the ground whitlock sprung to his feet and caught him on the side of the head with a stinging haymaker then followed up with two brutal body punches that dropped him to his knees the man clutched his stomach in agony then noticed the fallen browning out of the corner of his eye he grabbed it and turned on whitlock who managed to deflect it before he fired they struggled for possession of the gun it slipped from the gunmans hand landing at his feet whitlock shoved him back onto a tarpaulin in the corner of the warehouse and scooped up the browning he levelled it at the gunman then let his hand drop to his side the man had been impaled on the rusted spikes of a security gate that had been discarded underneath the tarpaulin whitlock swallowed back the bile in his throat and crossed to where the gunman lay his shirt soaked in blood he felt for a pulse then letting the gunmans arm drop he bolstered the browning before walking back slowly towards the doors as he reached them he heard the first of the police sirens in the distance he dusted off a box and sat down to wait for them kolchinsky was waiting in the foyer when whitlock got back to the hotel hows the leg were kolchinskys first words o k whitlock replied with a grim smile it didnt need stitches but i got a tetanus jab as a precaution thank for clearing everything for me with the n yp d i had visions of being stuck in a cell all night kolchinsky patted whitlock on the shoulder come on mobutos waiting to see you how is he remarkably well under the circumstances kolchinsky replied as they walked to the lift you wouldnt believe someone had just tried to kill him hes acting like it never happened acting being the operative word whitlock retorted as the lift door parted you really dont like him do you as a person no but hes obviously genuine about bringing democracy to zimbala and that makes all this worthwhile they rode the lift to the thirtieth floor and were immediately challenged by a uniformed policeman as they stepped out they both held up their passes and were allowed through the entire floor had been booked by the zimbalan delegation although only ten rooms were being used it was a security measure another policeman challenged them outside mobutos suite and again they had to produce their passes kolchinsky knocked on the door it was opened on the chain by masala who immediately unlocked it to allow them in they were ushered into the lounge then masala discreetly withdrew closing the door behind him mobuto was alone he was seated on the sofa sifting through a batch of papers he had taken from his attache case he looked up removed his reading glasses then got to his feet and indicated the second sofa kolchinsky sat down and asked if mobuto minded if he smoked please feel free mobuto replied then turned to whitlock you saved my life tonight thank you i believe you were injured while chasing the gunman nothing serious i hope whitlock shook his head i cut my leg when i fell off the motorbike its nothing im sorry about your man hes the one who really saved your life he died without ever regaining consciousness at least he was spared the pain mobuto folded the glasses and placed them on the coffee table in the centre of the room can i offer either of you a drink nothing for me kolchinsky replied shaking his head clarence nothing thank you whitlock sat down beside kolchinsky wheres brett hes next door mobuto replied indifferently and masalas in the other room youve got no protection ive got half the new york police force in the corridor and bodyguards in every adjoining room mobuto cut in sharply i feel like a prisoner its important that you always have at least one bodyguard in the room with you at all times whitlock countered even when im sleeping even when youre sleeping whitlock shot back these assassins are obviously prepared to sacrifice r their own lives to kill you that means theyll go to any lengths to get you what exactly are you implying what im saying is that even in this room youre not safe they could come through the window were thirty floors up for god sake mobuto cut in then chuckled softly to himself i think youre being a little melodramatic no sir hes not kolchinsky said sternly cws right you must always have at least one bodyguard with you at all times tonight proved that mobuto sat down opposite them and sighed deeply very well you are the experts whitlock got to his feet which rooms brett in mobuto pointed to his left hes next door whitlock left the suite and knocked on the adjoining door he grabbed brett the moment he opened the door and slammed him up against the wall youre supposed to be next door not sitting here on your arse watching a ball game brett broke free from whitlocks grip and stared angrily at him the president told me to go what the hell was i supposed to do you were supposed to explain to him that its your job to stay with him you dont tell him his job and he doesnt tell you yours youre supposed to be a professional start acting like one brett glared furiously at whitlock then slipped on his shoulder holster and scooped up his jacket before leaving the room whitlock followed him into mobutos suite brett pulled up a chair and sat discreetly in the corner the presidents just received a telephone call from zimbala kolchinsky said his brothers been kidnapped what happened whitlock replied looking at mobuto he went to meet an informer an hour later the newspapers deputy editor received an anonymous call to say that remy had been abducted by ngunes men thats all the caller would say mobuto glanced at whitlock i presume you have been briefed about the ngune breakout yes sir i have whitlock replied has ngune got the backing to attempt a coup detat hes got men and money mobuto answered matteroffactly the men are his exsecurity policemen the money comes from the wealthy moslem community in the south of the country many of them built up vast fortunes under my fathers regime illegal fortunes i hasten to add they know that if i do bring a new democratic freedom to my country then itll mean the confiscation of those fortunes and as you know greed knows no bounds theyll go to any lengths to reinstate a dictatorship that will protect them just as my fathers regime did for fortyfive years im the one obstacle in their way the people look to me as a new messiah i wont let them down one thing puzzles me whitlock said at length your father repealed the law making you his natural successor once he realized youd never follow in his footsteps so how did you manage to wrestle power from the government after his death my father was the government he made the decisions he passed the laws his ministers were just yesmen puppets so when he died the puppets had noone to pull their strings anymore they panicked and i used that panic to my benefit but i had to act fast ngune was my biggest threat he was the one man my father trusted really trusted fortunately for the country the police and the security police had never got on and with the police and most of the armed forces behind me i was able to stop ngune from seizing power unfortunately i underestimated the strength of his support but im determined not to cut short my visit here that would just play straight into his hands it would make the people think was panicking and that could lose me support mobuto got to his feet and moved to the sideboard to pour himself a bourbon well gentlemen if youll excuse me ive got some work to finish before i go to bed of course kolchinsky said getting to his feet whitlock crossed to where brett was sitting dont let him out of your sight he said softly i wont brett replied tersely whitlock said good night to mobuto then followed kolchinsky out into the corridor i wish we could have used our own people to babysit mobuto id have felt a lot happier kolchinsky nodded grimly i know what you mean but were stuck with baileys men im afraid theres nothing i can do about it i know whitlock replied and pushed the button for the lift im going to drop by the hospital to update the colonel on todays developments fancy coming whitlock shrugged why not carmen wont be home yet she works late tuesdays he looked at his watch but arent visiting hours over the secretarygeneral had a word with the hospitals administrator who reluctantly agreed to make an exception in the colonels case and waive the normal visiting hours it was one of the conditions the colonel laid down if he was to remain in hospital whitlock shot kolchinsky a knowing look then ushered him into the lift kolchinsky drove the short distance to the bellevue hospital conveniently situated less than two miles away from both the hotel and the united nations building the receptionist directed them to a private ward on the third floor kolchinsky knocked lightly come in philpott called out kolchinsky opened the door and entered philpott was sitting up in bed his face hidden behind a copy of the new york times just put them by the bed ill take them later philpott muttered gruffly from behind the newspaper its me malcolm kolchinsky announced philpott lowered the newspaper and gave them a wry smile im sorry i thought it was another of those damn nurses theyve been coming and going all day he glanced at whitlock i see he managed to drag you along as well whitlock smiled and pulled up a chair how are you feeling sir a little weak but otherwise fine kolchinsky sat down on the second chair and handed philpott a brown packet its from the deli on th street philpott opened the packet and looked inside grapes i was hoping it might have been some tobacco the doctor confiscated mine he put the packet on the bedside table and picked up his empty pipe im dying for a smoke cw im not fetching you any tobacco whitlock cut in quickly get better first then you can smoke your pipe again i am better i should have discharged myself this morning philpott gave a resigned sigh any news of mike kolchinsky explained the days events culminating in the attempted assassination of jamel mobuto good god philpott muttered when kolchinsky had finished talking he looked at whitlock are you alright i cut my leg when i fell off the motorbike its nothing serious but my suits a total writeoff itll break my tailors heart at least youre alright any news on the assassin and his accomplice nothing yet kolchinsky replied they werent carrying any id but theyre almost certainly zimbalan probably exsecurity policemen ive had their photographs and prints faxed through to the police in habane hopefully theyll have come up with something by tomorrow and what was that you said earlier about bernard hes cia kolchinsky nodded then opened the attache case he handed his photostat copy of baileys file to philpott its all in there ill leave it with you tonight it certainly makes interesting reading i bet it does philpott hissed be careful of bailey sergei tell him as little as possible and dont trust him an inch i think we all realized that when we met him kolchinsky said glancing at whitlock and as for those two bulletcatchers whitlock trailed off with a shake of his head what about them philpott asked lets just say i wouldnt want them protecting me whitlock replied as i said to sergei back at the hotel i only wish we could have used our own people to babysit mobuto id have slept better i did try cw philpott said with an apologetic shrug i wanted to bring in strike force seven as his personal bodyguard team that would have left you free to work with sabrina in beirut but the president wanted this to be a joint operation and bailey managed to convince him to use cia men as bodyguards there was nothing i could do at least the president saw enough sense to agree to my request to put you in charge of the unit i know you wont let me down cw just keep an eye on baileys goons if president mobuto had been killed tonight wed have been crucified weve still got three days to go sir theyre sure to try again you can count on it and what happened to this warning bernard was supposed to have passed on to bailey i spoke to bailey after the attempt on the presidents life kolchinsky said he claims bernard never contacted him his theory is that the two men were either freelance or else they decided to try and kill the president by themselves without telling the others it just doesnt ring true does it whitlock said of course it doesnt philpott snapped tersely but were dealing with bailey remember kolchinsky nodded then rubbed his eyes wearily well theres nothing more we can do tonight and im shattered its been some day whitlock got to his feet only three to go can you drop me off at the apartment on your way home sergei if i get the subway ill probably fall asleep and end up at washington heights kolchinsky patted whitlocks shoulder of course come on philpott watched them leave then stared at the folder kolchinsky had left with him he knew bailey was up to something but what the thought lingered as he opened the folder and started to read its contents four sabrina paused outside the door knocked and entered the man behind the desk was in his early forties with a dark swarthy complexion and a thick black moustache which arched over the corners of his mouth he looked up from the document he was reading and his eyes lingered on her body before he sat back and raised his eyebrows quizzically waiting for her to speak are you captain farouk she asked thats what it says he replied in faultless english gesturing to the nameplate on his desk if you read arabic sabrina replied with a smile i spoke to you earlier on the phone ah yes farouk cut in and glanced down at the notepad in front of him miss cassidy not so sabrina cassidy she replied using the name on her un ago passport please wont you sit down miss cassidy farouk said indicating the wooden chair in front of his desk thank you she said and sat down is this your first time in beirut yes she replied truthfully i didnt know where to begin looking for mike so i called the police and they put me on to you they said you were in charge of the investigation she feigned nervousness by fidgeting with the handbag in her lap but what investigation whats happened farouk raised his hand to silence her theres a warrant out for the arrest of michael green the name on one of the passports graham had drawn from un ago stores in new york she sat forward on what charge murder she slumped back in the chair oh my god murder i dont believe it sure mikes a bit of a rebel but hed never kill anybody farouk uncapped his pen and pulled the notepad towards him id like to ask you a few questions miss cassidy yes of course she replied continuing to feign nervousness anything you said on the phone that hed called you in new york what exactly did he say all he said was that he was in trouble and that he needed some money to get out of the country then the line went dead do you know why he was here the first i knew he was in beirut was when he rang me she sighed deeply mikes a loner its not the first time hes gone off by himself and he owns a company in new york farouk said consulting his notes again whitaker haulage she added hes the boss yes i know we found some business cards in his hotel room farouk tapped thoughtfully on the notepad and his fellow directors dont mind him just going off by himself without letting them know where he is what if something were to happen to the company theyre used to his erratic behaviour by now and anyway he pays their salaries what can they say did he have any friends that you knew of in beirut she shook her head none that he ever mentioned russell laidlaw she pretended to think for a moment then she shook her head again no i cant say the name means anything to me is that the man who was murdered no farouk replied he was the last person to see your boyfriend here in beirut he used to be in the special forces in america the delta unit are you suggesting that mike was once a member of delta she shook her head in disbelief i dont believe it not for one minute im not suggesting anything miss cassidy its just strange that laidlaw was with delta and the murdered man barak was an informer for delta here in beirut delta seems to be the common denominator doesnt it havent you asked this man laidlaw about mike he claims to have met him for the first time at the windorah its a bar frequented mainly by foreigners the owners borne out his story so im back to square one cant you ask delta i already have they say no michael green has ever been with them and it took a lot of persuasion for them to just admit that how do you know mike was involved did someone see him his fingerprints were on the murder weapon i checked with interpol and they confirmed they were his prints interpol she replied with surprise you mean he had a criminal record no but the new york police had his prints on file the n ypd had grahams fingerprints on file they had all u n a c o operatives fingerprints on file it was a precaution in case any of them were injured or killed and werent carrying any formal identification but michael green then it hit her why hadnt she thought of it when kolchinsky briefed them un ago must have given the nypd permission to release the prints under grahams assumed name but why it made no sense they had set up their own operative she wanted some answers and she was determined to get them when she next spoke to kolchinsky is something wrong miss cassidy farouk said noticing her frown she cursed herself silently for letting her guard drop sorry i was just surprised that the new york police had his fingerprints on file i never realized he had a criminal record he was once convicted of a drinkdriving offence i didnt know that she said then sat forward her eyes burrowing into farouk i still dont believe mike killed this man its not in his character well unless he turns himself in we have to assume that he is the killer and the longer he remains on the run the worse it will become for him i think hes being held against his will somewhere she said perhaps hes already fled the country interpops been alerted how could he have fled the country without any money she shook her head no it all points to him being held against his will somewhere mike never travels without cash and credit cards so why call me unless he had lost them or had them stolen you really believe hes innocent dont you yes i do she got to her feet is there anything i can do to help him its a police matter now miss cassidy farouk capped his pen and pointed it at her if he should contact you tell him to call me it would be in his best interests i doubt he will call me she said with a dejected shrug he doesnt even know im here farouk got to his feet and came round the desk to shake her hand thank you for your timemiss cassidy she nodded and walked to the door oh miss cassidy farouk waited until she turned to look at him if youre caught trying to help him escape youll be charged with aiding and abetting a wanted criminal bear it in mind sure she replied and closed the door behind her laidlaw had been detained by the police only hours after baraks murder and although they had interrogated him at regular intervals every four hours trying to break him down he had managed to stick to his story he had met graham or green as he had referred to him throughout the interrogation for the first time at the windorah they had talked for a while then he had given green a lift back to his hotel he had never seen him again after that he knew noone had seen him at baraks house otherwise hed have been charged straight away he had been finally released after thirtysix hours he had tried to sleep when he got home but to no avail the voice haunted him the voice of the policeman farouk but he had never seen farouks face he had asked the questions at every interrogation but always from behind the sanctuary of a powerful table lamp why hadnt he shown his face laidlaw had racked his brains over and over but he couldnt place the name so why had he been so secretive laidlaw knew he could be overreacting from lack of sleep it could have been a plan to try and break him down a voice no face but still it troubled him who was farouk he punched the pillow angrily forget farouk just get some sleep but he couldnt that monotonous grinding voice was in his head and he couldnt get rid of it he kicked the sheet off and swung his legs onto the floor pushing the hair from his face he looked at the bedside clock it had been five hours since hed got home and he hadnt slept in that time all because of that damn voice he stifled a yawn then stood up and went into the kitchen he opened the freezer and helped himself to a cold beer and the last of the chicken drumsticks from the packet he had bought earlier in the week he tossed the empty packet onto the overflowing bin in the corner of the room and sat down at the table just as he was about to open the beer the doorbell rang he shook his head in despair then got to his feet and went to open the door russell laidlaw thats right laidlaw muttered youre not a reporter are you my names sabrina cassidy im a friend of mikes mike mike graham sabrina retorted with a hint of irritation in her voice we need to talk look come back later im absolutely exhausted ive been in police custody for the last thirtysix hours and its all thanks to your friend mike i think hes in trouble she said please we need to talk laidlaw rubbed his eyes wearily then pulled open the door what the hell i couldnt sleep anyway thanks she said and stepped inside youll have to forgive the mess laidlaw said closing the door im not very domesticated she followed him into the kitchen and sat down in the chair offered to her you want a beer he asked coffee if youve got it somewhere he replied and switched the kettle on before rummaging through the drawers he found the coffee jar and put a heaped spoonful into the only clean mug he could find you say youre a friend of mikes you work with him thats right she replied laidlaw opened the beer and drank a mouthful and youre out here to find him well i wish you luck you saw him didnt you i met him yesat the windorah its a bar in town we talked a bit then i gave him a lift back to his hotel i never saw him after that sabrina exhaled deeply how can i convince you im on the level laidlaw filled the cup with hot water then placed it on the table in front of her he put the milk bottle beside the cup help yourself look miss cassidy i met your friend spare me the act she cut in angrily you served in delta together it was on an operation in libya that his family was kidnapped by arab terrorists to try and force him to countermand the order to attack the two men behind the kidnapping were salim almakesh and jeanjacques bernard almakesh was killed by the israelis bernard was thought to have been killed in a carbomb attack a year and a half ago mike obviously found out bernard was alive and came out here to get him you were his contact thats all we know ive been sent here to find out what really happened and get him back to the states laidlaw pulled out the chair opposite her and sat down carrie gave mike a watch as a christmas present what make was it piaget goldplated and it was a birthday present satisfied laidlaw nodded satisfied whos this we you mentioned i cant tell you im afraid undercover work in other words something like that she replied are you his partner she nodded did you tip him off about bernard yeah i saw bernard outside the american university hospital i knew mike would want to know and where did this barak fit into the picture barak had been a delta contact for years if anybody could find bernard then he could until mike put a bullet in his back mike didnt kill him you know that she retorted sharply all i know is that when i reached the house barak was dead then i saw baraks car being driven away at high speed and mike had gone put two and two together it has to be a setup why kill the one man capable of leading him to bernard it makes no sense i wasnt there when he went into the house he insisted on that i dont know what they discussed only mike knows that thats why we have to find him not we you can count me out i put myself on the line for him once already and look where it got me thirtysix hours in jail interrogations every four hours no miss cassidy if you want to find mike you find him by yourself i dont know my way around beirut so get a guide theres plenty of them and they dont cost much if its money dont insult me miss cassidy laidlaw snapped sharply she raised a hand in apology im sorry i shouldnt have said that i need your help mr laidlaw and so does mike if the police get to him first hell be put away for life and what if he did kill barak what if he is guilty youre going to help a killer flee justice i dont know how well you know mike i think i know him pretty well hes a damn good professional and he wouldnt jeopardize his career by putting a bullet in the back of some twobit informer mikes changed laidlaw answered staring at the beer can he was turning on the table i noticed that the moment we met he used to be the most stable guy i ever knew nothing ever riled him but that was before he lost his family now hes bitter unpredictable id even say psychotic i dont go along with your assessment miss cassidy i think he was more than capable of shooting barak in the back especially if you consider he was on the trail of the man he believes had his family abducted and almost certainly murdered no i dont want any more to do with mike hes trouble sabrina pushed her chair back and stood up her eyes blazing at least mike hasnt run away from his past what about you hiding away in this squalor trying to forget what happened in honduras she noticed the surprise in his eyes oh i know all about you mr laidlaw i read your file on the plane i know why you left delta i dont think youre in any position to pass judgement on someone like mike just get out laidlaw hissed between clenched teeth my pleasure she retorted then walked to the door where she paused to look back at him and dont forget you were the one who contacted mike in the first place its thanks to you that hes in this mess right now think about that when you open your next beer laidlaw sunk his face into his hands a moment later the front door slammed shut he suddenly grabbed the beer can and hurled it against the wall then upturned the table sending it crashing against the cooker he checked himself as he was about to kick the chair out of the way then walked slowly to the bedroom and slumped onto the bed he put his hands behind his head and closed his eyes within minutes he was asleep it proved to be a disturbed restless sleep you look like death dave jenkins said when laidlaw arrived at the windorah that evening i feel like it laidlaw retorted climbing onto one of the bar stools a beer dave comin up jenkins replied uncapping a budweiser and placing it on the counter in front of laidlaw where were you last night i was thinking about sending out the cavalry to look for you if you hadnt shown up tonight its nice to be missed laidlaw muttered then took a drink of beer so where were you last night laidlaw shrugged i didnt fancy coming in is that such a crime if it affects my profits yes jenkins said with a grin then pushed a coaster across to laidlaw what do you think of the design a batch of them came in this morning what laidlaw replied in amazement just look at the design jenkins picked up another four and handed them out to the other customers sitting at the counter laidlaw glanced at it turned it over and was about to discard it when he saw the handwritten note scrawled across it he looked up but jenkins was busy discussing the logo with one of the other customers he read the note go upstairs to room knock twice pause knock twice more interesting isnt it jenkins said deftly taking the coaster from laidlaws hand and discarding it unobtrusively in the bin under the counter but then im biased anyway laidlaw took another mouthful of beer then got to his feet and walked to the stairs at the end of the room he paused his hand on the banister what the hell was going on he sighed deeply then mounted the stairs and looked around him slowly the windorah had been a small family hotel before jenkins bought it seven years earlier the ten rooms were all situated on the first floor jenkins had decided to concentrate on the bar and closed the rooms he converted the first two into toilets and the others were only used for customers invariably foreign journalists who were too drunk to drive home he never charged for the rooms and the journalists repayed him by keeping their custom at the bar laidlaw stopped outside room glanced round to see that nobody was about then knocked twice he paused momentarily then knocked twice more a bolt was drawn back from inside then the door opened fractionally before a hand reached out and hauled him into the room the door closed behind him immediately mike laidlaw said in amazement as graham bolted the door you took your time where the hell were you last night being interrogated on a murder charge laidlaw snapped back thirtysix hours without any sleep and all thanks to you youve got some explaining to do graham walked to the unmade bed and sat down didnt kill barak so where were you when i got to the house and who drove off in baraks peugeot graham rubbed his unshaven face and looked up at laidlaw all i know is that when i entered the house someone coshed me when i woke up i was in some back alley i still dont know where it was and my beretta was gone the police have got it laidlaw said coldly it was the gun that killed barak i know graham retorted why the hell do you think ive been holed up here since yesterday when i saw my picture on the front page of the local newspaper i knew it meant trouble so why did you come here i went to your house first but the cops were watching it i also saw them putting a tap on your phone thats why i couldnt call you then i thought of dave hes the only other guy i could trust here laidlaw moved to the window and tweaked the edge of the curtains the police car that had followed him to the windorah was still parked across the road were you followed here graham asked yeah laidlaw replied letting the curtain fall back into place but that was to be expected jeez i still dont know what to make of your story it doesnt make sense if bernard did kill barak why not kill you as well what would he have to gain by setting you up that questions been going round in my head ever since i woke up in that alley and and nothing graham replied like you said it makes no sense im still a threat to him alive what if bernard wasnt behind it it has to be bernard hell i wish i knew why though laidlaw looked down at graham the cops arent the only ones on your tail your partners in town grahams eyes narrowed suspiciously my partner calls herself sabrina cassidy looks like a model out of one of those coke ads only better graham smiled faintly thats her when did she get in dunno we didnt exactly hit it off i know what you mean i didnt get on with her either when we started working together wed fight like cat and dog hell we still have our spats but shes still a damn good professional all the same she thinks a lot of you you know i made the mistake of criticizing you and she came down on me like a ton of bricks shes very maternal it can be a pain in the ass at times is that what you call it laidlaw replied an eyebrow raised quizzically there were two knocks on the door before graham could muster a reply a pause then another two knocks thats dave graham said he said hed be up ill get him to find out where sabrinas staying graham unlocked the door jenkins entered followed by two arabs in jeans and opennecked shirts both were armed with russian makarova pistols im sorry mike jenkins said giving graham a despairing look they caught me unawares they were in the opposite room shut up one of the arabs snapped in a thick english accent you are mike graham graham nodded slowly who are you bernards goons captain farouk want to see you the arab replied thats the bastard who interrogated me laidlaw hissed if you not come the girl will die the arab took a passport from his pocket and tossed it on the bed captain farouk say you look he serious graham picked up the passport and looked at laidlaw its sabrinas he turned on the englishspeaking arab if you or this farouk have touched her ill tear you apart with my bare hands the arabs face remained motionless you come all of you farouk wants me let the others go graham said if you not come the girl will die its like talking to a robot graham hissed then glanced at jenkins and laidlaw were going to have to do as he says im sorry what about the bar jenkins asked the bar closed closed jenkins replied indignantly it has been closed we go out the back door and if you are thinking about trying to fight us yeah we know graham cut in angrily the girl will die the arab concluded jenkins led the way down the stairs into the now empty bar room he opened the hatchway at the end of the counter then turned to the englishspeaking arab can i at least lock up the arab nodded then ordered his accomplice to go with jenkins when they returned jenkins again led the way out into the side alley behind the bar a black van was parked by the door jenkins locked the door pocketed the keys then his hands were tied behind his back before he was bundled into the back of the van after graham and laidlaw the doors were closed enveloping them in darkness and locked from the outside the two arabs then climbed into the front and moments later the van spluttered into life and turned out of the alley mike can you reach into my jacket pocket jenkins said nudging graham with his elbow what the hell for my keys jenkins replied theres a swiss army knife on the keyring thats why i insisted on locking the bar we can cut ourselves free good thinking dave but we cant risk it what do you mean jenkins replied if we can cut ourselves free we can jump those two when they open the doors again three against two wed have a good chance of overpowering them if we could be sure it would only be the two of them what if there are others waiting for us when we do reach our destination its worth a try surely jenkins retorted its not just that we dont know where sabrina is even if we did manage to overpower them we could be putting her life in danger i wont take that risk great so were just goingto sit here like trussed up chickens if you quit whining dave i could tell you what ive got in mind thats gratitude for you who took you in dave shut up laidlaw snapped then turned to graham beside him well whats the plan we loosen our ropes then once we know sabrinas safe we can make our move its a long shot i know but there isnt much else we can do under the circumstances i had the same idea laidlaw said lets just hope cheech and chong up front arent telepathic weve got to chance it graham replied grimly they set about loosening the ropes just enough for them to be able to reach the knot once graham gave the signal their only concern was that in the darkness one or more of the ropes had been loosened too much and it would be noticed when they emerged from the back of the van all they could do was wait twenty minutes later the van came to a halt but the engine was kept running they heard one of the arabs get out and moments later a metal gate was opened and the van drove forward a few feet before stopping again presumably to pick up the arab they drove another couple of hundred yards before the van came to a halt and the engine was switched off this time both arabs got out and the back doors were unlocked the englishspeaking arab ordered them to get out jenkins scrambled out first followed by graham and laidlaw they looked around they were in an illuminated yard lined with a row of six red and black pantechnicons graham couldnt understand the writing across the side of the nearest one it was in arabic the arabs spoke briefly together then the englishspeaking one stepped back his makarova trained on the three men his colleague walked behind jenkins and tugged at the rope binding his wrists he cursed angrily and immediately tightened it graham and laidlaw remained motionless not daring to look at each other laidlaw was spun round and the arab checked his rope then he was pushed aside and graham subjected to the same treatment the arab shookhis head at his colleague inside the englishspeaking arab ordered gesturing with the pistol to the door behind him graham and laidlaw exchanged relieved glances then followed jenkins into the whitewalled corridor they were led to a metal door the englishspeaking arab pulled it open and indicated for them to enter they found themselves in a cavernous room lined with scarred wooden workbenches and rows of metal hooks hanging from the ceiling they were all on runners and could be manoeuvred the length of the room it was spotlessly clean the second arab walked to a door and disappeared inside moments later the door opened and he emerged with sabrina her hands were bound behind her back but she was otherwise unhurt he pushed her onto a chair by the door graham took a step towards her but the englishspeaking arab levelled the pistol menacingly at him and ordered him to remain where he was you ok graham called out im fine i didnt realize farouk she trailed off when she saw graham and laidlaw both look past her their eyes riveted on the man who had appeared in the doorway good to see you again mr graham its been a long time sabrina looked from farouk to graham a puzzled frown on her face you know farouk farouk graham snorted contemptuously thats salim almakesh what sabrina replied in amazement but he was killed by israeli commandos in damascus thats obviously what they wanted us to believe graham said without taking his eyes of almakesh which only leaves one logical explanation youre working for the israelis now arent you almakesh stepped away from the door his hands dug into his trouser pockets he nodded it was either that or be killed it was a question of survival now it makes sense laidlaw said nodding to himself i couldnt understand why you never showed yourself when you were interrogating me you knew id recognize you straight away i wasnt sure whether you would or not almakesh replied i have changed my appearance considerably since i was with the black june but it seems i made the right decision after all who killed barak graham demanded you or bernard bernard i had nothing to do with it almakesh said when barak told him you were in beirut barak worked for him graham interceded barak worked for anyone who paid him almakesh replied with a dismissive shrug but he had started to drink heavily in recent months and bernard felt he had become a liability so when he heard you were in town he hit on a plan to get rid of both of you hed kill barak and set you up as the fall guy believe thats the term you americans use he would knock you out when you went to the house kill barak then dump you in an alley near the cola roundabout in western beirut all i had to do was go there and arrest you but when i got there youd gone why didnt bernard just kill me when he had the chance graham asked and have unaco crawling all over beirut al makesh smiled when graham looked at him in surprise i have my sources just like you but if you were arrested for murder they would have to be very careful not to blow their cover any sort of publicity could have splashed unaco across the front page of every newspaper in the world i would have recognized you the moment i saw you graham said who would have believed you the israeli mossad would have confirmed that id been killed in damascus i have a watertight cover for all those years i was with the black june the authorities would think youd finally cracked under the pressure of what had happened to your family youd probably have ended up in an asylum i could have backed him up laidlaw said my superiors would have dismissed grahams allegations about my past as the ramblings of a broken man but if youd also been able to identify me then they would certainly have initiated an investigation for that reason you would have had to be silenced once graham was in custody an accident but when bernards plan backfired i needed you alive in case you could lead me to graham which as it turned out you did were the cia in on this sabrina asked no almakesh replied bluntly and neither were the mossad the cia graham asked staring at sabrina what the hell have they got to do with this bernard works for them she told him what graham snarled shes right almakesh said then gestured around him this all belongs to bernard its a meatprocessing plant paid for with money from a cia slush fund hes now a legitimate businessman and how did the israelis get you into the police sabrina asked i was a policeman for twelve years in jordan before i joined the black june it wasnt difficult for me to fit in here so not only am i in a job i know im also in a position to pass vital information back to the israelis its the perfect cover and now youre going to kill us to protect your cover laidlaw concluded you know too much kill us and un ago will be crawling all over beirut sabrina warned him til have to take that risk but even if they do come they still wont find any bodies theres a beef shipment due out tomorrow destined for syria youll be going with it almakesh pointed to a wooden container in the corner of the room your bodies will be put in there the container will then be sealed and loaded onto one of the trucks in the morning then once over the border it will conveniently disappear who knows how long it will take before its discovered all neatly worked out graham said facetiously you two must be very proud of yourselves this is all my idea bernard doesnt even know youre here we have an arrangement i use this place if i need to get rid of someone the blood gets washed away in the morning so theres no evidence to suggest a crime ever took place and his foreman makes sure the containers are loaded onto the trucks and dumped over the border no questions asked all very amicable almakesh looked at the englishspeaking arab standing beside graham samir you know what to do graham had managed to untie his hands soon after entering the room and lashed out at samir catching him on the side of the face with his fist rocking him back against the wall the makarova fell to the floor laidlaw who had also managed to untie his hands tackled the second arab graham picked up the makarova and shot the second arab as he turned his pistol on laidlaw laidlaws hand was on his pzzo automatic but he knew he couldnt fire it no matter how hard he tried samir grabbed graham from behind as almakesh unholstered his beretta graham broke the hold and swivelled samir round as almakesh fired the bullet took samir in the chest sabrina leaped from her chair and shouldercharged almakesh before he could fire again his gun clattered noisily to the floor graham swung the makarova on almakesh who was still reaching for the beretta all the hate welled up inside him as he thought of carrie and mikey he squeezed the trigger nothing happened the pistol had jammed shoot him graham screamed at laidlaw who was staring at the pistol in his hand russ shoot him almakeshs fingers curled around the beretta sabrina lunged at him he swung the gun on her she kicked out catching him on the wrist the bullet was deflected harmlessly into the ceiling graham tore laidlaws pzzo automatic from his hand and shot almakesh through the head he was dead before his body hit the floor graham swung round to laidlaw and grabbed him by the front of his shirt what the hell were you playing at christ russ he was about to kill us and youre standing there admiring the damn gun whats your problem sabrina was quick to intervene and nudged graham with her elbow mike untie me graham shoved laidlaw away from him then turned to sabrina and untied her hands whos the other guy she asked massaging her wrists dave jenkins he runs the windorah its a bar in the city hes been hiding me for the last couple of days jenkins waited until laidlaw had untied his hands then approached graham who introduced him to sabrina mike you deliberately loosened my ropes more than you needed to why youre not a soldier dave i didnt want to get you involved in the fighting also it was a psychological move i knew the goon would automatically check to see if our ropes were as loose as yours thats how we were able to deceive him graham looked angrily at laidlaw i should have left your ropes loose as well youve got every right to be mad at me mike i know i should have told you but he trailed off with a shrug and stared dejectedly at his feet told me what graham demanded that youve become some kind of bornagain pacifist can we discuss this later sabrina said stepping between them weve got to get out of here what if someone heard the shots almakesh would have taken care of that graham said he would hardly have wanted anyone alerting the authorities would he i guess not sabrina replied then gestured towards the bodies what about them they take our places when the meat shipment leaves for syria tomorrow graham answered what if they check the container jenkins asked they wont if its sealed theyll just assume its us come on lets get them in the container they carried the bodies in silence across the room and dumped them into the wooden container graham then nailed on the lid can we get out of here now sure dave graham answered with a reassuring smile weve got to talk sabrina said to graham alone come back to the windorahjenkins offered you can talk there in private yeah well take you up on that dave graham said then suddenly looked despairingly at the sealed container oh god the keys for the van are here sabrina said jangling them behind graham well someone had to be alert what would i do without you graham replied facetiously what indeed she answered with a questioning glance in his direction before walking to the door jenkins unlocked one of the bedrooms when they got back to the windorah and switched on the light after he had crossed to the window to draw the curtains anyone thirsty id love a coffee sabrina said sinking into the armchair beside the window make that two graham added russell beer please dave laidlaw replied jenkins left the room you want me to leave as well laidlaw asked not until youve told me what the hell happened to make you trigger shy graham sat on the edge of the bed and looked up at laidlaw well laidlaws eyes flickered towards sabrina she knew shed read his dossier he pulled up the wooden chair from beside the bed and sat down last year we went into honduras to help the government troops suppress an attempted coup detat by communistbacked rebels wed been there about a week when we got news that the rebel leader and his council would be holding a meeting at a farmhouse on the outskirts of choluteca its a town in the south of the country rebel territory we were asked to infiltrate the area and retrieve as many documents as we could from the farmhouse but no prisoners why i dont know but those were our orders six of us went in there wasnt a single guard on duty when we got there that should have alerted us but as i said we had our orders we launched our offensive just as the meeting was supposed to have started three of us went in the front the other three through the back wed been told which room would be used for the meeting so we didnt have to search the whole building we threw stun grenades into the room then went in firing he shifted uncomfortably on the chair and wiped a bead of sweat that ran down the side of his face there were no rebels there just four missionaries and thirtyfive kids none of the kids were over ten orphans of the war it only took us a few seconds to realize the mistake but by then twentyeight kids and three of the missionaries were either dead or dying two of the kids and the fourth missionary died later in hospital five kids survived five out of thirtyfive the rebels blamed the massacre on the government troops and the government blamed it on the rebels it became just another story from central america nobody took much notice he rubbed his hands over his face the six of us were immediately flown back to the states to undergo psychiatric treatment i was the worst affected i couldnt touch a gun christ i even broke out into a sweat if i saw one on tv the other guys responded to treatment i didnt after six months the psychiatrists gave up on me so i was retired it was another six months before i was able to pick up a gun again but i still couldnt touch the trigger i wanted to shoot that bastard tonight mike my brain told me to pull the trigger but my finger wouldnt respond i know i should have told you earlier but i reasoned that if i did you wouldnt want me along and you needed a guide you wouldnt have lasted five minutes if youd gone after bernard by yourself they protect their own around here yeah i know graham stood up and patted laidlaw on the shoulder im sorry buddy i only wish youd told me this earlier like when we first met it would have saved a lot of unnecessary antagonism i realize that now laidlaw replied with a shrug but like i said i didnt think youd want me along i wouldnt have let you off that easily graham said with a halfsmile the door opened and jenkins entered carrying a tray he placed it on the bedside table laidlaw took a beer drank a mouthful then looked at graham you guys want us to leave sabrina nodded please mike and i need to talk sure laidlaw said then followed jenkins to the door graham closed the door behind them then turned back to sabrina youre here to take me back arent you yes then youre wasting your time i came out here to find bernard and thats what i intend to do she sat down then outlined the case to him careful not to leave anything out so what youre saying is that bernards the only person who knows when the hit on mobutos going to take place graham concluded once she had finished speaking she nodded and if you put a bullet into him before he can pass the information on to bailey then mobutos as good as dead it would almost certainly mean the return of a dictatorship to zimbala and the reinstatement of the security police could you live with that on your conscience for the rest of your life graham rubbed his hands over his face then stared thoughtfully at the carpet for some time before finally looking up at sabrina again til make a deal with you a deal she replied with a frown you help me find bernard forget it she cut in sharply hear me out sabrina if you help me find bernard ill wait until hes tipped off bailey before i kill him if you refuse then ill go after him regardless of what happens to mobuto could you live with that on your conscience for the rest of your life i dont believe what im hearing she replied what the hells the matter with you mike this isnt some game show where you barter with another contestant for the big prize were talking about a mans life here were talking about the future of a country if bernard gets away after tipping off bailey hes certain to be given a new identity by the cia he could go anywhere he wanted and id never find him again never let it go mike this vendettas going to destroy you you didnt kill barak i can vouch for that when we get back to the states youll catch hell for coming out here but that will be the end of it but if you kill bernard youll be thrown out of un a co you could even be indicted for murder is that what want i want bernard thats what i want and if they throw me out he trailed off with a shrug those are my terms sabrina take them or leave them you do what you want mike she snapped then got to her feet and strode to the door ive tried to reason with you i should have known better im going to call sergei and tell him whats happened graham grabbed her arm as she opened the door help me sabrina please i dont want anything to happen to mobuto but i have to go after bernard dont you see that i owe it to carrie and mikey i owe it to them she pulled her arm free and walked to the booth lifting the receiver off the wall she could hear jenkins and laidlaw talking in the bar room below her at least they were occupied she dialled the unlisted number identified herself to sarah at unaco headquarters and gave her the number of the phone to call back she replaced the receiver and tapped her fingers on the dogeared directory as she waited for it to ring graham appeared at the door she glanced at him but before he could speak the phone rang she picked up the receiver and had to identify herself again before she was patched through to kolchinsky sabrina speaking she replied you just caught me i was on my way home any news of michael she looked across at graham her mind still in turmoil over his ultimatum she knew if she helped him she would be reprimanded perhaps even suspended but if she refused mobutos life would certainly be at risk she had to make a choice then she thought of the picture graham always carried in his wallet of carrie and mikey what price justice if bernard were allowed to go free sabrina are you still there kolchinsky barked interrupting her thoughts sorry sergei its a bad line she lied its very clear this end i asked if there was any news of michael no not yet why was he set up what kolchinsky replied in surprise you know exactly what im talking about sergei i spoke to the policeman in charge of the case this afternoon he said the n ypd identified mike by his prints but they only know him as graham he travelled under the name of green how could they have matched the prints unless un ago authorized it we had no choice kolchinsky said at length if the beirut police had continued to probe who knows what they might have uncovered we had to protect the organization and what if mike gets arrested will un ago leave him to rot in some beirut jail to protect themselves he brought this on himself it was an unauthorized mission kolchinsky sighed deeply no we wouldnt leave him in some beirut jail wed get him out somehow but dont let it come to that sabrina find him and bring him back thats easier said than done all my enquiries have drawn a blank so far i suggest a change in tactics hes after bernard right if you find bernard first you wont have to chase after him any more hell come to you and then you can intercept him before he can get to bernard and how do you suggest i find bernard according to baileys dossier his bodyguards are hezbollah fundamentalists theyre hardly going to take very kindly to a woman poking her nose into their affairs are they they only act as his bodyguards in the lebanon he flew out of beirut last night destination habane he used the name alain devereux zimbala why i dont know bailey told me this morning and he only found out from one of his operatives who had seen bernard at beirut airport last night so he still hasnt contacted bailey about the hit not a word this is a critical stage of the operation sabrina thats why youve got to stop michael from getting to bernard ill get the next flight out to habane she assured him whos my contact in zimbala we dont have anyone in zimbala bailey offered to get one of his men at the embassy to liaise with you but i decided against it i dont want the cia interfering in our business what they will do is leave an envelope for you in one of the lockers at the airport itll contain your hotel reservation money maps of the city the usual ive also asked them to leave a beretta there for you the key will be at the information desk but apart from that youre on your own it wont be the first time she muttered call me when you get there i hope to have more on bernard by then hows the colonel hes fine i saw him this morning send him my regards when you next see him will you of course and sabrina be careful you can count on it she replaced the receiver and looked round at graham who was hovering at the door bernard left for zimbala last night i got the gist of the conversation why the sudden change of heart you were determined to spill the works when you went to the phone what good would it have done telling sergei id found you you wouldnt have come back with me anyway then id have had to chase after you wherever you went it would have been like something out of the keystone cops at least this way i know where you are and i know bernard will be able to tip off bailey before you get to him she gave him a wry smile well thats what ill say in my defence when i get back i dont think itll save me from suspension though why should you be suspended its not as if i gave you much choice you did what you thought was best under the circumstances the colonel cant fault you for that and what was all that about sending him your regards is he ill i havent told you have i with all this going on it completely slipped my mind told me what they returned to the room where she explained about philpotts heart attack and his subsequent convalescence at the bellevue hospital where he would remain for the next few days he can be a cantankerous old fossil at times but i hope this isnt going to force him to retire the place wouldnt be the same without him its up to his doctor to decide if hell be fit enough to return to work but the signs are encouraging by all accounts she gestured to the door well id better get back to the hotel and pack how will i know where youre staying once you reach zimbala youre sure to get there first we dont need to travel separately u n a c o dont have anyone in zimbala so word cant get back to sergei that were working together but word can get back to bernard remember he doesnt know what happened at the factory tonight as far as hes concerned im still a threat to him and that means hes sure to have people at the airport ready to intercept me the moment i arrive there what about me if almakesh knew we were with un a c o then bernards sure to know it as well and for all he knows we could be working together to track him down graham shook his head hell know the real reason why youre in beirut how sergei said bernard hasnt been in touch with bailey for days certainly not since cw and i were assigned to the case because almakesh knew why you were in beirut all bailey had to do was tell the mossad why you were here and they would have got almakesh to pass the information on to bernard how else do you think almakesh knew we were from un a co not from some informer on the street corner from the mossad graham sat on the bed and looked up at her bernard will make sure youre given a free hand wherever you go youre his guardian angelthe one person keeping me away from him no dont worry youll be perfectly safe in zimbala how are you going to get there i dont know yet my best bet would probably be to fly into one of the neighbouring states and sneak over the border at night which brings us back to my original question how will i know where to contact you ill have the use of a locker at the airport she trailed off with a despondent sigh sorry i forget you cant go near the airport leave it there ill sort something out what name will you be using he thought for a moment well i cant use michael green any more ill use the miles grant passport ok ill leave the key for the locker at the information counter she glanced at her watch as i said id better get back to the hotel i still have to make all the necessary travel arrangements before i go to bed see you in zimbala she walked to the door then paused to look back suspiciously at him ive put my neck on the block for you mike dont jump the gun and go after bernard by yourself no as if i would he replied his hands held out in a gesture of mock innocence his face suddenly became serious we made a deal ill stick to it sure she replied with a quick smile then left the room he returned to his room and pulled his holdall out from under the bed he could hear sabrina in the bar below talking to the two men then silence he turned his attention to rounding up his clothes and packing them in the holdall knock knock laidlaw said from the open doorway behind him come in russ graham said without looking round so youre off on your travels again where to now or cant you say you know the drill graham said youre going after bernard arent you graham zipped up his toilet bag and put it in the holdall perhaps you need an extra pair of hands graham looked round sharply and was about to shake his head when he paused to weigh up the pros and cons of the situation he was going into the unknown alone hell he didnt even know where he was going he could use someone with laidlaws experience he couldnt speak any foreign languages he knew laidlaw spoke french one of the main languages of zimbala but he was now officially working on un ago time and laidlaw was an outsider an outsider who couldnt even be relied upon to fire a gun in a crisis some decision in what do you know about zimbala small country in africa borders chad and niger it used to be a dictatorship ok graham cut in holding up his hands to silence laidlaw ive got to rendezvous with sabrina in zimbala shes flying there i cant risk that bernards sure to have his spies out looking for me im going to have to fly to either chad or niger and slip over the border by car but i dont speak french or arabic so im going to stick out like the proverbial sore thumb and that means attracting unnecessary attention that could get back to bernard and you want me to get you into zimbala you speak french and arabic laidlaw added then smiled wryly itll be like old times all i want you to do is get me to habane thats where im meeting sabrina then ill cut you loose graham immediately saw the disappointment in laidlaws eyes what if were caught in a firefight when we find bernard youd only be a liability i dont want your death on my conscience russ weve been through too much together laidlaw nodded his face grim i hear what youre saying mike ill get you to habane thanks graham said come on well sort out the flight arrangements downstairs laidlaw walked to the door then looked round at graham a faint smile touching the corners of his lips it wont be the first time ive had to come to your rescue and haul your ass out of trouble like hell graham replied goodhumouredly then picked up his holdall and followed laidlaw into the corridor closing the door behind him five whitlock drove his white bmw down the ramp into the basement carpark underneath his apartment block in manhattan he pulled into the reserved space beside a red porsche carrera carmens car he switched off the radio and glanced at his watch it had just gone six thirty he stifled a yawn it had been a long daytwelve hours with mobuto eight of those in the united nations building where mobuto and his entourage had spent the day mobutos address to the general assembly had impressed him it had been an eloquent impassioned speech in which he had promised to uphold the principles of democracy as the new leader of zimbala yet one aspect of the speech had surprised him mobuto had never once referred to his father by name or attempted to make any apology for the abhorrent crimes that had been committed under his regime it was as if he had blocked out that part of his life and was only interested in talking about the future the speech was well received by the delegates and a motion was carried unanimously to send a factfinding team to zimbala in six months time to monitor the situation with a view to readmitting the country to the united nations its original membership instated when the united nations was founded in been cancelled in when alphonse mobuto had refused to allow a delegation to visit zimbala to investigate accounts of mass genocide under his regime the motion had particularly pleased mobuto who was desperate to bring zimbala back into world affairs whitlock knew that the ambassadors of two western nations had already promised state visits to zimbala as soon as it was readmitted to the united nations it had been an historic day for the future of zimbala and it was all down to the tactful diplomacy of jamel mobuto whitlock had found his animosity towards mobuto beginning to waver as the day progressed he genuinely wanted to bring about change in a country where tens of thousands of its people had been tortured or murdered under his fathers regime they still treated each other with caution but each was beginning to respect the others professionalism and that was certainly a start whitlock had wanted to remain on duty for the banquet at the united nations that evening but kolchinsky had told him to call it a day he had reluctantly agreed to go home so the first day had passed uneventfully but it had been the easiest of the three days the following day mobuto intended to tour the africanamerican institute on east th street then go on to visit a highschool deep in the heart of harlem then on the third day he would be a guest at a trade fair held in new jersey two days of public exposure a security teams nightmare but that was what he was being paid for and after hearing mobuto at the united nations he was now more determined than ever to ensure his safety mobuto was a man with a mission a messiah the future of zimbala whitlocks thoughts were jolted by a sudden rap on the drivers window he looked round sharply then exhaled deeply when he saw the mans face peering in at him joshua marshall had been the parkingbay attendant ever since the apartment block had been opened eighteen years earlier he had grown up in the slums of harlem and had been a promising middleweight fighter in the late fifties before the lure of alcohol had devastated his career he had been dry for the past twenty years whitlock activated the window and clasped his hand over his chest you almost gave me a heart attack joshua i thought youd suffered one mr whitlock you havent moved since you parked the car i was thinking thats all whitlock removed the keys from the ignition and got out of the car how longs my wife been back joshua scratched his head thoughtfully about an hour she seemed in quite a hurry oh whitlock said locking the door did she say anything she didnt see me thanks joshua joshua touched his cap then ambled off back to his hut whitlock used his personal id card to activate the lift and tapped his foot apprehensively as he waited for it to arrive why had carmen been in such a hurry she never rushed anywhere she was always very graceful and calm what was wrong the lift doors parted and he smiled fleetingly at the couple who emerged then stepped inside and pressed the button for the seventh floor he paced the lift anxiously until it stopped and the doors parted again he strode briskly down the bluecarpeted corridor the apartment keys already in his hand the door opened directly onto the lounge carmen was standing by the window her sister rachel sat on the couch her hands clasped tightly together her eyes were red she had been crying he knew then that something had happened to rosie thank god youre back carmen said as he closed the door behind him whats wrong he asked his eyes flickering between the two women is it rosie rachel bit her lip as she struggled to hold back the tears shes gone what do you mean gone she had a blazing row with eddie and stormed out of the house rachel replied we dont know where shes gone whitlock sat down when did this happen about two hours ago eddie had just got back from work when they had a row in the kitchen she stormed out of the house im beside myself with worry cw shes only wearing a tshirt and jeans and she doesnt have any money im sure shes gone back to times square thats where shes been spending most of her time these last few months and one of the conditions of her bail was that she wasnt to go anywhere near times square until her case went to court carmen said whitlock rubbed his eyes wearily wheres eddie now hes out looking for her rachel replied but he doesnt know times square do you know any of her regular haunts there whitlock asked rachel shook her head rosie never tells us anything whitlock got to his feet well id better get over there its no use going now carmen told him you wouldnt know where eddie was hes phoning every twenty minutes to see if youre back when did he last phone about ten minutes ago carmen said glancing at her watch til go and change whitlock said are you hungry carmen asked theres a casserole in the oven i can put some out for you before you go no i had a big lunch ill eat later cw whitlock paused in the doorway to look back at rachel bring her home please whitlock nodded grimly and left the room rosie kruger was in the rollercoaster her favourite bar on west rd street less than a hundred yards away from the heart of times square she had her fathers pale blue eyes but her long black hair and honey complexion had been inherited from her mother she was sixteenyearsold but with her slim petite figure and attractive features she could have passed for twenty kenny doyle the twentyeightyearold barman at the rollercoaster knew her real age but that had never stopped him from serving her a drink he had been a good friend to her and when she walked out on her parents she had made straight for the bar looking for him he understood her plight he had run away from his home in chicago when he was fifteen and still bore the scars from the beating he had received at the hands of his father after his parents had discovered he was gay he had never contacted them again as far as he was concerned he had no parents rosie felt the same way about her parents her father was on the brink of alcoholism a pathetic figure who could only face life if he had a bottle in his hand she knew he was on the verge of losing his job not that it really mattered to him any more he had lost his dignity years ago and her mother was too weak to stop his drinking rosie had been the one who had had to put her father to bed every night for eighteen months while her mother took refuge behind the facade of a sordid affair with her boss a divorcee and then it had only ended after he had decided to go back to his wife no it wasnt only her father who had lost his dignity she could remember vividly the first time she had tried dope the day that she had found out about her mothers affair from one of her classmates she had felt cheap and degraded bitter she had shared a joint with some friends in the toilet they each had a few tokes and by the time the roach was flushed away she was already experiencing her first rush a warm dreamy sensation that seemed to encompass her whole being she never wanted it to end a week later she made her first score from a dealer in times square it made putting her father to bed that bit more bearable she had been smoking dope now for the last year scoring whenever she had saved up enough money from her weekend job at mcdonalds then the previous day it had all gone wrong she had met her connection in the usual place but the moment the deal was struck they were busted by three plainclothes policemen who had been watching them from an unmarked car on the opposite side of the road they were both frisked then cuffed and taken into custody it was the most humiliating and frightening night of her life she had never been so glad to see her mother that morning all she wanted to do was get out of the cell it stank of vomit and urine and for those few hours after she got home she found she could talk to her mother properly for the first time in over two years there was even a bond of understanding between them then her father had come home all he had done was scream abuse at her accusing her of bringing shame and disgrace on the family the double standards appalled her it was then she knew she couldnt stay there not with him she knew she was violating her bail conditions by being in the rollercoaster but she also knew she would be perfectly safe if she kept a low profile and she knew kenny would look after her what you drinking sweetheart the voice startled her but when she looked round she winced at the stale smell of alcohol on the mans breath he was wearing a grey suit his tie undone at the throat she estimated he was in his early thirties youre real pretty he said and reached out his hand to touch her face back off she snapped and jerked away hey leave my girl alone doyle said from behind the counter the man eyed doyle contemptuously then muttered something to himself and moved to another table and sat down thanks she said squeezing doyles hand any time doyle replied hows the bourbon im o k thanks anyway i havent got how many times must i tell you the drinks are on the house tonight why are all the best guys either married or like you youre too young to be so cynical doyle said youll meet the right guy some day then what take him home to meet my parents she replied with a look of mock horror doyle chuckled then left her to serve a customer she looked slowly around the room it wasnt busy not yet but give it another hour she was about to reach for her drink when she caught sight of the car out of the corner of her eye as it pulled up on the opposite side of the roada white bmw identical to the one her uncle had she held her breath as the drivers door opened whitlock got out a moment later eddie kruger emerged from the passenger side and closed the door behind him kenny rosie hissed beckoning the barman towards her what is itdoyle asked its my father and hes brought my uncle with him she said indicating with her head towards the bmw where whitlock and kruger were in conversation doyle took a set of keys from his pocket removed one and gave it to her its for the back door you know where it is is it that one next to the mens room he nodded it leads into an alley behind the bar wait there ill get rid of them dont worry ill send someone out to call you when theyve gone she made her way down the corridor that led off from the bar room continually glancing over her shoulder half expecting to see either her father or her uncle behind her she reached the door and unlocked it her hands were trembling she pushed it open and slipped outside closing it silently behind her a cold wind had picked up since she had arrived at the bar and she rubbed her arms quickly before picking her way through a sea of discarded newspaper to a metal drum and ducked down behind it her eyes riveted on the door she knew doyle would do his best to protect her but what if they decided to search the place anyway including the alley the wind sliced through the alley and blew a sheet of old newspaper against her leg she brushed it away then huddled closer to the wall hugging herself against the cold a stray mongrel appeared at the end of the alley its body gaunt from years of neglect it sniffed the air then made straight for the drum it stopped abruptly when it saw rosie an uncertainty shadowing its haunted eyes then it moved closer and began to scratch frantically at the foot of the bin a rat suddenly darted out from a hole in the side of the drum and she had to bite back the scream that rose in her throat it scurried over to a pile of old newspapers with the mongrel in close attendance the mongrel tore savagely at the newspapers and the rat fled further down the alley desperate for sanctuary rosie lost sight of it when it disappeared behind a cardboard box and she turned her attention back to the door she inhaled sharply when she saw the figure there it was the man in the grey suit who had tried to pick her up earlier he was looking at the bin but she didnt know whether he had seen her or not you can come out now he said beckoning towards her with his finger theyve gone she didnt move why had kenny sent him out to tell her or had he had the man overheard her talking to kenny she was frightened very frightened i know youre behind the drum he said taking a step towards it i told you theyve gone youre safe now she slowly got to her feet her eyes wide with fear the cold didnt bother her any more he held out a hand towards her she instinctively shrunk back against the wall her hands clasped tightly against her chest his smile was chilling she opened her mouth but she couldnt speak her throat was dry her lips were dry he stopped in front of her and wrenched her hands away from her chest she wanted to run but her legs wouldnt move she wanted to scream but no sound came from her throat a faint sneer of satisfaction touched the corners of his mouth she squeezed her eyes shut as she felt his hand slip under her tshirt leave her alone the man looked round sharply at the figure who had emerged silently from inside the bar he was wearing a pair of faded blue jeans a white shirt and a black leather jacket a faint scar ran the length of his left cheek youll get your ass out of here if you know whats good for you the man snarled menacingly bernard glanced at rosie go inside the two men have gone like hell you are the man snarled and grabbed her arm she raked his face with her fingernails he cried out in pain and stumbled back against the wall she jerked her arm free and ran to where bernard was standing inside bernard ordered indicating the door with his head her eyes flickered momentarily between the two men then she pulled open the door and hurried inside youre going to pay for that you sonofabitch the man hissed through clenched teeth as he wiped the blood from his cheek with the back of his hand bernard eyed the man contemptuously then dropped his cigarette and ground it underfoot the man lunged clumsily at bernard who ducked his wild punch and landed a vicious one of his own catching him painfully in the kidney the man stumbled against the wall and bernard followed through with two more crippling kidney punches dropping the man to his knees he grabbed the mans hair and slammed his face against the wall the man slumped into an unconscious heap at bernards feet bernard brushed his hands together then walked back to the door it swung open as he was about to reach out for the handle doyle stood in the doorway a baseball bat clenched tightly in his right hand its o k bernard reassured him he wont touch the girl again tonight doyle peered at the crumpled figure bastard i was ready to take his head off when rosie told me what had happened you know him never seen him before doyle replied then held open the door for bernard thanks for helping her most people around here would have just looked the other way is she your girl bernard asked as they walked back to the bar room just a friend a good friend the waitress who had been covering for doyle behind the bar eyed the baseball bat questioningly when he returned i didnt have to do anything doyle replied placing the bat under the counter again this gentleman took care of the situation he looked at bernard the least i can do is buy you a drink a diet cola if you have it bernard replied then eased himself onto the stool beside rosie are you alright she nodded i dont know how i can ever thank you if you hadnt come along when you did she trailed off as she struggled to hold back the tears would you like another drink he asked indicating her empty glass please she replied softly then looked at him for the first time since he had sat down i dont even know your name marc giresse he replied quoting the name on his passport im rosie kruger she looked round as doyle returned with the diet cola i was just saying if you hadnt sent mr giresse out when you did i hate to think what would have happened to me i didnt send him out doyle replied i was about to come out myself rosie and doyle looked at bernard simultaneously i was at the table behind you bernard said to rosie i saw what happened when that guy tried to pick you up then when he followed you down the corridor i thought id better make sure you were alright how did you know about my father and my uncle i overheard you two talking bernard replied with a sheepish grin its a bad habit of mine i tend to do it when im bored im sure glad you did rosie replied with a smile doyles eyes flickered to the nearest table behind rosie it was occupied by a young couple in their early twenties although he didnt know them he could have sworn they had been there for the past hour and they were sitting on the only two chairs at the table he looked at bernard frowned then glanced round sharply when he heard someone calling him from the end of the counter a drink for the lady when you have a minute bernard said as doyle turned to go sure doyle replied then went off to serve the customer giresse rosie said thoughtfully is that french bernard nodded you dont sound french you dont look it either youre very swarthy my father was french i was born in tarabulus wheres that she asked the lebanon a sly smile touched the corners of her mouth youre not a terrorist are you sure bernard replied then shook his head you americans never cease to amaze me everyone has to be neatly packaged into defined groups if youre russian you must be a communist if youre colombian you must be a drug dealer if youre libyan or lebanese you must be a terrorist i was only joking she said with a grin i know i only wish i could say the same about your politicians bernard took a sip of the diet cola then leaned his elbows on the counter im a humble businessman thats all meat packaging far less glamorous than being a terrorist im afraid do you know any terrorists you meet lots of different kinds of people in the lebanon bernard replied then dismissed the topic with a vague flick of his hand are you a runaway the question caught rosie by surprise normally she would have clammed up at that juncture she made it a point to tell people as little about herself as possible she never shared her inner thoughts with anyone not even her friends at school who had come to regard her as something of an enigma yet she felt completely at ease with bernard it was a feeling she had never had before not even with kenny and he was probably the best friend she ever had she felt as if she could trust bernard and she had never trusted anyone before in her life part of her was frightened it was a new experience for her to want to open up to someone especially a man but another part of her was relieved to have found a kindred spirit she could confide in sorry i didnt mean to pry bernard said noticing her distant expression no you werent prying she replied with a quick smile i guess i am a runaway i left home tonight its a start bernard said with a smile he held up his glass welcome to the club were you also a runaway she asked excitedly he nodded i knew it a kindred spirit she said softly to herself pardon nothing she said then looked up as doyle returned with her bourbon mr giresse was also a runaway small world very small doyle replied tersely then placed the bourbon in front of her his eyes darted towards bernard there was something about the man he didnt trust and his instincts were rarely wrong where you from beirut bernard replied holding doyles stare he suddenly smiled how much is the drink im paying for rosies drinks tonight doyle replied quickly please i insist bernard said then took a fivedollar note from his wallet and placed it on the counter have one yourself no thank you doyle replied and left the note on the counter when he walked off to serve another customer whats wrong with your friend bernard asked slipping the note back into his wallet rosie shrugged he gets like this sometimes i suppose i would too if i had to serve all the creeps that come in here every night thank you bernard retorted you know what i mean she replied then saw the smile on his face stop teasing me his face suddenly became serious have you got somewhere to stay tonight she instinctively looked across at doyle i was hoping kenny could put me up for a few days until id sorted things out with my parents but he cant hes got someone staying with him theres a couple of friends i know who might be able to give me a bed for the night ill try them and what if they cant she shrugged til find a flop house somewhere ive got a few bucks on me but dont tell kenny i told him i was broke thats crazy you cant go walking around new york by yourself at this time of night look ive got a spare room you can use it if you want thanks but she trailed off with an awkward shrug i mean i dont even know you likewise bernard replied he bit his lip thoughtfully ill tell you what call your friends and see if they can put you up for the night if they cant you can either stay at the flat or else ill give you some money and drop you off at a hotel why are you doing this my father raised me i never knew my mother he was the only family i had he died when i was fourteen so i ran off to beirut to avoid being put into an orphanage the first night there i was accosted by three men i managed to get away but he paused and touched the scar on his cheek they left me with a memento it looks a lot better on me than it would on you you got off lightly in the alley tonight dont push your luck she pondered his words then glanced at the pay phone in the corner of the bar you got any quarters bernard rifled through the change pouch in his wallet and handed her three quarters is that enough she nodded then climbed off her stool and crossed the room to the phone she dialled the first number no reply then she tried the second it was answered by a man threes company she said to herself and hung up when she turned round she found doyle standing in front of her here take this he said pushing a tendollar note into her hand whats this for taxi fare to my place you can stay there tonight but what about that guy hell understand doyle replied have you phoned to tell him im coming over i tried but hes not in hell be at a club i appreciate the offer kenny but i cant stay with you guys it wouldnt be right why not doyle demanded defensively you can pad out on the sofa it just wouldnt be right she replied with a shrug and slipped the money back into his pocket so where are you going to stay ill find a crash pad somewhere she said trying to reassure him i heard that lebanese guy offer you a room at his place dont go rosie theres something pseudo abopt him yeah what she demanded i dont know its just a gut feeling thats all oh really she retorted sharply hes been a perfect gentleman ever since i met him and you dont find many of them in this dive hes trouble rosie she shook her head angrily youve been acting weird ever since he started talking to me whats really bugging you kenny are you jealous that were getting along so well jealous doyle replied in disbelief grow up rosie im worried about you thats all yeah well dont bother i can look after myself she spun on her heels and walked back to where bernard was sitting til take you up on that offer of a bed if its still going sure bernard replied can we go now bernard looked round at her now its only eight thirty then lets go somewhere else she glanced up at doyle as he returned behind the bar this place has got distinctly chilly in the last couple of minutes bernard shrugged youll have to recommend somewhere im a stranger in these parts i know lots of places she retorted then glared at doyle before striding out of the bar bernard watched her leave it was beyond his wildest expectations all he had intended to do was keep tabs on her in case he needed a hostage after the hit on mobuto whitlocks niece the perfect weapon to foil un a co his american contact had told him where to find her he didnt know his name he only knew him by his codeword seabird no he couldnt have asked for it to have turned out better he pushed the diet cola away from him and climbed off the stool it was then that he noticed doyle watching him he allowed himself a faint smile of satisfaction then slipped the fivedollar note under rosies glass and left the bar whitlock closed the door behind eddie and rachel kruger then returned to the lounge and slumped dejectedly onto the sofa you did your best cw carmen said massaging his shoulders it wasnt enough was it whitlock replied between us we must have been to every bar within a mile radius of times square nothing that could be a good thing in itself if someone is shielding her then shell probably have a bed for the night god i hope so whitlock said then got to his feet and moved to the balcony where he looked out over the illuminated new york skyline its almost midnight cw carmen said from the doorway weve both got to be up early in the morning i know whitlock replied but made no attempt to move away from the railing youve done everything you could to find her shes on her own now i still say we should have called the police weve been through this already eddie and rachel decided against it we have to respect that shes their daughter not ours if she was our daughter she wouldnt be in this mess whitlock retorted wouldnt she whitlock looked round sharply at her then conceded the point with a shrug of the shoulders come on lets go to bed take care of yourself kid whitlock said softly then went inside and closed the sliding door behind him robert bailey was obsessed with security he drove to work in a bulletproof mercedes oosl changing his route daily his personal bodyguards were always armed his wife and two teenage daughters were ferried about by an armed chauffeur and his house in the georgetown suburb of washington was a virtual fortress tripwires lined the top of the perimeter wall and armed doghandlers patrolled the grounds twentyfour hours a day closedcircuit television cameras had been installed in every room and were monitored by guards from a control centre in the basement of the houseevery room that is except his study it was a soundproof windowless room at the end of the corridor on the second floor the only access was through a sliding metal door which could only be activated by punching a code into the bellpush on the adjacent wall he changed the combination daily nobody not even his family was allowed inside the room it contained his personal computer which was linked to computers at both the pentagon and the cia headquarters in langley hundreds of secret programs that had been built up by the cia over the years including data sensitive enough to topple the heads of half a dozen european governments if they were ever to fall into the wrong hands with this in mind he had devised more security measures to thwart any wouldbe intruder that managed to get past the guards the computer itself could only be activated by an access code known solely to bailey if the incorrect code was programmed in it would activate a canister of lethal nerve gas which was secreted in the ceiling directly above the door death would result in less than ten seconds but he had provided a double failsafe mechanism for himself in case he accidently pressed the wrong key while accessing the code the nerve gas would only be released if the incorrect code was programmed twice into the computer he was after all only human after feeding in the access code he sat back and stifled a yawn it was already one in the morning he was exhausted he had been up seventeen hours his wife and daughters had long since gone to bed they were accustomed to his irregular hours but they all shared his ambition to become head of the cia within the next five years and he knew he had the backing of the president and most of the powerful republican congressmen on capitol hill it was only a question of time he tapped another code into the computer and moments later a dossier appeared on the vdu the name on it was jeanjacques bernard he erased all the existing data and replaced it with a single line written in capital letters to be terminated after the assassination of jamel mobuto six sabrina flew out of beirut the following morning on a ugandan boeing bound for kampala via habane and khartoum it was barely half full it touched down at habane international airport six hours later and she was one of only eight passengers to disembark they were met on the tarmac by a friendly ground stewardess and driven the fivehundred yards to the small ovalshaped terminal building the interior had recently been redecorated and the pungent odour of fresh paint still hung in the air armed soldiers stood guard inside the building and she could feel the tension as she joined the short queue waiting to pass through passport control the official ran his eyes the length of her body as she approached the counter then held out his hand for her passport he wet his finger then leafed through it slowly before looking up at her what is the nature of your visit to zimbala miss cassidy he asked in a thick english accent im a journalist she replied with a smile and this country is news at the moment and how long do you intend staying in zimbala that all depends on my editor i would hope to be here for about a week though the official stamped the passport then handed it back to her your visa is valid for ten days if you wish to stay longer you will have to apply to have it renewed thank you she replied slipping the passport back into the pocket of her fawn blouson enjoy your stay in zimbala he said with a halfsmile then beckoned the next person in line to step forward to the counter she collected her lightweight vuitton suitcase then went to the information counter where she picked up the locker key that had been left there for her the lockers were situated at the far end of the terminal she unlocked the one corresponding to the number on the key inside was a black holdall she unzipped it it contained a beretta tucked into a boyt shoulder holster and a manila envelope she opened the envelope and took out the fax confirming her hotel booking the hotel was called the international taking a pen and notepad from her overnight bag she wrote down the name and address for graham then placed the sheet of paper inside the locker and closed it again she returned to the information counter and asked the stewardess for an envelope she put the key inside the envelope sealed it and wrote miles grant across it then told the stewardess that a mr grant would collect it later picking up her suitcase she went outside to look for a taxi she slipped on her sunglasses then crossed to the nearest taxi which was parked directly opposite the main entrance a white toyota the driver beamed at her then took her suitcase and put it carefully in the boot where to missy he asked the international she replied the driver frowned momentarily then nodded it only called the international after the president die it built many years now and always called alphonse mobuto hotel that figures she muttered the driver closed the back door behind her got in then climbed behind the wheel and pulled out into the road heading for the exit a pale blue cortina which had been parked in the carpark followed at a discreet distance there were two men in the car both wore blue overalls the driver was gordon gubene a former sergeant in the security police who had driven the van when ngune was sprung from jail thomas massenga sat beside him in a black leather cap and dark sunglasses he opened the glove compartment and removed a walther he had lost count of the number of assassinations he had carried out during his seventeen years with the security police dozens certainly men women children it had never made any difference to him he slipped the pistol into his overall pocket then picked up the brown folder off the dashboard it had been given to him the previous day at the airport by a man known only to him as columbus inside was a photograph of sabrina columbus had told him that she was part of a team which had been assigned to track down the assassins before they could carry out the hit on jamel mobuto she had to be stopped before she could uncover any incriminating evidence in zimbala he had long since memorized her face but it was the first chance he had had to compare it to her in person it did her little justice but he had no time for sentimentality she was the enemy and he would kill her once she reached her destination sabrina was immediately struck by the number of blocks of flats all of identical height and width that lined the road into habane tall unsightly structures positioned equidistantly from each other and painted a depressing shade of grey dont you have any houses around here she asked finally house not here the driver answered without taking his eyes off the road other side habane plenty money house for rich peoples but surely all that will change now that alphonse mobuto is dead the driver shrugged no money to build house thats why jamel mobuto went to america isnt it to get money to rebuild the country good man jamel mobuto not bad like his father sabrina just nodded realizing she was talking way over his head she suddenly wondered if he even knew that jamel mobuto was in america probably not where you from missy america she replied like chicago chicagos in america yes but im from new york the yankees he said grinning at her in the rearview mirror f thats right you like baseball he nodded we see baseball on television and football chicago bears my team ive got a friend who played professional football he was a quarterback for the new york giants your boyfriend he asked excitedly no just a friend she replied with a smile wondering how graham would have reacted to being called her boyfriend he still play she shook her head no he injured his arm in vietnam he couldnt play again vietnam the driver said with a frown what their team called she was about to explain then decided against it it would only lead to more misunderstanding she fell silent the military presence became significantly stronger the closer they got to habane apart from the roadblocks manned by soldiers armed with mis old mi tanks stood menacingly on every street corner she could sense the same tension that she had felt back at the airport most of the soldiers they passed were still in their teens the uncertainty of the situation etched onto their youthful features they wouldnt stand a chance against the heavily armed and welldisciplined squad of exsecurity policemen that were reportedly amassing in the south of the country but the reports un ago had received were mostly hearsay from locals in and around kondese much of it would be propaganda spread by ngune and his officers they had also received the draft of a statement made by a deserter who had fled to chad he claimed that the squad wasnt nearly as big as western intelligence had feared and that there was a bitter internal struggle amongst the officers about who would be included in ngunes cabinet once they had seized power the animosity was running so high that one officer had already been executed by ngune for killing a fellow officer in an argument un ac o were well aware that the deserter could be a plant to try and lull jamel mobuto into a false sense of complacency but they knew his claims could also be genuine all they could do was await developments mobuto had so far refused the offer of a united nations peacekeeping force in zimbala insisting that his troops would be able to crush any uprising by ngune and his rebels sabrina didnt share his optimism it worried her hotel the driver announced what sabrina replied her thoughts interrupted hotel the driver repeated pointing it out the international was a boxshaped building painted out in white and gold it was certainly nothing spectacular and it was reputedly the best hotel in town she shuddered to think what the worst was like the driver stopped the taxi in the forecourt and a doorman immediately stepped forward and opened the back door he doffed his cap to sabrina when she climbed out and snapped his fingers at a porter who came hurrying over and took the suitcase from the boot what it lacked in appearance it seemed to make up for in service she used some of the money in the envelope to pay the driver thank you he said appreciatively if you want to go anywhere i take you my name is harris the staff know me she nodded then bit her lip thoughtfully as she watched him climb back into the taxi and drive away had she tipped him too generously hed probably ripped her off anyway she made a mental note to study the currency more closely once she got to her room the cortina slowed to a crawl and as it drew abreast of the hotel mcssenga took the walther from his pocket and aimed it at sabrina get down a voice yelled but before sabrina could react she was bundled roughly to the ground in the same moment as massenga fired the bullet smashed into the wall massenga cursed angrily unable to get in another shot at sabrina who had rolled to safety behind one of the two concrete pillars that stood on either side of the doors he snapped at gubene who immediately accelerated and sped off down the road the doorman who had taken sanctuary behind the other pillar sprang to his feet and ran over to where sabrina lay he helped her up his eyes wide with concern are you alright she rubbed her bruised elbow painfully im alright i hope that wasnt a traditional zimbalan welcome rebels the doorman spat angrily now they are shooting at tourists sabrinas mind was in turmoil why had someone just tried to kill her who outside un ago knew she was in zimbala the questions disturbed her but pushing them from her mind she turned to the man who had shouted the warning before knocking her to the ground he was a small man in his forties with a thin face and wirerimmed glasses she was about to thank him when the manager emerged from the hotel and hurried over to them the doorman explained in swahili what had happened and the manager immediately began to apologize but sabrina held up her hand to silence him its not your fault she said with a quick smile are you hurt no im fine the manager ushered her into the foyer and led her across to the reception desk im sure you want to get up to your room but we need you to fill in the register first im sure you understand she was becoming irritated by the way he was treating her like a child but she let it pass and completed the formalities ill let you know when the police arrive miss cassidy the manager said after the receptionist had handed her key to the porter dont call the police on my account i told you im fine i must by law well you know where to find me now if youll excuse me of course the manager replied then bowed curtly before withdrawing to his office to phone the police she turned to the man in the wireframed glasses and held out her hand sabrina cassidy i owe you my life thank you joseph moredi he replied shaking her hand firmly he led her away from the reception desk can we talk what about he glanced at the porter who was hovering beside him then turned back to sabrina not here can we go to your room i appreciate what you did for me but i do feel a little shaken right now perhaps you could please miss cassidy he cut in it is important o k she replied seeing the intensity in his eyes they took the lift to the fourth floor and the porter led them to the room it was spacious and tastefully decorated with a bathroom en suite the window overlooked the main road sabrina tipped the porter after he had put the suitcase on the luggage stand and closed the door behind him i know who tried to kill you miss cassidy rebels i believe you call them sabrina replied his names massenga thomas massenga he was deputy head of the security police for the last five years before it was disbanded he walked to the window then turned back to look at sabrina these rebels as you call them arent in the habit of tailing foreigners from the airport and trying to shoot them outside their hotels massenga took a great personal risk coming out in the open like that i dont know who youre working for but your investigations are obviously linked to the mobuto brothers its the only reason massenga would have tried to kill you to prevent you from stumbling on the truth this is all very interesting mr moredi miss cassidy your lifes in danger he snapped angrily then held up his hands apologetically im sorry i didnt mean to shout at you like that i can appreciate your wanting to keep your cover intact and i know whats going through your mind right now youre thinking that i could be working in league with massenga and the shooting outside the hotel was all staged to try and get you into my confidence believe me it wasnt but i dont expect you to take my word for that jamel mobuto will vouch for me we were at oxford together im sure your organization can contact him in new york tell him to set a question that only the real joseph moredi would be able to answer then call me at this number he took a business card from his pocket and placed it on the dresser we can help each other miss cassidy please call me she waited until he had left the room then crossed to the dresser and picked up the card joseph moredi deputy editor of la voix remy mobutos newspaper if he was who he claimed to be then he could prove to be a valuable contact for them in zimbala there was only one way to find out she sat down on the edge of the bed and dialled un ago headquarters in new york massenga climbed out of the car after gubene had parked it in the garage of the safe house and slammed the door angrily behind him gubene waited until he had stalked out of the garage before getting out of the car himself and locking the drivers door moments later he heard massenga unlocking the front door and he winced as it hammered against the wall then silence he exhaled deeply then closed the garage door and walked down the narrow path he pushed open the front door gingerly with his fingers and entered he found massenga perched on the edge of the sofa in the lounge his hand resting lightly on the telephone you want a drink gubene asked apprehensively gesturing towards the cabinet in the corner of the room massenga shook his head then looked down at the telephone what am i supposed to tell him the truth gubene replied then crossed to the drinks cabinet and poured himself a scotch that we failed massenga said then slumped back on the sofa hell crucify us you know that you couldnt have anticipated what happened shed be dead now if that man hadnt intervened when he did it wasnt your fault you want to tell that to ngune youre the only one with his number gubene said with a shrug then left the room closing the door quietly behind him massenga dialled the number he had memorized ngune answered it immediately at the other end massenga told him what had happened at the hotel so shes still alive ngune concluded once massenga had finished yes sir massenga muttered and who was this knight in shining armour ngune asked sarcastically as he struggled to control his temper i didnt get a good look at him sir massenga replied it all happened so quickly you disappoint me thomas i thought you were the one person i could rely on to carry out an order i couldnt have anticipated his intervention sir massenga replied defensively remembering gubenes words i want results not excuses ngune snarled angrily and if you cant get them for me ill find someone who can do i make myself clear yes sir find out the identity of the man then call me do you want him killed if its not asking too much ngune retorted facetiously ill see to it sir i hope so thomas if i have to send someone else to habane it could seriously jeopardize your chances of becoming the new head of the security police once were in power remember that yes sir i realize massenga trailed off when he heard the dialling tone he replaced the receiver then crossed to the drinks cabinet and poured himself a scotch he had a feeling it was going to be a long night sabrina was studying a map of the city when there was a knock at the door she picked up the beretta off the bedside table and peered through the spyhole it was the man with the wireframed glasses she opened the door inside she said beckoning him into the room he entered and she closed the door behind him his smile faltered when he saw the beretta in her hand you wont need that i assure you not if youre really joseph moredi but i dont know that yet do i he swallowed nervously and nodded hesitantly did you speak to jamel mobuto not personally i had one of my colleagues do it and did he set a question for me she nodded could we get on with it he said anxiously his eyes darting towards the gun aimed at his stomach while you were at oxford you once went to a rugby match together who was playing ive never been to a rugby match in my life we once went to a football match together arsenal was the home team who were they playing he mused thoughtfully they werent from london black and white striped shirts he suddenly snapped his fingers together and pointed at sabrina newcastle sabrina lowered the gun im glad you got that right not half as glad as i am moredi said indicating the gun in her hand but why did you say rugby he trailed off with a knowing smile of course a trick question an added precaution she replied then indicated the armchair in the corner of the room please wont you sit down mr moredi thank you he said and eased himself into the armchair she replaced the beretta on the table and sat on the bed one thing still puzzles me how did massenga know i would be on that plane he was obviously tipped off but by whom i couldnt say he shrugged was i right about your investigation being linked to the mobuto brothers yes but i cant go into details i appreciate that moredi suddenly sat forward his arms resting on his knees jamel and remy mobuto have been friends of mine for over twenty years and now theyre both in danger ill do anything i can to help them anything you said earlier that massenga tried to kill me to prevent me from stumbling on the truth what exactly did you mean by the truth i only know part of it remys the only one who knows the whole truth and he was kidnapped earlier today by massenga by him or on his orders massengas been ngunes righthand man for the past five years an anonymous caller telephoned me at the newspaper to say that the rebels were holding remy do you have any idea where hes being held i have it on good authority from one of my more reliable sources that hes being held at the branco prison in kondese in the south of the country a couple of hours drive from here how much did remy mobuto tell you before he was kidnapped only that he was onto a story about a plot to assassinate his brother it was something big or so he claimed it involved ngune massenga and a third man the man who would pull the trigger did he mention a name moredi shook his head he knew who it was but he wouldnt tell me not until he had the proof he needed to publish the story remy was like that he always played his cards close to his chest he went to a rendezvous with an informant who had that proof thats when he was abducted and the informant blood was found in his car but there was no sign of him so remy is the key to this whole affair moredi nodded not only does he know who will pull the trigger he also knows where and when the assassination will take place does the name bernard mean anything to you sabrina asked moredi bit his lip thoughtfully then shook his head no i cant say it does who is he that i cant tell you sabrina replied apologetically at least not for the moment i understand sabrina bit her lip thoughtfully why dont the army check out this branco prison to see if remy mobuto is being held there kondese is rebel country the army wont go there theyre waiting up here in the north for ngune to make his first move so its a stalemate at the moment yes but jamel intends to get his generals round the table for talks when he gets back from america he wants to crush ngune and his rebels before they set out for habane thats certainly one of the reasons why ngune wants jamel dead he believes it would throw the army into disarray would it yes moredi replied bluntly but then the armys already in disarray many of the soldiers had friends and relatives in the security police now theyre on opposite sides but will the army try and stop ngunes men if they do march on habane or will they join them nobody really knows the answer thats what makes it all so uncertain zimbalas a powder keg waiting to explode all it needs is a single spark to set it off thats why jamel wants to stop ngune in his tracks if ngune does march on habane then the sparks will fly and whoever does win will have inherited a country bathed in the blood of innocent people jamel doesnt want that he saw enough bloodshed under his fathers regime i still dont see why massenga tried to kill me this afternoon if remy mobuto is the only person who knows whats going on then how can i be a threat to them theyve got him theyre holding the aces not me they obviously think youre out here to find him that could ruin everything for them sabrina propped a pillow against the wall and leaned back against it how long have you had massenga under surveillance how did you know that why else would you have been at the hotel when he tried to kill me moredi smiled youre very astute i dont know how long hes been in habane an informant con tacted us two days ago and said hed seen massenga we checked out the story and ive had a team of reporters watching him ever since he wont know hes being watched why dont you tell the police about massenga two reasons firstly if they did arrest massenga it could put remys life in danger and secondly there are policemen who are sympathetic to ngune they would tip him off and massenga would be pulled out this way he could still lead us to remy i know its a long shot but weve got to take it moredi paused to wet his lips ive been watching him ever since he went to the airport this afternoon actually its the second time hes been to the airport in the last two days he met someone there yesterday off a flight from beirut around noon they spoke for about an hour then the man flew out again i couldnt find out his name only that hed taken a pan am flight to new york via morocco and bermuda describe him he was pretty distinctive tall goodlooking black hair black moustache and a scar sabrina added tracing her finger down her left cheek yes moredi replied in surprise how did you know sabrina swung her legs off the bed ive got to make an urgent phone call in private oh of course moredi said getting to his feet til go down to the bar and get a beer would you like anything a diet cola moredi left the room sabrina rang kolchinsky at un ago headquarters and briefed him on what moredi had told her so bernard met massenga in habane kolchinsky said once she had finished i dont see anything suspicious in that he is supposed to be working with them remember its part of his cover that may be sergei but it seems a bit of a coincidence that massenga tries to kill me the day after he meets bernard youre reading too much into this meeting sabrina it would certainly explain the attempt on my life this afternoon how else would massenga know i was due in zimbala its a possibility i agree kolchinsky conceded and what about this third man that remy mobuto mentioned it has to be bernard why does it have to be bernard kolchinsky retorted what do the cia have to gain by assassinating mobuto who says its on cia orders he could have made a private deal with ngune to kill mobuto and doublecross bailey he wouldnt live long enough to spend the money put yourself in bernards shoes sergei baileys sure to have promised him a new identity once this is all over but bernards no fool he knows the cia will never use him again so whats he got to lose by contracting himself to ngune there was a pause while kolchinsky pondered her words so youre suggesting that bailey would have him killed rather than give him a new identity he knows too much but you dont have a shred of evidence to back up this elaborate theory of yours remy mobuto has the evidence im convinced of that now remy mobuto has been kidnapped and hes being held in kondese dont even think of it sabrina kolchinsky snapped sharply youve been assigned to find michael not to poke about in rebel country looking for remy mobuto stay away from kondese thats an order yes sergei sabrina muttered through clenched teeth i think it would be better if you caught the next available flight back to the states after all if moredis right then bernards here now and michaels sure to be close behind him til make the necessary arrangements there was a knock at the door ive got to go sergei moredis back ill call you if there are any new developments before i leave otherwise ill see you back in new york fine goodbye sabrina she replaced the receiver then crossed to the door and peered through the spyhole it was moredi she opened the door finished he asked sure she replied and stood aside to let him in he handed her a can of diet cola what happens now nothing she replied opening the can at least not until ive heard from my partner where is your partner i havent the faintest idea she replied then moved to the window and looked down into the street but hed better contact me soon were running out of time fast not another roadblock graham said tersely seeing the army patrol ahead of them this is the third one in as many miles it is the airport road theyre obviously taking no chances laidlaw replied bringing the white toyota to a halt behind a rusty blue fiat graham looked out of the passenger window and counted eight vehicles ahead of them he threw up his arms in despair all they could do was wait it had been laidlaws idea that they both dress as priests he had borrowed the costumes from a friend who ran a small theatre in west beirut on the pretext of needing them for a fancydress party the following evening they had changed into the costumes before leaving for the airport that morning where they had caught a direct flight to ndjamena the capital of chad laidlaw had hired the car at ndjamena airport and they had driven the eighty miles to the chadianzimbalan border where thezimbalan authorities had issued them with tenday visas like sabrina they were stopped regularly by army patrols on the main highway into habane but each time they were waved on when the soldiers realized they were priests and judging by the size of the military presence around them they assumed that this would be the last roadblock before the airport the fiat was waved through and laidlaw drove up to the boom gate and cut the engine an armed soldier approached the car and peered through the drivers window passport the soldier said in a thick english accent i speak your language laidlaw replied in swahili and handed the passports to him the soldier was surprised to hear his native tongue and smiled at laidlaw before opening the passports to compare the photographs with the two men in the car what is your business at the airport father we are meeting a friend laidlaw replied then glanced at his watch his flight is due in twentyfive minutes the soldier closed the passports and gave them back to laidlaw thank you father thank you my son laidlaw replied the soldier was about to give the order to raise the boom gate when he saw his commanding officer standing at the entrance of the small nissen hut at the side of the road he immediately snapped to attention the colonel a darkskinned african in his early forties told him to stand easy then crossed to the toyota and looked through the passenger window your passports he said to graham father grant doesnt speak swahili laidlaw said with an apologetic smile hes only been out here a few days the colonel took the passports from laidlaw and leafed through them slowly get out of the car both of you he said suddenly switching to english whats the problem laidlaw asked suspiciously just get out of the car the colonel repeated they did as they were told and the colonel walked round to the drivers side and took the keys from the ignition he beckoned two soldiers towards him and gave the keys to one of them he spoke to them quickly in swahili and they immediately hurried round to the back of the car and what do you hope to find in the boot laidlaw said sticking to english the colonel ignored the question and watched as the boot was opened one of the soldiers immediately called out to him he walked to the back of the car then looked round at laidlaw and beckoned him forward with his finger laidlaws eyes widened in horror when he looked inside the boot two ak assault rifles and a hand grenade lay beside their holdalls we know nothing about these laidlaw said looking to graham for support they werent here when we hired the car graham snapped youre both under arrest the colonel said then gestured towards a jeep parked at the side of the road get in this is outrageous graham said we demand to see your superior i am the most senior officer on duty the colonel retorted then barked out an order and five soldiers immediately unshouldered their mis and aimed them at laidlaw and graham you have a choice either you get in quietly or youll be handcuffed and thrown in its your choice laidlaw looked helplessly at graham graham bit back his anger and clambered into the back of the jeep laidlaw glanced at the soldiers then reluctantly followed him their holdalls were tossed into the back after them the two soldiers who had discovered the weapons got into the back seat and covered graham and laidlaw with their mis the colonel ordered a soldier to move the toyota to the side of the road then climbed into the front of the jeep and told the driver to go to the airport the boom gate was raised and the jeep sped down the highway towards the airport terminal the colonel pointed to a slip road and the driver nodded before indicating and turning the jeep off the main road this isnt the way to the airport laidlaw shouted above the noise of the jeeps engine the colonel glanced at him but said nothing where on earth are we going graham snarled but an mi was pressed into his stomach when he leaned towards the nearest soldier the driver slowed down as he approached a stationary white isuzu van then swung off the road and pulled up behind it grahams mind was racing what was happening were they about to be executed and their bodies taken away in the back of the van but why and where had the weapons come from had they been planted by the soldiers none of it made any sense he was about to try and signal laidlaw for them to tackle the two armed guards when the vans passenger door swung open and sabrina got out moredi climbed out of the drivers side and they walked to the jeep is nothing sacred any more sabrina said with a smile as she eyed grahams outfit graham jumped nimbly from the back of the jeep what the hells going on til tell you later she replied then gestured to moredi and introduced him to graham and laidlaw moredi shook hands with them then spoke briefly to the colonel who immediately ordered his troops into the jeep and the driver did a uturn and headed back towards the highway moredi led the colonel over to the others this is colonel david tambese one of the few soldiers i would trust with my life he was at sandhurst when jamel mobuto and i were at oxford together no hard feelings i hope tambese said shaking grahams hand not if you tell me whats going on graham retorted tambese glanced at sabrina who nodded when joseph told me you were going to pick up a message from the information desk at the airport he asked me to check the area for any signs of ngunes men there are at least four of them in the terminal we had to stop you before you got there why didnt you just arrest them laidlaw asked tambese shot a glance at laidlaw its almost certainly a suicide squad any attempt to approach them would result in a bloodbath they would open fire indiscriminately and who knows how many innocent people would have been killed its a new form of terror ngune has introduced in the last couple of days weve already had to deal with two suicide squads in the city centre fourteen innocent people have been killed in those two incidents alone well wait for them to leave then ambush the car its the only way to deal with them how do you know they were waiting for me we dont tambese answered but after the attempt on miss cassidys life we couldnt take any chances what happened graham cut in quickly til brief you later she replied how did you know when wed get here graham asked sabrina i didnt i just knew you had to come to the airport sooner or later i gave colonel tambese a photograph of you to make sure hed stop you before you reached the airport its the one i took to beirut with me in case i needed it when i approached the lebanese police the three men in the jeep are trusted soldiers of mine tambese continued most of the others at the roadblock are new recruits we still dont know where their true sympathies lie i had to make your arrest look realistic arresting foreigners for no apparent reason isnt exactly part of the plan for the new zimbala thats why we planted the akys and the grenade word is sure to get back to ngune that youve been arrested which means ngune will think youre in custody at least for the time being moredi added why do i get the feeling this is leading up to something graham said his eyes flickering between moredi and sabrina it is sabrina said were going to kondese to find remy mobuto graham took sabrina to one side and what about bernard you remember our agreement you dont have to whisper sabrina said they know about bernard whats so important about remy mobuto graham asked he knows where and when the hit on his brother will take place thats why he was abducted so where does bernard fit into this ngune and his deputy massenga are obviously the two brains behind this whole operation but according to remy mobuto there is a third man the assassin and from what josephs told me it has to be bernard i think all this talk of a hit squad made up of exsecurity policemen was just a red herring to throw the authorities off the scent but youve got no proof that this third man is bernard no its just a hunch and theres only one person who does know the truth remy mobuto graham concluded we have to find him mike quickly how far is kondese from here its a good twohour drive moredi told him so what are we waiting for graham said then picked up his holdall and walked to the van seven morning morning rosie replied rubbing her eyes wearily as she emerged from the bedroom sleep well bernard asked great thanks i havent slept that well in ages thats good bernard slipped on his leather jacket i have to rush theres food in the fridge help yourself ive left twenty dollars on the kitchen table buy something for dinner do you have special food she asked hesitantly halal you mean no im not a muslim im supposed to be catholic but i renounced the faith after my father died get anything pizzas burgers whatever you like what time will you be back you know what these business meetings are like they can go on for ever i hope to be back by six bernard opened the front door then looked back at her the moneys for food not dope if the police catch you near another dealer theyll throw the book at you i know she replied til score us some dope o k o k she replied with a grin marc yes thanks for everything bernard winked at her then left the flat and closed the door behind him rosie fixed herself breakfast then changed out of thp baggy white tshirt bernard had lent her into her jeans and the light blue shirt he had left out for her she rolled up the sleeves then went back into the kitchen to make herself another cup of coffee she sat down at the table and held the cup in both hands as she thought about the previous evening he had taken her to a steakhouse after they had left the rollercoaster and ordered her the biggest tbone steak she had ever seen she had been ravenous not having eaten properly for thirtysix hours and managed to clear the plate and still have room for an icecream then after scoring from a dealer outside bryant park he had taken her back to the flat they had talked for hours well she had he had listened patiently as she bared her soul it was like unloading a great burden from her shoulders she had felt completely relaxed in his company he reminded her of c w two gentlemen cw was the only other person she could talk to in times of trouble she knew cw would have chastised her for going off with a strange man but it wasnt as if she did it all the time in fact it was the first time it had ever happened and she wouldnt have done it if she had felt the slightest doubt about him and her instincts had been proved right she wondered if cw would understand she would phone him he could pass a message on to her parents her thoughts were interrupted by the buzz of the doorbell her initial reaction was that marc had come back for something hed probably forgotten his keys her mother did it all the time she put the cup down on the table and was about to get up when another thought struck her it could also be the police what if they had traced her to the flat but how and anyway the flat was in murray hill nowhere near times square she wasnt violating her parole conditions what about last night she had been in times square had they received a tipoff who from kenny but he didnt know where she was the doorbell rang again she stood up and walked to the front door she opened it on the chain rosie a voice called out kenny she replied peering through the narrow aperture at him can i come in or are we going to talk like this she unhooked the chain and opened the door how did you know i was here i had you followed from the rollercoaster doyle replied and immediately pushed his hands against the door when rosie tried to slam it in his face i did it because i was worried about you so you had someone spy on me she snapped still trying to force the door closed go away kenny go away and leave me alone rosie i just want to talk to you please no she screamed go away you carry on yelling like that and one of the neighbours will call the police is that what you want she stopped pushing on the door ok say what youve come to say then get out i cant believe youre acting like this kenny we used to be friends we still are think again she snapped back rosie theres something about this guy that isnt right youre not starting that again im worried about you for christs sake the guy saved your butt last night granted but there was no need for you to throw yourself at him like you did throw myself at him she retorted in amazement thats exactly what you did and you know it you couldnt take your eyes off him you live in a fantasy world you know that doyle shook his head slowly open your eyes rosie this is the real world youre shacking up with rosie slapped him across the face im not shacking up with him he hasnt touched me since we met doyle dabbed the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand his lip was bleeding ive tried my best you just wont come out your fantasy world will you but youll learn and itll be the hard way ill see you around take care of yourself rosie watched doyle disappear into the lift then wiped a tear from hercheek why had she hit him she had never hit anyone before in her life and he was her best friend she knew he was only trying to protect her he had always been the big brother she never had but why couldnt he understand that she needed her own freedom a freedom to pick and choose her own friends she so wanted him to like marc but now she knew that would never happen he would be there for her when marc was gone he was always there for her thats what made him so special then they could talk again but until then she would stay away from the rollercoaster far away she closed the door and went back to the kitchen where she finished her coffee after washing up she went through to the lounge and picked up the newspaper bernard had been reading the front page carried the story about the attempted assassination of jamel mobuto outside the united nations plaza she didnt bother reading it she wasnt interested in politics she paged through the newspaper found nothing of interest and tossed it onto the coffee table in the middle of the room she glanced at her watch nine fiftyfive she wasnt going to sit around the flat all day hell there wasnt even a television set she went back to the kitchen and was about to pocket the twenty dollars when she thought better of it and left it on the table she would only use it for food she turned out her pockets she had six dollars and a few cents it would be enough for a sandwich at lunchtime she stuffed the money back into her pocket then picked up the spare key from the table in the hall and left the flat doyle watched rosie leave the building from the seclusion of a doorway on the opposite side of the street he waited until she had disappeared from sight then crossed the road and mounted the steps leading up to the glass doors he glanced around quickly then entered the foyer it was deserted he took the lift to the third floor and walked the short distance to the flat he looked around again and satisfied he was alone removed a credit card from his wallet and slipped it carefully between the door and the jamb he eased it against the lock and prised it back gently until he felt the door give under his sustained pressure after a quick perusal he pushed open the door and slipped inside closing it silently behind him he looked into the room nearest the front door the lounge the second door led into a bedroom the bed was unmade the tshirt rosie had been wearing the previous night lay crumpled in the corner he tried the adjoining door it also led into a bedroom the bed had been made with military precision he moved to the wardrobe and tried the door it was unlocked he opened it the clothes had been ironed then folded with meticulous care before being stacked neatly on the shelves he unhooked the second door and opened it two pairs of jeans hung beside a pair of black flannels and a grey chintz jacket he crouched down and unzipped the grey holdall at the bottom of the wardrobe it was empty he was about to zip it up when he noticed the black attache case pushed up against the back of the wardrobe he pushed the holdall to one side then removed the attache case and placed it carefully on the floor wiping the sweat from his forehead he glanced furtively over his shoulder like a naughty schoolboy about to light up a cigarette behind the toilets he wiped his clammy hands on his shirt then tried the catches they wouldnt move a combination lock he tilted the case to get a closer look at the digits they were all at zero oneninesixseven doyle looked round startled by the voice behind him bernard stood in the doorway a desert eagle automatic in his hand please carry on bernard said indicating the attache case with the pistol the combinations oneninesixseven the year the pflp was founded what doyle said his eyes riveted on the pistol youve never heard of the pflp doyle swallowed nervously and shook his head the popular front for the liberation of palestine youre a terrorist doyle spat the words out i prefer revolutionary but not any more i work freelance now how did you know i was here doyle stammered bernard indicated the transmitter attached to his belt you activated it the moment you opened the wardrobe he noticed the uncertainty in doyles eyes i was in the adjoining flat working the two flats are connected by a door built into the lounge wall thats why you never heard me come in actually i thought it was rosie snooping around what are you going to do with her nothing bernard replied casually then gestured to the case again with the pistol you still havent opened it i thought youd be curious to know whats inside doyles hands were trembling as he lined up the digits he placed his thumbs on the catches then paused to glance up at bernard his breathing was ragged and the sweat now ran freely down his face its not boobytrapped if thats what youre worried about bernard said do you think i would be standing here if it was doyle wiped the back of his hand across his forehead then unlocked the case he eased the lid open inside were the specially designed segments of a rifle and telescopic sightattachment which were sunk into the contours of a foam base a gun i should have guessed a galil sniping rifle to be exact they may be the enemy but the israelis still make the best weapons in the world so is your curiosity satisfied now gay boy the taunt stung doyle into action he lunged at bernard who sidestepped his wild punch and landed a vicious rabbit punch of his own at the base of doyles neck doyle stumbled and threw his hands up to protect his face as he fell heavily against the wall bernard took a silencer from his pocket and screwed it onto the muzzle of the pistol he looked down at doyle who was on his knees his head bowed his fingers gingerly massaging his neck hey gay boy bernard said prodding doyle with his foot doyle looked up slowly bernard smiled coldly and shot him through the head kolchinsky was reading through a dossier when the intercom buzzed cws here mr kolchinsky send him through sarah kolchinsky replied and used the sonic transmitter to activate the door morning sergei whitlock said entering the room kolchinsky glanced at his watch afternoon actually its a minute after twelve whitlock shrugged i wont quibble about a minute sit down kolchinsky said indicating the nearest of the black leather sofas i thought you were supposed to be accompanying the president to the africanamerican institute this morning the tour was cancelled whitlock sat down hes been in conference all morning suits me fine the less he sees of new york the better what about his trip to harlem this afternoon still on unfortunately its scheduled for two oclock thats why i thought id pop over and see you while i had the chance anything on the two assassins not a thing ive been on the phone to the zimbalan authorities again this morning it seems the security police shredded a lot of documents before jamel mobuto outlawed the organization a lot of personnel files were also destroyed theyve promised to get back to me the moment they come up with anything kolchinsky pushed a folder across the desk this came in this morning from the lab at the test centre its the report on the shooting outside the united nations plaza its routine stuff mainly but there was something that caught my eye second page third paragraph see what you think whitlock opened the folder and read the relevant paragraph then looked up at kolchinsky i see what you mean although the gunman was only thirty yards from mobuto he fired almost three feet wide of his target are they sure about their calculations they had halfadozen press photographs to choose from when it came to pinpointing mobutos position outside the hotel whitlock closed the folder and replaced it on the desk so the gunman either missed deliberately or else he was a lousy shot it doesnt make sense whitlock said thoughtfully any assassin worth his salt wouldnt have missed by three feet not from that distance kolchinsky explained briefly what sabrina had said earlier about a third man if bernard is this mysterious third man why not just use him to assassinate mobuto whitlock said why go to all the trouble of assembling a team of security policemen he trailed off and looked quizzically at kolchinsky decoys that had crossed my mind but decoys for what we know that bernard wasnt even in the country when the attempt was made on the presidents life he was in beirut whitlock stood up and walked to the window he chewed his lip thoughtfully then turned back to kolchinsky what if this third man was there the other night when the attempt was made on mobutos life as backup as the assassin the gunman in the crowd was just the decoy kolchinsky tapped the folder the bullet dug out of the wall came from a ninemillimetre parabellum its the same gun discarded by the gunman exactly whitlock said nodding he purposely fired wide that would tie in with the report so why didnt this third man shoot mobuto obviously he didnt have a clear shot whitlock moved to the desk and looked down at kolchinsky i know its a wild hunch sergei but it makes sense dont you see that the decoy draws our attention to himself by firing blindly and in doing so gives the real assassin the chance to shoot mobuto in the ensuing confusion but as i said the assassin obviously didnt have a clear shot and hes only got one shot in that situation so if this theory of yours is right why didnt the first gunman also try to shoot mobuto why purposely fire wide because they want mobuto dead who would be more reliable the man in the crowd armed only with a handgun or the sniper overlooking the target area what if the first gunman had only wounded him theyd never have got near him in hospital hed have been guarded better than fort knox if your theory is right then bernard cant be this third man why whitlock countered ive told you he was in beirut two days ago we only have baileys word for that you said that bernard was spotted at the airport by a cia operative bernard could easily have bribed him to say that what if hes been here all the time kolchinsky stared at the folder thoughtfully then looked up at whitlock if youre right the next attempt has to be this afternoon its the only time the president will be out in the open my thoughts exactly i want to draft in more police snipers to cover the area around the school how many whitlock visualized the plan of the area in his head a dozen to be on the safe side kolchinsky made a note on his desk pad til arrange it with the commissioner well id better get over to the hotel call me when youve spoken to the commissioner kolchinsky nodded then activated the door for whitlock he closed it behind him then reached for the telephone hello bernard said answering the telephone after the first ring this is seabird a voice said columbus bernard replied quoting his codename whitlocks stumbled on the truth seabird told him abort plan a dont go to harlem this afternoon what about sibele and kolwezi send them in as if nothings wrong theyre expendable itll also convince whitlock he was right leaving plan b right seabird agreed what about the rifle ill have someone drop by later and pick it up dont worry we wont have any problems getting it past the security guards bernard replaced the receiver and smiled to himself the hit on mobuto was now down to him he liked it that way rogers was sitting by the door of mobutos suite reading a magazine when the lift doors opened and whitlock emerged into the corridor the two uniformed policemen by the lift checked whitlocks id disc then let him pass rogers discarded the magazine onto the coffee table beside him and got to his feet theyre still in conference he said when whitlock reached him whitlock glanced irritably at his watch whats he playing at he knows hes got to give an address at the school in an hour the press are already crawling all over the foyer waiting for him to appear hoping for blood this time rogers muttered cynically no doubt whitlock agreed if hed been ready a half an hour ago we could have avoided them the door suddenly opened and the towering figure of masala appeared the president will be ready to leave in five minutes whitlock waited until the zimbalan ambassador and his entourage had left before entering the suite can i have a word with the president he asked masala the president is dressing came the sharp reply is there a problem mobuto asked from the doorway of his bedroom there could be sir whitlock replied then youd better come in mobuto said then disappeared back into the bedroom mobuto was putting on a red silk tie in front of the mirror when whitlock entered the room and what seems to be the problem whitlock bit back his anger at mobutos sarcastic tone we agreed that you would be ready half an hour ago to avoid the press the conference lasted longer than i anticipated mobuto replied glancing towards whitlocks reflection in the mirror well the press are here in force now well have to smuggle you out through the back of the hotel mobuto finished knotting his tie then turned to face whitlock perhaps youd like to put a paper bag over my head as well just in case someone should see me none of this would be necessary if we had left on time whitlock retorted unable to hold back his anger any longer you sound just like my father everything he did had to be done with military precision he lived by the clock he never knew the word flexibility mobuto held up his hand before whitlock could reply lets get something straight clarence i intend to leave here through the front of the hotel and if there is an assassin in the crowd then lets hope youre as quick on your toes as you were the other night but i will not bow to their terror by sneaking out through back doors is that understood whitlock nodded mobuto put on his jacket and slipped a carnation into his button hole im ready shall we go the bleeper attached to whitlocks belt went off before he could reply he silenced it and immediately went into the lounge where a special scrambler telephone had been installed he rang un ago headquarters and gave sarah his identity number she immediately patched him through to kolchinsky baileys just called kolchinsky told him bernards been in touch finally whitlock replied did he say where the hit would take place at the school where at the school theres no definite plan but bernard told the gunman to make the hit outside the building which would tie up with a second assassin perhaps kolchinsky replied its a twoman team like before one wheelman one assassin the getaway car will be a red buick registration number eng that certainly helps whitlock said jotting down the number i got a bad feeling about this cw be careful you can count on it whitlock replied keep me advised will do whitlock said then replaced the receiver well mobuto enquired whitlock recounted what kolchinsky had said on the telephone at least now we know where we stand mobuto said once whitlock had finished speaking i hope youre right whitlock replied softly then followed mobuto to the door the mercedes carrying the president was hemmed in between two police cars while a second mercedes brought up the rear of the convoy whitlock sat in the front of the presidential car his mind racing had he anticipated every possibility when he had organized the security arrangements at the school that morning was there a weak link he had gone over the plans of the area with the head of the swat team had they overlooked anything if something happened to mobuto now they had been warned that another attempt was to be made on his life heads would definitely roll starting with his he had radioed through to the swat team before they set out for harlem warning them to be on the lookout for the red buick he had also given them strict instructions not to open fire unless it was absolutely necessary a prisoner to question would be invaluable to a case that was crying out for answers and there was far more chance of the gunman being killed than the getaway driver then there was bernard where did he fit into the jigsaw was he the third man and if he was was he working for bailey or had he doublecrossed the cia was he working for ngune so many questions and he didnt have an answer for any of them that worried him and like kolchinsky he had a bad feeling about mobutos visit to harlem are you married clarence mobuto asked from the back seat i suddenly realized i dont know anything about you since you left oxford whitlock wished mobuto would stop callinghim clarence but there was nothing he could do about it mobuto had already reported him to kolchinsky for calling him jamel at the airport kolchinsky had hauled him into the office the next day and told him to bite his tongue mobuto was a guest in the country and an important one at that kolchinsky had also pointed out that it wasnt as if he were insulting him he was only calling him by his name whitlock knew he was right clarence indeed yes ive been married for seven years actually my wife works in harlem really what does she do shes a paediatrician how interesting mobuto said without sounding particularly convincing do you have any children no the silence descended again were in harlem now whitlock said as the mercedes followed the police car into lenox avenue mobuto peered through the dark glass window it seems so bleak and depressing it is believe me povertys rife because unemployments so high so youngsters turn to drugs crime and prostitution to make ends meet its hard to believe this is america land of the free id like to speak to some of the people mobuto said the pained expression etched on his face driver pull over the driver shot whitlock a nervous glance but whitlock shook his head were not stopping not until we reach the school why not mobuto demanded these are your people as well clarence we may be black sir but we dont belong here they dont like outsiders and can you blame them looking around at all the squalor this is what a succession of american governments have done for them it makes me bitter when i come into harlem but they dont want my sympathy they dont want anybodys sympathy they just want to be left alone to try and sort out their own problems whitlock glanced at mobuto in the rearview mirror dont think it was easy getting you into harlem it wasnt the government had to negotiate with community leaders to let the convoy enter were driving through some gangs turf right now were violating their space if our visit hadnt been sanctioned by the community leaders the convoy would certainly have come under attack by now but surely the police cars would deter them a faint smile touched the drivers lips the gangs dont fear the police whitlock said if anything its the other way round you may have noticed that all the uniformed policemen in the convoy are black theyre all based here in harlem the people know them mobuto fell silent the large crowd of onlookers which had congregated outside the school was being kept away from the main gates by a cordon of policemen some were genuinely interested in the man others attracted by the media hype that had surrounded his visit since the attempt on his life two days earlier the schoolchildren who lined the approach road to the school had been issued with small replicas of the zimbalan flag and they began to wave them on cue the moment the cavalcade came into sight mobuto smiled and waved as the car passed them whitlock ignored the children his eyes were on the surrounding buildings he could see the swat snipers on the roofs their faces shaded from the overhead sun by their black peaked caps he had given instructions that all buildings be searched and guarded within a sevenhundredyard radius of the school he knew it had already caused a lot of resentment amongst the occupants especially as the swat team was predominantly white but there was nothing he could do about it his first duty was to protect mobuto the mercedes followed the police car through the wroughtiron gates and pulled up behind it two hundred yards further on in front of the main portico where the principal and a deputation of community leaders were standing whitlock slipped in his earpiece which kept him in touch with the leader of the swat team then got out of the car and waited until rogers and masala had joined him from the second mercedes before opening the door for mobuto the principal stepped forward as mobuto climbed from the car and extended his hand in greeting he welcomed mobuto to the school then set about introducing him to the five community leaders who had been chosen to meet him whitlock and rogers exchanged anxious glances why couldnt the introductions be made inside mobuto was a prime target on the portico whitlock slid on his sunglasses and scanned the roof of the adjacent building it was guarded by two of the swat team he felt the sweat run down the side of his face bernard had said the attempt would be made outside the school that was why he had already persuaded mobuto not to get out and greet the crowd it would be tempting fate which left the sniper if in fact there even was one and if bernard were the sniper why had he tipped off bailey about the hit none of it made any sense but it wasnt the time to be speculating about bernards involvement he looked around once more then turned back to mobuto who was being introduced to the last of the community leaders he nodded to masala who took up his position at the door waiting to lead the deputation into the corridor then spoke briefly to the uniformed policemen who had formed a cordon around the portico reiterating the point he had made several times earlier at the briefing that nobody was to get past them once mobuto was inside the building he also told them to keep in touch with the other uniformed officers in and around the school building and to contact him if anything untoward happened no matter how trivial he was desperate to apprehend the assassin or assassins without a shot being fired it would make amends for the lapse of security outside the hotel rogers touched him on the arm they were ready to go inside whitlock had been uncertain about rogerss presence in the hall he would be the only white face there it had finally been decided that he would watch the door leading off from the back of the stage he would be hidden from view by the heavy red curtains that bordered the stage on three sides whitlock looked around one last time then followed mobuto into the building walter sibele had been with the zimbalan security police for eight years before it was disbanded by jamel mobuto so he had jumped at the chance to join the fourman team selected to go to america to assassinate mobuto massenga had told them not to view it as a revenge mission it must be approached clinically and professionally they had been training together for a week at a farmhouse on the outskirts of kondese when massenga had suddenly arrived unexpectedly with a man none of them had ever seen before massenga introduced him only as columbus there was to be a change of plan columbus was the new team leader and he would kill mobuto they were to listen to him and obey his every instruction they didnt question massengas orders but there was a feeling of resentment against this newcomer he had yet to prove himself on the second day he had thrown down the gauntlet if any of them could beat him on the firing range then they would not only become the new leader but they would also win the job of killing mobuto it was a challenge they had readily accepted none of them had come close to matching his shooting ability either with handguns or rifles that was to be the turning point by the time the four of them had flown out to america there was nothing they wouldnt do for him and now that the other two were dead it was up to kolwezi and himself to prove themselves to columbus even if it meant they would be killed in the process they were ready for thatas long as mobuto died with them then ngune could take power and they would become the martyrs that had helped to create a new generation of power in zimbala and if they survived ngune would decorate them publicly iz for their bravery whatever the outcome mobuto had to die sibele had been searched when he entered the building and the number on his invitation had been checked against a list it had been bought legitimately from a tout in st nicholas park there had only been five hundred tickets printed and on mobutos specific instructions three hundred and fifty of those were to be sold to the public all the money would go to help the children of harlem had all the tickets gone to the wealthy black socialites of new york as had initially been the plan then he could never have got into the building it was ironic that mobuto had orchestrated his own death the gun a beretta had been smuggled into the building a week ago by a janitor who had been handsomely rewarded for his trouble he had waited until the toilets had been searched by the police then taped the gun under the cistern for sibele to collect minutes later he had tucked the beretta into the belt at the back of his trousers then taken his seat early to ensure that he was close to the stage he had been sitting there for over an hour but he knew mobuto had arrived at the school it would only be a matter of minutes before he entered the hall the double doors at the back of the hall were thrust open and the menacing figure of masala entered there were some anxious whispers from the audience but the appearance of the principal behind him seemed to calm the situation most of the audience recognized mobuto immediately from the exposure he had received on national television and they watched him walk down the aisle with the rest of the delegation and climb the stairs leading onto the stage the principal gestured to the chair nearest the podium and mobuto smiled briefly before sitting down the community leaders took their seats leaving the chair next to mobuto vacant for the principal whitlock and masala sat at the rear whitlock glanced towards the wings rogers gave him a thumbs up then peered through the curtains at the audience before turning and moving back to the door the principal moved to the podium he looked out across the sea of faces then cleared his throat may i straight away welcome you all here today i had a speech all prepared to introduce our guest to you but thanks to the efficiency of the american press i doubt theres anyone here who doesnt know the entire life history of mr mobuto by now there was a ripple of laughter mobuto remained impassive as he stared at the floor mr mobuto has graciously agreed to answer any questions you may have after he has finished his speech so without further delay please give a warm harlem welcome to the new president of zimbala jamel mobuto that was sibeles cue as the applause echoed around the room he drew the beretta and sprung to his feet the woman beside him screamed masala knocked the principal out of the way and felled mobuto shoving him to safety behind the podium before sibele could get off a shot women and children began screaming as chairs were kicked aside in the stampede for the back doors whitlock drew his browning but couldnt shoot at sibele for fear of hitting someone in the audience sibele looked towards the gallery which had been closed for renovations there was no sign of columbus where was he he said he would be there something must have gone wrong sibele turned back towards the stage he was on his own whitlock had reached the edge of the stage when sibele swung the beretta on him and fired the bullet hit whitlock in the arm the browning spun from his hand sibele ran towards the stairs leading onto the stage rogers swung out from behind the curtain and fired twice assibele reached the top of the stairs the bullets took sibele in the chest punching him off the stage he crashed into the front row of chairs scattering them across the floor rogers leaped off the stage and kicked the gun away from sibeles outstretched hand he pressed his smith wesson into sibeles neck and felt for a pulse well whitlock asked from the edge of the stage his hand clutched over his arm dead rogers replied then frowned anxiously areyou ok whitlock nodded and hurried over to where mobuto lay sir are you alright tm fine mobuto got to his feet and winced as he looked at whitlocks bloodsoaked sleeve youre losing a lot of blood you need to get to a hospital the bullet went straight through it looks a lot worse than it is the principal and the community leaders ventured out from behind the curtains and looked from sibeles body to whitlocks injured arm how did he get in here with that gun the principal demanded i thought the police had searched everybody who came in here today they did whitlock replied it was obviously an inside job two uniformed policemen appeared at the back of the hall alerted by the sound of gunfire call an ambulance rogers shouted to them and close those doors the press arent to get in here under any circumstances until the bodys been removed yes sir one of the policemen said and closed the doors behind them whitlock used his handkerchief as a tourniquet then glanced out across the now deserted hall before focussing his attention on the gallery why had sibele looked up there was that where the sniper should have been but the door leading into the gallery was being guarded by a uniformed policeman had that put the sniper off you also saw it masala said behind him whitlock nodded there was a knock at the door and a breathless policeman entered the hall he glanced at sibeles body then looked up at whitlock weve been trying to reach you but you werent replying whitlock instinctively looked down at the receiver on his belt the wire connected to the earpiece had been ripped from the socket probably when he fell he looked up at the policeman what is it the swat team have cornered the getaway driver a couple of blocks from here theyre awaiting your instructions whitlock turned to rogers get over there right away we need him alive make sure the swat team know that if they are forced to shoot tell them to maim not kill im on my way rogers said and jumped nimbly off the stage wait im going with you masala said and looked to mobuto for his consent go on and remember what mr whitlock said dont kill him masala nodded and followed rogers from the hall they were immediately besieged by the press but neither man said anything as they shoved their way through the extended microphones rogers told the uniformed police on the portico to get the press out of the building then walked with masala to the main gates where an even larger crowd had gathered after word had spread through the neighbourhood of the shooting a member of the swat team was waiting for them whats the situation rogers asked we spotted him in a sidestreet the description of the car and the registration number match the bulletin you sent through to us earlier the streets been cordoned off but we havent approached the car hes just sitting there lets go rogers said the three men ran the hundred yards to where a crowd of onlookers had gathered around the mouth of the sidestreet a police car was parked at an angle to the road making it impossible for the buick to get out without ramming it another police car was similarly positioned at the other end of the street halfadozen members of the swat team were positioned on the roofs overlooking the street their rifles trained on the car the lieutenant in charge of the swat team was waiting for them rogers told him what whitlock had said and he immediately passed the instructions on to his men what do you suggest we do the lieutenant asked til try and speak to him rogers replied the car could be boobytrapped said the lieutenant rogers shrugged ive got to take that chance the longer we make him sweat it out the more chance there is of him cracking we need him alive remember the lieutenant nodded rogers stepped out in front of the police car and took off his jacket he carefully unholstered his smith c wesson held it up for kolwezi to see then handed it to masala are you crazy the lieutenant said in amazement he could gun you down if he does dont kill him disable him the lieutenant sighed deeply then stepped back and spoke into his radio telling his men that rogers would be going in unarmed rogers walked slowly towards the buick his arms held out away from his body he reached the front of the buick and indicated for kolwezi to open the drivers window kolwezi wiped the sweat from his face with his hand then wound down the window he levelled the walther at rogers and ordered him to approach to within five feet of the window rogers complied he looked up at the nearest of the swat snipers on the roof above them he was at least fifty yards away from the car out of earshot we can talk they cant hear us rogers told him in arabic sibeles dead and mobuto no what about columbus he couldnt get into the building rogers lied it was too well guarded but there was no way to get a message to sibele before he went into the hall he didnt stand a chance twice we have failed kolwezi said bitterly mobuto lives a charmed life just as he did when his father was in power dont worry your deaths wont be in vain mobuto will die tomorrow columbus rogers nodded then glanced across at masala and the lieutenant im supposed to be trying to persuade you to surrender go now my friend rogers turned sharply on his heel and began to walk back towards the police car kolwezi calmly pressed the barrel of the gun against the roof of his mouth and pulled the trigger carmen had left her receptionist to lock up and rushed over to the hospital after whitlock had rung to tell her that he was there although his arm was heavily bandaged he had assured her that it wasnt a serious wound he knew the lie would at least put her mind at rest it did hurt like hell though the doctor had given him a prescription for sleeping tablets which they had picked up on the way back to the apartment he had eaten a light dinner then retired to bed early determined to be back at work the following morning she was busy washing up when the telephone rang she wiped her hands on the dish towel and answered the extension in the kitchen carmen rosie carmen countered in surprise yeah rosie replied she had dropped the aunt and uncle routine at their insistence uncle clarence whitlock had hated it now she just called him cw rosie where are you carmen asked anxiously your parents are going out of their minds with worry you must call your mother no rosie cut in firmly thats why i called you tell her im fine ill call her in a few days where are you staying with a friend why not come and stay with us for a while carmen suggested you dont have to see your parents until you want to but at least theyll know youre safe well rosie replied til call you tomorrow at work and well sort something out is that a promise sure my moneys run out ill call you ok ok the line went dead carmen replaced the receiver then looked in on her husband wondering if he had heard the telephone he was fast asleep she smiled then closed the bedroom door and returned to the kitchen to finish washing the dishes rosie picked up a pizza from the pizzeria near the callbox then went back to the apartment she opened the door and saw bernards leather jacket on the chair in the hall he was listening to the news on the radio in the lounge when did you get in she asked from the doorway about twenty minutes ago bernard replied with a smile how was your day dont ask he said then got to his feet and pointed to the box in her hand whats the pizza ham and mushroom is that ok great im starving bernard made room for the box on the coffee table and how was your day i went out soon after you left this morning she said opening the box i only got back now where did you go bernard asked i took the subway to fifth avenue i spent the day windowshopping not much else to do there with five bucks in your pocket bernard smiled then helped himself to a slice of pizza i rang my aunt just before i got the pizza your aunt bernard asked suspiciously the pizza slice hovering inches from his mouth carmen she suggested i go and stay with them from tomorrow i reckon it might be a good idea its not that i dont appreciate what youve done for me i really do but she is family i only wish my parents were as liberal as my aunt and uncle and youre going to move in with them tomorrow yeah i think so weve always got on great is there something wrong no i think its a good idea and anyway im heading back to beirut in a couple of days bernards mind was racing carmen whitlocks wife if rosie moved in with them he could kiss his hostage goodbye it only complicated matters why couldnt she have called them the next day by then he would know if he needed her he would have to play it by ear it was the only way the doorbell rang bernard frowned was it the courier for the rifle he wasnt expecting him for another couple of hours and he wasnt expecting anyone else he wiped his hands on a paper napkin then got to his feet and answered the door two uniformed police officers stood in front of him good evening sir one said touching his cap are you marc giresse bernard nodded slowly yes whats the problem officer may we come in yes of course bernard replied opening the door for them im officer deacon the spokesman said once they were inside and this is officer cummings bernard noted that their badges were genuine you still havent told me what the problem is deacon was about to speak when rosie appeared from the lounge he glanced towards her are you rosie kruger she glanced at bernard her eyes wide and fearful yes she stammered do you know a kenneth doyle yes she answered a look of concern suddenly crossed her face has something happened to him i was hoping one of you could answer that deacon took a sheet of folded paper from his pocket and held it up mr doyle left this note with a friend in it he said he was coming round here this morning to see you miss kruger he also said that if this friend hadnt heard from him by four oclock this afternoon he was to go to the police with the note it all sounds a little sinister doesnt it officer there must be a logical explanation bernard said fighting the anxiety that throbbed in the pit of his stomach did you know miss kruger was sixteen years old mr giresse or that she was a runaway yes i knew that bernard replied she told me that was one of the reasons i gave her a bed for the night shes too young to be on the streets at night whose bed cummings asked looking from bernard to rosie you bastard rosie snarled marcs never touched me cool it rosie bernard said holding up his hands did mr doyle come round this morning deacon asked rosie she nodded he had this thing about marc he didnt trust him he wanted me to leave the apartment i told him to go away marcs been fantastic to me ever since i came here and did he go away cummings asked yes did he return cummings continued i dont know i left soon after him and i only got back a few minutes ago did you see him deacon asked bernard ive been out all day officer bernard replied im sorry i cant be more helpful but i only met him once and that was at the rollercoaster where he worked have you tried the rollercoaster weve tried all his usual haunts miss kruger he just seems to have vanished and thats very unlike him according to his friends thats true rosie said kenny loves company ive never known him to be alone you say he didnt trust mr giresse cummings said why kenny was very protective towards me he was like a big brother he was always wary of any new friends i made especially if they were men i dont know why he didnt trust marc he just kept saying that there was something about him that wasnt right youd both better come down to the precinct with us deacon said are you booking us bernard demanded no deacon replied wed like to question you further its ok bernard said to rosie as i said theres sure to be a logical explanation to all this get your coat i dont have one with me she replied use mine bernard said gesturing towards the chair he turned to deacon can i get a jacket from the bedroom deacon nodded then followed bernard into the bedroom he stood by the door bernard opened the wardrobe and unhooked the grey jacket then slipped his hand under the pile of shirts and curled his fingers around the desert eagle it still had the silencer attached his first thought was to shoot deacon on the turn but that would alert cummings he had to get them together he removed the automatic from under the bottom shirt and slipped the jacket over his hand to hide it he closed the wardrobe then walked across to deacon cummings was now in sight standing by the front door but rosie was in the way of a clear shot he cursed what if cummings opened the door before rosie moved any gunplay outside the flat would certainly compromise his cover his mind was still racing when cummings reached for the handle bernard had to play his hand even if rosie were caught in the crossfire keeping his cover intact far outweighed her usefulness as a hostage he raised the gun underneath the jacket and shot deacon through the head rosie screamed as deacon stumbled back against the wall before slumping face forward onto the carpet cummings instinctively pushed her aside and was still reaching for his holstered colt python when bernard shot him he was slammed back against the door and the surprise was still mirrored in his eyes when he slid lifelessly to the floor bernard discarded the jacket and aimed the automatic at rosie who was crouched against the wall her hands clutched together tightly under her chin she looked up slowly at him the terror plain on her face please dont kill me she whimpered shaking her head slowly im not going to kill you youre too valuable to me bernard kept the gun trained on her as he checked to see that both policemen were dead satisfied he ordered her to stand up she slowly got to her feet petrified you should have listened to your friend kenny shouldnt you what have you done to him she asked already fearing the worst he came back to the flat after you had gone i think he fancied himself as a bit of a detective but he was in way over his head pity he meant well you killed him didnt you yeah he replied with an indifferent shrug she fought back the tears why hadnt she listened to kenny he had been right all along she had been living in a fantasy world and now suddenly she had been pitched headlong into the world of reality she desperately wanted to crawl back into her old world where she knew she would be safe but she knew that couldnt happen never again then came the damning realization that she had been partly responsible for kennys death if she had listened to him he would still be alive and in that moment of truth her fear turned to anger she lunged at bernard almost wishing he would pull the trigger he sidestepped her clawing hands and she saw the gun out of the corner of her eye as he swung it down onto the back of her head then everything went black eight sabrina gazed up at the myriad stars that speckled the night sky like a panoply of diamonds on a velvet background and could almost believe there was a heaven what else could lie beyond such beauty although she had been raised a catholic she had never really considered herself very religious and now only attended mass once a year with her parents at christmas and that was only to appease them she smiled to herself why did the subject of religion always seem to crop up when she was on assignment a subconscious attempt to avoid eternal perdition she pushed the thought from her mind and concentrated instead on their plans it had been decided that the five of them would travel to kondese alone tambese had told them that any attempt to take reinforcements would only alert the rebels sabrina had spoken privately to graham about the decision to take moredi and laidlaw with them moredi knew the layout of branco prison having once been a prisoner there and laidlaws speciality at delta had been his ability to plan the best way in or out of a compound both would be invaluable but neither would be part of the assault team satisfied sabrina had let the matter drop tambese had then collected an assortment of weaponry from the barracks before chartering a cessna from a private firm in the city not only would it be quicker by air they would also avoid the rebel roadblocks which had been set up on all the approach roads into kondese moredi had arranged for them to land at a farm on the outskirts of kondese which belonged to matthew okoye a personal friend of the mobutos he was one of the wealthiest businessmen in the country and ngune had wisely given strict instructions for him to be left alone when the rebels had set up camp in and around kondese he knew the value of keeping on the right side of the likes of okoye they were the future of zimbala irrespective of who was in power it had taken them a little over an hour to reach the private airstrip and after tambese had landed the cessna they were driven to the farm okoye and his wife had discreetly withdrawn after dinner leaving them in the spacious lounge to discuss the operation but there wasnt anything they could do until the plans of the prison compound were delivered to the farm so sabrina had gone out onto the porch for a breath of fresh air the door opened behind her she looked round and smiled at graham when he emerged onto the porch its so peaceful out here look at the sky not a cloud in sight just stars as far as the eye can see and you can even make out the lights of kondese in the distance isnt it beautiful yeah its at times like this that you can see where keats got his inspiration for the secret rose or hopkins for the starlight night you never cease to amaze me mike graham she said shaking her head in astonishment i never realized you read poetry he smiled then sat on the step beside her i grew up with it my mother has volumes of the stuff all beautifully bound in leather keats wordsworth browning shelley the lot every friday night her parents would come round for a meal and afterwards i would have to read to them from one of the volumes that went on until i was in my teens do you still read poetry only when i visit my mother at the retirement home in santa monica shes still got all the volumes on a shelf in her room her eyesights going so i always read her favourite poems to her thats the first time youve ever really spoken about your childhood do you know that now you know why he said with a wry grin imagine a tenyearold in a suit and tie reading grays elegy in a country churchyard to his grandparents but she meant well and thats what counts sabrina chuckled i only wish id been there to see it you dont graham retorted shed have got you reading as well i know you think the world of your mother but you never talk much about your father i dont mean to pry but is there a reason for that i was never close to my father we didnt have anything in common thats why he never once took zoo me to see the giants or the yankees play i had to go with other kids fathers until i was old enough to go by myself it was really embarrassing i started playing football at the age of eleven he never once came to watch me play never my mother wasnt interested in football either but i cant ever remember her missing a game when i played in the new york area didnt he even go and watch you when you played for the giants he died seven months before i joined them i doubt hed have come though why break the habit of a lifetime the bitterness wasnt lost on her and she decided against pursuing the subject but she was still amazed at his openness a year ago he would have clammed up at the mere mention of his past was he beginning to break down those barriers he had built around himself since he had lost his family or was it the thought that he was finally going to get a showdown with the man he blamed for their murder and what would happen if he did come face to face with bernard would he kill him or would he hand him over to the authorities she knew she couldnt answer that question or perhaps she just didnt want to you guys look cosy down there said laidlaw from the doorway what the hells that supposed to mean graham demanded scrambling to his feet just kidding laidlaw said winking at sabrina sabrina shook her head slowly to herself what a jerk but then he didnt know graham like she did any suggestion of any impropriety between them zoi immediately put graham on his guard some things hadnt changed what do you want graham snapped hey chill out man i said i was only kidding laidlaw looked from sabrina to graham look i dont give a damn if you guys have got something going graham grabbed laidlaw by the shirt and shoved him up against the wall we work together period understood laidlaw pulled free and smoothed down his shirt the plans are here he said tersely then yanked open the door and disappeared back into the house why cant a man and woman work together without there always being some sort of sexual overtone attached to it sabrina nodded tightlipped then followed graham into the house laidlaw walked up to graham im sorry mike i was out of order forget it graham replied then crossed to where tambese and moredi were sitting on the sofa the plans spread out across the table in front of them sit down tambese invited gesturing to the second sofa which they had positioned on the other side of the table graham waited until they were all seated then looked past sabrina at laidlaw what do you think laidlaw turned the plan around then looked up at moredi you say the perimeter fence is electrified moredi nodded i dont know the voltage but it is lethal a prisoner died trying to escape over it when i was being held there escape was impossible tambese told them i heard stories of prisoners who had just arrived at the prison breaking free from the guards and throwing themselves against the fence to avoid being interrogated thats how much the people feared the security police wheres the current controlled from laidlaw asked tambese tapped a square in the centre of the building thats the control room but its situated underground it only has one approach route which is protected by a metal grill the door itself is made of reinforced steel and can only be activated from inside the control room itself its impregnable david was one of the officers who liberated branco after the death of alphonse mobuto moredi told them was that the first time you had ever been inside the prison sabrina asked tambese nodded the army and the regular police were never allowed into branco when it was run by the security police wasnt the fence deactivated when the prison was liberated graham asked it was tambese agreed but it wouldnt have been very difficult to rig it up again so youre not sure whether it has been reactivated sabrina said to tambese it has according to our sources here in kondese tambese replied couldnt you instigate a power cut graham asked tambese shook his head it wouldnt work even if we could get into the power station theres an emergency generator inside the compound what about the entrance laidlaw asked without taking his eyes off the plans one main gate there moredi replied pointing it out operated from the control room tambese added there are also two watchtowers overlooking the gate each is manned by an armed guard we wouldnt get within a hundred yards of the main gate without been seen whats it made of laidlaw asked reinforced steel laidlaw chewed his lip thoughtfully as he continued to study the diagram how many of ngunes men are inside the prison compound graham asked tambese we think about twentyfive what about the remainder of his troops sabrina asked i wish i knew tambese replied with a sigh i really do there are pockets of them in and around kondese manning roadblocks and patrolling the city centre the resistance movement has been scouting the area ever since the rebels took kondese but so far theyve come up with nothing its uncanny there must be a garrison around here somewhere but we just cant find it what if its a bluff and ngune doesnt have the manpower he claims to have that had crossed our minds mr graham but what use are tanks and aircraft without men and we know he has both why not destroy them sabrina asked in surprise because theyre in chad if our troops crossed the border into chad wed be certain to cause an international incident and thats the last thing we need now that were on the verge of being allowed back into the united nations weve lodged a formal protest with the chadian government but they claim the tanks and planes are part of their own arsenal which in effect they are but we know from reliable sources inside the chadian army that ngune has struck a deal with their government to use some of their tanks and planes in the event of an attempted coup detat but only if ngune provides the men so at the moment its a stalemate couldnt the garrison be in chad sabrina asked tambese shook his head no weve checked and anyway the chadian governments too smart for that if they were giving a safe haven to ngunes men it would provide us with the proof we need to discredit them thats it laidlaw suddenly blurted out the sewers what sabrina said turning to laidlaw in surprise thats how we get into the compound through the sewers there thats the manhole laidlaw said pointing it out on the diagram itll be locked graham said so we cut through it with an oxyacetylene torch laidlaw replied the guards would see the flame from the watchtower graham shot back laidlaw smiled victoriously no they wouldnt according to the scale of this plan the manhole cover cant be more than a couple of yards behind the staff quarters the guards wont be able to see it from the watchtowers and what about the men in the staff quarters sabrina asked if we go in at about three tomorrow morning theyll be asleep laidlaw looked at tambese youre sure the only guards on duty then will be the two in the watchtower there wont be any guards patrolling the grounds tambese shook his head theres no need the watchtowers overlook the grounds ok so lets say we do cut through the manhole cover graham said staring at the diagram how do we get from the staff quarters to the cell block the guards will have to be neutralized first all wed need for that is a sniper rifle and a silencer laidlaw looked across at tambese again could you get them theres no need sabrina said to tambese we can use the uzis you brought from habane theyve got silencers its too risky laidlaw replied those watchtowers are a good twohundred yards away from the staff quarters if we dont kill the guards with the first bullet that would almost certainly compromise the operation thats why we need a rifle with a telescopicsightattachment it has to be a firsttime kill til arrange to get them tambese said o k so the guards have been neutralized graham said then what then we cross to the cell block and find remy mobuto laidlaw replied matteroffactly graham ran his fingers through his hair a puzzled expression on his face surely the two buildings are sectioned off from each other by a fence or a wall not according to this laidlaw replied pointing to the two rectangles in the diagram it isnt san quentin mr graham moredi said softly then sat back and clasped his hands in his lap there isnt a canteen where the prisoners can eat their meals and there isnt an exercise yard where prisoners can walk about and stretch their legs there are no rights at branco thats the first thing i learned when i got there i was held there for eight weeks and like all political prisoners at branco my hands and feet were manacled and i was put in a dark cell four foot by eight foot and the only time i ever left it was when i was taken down the corridor to a windowless room where my interrogators were waiting to torture me and every night a spotlight in the corner of the cell would be switched on and i would be told to stand to attention that happened almost every hour and when i was too exhausted to get to my feet any more one of them would come into the cell and beat me if i was lucky he would use a whip or a baton if not he used a club studded with sharpened nails or a length of barbed wire and of course i was helpless to defend myself because my hands and feet were in chains they didnt even provide a bucket for sanitary purposes so you lay in your own excrement then once every few days when the smell became too much even for the guards to endure they would come round with a hosepipe and spray down the cells moredi suddenly smiled sadly at graham so you see now why there was no need to put up a fence or a wall between the two buildings we werent going anywhere graham nodded grimly but said nothing any words would have been hollow after what moredi had told them i can give you a rough layout of the cell block but i wont go back in there again moredi said wringing his hands together not after what i went through we understand sabrina said gently are we going with mr laidlaws plan then tambese asked after a lengthy silence its worth a try graham replied but we cant go in there blind well have to check it out first agreed laidlaw replied then looked at tambese again can you get a copy of the plans of the sewers for the area around the prison not without arousing suspicion tambese answered i only managed to get a plan of branco because i remembered there was one at our headquarters in habane plans for the sewers will be kept at the city hall and thats closed we need the plans laidlaw said looking at each face in turn we cant do anything without them which only leaves one option graham concluded break into the city hall and get them wed never get past the roadblocks sabrina said added to which theres a curfew in the city from six at night to six in the morning moredi told them that only leaves us with one alternative well have to bring in the resistance movement ill call matthew okoye excuse me tambese said then got to his feet and walked to the door surely you can contact the resistance movement without involving okoye graham called out after him not really hes their leader tambese replied then left the room simon nhlapo scrambled behind the wheel of the ambulance and started the engine as his partner joe vuli jumped into the passenger seat beside him he switched on the siren then sped down the driveway and swung the ambulance out into the deserted street he had been a paramedic for eighteen years at the kondese national hospital well that was its new name it had been the margaret mobuto hospital named after alphonse mobutos wife who had died four years after it was opened in iyz but jamel mobuto had ordered the name to be changed within days of his fathers death just as the alphonse mobuto hospital became the habane national hospital nhlapo wasnt a political man but like many of the swahilis in and around kondese he saw a future for zimbala under jamel mobuto thats why he couldnt understand why the government had let ngune and his butchers take control of kondese he remembered well the days when kondese was alive with activity at night now the streets were deserted save for the patrolling gangs of ngunes vigilantes who toured the city centre in search of anyone foolish enough to violate the curfew punishment was immediate execution even the police force had been disbanded by massenga and now the only vehicles seen on the road after the curfew were those belonging to the besiegers and they had to have special passes affixed to their windscreens and of course the ambulances there had been an initial fear at the hospital that ngune would install his own puppet doctors but he had assured the administrator that he had no intention of interfering with the running of the hospital as long as the staff abided by his rules many did out of fear but others like vuli and himself had joined the resistance movement as soon as the security police overran kondese it was the first time he had ever been involved in an underground movement but he felt the time had come to make a stand against the brutality of ngune and his security police if ngune seized power the country would again be in the hands of a corrupt dictator nothing would have changed he had to be stopped but nhlapo also knew the penalty if he was ever caught as a resistance fighter that had been spelled out clearly at their first rally he would be taken to branco where they would torture then execute him dozens had already died at the hands of ngunes men since they returned to kondese it was as if they had never left the rumours that the army were preparing to move in to liberate the city had been rife for the last three weeks but so far nothing and the people of kondese were becoming desperate he trod on the brake pedal as they reached the first of the numerous roadblocks that lined the city streets it consisted of a sheet of rolled barbed wire that lay the width of the road four men stood beside it all in jeans and tshirts and all armed with kalashnikov assault rifles one of the men approached the drivers side of the ambulance the kalashnikov clenched tightly in his right hand where are you going he demanded theres been an accident on the m nhlapo replied a car went off the road the man nodded having already received word of the callout by the controller at the hospital the ambulance was searched for any weapons or contraband that the crew may be trying to smuggle past the roadblock but nothing was found satisfied the man returned to the drivers window youll be given a free passage through to the last roadblock on the outskirts of the city i know the drill by now nhlapo retorted tersely the man nodded to his colleagues and the barricade was pulled back until there was just enough room for the ambulance to get through nhlapo engaged the gears and sped off they passed another four roadblocks each time being waved through by an armed guard they were stopped as expected at the last one on the edge of the city again the ambulance was searched before being allowed to continue nhlapo drove the short distance to join the m it was eerie and deserted the resistance movement had shot out most of the lights to give them the cover they had needed to launch a series of lightning strikes on rebel patrols in the area the gutted remains of rebel vehicles on the side of the road were testament to the success of the mission over thirty rebels had been killed in the ambushes before ngune pulled his men back to within the confines of the city he had immediately reinforced the roadblocks on the edge of the city with both men and weapons to repel any attempt by the resistance movement to retake kondese but a succession of arrests and summary executions in the last fortnight had left the resistance movement disjointed and demoralized they couldnt launch an offensive on kondese without the backing of the government forces and they seemed determined to wait for ngune to make the first move vuli pointed to a figure in the distance who was frantically waving a white handkerchief to attract their attention nhlapo switched off the siren as he neared the man then pulled over onto the side of the road bringing the ambulance to a halt a few feet in front of him did you call the hospital nhlapo asked after he had jumped out of the ambulance yes tambese replied pocketing the handkerchief this is such a treacherous stretch of road nhlapo said especially at night tambese added or in the rain vuli said completing the password they had agreed with okoye when he had called them earlier at the hospital they didnt know tambeses name and he didnt know theirs it was a precaution in case any of them were arrested by the security police that way the damage would be minimal whats the plan nhlapo asked you get us past the roadblocks thats all you need to know how many are you three tambese replied then put two fingers in his mouth and whistled loudly laidlaw was the first to appear he was carrying a doctors black bag which okoyes wife had lent him she had a surgery in the city vuli gasped in shock when graham and sabrina emerged from the undergrowth behind him okoyes wife had spent over an hour making them up to look as though they had been involved in a car crash their faces and clothes were splattered with sheeps blood and both had discoloured bruises on their faces which she had carefully shaded with an eyebrow pencil its makeup tambese reassured vuli and nhlapo its very realistic said vuli thats the general idea tambese told him we have to get them through the roadblocks graham crossed to where laidlaw was standing you know what to do laidlaw bit back his anger and nodded take the car back to the farmhouse and wait for your call i still say i could be of some use no graham cut in quickly weve been through this before russ i need someone i can trust at the farmhouse to call new york in case something should go wrong moredis there laidlaw shot back he doesnt know sabrina and i work for un a co you do if you havent heard from us by daybreak call the number i gave you and speak to a guy called cw yeah i know ready mr graham tambese asked graham nodded laidlaw handed the doctors bag to tambese then looked back at graham you watch yourself you hear yeah graham muttered then walked over to the ambulance what about this sabrina asked indicating the holdall she was carrying it contained the three berettas three silenced uzis the spare ammunition clips and the holsters that tambese had drawn from the barracks in habane okoye had made the necessary arrangements to have the sniper rifle silencer and blowtorch left for them near the city hall by a member of the resistance movement graham looked at tambese well where do we put it we cant put it in the ambulance like that tambese replied theyd be sure to see it what do you suggest sabrina asked tambese clambered into the back of the ambulance pass me the holdall sabrina handed it to him he unzipped it and tipped the contents out onto one of the stretcher beds then pulling back the top sheets on both stretcher beds he carefully laid the weapons holsters and clips down the centre of the two mattresses before remaking the beds again so well be lying on them graham said tambese nodded its the first place theyll look graham shot back had you been locals yes tambese replied but youre foreigners and youre posing as journalists those things can make a lot of difference right now graham scrambled into the back of the ambulance and sat on one of the beds why should they make a difference because ill tell the rebels that you were attacked by government troops outside kondese theyre sure to see the potential of a major publicity coup if they were to get you the best possible medical care and that would mean giving the ambulance a free passage to the hospital it would be too good an opportunity for them to miss and if they dont fall for it graham asked then were in trouble tambese replied reaching out a hand to help sabrina into the back of the ambulance he told vuli in swahili to leave all the talking to him he also told him to knock on the glass partition when they neared the first of the roadblocks vuli nodded then closed the back doors and climbed back into the cab nhlapo started up the engine then wiped a drop of sweat from his face god help us if they find those guns vuli glanced at nhlapo and shook his head slowly not even he could help us then nhlapo swallowed nervously and did a uturn before heading back towards kondese vuli rapped loudly on the glass partition when the roadblock came into view nhlapo instinctively touched the brake pedal when one of the rebels stepped out into the road to wave down the ambulance vuli patted nhlapos arm reassuringly then reached for the clipboard on the dashboard it contained details of the accident which vuli had copied down almost word for word from the summary tambese had compiled before leaving the farmhouse ngune had insisted that the ambulance service make a report of any incident that took them beyond the roadblocks on the edge of the city that was considered nomans land by the rebels it was certainly a major victory for the resistance movement and it was only the beginning vuli told himself the ambulance stopped a few feet in front of the convoluted tangle of barbed wire spread across the road a battlescarred mi walker bulldog tank stood in the shadows beside a looted corner shop a man wearing a faded adidas tshirt sat on the turret a kalashnikov rifle beside him vuli also noticed the front portion of a ferret armoured car which was partially hidden up a sidestreet he knew from a former soldier who was now with the resistance movement that both vehicles were obsolete and there was a feeling that the mis dotted about the city didnt have the necessary parts to be used in conflict they were merely a bluff but they were all well guarded and all attempts by the resistance movement to capture one had ended in failure the man who had flagged down the ambulance rapped on the passenger window disturbing vulis thoughts vuli opened the window out both of you the man ordered vuli and nhlapo climbed out and another rebel immediately set about checking for any weapons that may have been picked up when the ambulance was out of their jurisidiction report the man clicked his fingers and held out his hand towards vuli give it to me vuli handed the clipboard to the man americans the man said looking up at vuli vuli nodded journalists open the back the man ordered nhlapo walked round to the back of the ambulance and opened the doors he had to check his surprise graham had an oxygen mask over his face and sabrina who lay with head lolled to one side had a drip attached to her arm with a strip of plaster the man looked from graham to sabrina then met tambeses cold stare who are you dr moka tambese retorted i live close to where their car left the road i was the first on the scene they are americans journalists both from new york are their injuries serious tambese nodded grimly they were shot at by a government patrol one of the bullets struck the woman she was driving she told me that much before she lost consciousness it seems as if he struck his head on the windscreen when the car hit the tree hes badly concussed they both need urgent medical attention at the hospital after we have searched the ambulance came the ziy sharp reply as if the man felt his authority was being undermined in front of his colleagues the woman is haemorrhaging tambese snapped and indicated the bag of blood connected to the drip she could die if she doesnt undergo surgery within the next hour and if she does you can be sure ill hold you personally responsible your colonel ngune would be crucified by the international press i doubt hed thank you for it do you a look of fear had spread across the mans face at the mention of ngune he looked at sabrina then spoke in a whispered tone to his colleagues who were congregated around the back of the ambulance whats the problem tambese thundered i need to get this woman to the hospital now the mans eyes flickered around the inside of the ambulance then he snatched the clipboard from vulis hand and signed the accident report tambese sighed deeply that was the clearance they needed how many more roadblocks will we have to stop at before we reach the hospital tambese asked glancing at the man you wont be stopped again came the reply thank you tambese said that might just make the difference between life and death for this woman the man told vuli to close the doors tambese slumped back in his chair as the doors slammed shut and wiped his hands over his face neither sabrina nor graham moved even though they had heard the doors close the ambulance started up and the siren was switched on again as soon as it pulled away from the roadblock were clear tambese said graham immediately sat up and pulled the oxygen mask from his face he winced as he massaged his spine jesus my backs killing me sabrina peeled the plaster off her arm and grinned at tambese i dont know what you said to him but you sure sounded mad as hell my mother died in the back of an ambulance tambese said after a thoughtful pause i guess i was just reliving those emotions im sorry sabrina said apologetically it was a long time ago tambese replied have we got free passage into the city graham asked breaking the sudden silence clear all the way tambese replied then wagged a finger at them i told you they would fall for it what did you say to them sabrina asked tambese translated the gist of the conversation using ngunes name seems to have done the trick graham said when tambese had finished it certainly helped his minions are terrified of him i can believe it sabrina said grimly vuli pulled back the glass partition and gave them a thumbsup where do you want to be dropped off he asked tambese in swahili go to the hospital tambese told him well take it from there vuli nodded then closed the partition again what about the ambulance men sabrina asked wont ngune take it out on them theyll go to ground after this the resistance movement will have them smuggled out of kondese the ambulance slowed down and tambese peered through the glass partition his hands cupped on either side of his face what is it graham asked anxiously were nearing the hospital tambese replied without looking round at him thank god for that what now get ready tambese answered then pulled open the glass partition again go round the back he said to nhlapo in swahili til tell you when to stop nhlapo nodded as he swung the ambulance into the driveway he switched off the siren graham and sabrina discarded their bloodsplattered clothes to reveal black jumpsuits after tugging a black woollen hat over her head sabrina took a tube of camouflage cream from her pocket and squeezed a little onto her palm then tossed the tube to graham he rubbed the cream over his face and hands then offered the tube to tambese who grinned goodhumouredly and waved him away graham shrugged pokerfaced and dropped it onto the bed tambese stripped off to his black jumpsuit then peered through the partition again watching for the line of refuse bins that okoye had told him to use as a landmark to disembark he knocked on the glass when they came into view and told nhlapo to pull over graham handed out the weapons then divided the clips into three piles on the bed they loaded their weapons and slipped the spare clips into the pouches on their belts after bolstering his beretta tambese knocked lightly on the partition nhlapo peered out of the drivers window and gave vuli the thumbsup sign vuli looked about furtively to make sure there wasnt anyone about then opened one of the doors and gestured to them to get out tambese ushered graham and sabrina out of the ambulance then jumped nimbly to the ground and vuli immediately closed the back door again get rid of the clothes and wipe the ambulance down for fingerprints tambese said to vuli no need were going to torch it anyway vuli replied those were our orders well thanks for your help good luck vuli said with a quick smile then looked around again go on a porter could come out here at any time tambese hauled himself over the low wall where graham and sabrina were already waiting for him the city halls a couple of hundred yards down the road he whispered he looked the length of the deserted street then turned back to them ready they both nodded then followed tambese down the embankment to the pavement where he paused to listen for any approaching vehicles silence he led them across the road then they ran doubled over to the nearest doorway the city hall which spanned the length of the adjacent block was an ugly oblongshaped building dating back to the early nineteenth century when the country was still part of the french empire tambese was about to break cover again when they heard the sound of an approaching engine they ducked into the doorway and lay flat on their stomachs their uzis held at the ready a black toyota pickup drove past with two men in the front and a third in the back his arms resting on the top of the cab a sterling submachine gun was slung over his shoulder he held a wine bottle in his hand the truck continued to the end of the road where the driver idled the engine for a few seconds while he decided which turnoff to take then he accelerated sharply and the tyres shrieked in protest as the truck pulled away and disappeared up a sidestreet tambese scrambled to his feet and scanned the street before giving graham and sabrina a thumbsup sign they sprinted the hundred yards to the front of the city hall and were still trying to catch their breath when they heard the sound of an engine in the distance tambese pointed to a cluster of shrubs against the side of the building and they ducked down behind them only seconds before the truck came back into view the man in the back shouted something to the driver who pulled the jeep over and stopped in front of the city hall the man got out and threw the empty wine bottle into the gutter the driver shouted angrily at him as glass splinters peppered the side of the truck the man grinned at the driver and held up his middle finger contemptuously then walked unsteadily towards the bushes sabrina instinctively shrunk further away from the approaching figure and backed into someones arm then she noticed that graham who was the closest to her was crouched with both arms folded across his chest cradling his uzi it hadnt been his arm she turned her head very slowly very reluctantly and looked to see whose it was a body was entangled in the bushes behind her the face which had been shot away at close range was seething with hundreds of writhing squirming maggots she felt a scream rise in her throat but graham clamped his hand roughly over her mouth before any noise could escape from her lips he had seen the body when she backed into it and had anticipated her reaction the man who was urinating onto a nearby bush didnt hear her muffled cry above his uneven whistling when he finished he returned to the truck still whistling to himself the driver immediately started up the engine and pulled away from the kerb within seconds silence returned to the deserted street you ok graham asked putting a hand lightly on her arm sabrina nodded guiltily tambese led them a short distance away from the body it had been decided that he and sabrina would break into the building while graham checked the area for the nearest manhole cover they would meet up again outside in twenty minutes time down sabrina said sharply as a pair of headlights swept into the street they ducked out of sight and moments later a jeep came into view it sped past the city hall and shot through a red light before disappearing up a sidestreet is that all they do graham asked tentatively getting to his feet again tambese nodded its very effective as youve seen you dont know when theyre likely to appear and if theyre hunting resistance fighters theyll drive without their lights on but that wont happen around here the resistance movement confine their attacks to the outlying areas of the city he looked at sabrina ready ready she replied synchronize watches tambese said he waited until the second hand reached the twelve on his watch ten fortytwo check graham said check sabrina added twenty minutes tambese said to graham then disappeared round the side of the building sabrina followed him and they kept low as they passed a succession of windows overlooking the spacious garden the grass was now anklehigh and the beds riddled with weeds tambese stopped beside a steel ladder which was bolted against the side of the building he crouched down and looked behind a nearby bush for the holdall okoye had said would be left there by the resistance movement he unzipped it and checked the contents a portable oxyacetylene blowpipe insulated gloves a canister of carbon dioxide a de lisle carbine a torch and a length of coiled rope he handed the torch to sabrina then slung the rope over one shoulder the uzi over the other and climbed up onto the flat roof he surveyed the surrounding streets then beckoned to sabrina who shouldered her uzi and climbed to the top of the ladder where tambese was waiting for her she ignored his outstretched hand and jumped nimbly onto the roof theres the skylight she said pointing to the glass window in the centre of the roof tambese crossed to it and cupping his hands on either side of his face peered through the glass well sabrina prompted behind him matthew was right it is some kind of a storeroom there must be thousands of files down there whats the distance to the floor its a drop of about thirty feet tambese replied then removed the rope from his shoulder this is forty foot well i hope it is so do i sabrina said and indicated the flagpole behind them well need the extra few feet to tie it to that tambese unwound the rope and secured one end to the flagpole he pulled sharply on the rope to test the strength of the pole it was anchored firmly into the concrete he looked around slowly the streets were still deserted he crouched down beside the skylight again it shouldnt take me long to open it sabrina hooked her fingers under the frame and lifted it up it was open tambese said in amazement she held up a nail file the woods rotted over the years it wasnt very difficult to release the catch tambese smiled then pulled back the skylight and dropped the rope through the opening it fell to within a couple of feet of the floor he held the rope out towards her she slung her uzi over her shoulder then abseiled down landing silently on the floor below tambese followed and had almost reached the floor when he noticed that sabrina was holding out her hand towards him the gesture wasnt lost on him and he knew she was right she deserved to be treated as an equal not as a woman in a mans world he held up his hand to concede the point she moved to the door and opened it fractionally the corridor was deserted she gave him a thumbsup then turned back to watch the corridor through the crack in the door he pulled okoyes map from his pocket and used it to get his bearings he was surrounded by rows of shelves all ladened with dusty dogeared files they didnt interest him what did were the dozens of drawers that lined the walls they contained the blueprints of every structure ever built in and around kondese in the last twenty years okoyes contact had said the blueprints for the city sewers would be stored under section tambese went to the nearest row of drawers to get his bearings and it came as a great relief to discover that each drawer was numbered in multiples of ten and not in single units as he had feared he quickly found the section he wanted and pulled open the drawer marked the blueprints which were rolled up and secured with elastic bands lay in neat rows and each had a white label attached to it identifying it by number he cursed under his breath without a code he would have to unroll each one individually when he took the first one out he noticed a sheet of paper stuck to the bottom of the drawer he pushed aside the blueprints lying on top and found it contained the index to identify the numbers he ran his fingers down the list then replaced the blueprint and closed the drawer it wasnt in there someones coming sabrina hissed tambese looked round sharply at her and gestured for her to close the door she did as he said then took up a position at the side of the door waiting he unslung his uzi and trained it on the door he was certain they hadnt been seen from the street and okoyes contact had said that the alarms had been cut by the security police when they took control of the building so how had they been detected he quickly reassured himself that the guards appearance could have nothing to do with them what if he were going to another room it was a long corridor suddenly the door handle was pushed down from the outside the door was locked as it had been when they got there sabrina stiffened the uzi held inches from her face she curled her finger around the trigger when she heard the sound of keys jangling outside the door moments later a key was pushed into the lock and the door opened slowly but nobody entered then there was a distinctive metallic click above them followed by an order in swahili for them to drop their weapons tambese shook his head at sabrina when he saw her hands tighten on the uzi he turned slowly and looked up at the skylight a man stood a couple of feet away from the window the kalashnikov assault rifle in his hand trained on tambese he repeated his order tambese dropped the uzi a second man entered the room and quickly disarmed sabrina i could have taken him she hissed to tambese so could i but at what price the other one would have opened fire and even if we had managed to take him out as well the gunfire would have alerted every patrol in the area the last thing we need is a gunfight in the middle of the city centre sabrina remained silent she knew he was right she prayed that graham had seen the man climb up onto the roof at that moment he was their only chance tambese purposely spoke to the guard on the roof hoping graham would hear the voice the guard grinned and pointed to the wall by the door theres an infrared sensor embedded in the wall by the door tambese translated for sabrina thats how they detected us okoye said nothing about any sensors sabrina whispered back they were put in when the security police got here it was one way of cutting down on guards the guard behind tambese told him to be quiet he looked up at his colleague and as they spoke tambeses face became increasingly grim what is it sabrina hissed out of the corner of her mouth theyre deciding what to do with us the one up there says were curfewbreakers and should be shot now the one behind us wants to call branco and tell ngune again tambese was told to be quiet the guard pulled the hat off sabrinas head spilling her hair onto her shoulders he shouted something to his colleague and the two men laughed what did they say she asked tambese who had got to his feet again you dont want to know he replied the butt of the kalashnikov slammed into tambeses back again as punishment for speaking to her he stumbled and fell to the floor the guard aimed the kalashnikov at him his finger curled around the trigger sabrina lashed out with her foot catching him on the wrist the kalashnikov spun from his hand the guard above them swung his gun on sabrinas back tambese knew he could never reach the uzis before the guard pulled the trigger he lunged at sabrina and knocked her to the ground the guard on the roof opened his mouth and a trickle of blood seeped down his chin then he fell through the skylight landing with a deafening thud on the wooden floor there were two bullet holes in his back tambese and the remaining guard both made a grab for the fallen kalashnikov the guard got to it first he lashed out with the butt and caught tambese on the side of the face tambese reeled backwards like a groggy boxer who had been rocked by a punishing right hook the guard swung the kalashnikov on sabrina who was still reaching for her uzi then he saw a movement above him he was still raising the kalashnikov when graham shot him twice in the chest the bullets punched him back against the wall and he slid lifelessly to the floor graham crouched at the edge of the skylight you guys o k down there sabrina retrieved the uzis then looked up at graham what kept you thats gratitude for you graham retorted did you find the manhole tambese asked gingerly rubbing his cheek yeah with great difficulty the nearest is a couple of streets away thats what took me so long that and dodging half a dozen patrols you got the plans yet not yet tambese replied but it wont take me long sabrina piled her hair up on her head and pulled the hat back onto her head she shouldered her uzi then climbed up to the roof tambese rifled through the remaining drawers until he found the blueprint he stuffed it down the front of his shirt then he too climbed back up to the roof graham pulled up the rope and sabrina closed the window over the skylight how long before theyll be missed sabrina asked looking through the window at the bodies below them the next shift comes on at six in the morning well be long gone before then graham untied the rope from the flagpole then looped it over his shoulder and followed tambese and sabrina down the ladder how far is the prison from here sabrina asked once they had reached the ground about three miles due east tambese replied then pulled the blueprint out from under his shirt and put it in the holdall well look at it when we get to the sewers at least there we wont be constantly on the lookout for rebel patrols he took the rope from graham and replaced it in the holdall ready graham nodded then broke cover and sprinted a hundred yards to the safety of a low hedge at the bottom of the garden he scanned the length of the deserted street then gestured for them to follow they ran to the hedge and crouched down beside him graham was about to get to his feet when he heard the sound of an approaching car engine they lay flat on the ground until it faded into the distance graham got to his haunches again and peered over the hedge he nodded and ran to the gate wincing as it creaked open then he beckoned them forward and led them across the road up a narrow alley linking the two adjoining streets he held up his hand as they reached the end of the alley and peered cautiously the length of the second street it was deserted he pointed to the manhole cover in the road fifty yards away from where they stood tambese put the holdall on the ground and flexed his hand where the straps had dug into his flesh he was about to pick it up again when sabrina tugged his sleeve and tapped her chest with her finger she picked it up it was heavy but then it would be she reminded herself inside were the oxyacetylene tanks graham looked round at them then slipped out into the street careful to keep close to the buildings in case they needed the cover of a doorway they were twenty yards from the manhole when the man emerged from the shadows of an alley on the other side of the street tambese immediately recognized him as the same man who had urinated in the bushes at the city hall he had another bottle of liquor in his hand it fell from his fingers the moment he saw them and he was still reaching for his shouldered kalashnikov when tambese shot him graham sprinted over to him and felt for a pulse he looked up and shook his head i thought you said they never patrolled on foot sabrina said to tambese once they had crossed to the body they dont tambese replied grimly which means his buddies will be back for him graham concluded weve got to hide the body sabrina said looking around for a suitable place graham snapped his fingers the sewer til get the cover tambese said already running towards the manhole graham wiped the sweat from his forehead then anxiously looked the length of the street knowing the jeep could return at any time or another patrol could appear he hooked his hands under the mans arms and sabrina grabbed his legs and they carried him over to where tambese was struggling to prise open the cover hurry up graham hissed im doing my best came the sharp riposte graham laid the body on the ground and crouched down beside tambese between them they managed to lift the cover and lay it silently on the road sabrina dragged the body to the edge of the opening and graham helped her tip it into the sewer it struck the water with a loud splash then silence tambese peered into the darkness there was a set of rungs embedded in the wall leading down to the sewer he eased himself through the opening and descended to a ledge the stench was awful graham went next sabrina was about to follow when she remembered the holdall she hurried over to the mouth of the alley but as she picked it up she heard the sound of an engine approaching at speed she knew she would never reach the manhole in time and looking across at graham gestured for him to pull the cover back over the opening he hauled it into place seconds before the truck turned into the street sabrina melted into the darkness of the alley the holdall in one hand the uzi in the other she ducked behind a row of metal drums and clamped her hand over her face to block out the putrefying smell of the rubbish that surrounded her the truck pulled up in front of the alley and the driver shouted the dead mans name the second man in the passenger seat pointed to the broken bottle then threw up his arms in despair and climbed out of the truck the driver tossed him a torch and sabrina crouched down as the beam cut through the darkness it hit the drum in front of her casting a shadowy light on the ground in front of her then she saw it a large bloated black rat gnawing at a piece of stale bread that lay inches away from her foot she inhaled sharply not daring to move as the beam continued to play across the drums it reminded her vividly of the incident when as a child she had been inadvertently locked in a cellar and for the next two hours all she had heard in the darkness was the incessant scurrying of the rats around her it had left her with a deeprooted fear of all rodents which had almost killed her while on assignment in yugoslavia she had broken cover after discovering that a box she and graham were crouched behind was infested with rats graham had saved her life by tackling her a splitsecond before a bullet would have hit her the man finally switched off the torch and walked back to the truck he spoke briefly to the driver and climbed back into the passenger seat the driver cursed angrily then started the engine and drove off sabrina waited until the engine had faded into the distance before getting to her feet the sudden movement startled the rat and it disappeared through a hole in the wall behind her she was sweating rats still frightened her but at least now she was able to control her emotions and that discipline had certainly saved her life she picked up the holdall and moved cautiously to the entrance of the alley the street was deserted she hurried over to the manhole and knocked on the cover it was pushed back and grahams head appeared above the level of the road you ok he asked anxiously she nodded and handed the holdall to him he passed it on to tambese then pressed himself against the wall to let sabrina climb down to the ledge she took the torch from the holdall and switched it on the first object the beam picked out was a dead rat floating in the water theres a lot of them down here tambese said behind her i can live with that she replied nonchalantly graham smiled to himself then pulled the cover back into place nine carmen looked up in surprise when whitlock entered the lounge what are you doing up cw those sleeping tablets were supposed to have knocked you out until morning i never took them whitlock replied easing himself into his favourite armchair i dont believe it she retorted then closed the book she was reading and placed it on the table beside her you need rest why else do you think i asked the doctor to prescribe you such a strong sedative im on standby carmen what if there were an emergency what use would i be laid out cold until morning she shook her head in desperation your arms in a sling for gods sake what use would you be anyway i know this might come as something of a shock to you but un ago can function without you now please take those tablets and go to bed stop fussing carmen im ok he retorted then inhaled sharply through clenched teeth when he bumped his arm against the chair so i see she got to her feet ok if you wont listen to me as your wife then will you at least listen to me as a doctor im not one of your kid patients he said irritably no youre not at least they have the sense to listen to me when i tell them to take their medicine she snatched the book off the table and disappeared into the kitchen he crossed to the drinks cabinet and poured himself a small whisky before returning to the armchair he had certainly been tempted to take the sleeping pills if only to escape from the guilt he felt inside a guilt that stemmed from deceit it had started when sabrina rang him from zimbala to get mobuto to vouch for joseph moredi then she had called him again to get a clearance on colonel david tambese he had secretly obtained the necessary information from a computer file in the command centre in return for his help she had confided to him that she and graham were working together to find remy mobuto but kolchinsky had forbidden her to go near kondese it had to be their secret whitlock had been caught in two minds she was acting in direct violation of an order and that could lead to her being suspended moreover he would be part of it if he kept the information to himself but they were his partners and he had given his word not to tell kolchinsky at first he felt he had done the right thing but the guilt had taken effect like a slowacting poison and now it weighed heavily on his mind he knew all he had to do was call kolchinsky to clear his conscience but he had given his word no he would stand by them even if it went against him he was still a field operative he would only be transferred to the management side at the end of the year his loyalty was still to graham and sabrina it didnt ease his conscience but at least he felt his actions were justified but if they screwed up the telephone rang interrupting his train of thought cw sergei whitlock replied immediately recognizing kolchinskys voice hows the arm whitlock glanced towards the kitchen door its ok thanks whats up im sure you didnt call just to ask me about my arm no kolchinsky agreed its about your niece rosie how do you know about rosie whitlock shot back in surprise im not going to explain it over the phone ive sent a car over for you it should be there in about twenty minutes sergei is she alright whitlock demanded i dont know kolchinsky replied you dont know whitlock retorted sharply why are you being so damn evasive kolchinsky sighed deeply down the line a tshirt with her name on it was found in a flat in the murray hill district three bodies were also found in the flat two of them were policemen but rosie wasnt there thats all i know at the moment im on my way down there now whose flat was it we dont know not yet kolchinsky replied til see you there cw and dont say anything to her parents until weve established what really happened sure whitlock muttered then replaced the receiver and looked up at carmen who had been standing in the doorway for the duration of the call ive got to go out its rosie isnt it whitlock nodded then got to his feet whats happened to her thats what im hoping to find out whitlock replied then squeezed her arm reassuringly before walking into the bedroom the whole street had been cordoned off by the police by the time whitlock arrived the driver pulled up next to kolchinsky who was standing a few yards away from the growing crowd of onlookers struggling behind the police tape to get a better view of the entrance to the apartment block word had already spread among them of at least three murders inside the building and all they wanted to see now were the bodies being brought out to the two ambulances parked close to the steps leading up into the foyer kolchinsky opened the back door and whitlock climbed out the driver who had already been told by kolchinsky to wait for whitlock drove away in search of a parking space whitlock held his injured arm close to his chest as he followed kolchinsky to the front of the crowd a patrolman who had already been told by a superior to give kolchinsky authorized access to the area immediately pulled up the tape to allow the two men through whitlock grabbed kolchinskys arm once they were out of earshot of the crowd i want some answers before we go in there firstly how did the police know to get in touch with you about rosie we have files on the relatives of all un ago personnel both here and abroad a list of those names is in the hands of interpol the fbi and the nypd we cant afford to take any chances cw thats a violation of their civil rights whitlock shot back as they continued to walk towards the building spare the lecture cw its in their interests as much as ours if they get into trouble with the law we need to know about it to prevent the possibility of the organization being compromised in the ensuing investigation and in certain cases we can pull strings to have the charges dropped for the same reason and who has access to these files jacques rust at our headquarters in zurich the colonel and myself theyre completely confidential thats why weve never told any of the staff about them but youre an exception youll have access to them when you join the management team at the end of the year you need to know about them and what if i wasnt joining the management team at the end of the year whitlock countered kolchinsky smiled faintly then you wouldnt be here would you are these relatives ever tailed if we feel its necessary yes and rosie no kolchinsky replied softly as they mounted the steps a policeman opened one of the glass doors for them and they stepped into the foyer kolchinsky pressed the button for the lift in retrospect i should have had her tailed who knows perhaps this could have been averted truth is i didnt even know she had violated her bail restrictions until tonight i thought she was still in the custody of her parents they got into the lift and kolchinsky pressed the button for the third floor did you know she was here kolchinsky asked suddenly no but i knew she wasnt at home she walked out the day she was released into her parents custody she had an argument with her father he and i went looking for her in times square thats where she usually hangs out but we couldnt find her if wed called in the police shed have been done for bail violation and that would almost certainly have made the difference between a suspended sentence and a jail sentence id already had a word with the commissioner the charges were to have been dropped even with a bail violation but that was before this its out of my hands now cw im sorry whitlock nodded grimly but said nothing the lift stopped at the third floor and kolchinsky identified himself to a uniformed policeman who told him where the deputy police commissioner was waiting for them kolchinsky thanked him and led the way into the flat whitlock stopped in the entrance and looked down at the two dead policemen before following kolchinsky into the lounge the man seated in the armchair was in his early fifties with fine brown hair and a rugged leathery face sergei how are you the man asked in a surprisingly gentle voice kolchinsky shook the extended hand c w whitlock deputy commissioner sean hagen cw works for us hes also rosies uncle pleased to meet you sir whitlock said also shaking the extended hand sit down wont you hagen said indicating the sofa opposite him what happened sean kolchinsky asked taking the proffered seat hagen rubbed his hands over his face then explained about the note doyle had left with his friend which had been forwarded on to the police after doyle had failed to keep a rendezvous that afternoon and the two patrolmen came here looking for doyle kolchinsky said hagen nodded they were shot in cold blood sergei neither of them even had time to draw his weapon both were married with kids his eyes instinctively flickered towards whitlock i want their killer brought to book and ill leave no stone unturned in doing it you think rosie shot them whitlock fired back in amazement a sixteenyearold kid shes never picked up a gun in her life cw thats enough kolchinsky said softly but firmly and put a hand lightly on whitlocks arm no i dont think your niece shot them mr whitlock hagen said at length all three murders were professional hits who was the third victim kolchinsky asked doyle yes he was shot several hours before the two patrolmen he was killed in the hall then taken into the bedroom and put under the bed we found bloodstains on the carpet in the hall what about fingerprints whitlock asked weve already lifted several sets the only ones to be positively identified so far are your nieces ive got a team working around the clock trying to match the other sets if you need any help no hagen cut across kolchinskys words he sighed deeply but thank you anyway well trace them ourselves and no other clues whitlock asked only that a neighbour saw your niece leave here with a tall man about five oclock this afternoon she couldnt describe him because he was wearing dark glasses a fedora and a leather jacket with the lapels up but apart from that nothing which only strengthens my belief that this was a professional job it could have been the work of a hitman from one of the drug cartels who knows your niece was mixed up in that scene wasnt she she smoked a bit of pot thats all christ you make it sound as if she was a mule or a pusher for one of the cartels drugs are drugs hagen retorted so ban nicotine and alcohol whitlock snapped then got to his feet and moved to the window hagen stood up well if youll excuse me sergei ive got a press conference in twenty minutes kolchinsky walked with hagen to the door im sorry about cw sean hes upset naturally he and rosie have always been close shes probably closer to him than she is to her own father til call you if anything comes up hagen said then shook kolchinskys hand and walked into the kitchen to consult with his detectives we might as well go whitlock said behind kolchinsky there isnt anything we can do here anyway youre right youve done enough already kolchinsky retorted angrily what got into you speaking to the deputy police commissioner like that you were well out of turn til see you outside whitlock retorted and strode out of the apartment towards the lift cw wait up kolchinsky called out then hurried after him whitlock held the lift and they descended to the foyer in silence hagen and i have different values sergei whitlock said as they walked towards the entrance he wants to find a cops killer i want to find rosie shes out there somewhere and you can be sure shes scared as hell whoever killed doyle and those cops isnt going to just let her go is he shes a witness it had crossed my mind that she might already be dead but i dont really think thats very likely now why take her away and kill her when he could have done the job here no i think he needs her for something why else take her with him im scared for her sergei really scared kolchinsky put a consoling hand on whitlocks arm then led the way down the steps into the street he gave a curt no comment to a news reporter who was hovering hopefully for a story then ducked underneath the police tape and forced a path through the crowd to where the driver was waiting for them kolchinsky sent him off to fetch the car til keep you posted on any new developments cw kolchinsky assured him but there really isnt much else either of us can do tonight and you need to rest that arm its okwhitlockreplied then why were you cursing every time someone touched it when we were making our way through the crowd kolchinsky smiled gently of course it hurts you need to rest it let rogers handle the security tomorrow its the presidents last engagement before he flies out and the trade center has to be one of the most securityconscious buildings in the state of new york i want to be there whitlock said stubbornly youve already prepared a schedule for the security team you dont need to be there tm in charge of mobutos security until he flies out of jfk tomorrow night end of story kolchinsky shrugged helplessly tm not going to argue with you ah here comes your driver whitlock slipped his hand into his inside jacket pocket and withdrew a newspaper ask the lab boys to dust it for prints what kolchinsky replied in surprise it was down the side of the sofa in the flat i lifted it when you walked hagen to the door some of the prints will be smudged from its being in my pocket but theyre sure to pick up something even if its only rosies prints kolchinsky took the paper carefully from whitlock this is against the law you know so is keeping files on the relatives of un ago personnel whitlock replied pokerfaced have you got a copy of rosies prints no but it wont be difficult to get them now go on home call me tonight if the lab boys come up with something whitlock said then climbed into the back of the car kolchinsky closed the door behind him then slapped the roof the driver pulled away and moments later the mercedes was swallowed up in the evening traffic kolchinsky looked back as the first of the bodies was loaded into one of the ambulances then turned away and walked towards his car rosie woke with a splitting headache she was lying on a single bed in a small room with a chest of drawers an armchair and a small basin by the window the curtains were drawn she swung her legs slowly off the bed then sat forward her face in her hands it was then that she smelled the chloroform on her clothes then it all came back to her a terrifying flashback the two policemen kenny then the blow on the back of the head when she had come round in the flat the man she knew as marc had finished packing his belongings and the holdall and attache case stood by the front door he had been sitting against the wall his knees drawn up in front of him watching her the automatic hung loosely in his right hand he had told her that they were going to walk down to the street together where a car would be waiting for them any attempt to draw attention to themselves and he would kill her after all he had nothing to lose he had draped the jacket over his gun hand and carried the attache case in the other she had to carry the holdall he had kept the barrel of the gun pressed firmly against her ribs until they reached the car parked in front of the building the driver was a black man she had never seen before the two men had spoken a language she didnt understand then she was bundled into the back of the car and a chloroformsoaked cloth had been clamped over her face that was the last thing she remembered until now she didnt know where she was or how long she had been there she rubbed her temples gingerly trying to massage away the pain what she would give for a headache tablet she switched on the bedside lamp then got to her feet and moved to the door it was locked then she went to the window she drew back the curtains a pair of shutters had been secured over the window she tried to open the window it was stuck she tried again it wouldnt budge she looked about for something to break the glass there wasnt anything she checked the chest of drawers empty she slumped dejectedly on the bed and struggled to hold back the tears suddenly there was the sound of a key being inserted in the door it was unlocked and opened bernard entered the room and sat down in the armchair where am i rosie demanded safe bernard replied with a smile then glanced across at the chest of drawers that was good thinking looking for something to break the window but it wouldnt have done you any good anyway its reinforced glass how did she trailed off and looked about the room before glaring at bernard wheres the camera behind the mirror bernard said gesturing towards it youre sick she snapped then winced as a sharp pain shot through her head bernard held up two aspirin you look like you need these go to hell bernard chuckled i admire your spirit rosie youre quite a kid you know that why are you holding me here bernard put the tablets on the chest of drawers then got to his feet youre my insurance policy what are you talking about insurance against what what you dont know wont hurt you lets keep it that way id hate to see you end up like your friend kenny strange as it may seem i like you youre a good kid mixed up but still a good kid take those tablets and come on through to the lounge when you feel better bernard paused in the doorway and looked back at her you remind me a lot of myself when i was your age he smiled thoughtfully then disappeared out into the hall she moved to the open door but the black man who had driven the car suddenly appeared in the doorway his arms folded across his chest he ran his eyes the length of her body then grinned to himself she stepped away from the door then went to the chest of drawers and picked up the tablets she poured some water into the plastic mug on the basin and washed down the aspirin bernard called out to the man when rosie looked round he had disappeared from the doorway she peered cautiously out into the hall it was deserted then she noticed the door at the end of the hall it had to be the front door but was it locked there was only one way of finding out she could hardly contain her excitement as she hurried towards it it was only on a yale lock but when she unlocked it it only opened a couple of inches damn it was on a chain as well she hadnt seen that rosie bernard shouted from the doorway of the lounge she didnt look round she fumbled desperately with the chain half expecting to be ripped away from the door at any moment she managed to unhook the chain and waited until he had almost reached her then sidestepping his outstretched hand she jerked the door back as hard as she could the edge caught him in the face and he stumbled back against the wall blood pouring from a gash above his right eye she darted out and slammed the door behind her she found herself on a porch a wood surrounded the house as far as the eye could see but there was a twohundred yard clearing before she reached the first of the trees she bounded down the stairs ran down the narrow path and wrenched open the gate before sprinting across the clearing towards the trees bernard pulled open the door and emerged onto the porch the front of his shirt was already streaked with blood and his sleeve was stained from where he had used it to wipe the blood from his face the second man appeared behind him and aimed his walther at rosie bernard pushed the mans arm down angrily put the gun away elias he hurried to the gate and cupped his hands around his mouth rosie listen to me dont go into the woods theyre full of animal traps she kept running rosie dont go in there elias came up behind bernard and handed him a torch animal traps he said in hesitant english then closed his hands together to represent the jaws of a trap snapping shut yes the woods full of them if she stands on one of those it could take her foot off what can we do elias asked switching to arabic we go after her bernard retorted then sprinted towards the section of the woods where he had seen rosie disappear seconds earlier elias stared after bernard reluctant to go near the trees bernard stopped and looked round angrily at elias go round the side cut her off he shouted breathlessly then continued to run towards the trees elias swallowed nervously what was worse the animal traps or bernards wrath if he refused to obey him it wasnt a difficult choice he moved towards the trees rosie paused for breath when she reached the edge of the trees the wood looked dark and forbidding by the light of the moon she had heard bernards warning but had it been a bluff or was he telling the truth she had once seen a television documentary on the appalling injuries incurred by animals who had been caught in these traps it had left her in tears she looked back at the approaching silhouette of bernard she had to make a decision and quickly she had to go on she picked up a branch then began to move further into the wood using the branch to prod the ground in front of her one mistake and she could be crippled for life if in fact there were traps but she couldnt afford to take the chance she ducked behind a tree and listened carefully for the sound of bernard behind her it was silent not that she was surprised he was obviously a professional if only she could find somewhere to hide until daybreak then she could make her way safely through the wood she was about to move further in the wood when she saw a light cut through the darkness to her left she pressed herself against the tree not daring to even wipe the sweat from her face she tried to blink it away as it stung her eyes the beam scythed across the darkness then went out as suddenly as it had come on rosie bernard called out the voice came from behind her the torch light had come from a different direction were they trying to close in on her from different directions she wiped her forearm across her face then moved tentatively to her right the branch still scraping the ground in front of her it was noisy but there was nothing she could do about it she heard a rustle in front of her and ducked behind a tree a splitsecond before the torch beam sliced through the darkness again panning the trees around her elias shouted something in swahili and she heard him approaching the tree had he seen her or was he trying to force her to break cover the footsteps came closer then stopped and the torch went out where was he she swallowed nervously and ran her tongue across her dry lips the silence was agonizing where the hell was he keeping her back pressed firmly against the tree she turned her head slightly and peered cautiously into the darkness behind her nothing at least he wasnt on the other side of the tree then she heard another noise this time to her right it had to be bernard but did they know where she was she forced herself to control her ragged breathing she had to keep silent it was her only chance then a torch beam shone onto a cluster of trees thirty yards away from her they didnt know where she was she felt a surge of relief flow through her bernard called out her name again it came from the direction of the torch beam the light became fainter as he moved further into the wood she screamed in terror as someone grabbed her arm from behind and yanked her away from the tree elias switched on his torch then shouted to bernard that hed caught her his voice seemed to bring her out of her shock she lashed out with the branch catching him on the side of the face the walther fell to the ground as he clutched his face in agony she turned to run but he grabbed her roughly round the neck and threw her to the ground winding her he kept the torch beam trained on her as he felt in the darkness for the walther there was a sickening crunch of bone as the jaws of a trap hidden under a pile of leaves snapped over his wrist he screamed in agony and the torch fell from his grasp as he slumped to his knees where he clawed desperately at the serrated edges of the trap in a frantic attempt to release his mangled wrist bernard reached them and shone his torch onto the trap rosie turned away sharply and clutched her stomach as she vomited against the tree help me elias screamed at bernard in arabic why youre no use to me now bernard said disdainfully and shot him through the head rosie huddled against the tree as the gunshot echoed across the silent wood bernard grabbed her arm roughly and hauled her to her feet she purposely averted her eyes from the body at her feet have you finished playing games now bernard snapped bolstering his automatic she could only nod mutely then lets get out of here before we have another z accident he said then tightened his grip on her arm and marched her back to the house thats better bernard said after he had handcuffed her to the radiator in the bedroom she tugged angrily at the handcuffs then slumped back against the wall he left the room closing the door behind him and went to the main bathroom to attend to the cut above his eye the bleeding had stopped and the area around the eye was already swollen and puffy it would be closed by morning he wet a cloth and dabbed it gingerly against his eyebrow the wound turned out to be deeper than he had originally thought he washed his hands and face then found some disinfectant and cotton wool in the wall cabinet above the basin he sprinkled some of the disinfectant onto the cotton wool then pressed it against his eyebrow his face remained expressionless as the disinfectant seeped agonizingly into the wound he discarded the swab then went to his bedroom and changed into a clean shirt sitting on the edge of the bed he picked up the telephone and dialled an unlisted number then propped a pillow against the headboard and sat back against it waiting for the call to be answered when it was there was only silence on the other end of the line its columbus bernard said this is seabird ive been trying to contact you for hours where the hell are you at the safe house off the garden state parkway what came the incredulous reply you werent cleared to stay there i didnt exactly have much time to pick and choose did i or havent you heard about what happened at the apartment of course i heard seabird retorted angrily that was one of our best safe houses in the city and thanks to you its been blown three bodies two of them cops what the hell happened there and whats this about whitlocks niece being involved bernard explained briefly about rosie her connection with doyle and the reason the police had come to the apartment and why wasnt i informed that youre holding whitlocks niece seabird said once bernard had finished speaking you could blow the whole operation you werent informed because it doesnt concern you shes my insurance in case something should go wrong tomorrow insurance against what do you honestly think un ago will just let you walk away because youve got whitlocks niece credit them with some professionalism of course they wont but i can use her to buy time bernard swung his legs off the bed but were speculating here nothing will go wrong i guarantee that why dont i feel reassured i need a favour thats why i called bernard said then went on to explain what had happened earlier at the house i need another babysitter for the girl do you now came the sarcastic riposte and who the hell was this elias anyway the fifth member of the zimbalan team fifth i was told there were only four i included a fifth man as backup it seemed the sensible thing to do in case one of the others was killed or arrested before the operation began you included him this whole operation was devised after months of detailed planning but that doesnt seem to bother you does it you just do what the hell you want dont you you work for us in case youd forgotten and we tell you what to do is that understood sure bernard replied disinterestedly what about that babysitter youre not getting one then find yourself another assassin bernard replied and slammed the receiver back into the cradle the telephone rang moments later bernard picked it up yes columbus yes dont you ever do that to me again then wed better come to an arrangement about a babysitter bernard said matteroffactly very well came the bitter reply youll have one in the morning thats the best i can do thats fine i only need him to watch the girl while im at the trade center the line went dead bailey sat thoughtfully in his study after he had replaced the receiver then reached for the bourbon beside him and took a sip it was just as well he had already arranged to have bernard eliminated after mobutos death a babysitter indeed he glanced at his watch seven fortyfive brett would already be at the hotel having relieved rogers at six that evening he found the number of the united nations plaza and when he got through asked the switchboard operator to connect him to the room which had been specially set aside for the presidential bodyguards it was answered by brett its bailey can you talk no came the quick reply can you get to another phone and call me back sure brett replied til be waiting bailey said then replaced the receiver and drank down the remainder of the scotch brett called back five minutes later what time does rogers relieve you bailey asked eight tomorrow morning brett answered right when he gets there i want you to go straight from the hotel to the safe house off the garden state parkway you know the one i mean i should do sir i helped to lay the traps bernards there but i thought he was staying at the apartment in murray hill brett replied he was until he shot two policemen there sweet jesus how did that happen til brief you tomorrow all you have to worry about at the moment is getting to the safe house in the morning til be there sir hes holding whitlocks niece as a form of insurance in case anything should go wrong at the trade center tomorrow he wants you there to keep an eye on her while hes away insurance it sounds like hes cracking sir no hes just being shrewd like he always is do as he says then kill him when he returns to the house irrespective of whats happened at the trade center we wont be able to use him again after tomorrow anyway but be careful hes smart hes sure to suspect well go after him once this is over and the girl shes a witness isnt she but she mustnt be harmed until youve killed him as i said hes smart hes quite likely to have devised a method of approaching the house unseen and if he sees shes dead hell pull out then well have lost him i understand sir good hows my favourite president hes in a meeting with his colleagues from the embassy theyve been locked away in his suite for the last three hours god knows what theyre discussing it doesnt really matter does it by this time tomorrow hell be dead brett chuckled yes sir he will bailey smiled to himself then replaced the receiver he left the study secured the door behind him then went downstairs to join his wife and children in the lounge kolchinsky rubbed his eyes wearily then opened another of the files that had been left on philpotts desk for him it was one of half a dozen in front of him each containing an update on one of the un ago strike force teams currently on assignment they were compiled by duty analysts in the command centre he read the first two paragraphs of the report then stifled a yawn and got to his feet he wasnt taking any of it in he needed a break pouring himself a coffee from the dispenser behind him he moved to the nearest of the black sofas and sat down he lit a cigarette and was about to reach for his coffee when the interleading door between the office and the command centre slid open and an analyst entered carrying a folder not another update hans kolchinsky said with a resigned sigh no weve matched the prints taken from the newspaper you brought in earlier hans held the folder out towards kolchinsky i think youd better take a look for yourself sir kolchinsky took the folder and opened it inside was a printout of the computer file corresponding to the prints the name was typed in capital letters across the top of the page jeanjacques bernard he closed the folder and placed it on the table is there anything else sir no thank you hans kolchinsky replied hans returned to the command centre activating the door behind him kolchinsky looked at the folder again he knew he should be surprised but he wasnt he couldnt explain the feeling it was almost as if he had expected something like this subconsciously had he he glanced across at the telephone on philpotts desk whitlock had asked him to call with any news on the fingerprints but what good would it do waking whitlock with that kind of news he wouldnt get to sleep again and it wasnt as if either of them could do anything about it no hed tell whitlock about it in the morning he reached for the folder and inadvertently knocked the cup off the table spilling coffee onto the carpet he cursed angrily but when he bent down to retrieve the cup he noticed something attached to the underside of the table at first he thought it was a spider or even a piece of gum but when he got closer he realized it was a microphone no bigger than a mans coat button it had two prongs on the back which had been used to secure it to the wood he made no attempt to remove it no that would only alert the person who had planted it there and there was only one man who could have done it dave forsythe whose job it had been for the last year to check the command centre philpotts office and sarahs office for bugs when he came on duty every morning he was one of the senior electronic experts in the organization kolchinsky could hardly believe it but the proof was there and how long had it been there how long had the organization been compromized he got to his feet and picked up the folders hed read the rest of them at home at least there he wouldnt feel betrayed he used the sonic transmitter to activate the door switched off the light in philpotts office then closed the door behind him ten tambeses arms ached and he was sweating profusely but at least the goggles stopped the sweat from seeping into his eyes that would have made the situation even more unbearable apart from the goggles he was also wearing a pair of thick insulated gloves and the blowpipe in his right hand was attached to the two oxyacetylene tanks strapped to his back he was anchored to the wallmounted ladder underneath the manhole cover by the rope which had been looped through his belt and secured to the sides of the ladder although uncomfortable it left his hands free and that was essential for the job he was doing using the blueprint taken from the city hall it had taken them almost seventy minutes to negotiate their way through the labyrinth of sewer tunnels to finally reach the manhole that led up directly into the prison grounds they had decided to go in around two thirty that morning that had left them a good two hours to devise the best method of cutting through the cover without alerting either the guards manning the watchtowers or their colleagues sleeping in the building which stood only a few yards away from the manhole they had found out from the blueprint that the manhole cover was protected by a time lock which they had to assume was regulated from the control room inside the prison compound so that it would be impossible to cut through it without triggering some sort of alarm that meant they would have to cut a section from within the framework of the cover itself they knew the guards couldnt see the manhole from the watchtower furthermore it faced onto a windowless wall so the flame wouldnt be the problem it would be the noise that had narrowed their options considerably it was graham who had come up with the most viable solution the cover would have to be removed in segments that way it would only need one person on the ladder tambese had insisted on doing the job if by chance the flame was seen he would be challenged giving them time to flee it was after all his friend they were going to spring from jail graham had suggested they take it in turns on the ladder but tambese had refused to back down they had done more than enough already to help him he would do it alone tambese shook the sweat from his face and glanced down at graham and sabrina who were sitting on the ledge with their backs to him to protect their eyes from the brilliant flame they each had their uzis in their laps he had been tempted to take up grahams offer of help several times in the past twentyfive minutes but now that he was on the last of the six sections he was just glad it was nearly over he used his free hand to hold the metal as he cut through the last few inches then as it came away in his hand he reached through zi the opening and placed the segment with the others that lay in a circle around the manhole he switched off the blowpipe then called out softly to graham who immediately got to his feet and untied the rope from the ladder tambese climbed down to the ledge and gratefully unloaded the tanks from his back he put the apparatus in the holdall and tossed the goggles and gloves in after it graham used the canister of carbon dioxide to cool the rim of the cover then replaced it in the holdall he waited until tambese and sabrina had climbed out of the sewer before passing the holdall up to them he climbed up the ladder then hauled himself through the opening and joined the others who were standing with their backs to the wall tambese peered cautiously around the side of the building at the two tall forbidding watchtowers on either side of the main gate two hundred yards away from the barracks he could make out the silhouettes of the two armed guards in the reflection of the spotlight mounted above the gate he dropped to his haunches and took the de lisle carbine from the holdall give me the rifle sabrina whispered no ill do it i have done this kind of thing before you know let sabrina do it graham said softly behind tambese shes the best sniper ive ever seen and thats not something id say lightly this is my operation tambese retorted i call the shots it might be your operation but its my ass on the line graham hissed let sabrina do it zz i wouldnt have offered to do it if i thought id screw up sabrina said to tambese trying to diffuse the sudden tension between the two men trust me david tambese was caught off guard by her use of his first name he sighed deeply then stood up and shrugged helplessly it seems im outvoted here sabrina took the rifle from tambese attached the suppressor to the end of the barrel then moved to the edge of the building and looked up at the watchtowers it was a heavy responsibility on her shoulders but she was confident she could take them out silently she wrapped the strap tightly around her arm then raised the butt to her shoulder and trained the barrel on the guard furthest away from her she curled her finger around the trigger the guard suddenly turned away from the railing and walked to the front of the watchtower now he was partially hidden behind one of the wooden struts she couldnt risk the shot she lowered the rifle fractionally and eased her finger off the trigger tambese noticed the gesture but graham grabbed his arm and shook his head before tambese could say anything her eyes flickered to the second guard he was still leaning on the railing with his back to her she willed him to stay where he was then the other guard suddenly turned around and walked to a chair in the corner of the watchtower he took a pack of cigarettes from his pocket lit one then sat down and propped his ak against the side of the chair sabrina immediately tightened her grip on the rifle then lined up the side of the guards head in the sights she squeezed the trigger the bullet took the guard through the side of the head punching him off the chair sabrina had already fed another bullet into the chamber by the time the second guard turned towards his fallen colleague he had no chance to raise the alarm before she shot him through the head the force of impact knocked him backwards and she bit her lip anxiously as he teetered precariously close to the railing if he fell the sound of his body hitting the ground could wake a light sleeper after what seemed like an eternity the guard fell face forward onto the floor the ak skidded across the floor and tumbled off the watchtower she winced as it hit the ground with a muffled thud then there was only silence she exhaled deeply and slumped back against the wall where did you learn to shoot like that tambese asked in amazement she shrugged modestly as she replaced the rifle and suppressor in the holdall youd better lead the way to the cell block she said to tambese he nodded and looked around the side of the building at the cell block three hundred yards away a single light shone above the main entrance otherwise it looked deserted at least it did from the outside tambese disappeared around the side of the building sabrina followed graham picked up the holdall and went after them they ducked low as they passed the windows of the barracks and only straightened up when they were clear of the building when tambese reached the cell block he ignored the double doors and went directly to a window at the side of the building he wasnt surprised to find it ajar not on such a humid night he pressed himself against the wall and peered cautiously into the room there was a guard on duty he sat with his back to the window his feet propped up on a table reading a newspaper a radio was playing in the corner of the room but there was no way of getting in without first cutting through the bars that protected the window tambese unslung his uzi then dropped to one knee and eased the barrel through the opening lining up the back of the guards head in the sights sabrina looked away as he pulled the trigger the guard was punched forward by the momentum of the bullet but as he landed heavily on the floor his foot caught the chair leg knocking it over graham and sabrina immediately took up positions on either side of the window tambese remained on one knee his uzi trained on the corridor which led off from the reception area he doubted the noise would have carried above the music on the radio but they couldnt afford to take any chances not when they were so close to their objective he waited a couple of minutes then satisfied the noise hadnt alerted any of the other guards in the building he propped his uzi against the wall and removed the oxyacetylene equipment from the holdall graham and sabrina took up positions on opposite sides of the cell block as tambese went to work cutting through the iron bars across the window it only took him a few minutes to complete the job then after replacing the equipment in the holdall he recalled the others to the window he clambered through the opening first then took the holdall from graham and dumped it on the floor graham and sabrina climbed in after him and as they hid the body under the reception desk tambese righted the chair and used a cloth he found under the desk to mop up the bloodstains at least it wouldnt look suspicious if anyone happened to pass they would just assume the guard had left the room after pulling the blind down over the window tambese led the way to a flight of stairs at the end of the corridor he gestured for them to wait then tiptoed silently to the foot of the stairs and peered cautiously around the side of the wall the corridor was lined with rows of cell doors he could see the table and two chairs at the end of the corridor where the guards would have sat but there were no guards on duty which he automatically assumed meant there were no prisoners being held on that floor he beckoned graham and sabrina towards him and told them to cover him while he checked the cells he moved quickly and silently down the corridor looking into every cell he was right they were all empty he returned to the others and pointed to a second flight of stairs leading down to another floor how many floors in all graham whispered tambese held up three fingers then moved stealthily down the stairs pausing again at the bottom to peer carefully into the corridor it too was deserted he gestured for graham and sabrina to follow him then descended the third flight of stairs and held up a hand as he reached the bottom he wiped his sweating forehead then pressed himself against the wall his uzi held upwards inches from his face and looked warily round the side of the wall the two guards sitting at the end of the corridor were engrossed in a game of cards tambese glanced at graham and sabrina and gave them a thumbsup sign they tiptoed down to where he was standing waiting for his signal the signal never came tambese suddenly stepped out into the corridor and opened fire neither guard had a chance to reach for the ak against the wall before the fusillade of bullets cut them down where they sat tambese ejected the empty clip and slotted a new one into place before sprinting down the corridor to where the guards lay sprawled beside the overturned table and chairs both of them were dead david over here said graham tambese hurried across to where graham was shining the torch into one of the cells remy mobuto lay motionless on a palliasse in the corner of the cell remy tambese called through the bars remy its david david tambese he glanced anxiously at graham when mobuto remained silent remy can you hear me silence sabrina appeared behind them all the other cells are empty then she noticed the concern on their faceswhat is it hes been drugged graham said grimly strapping the oxyacetylene tanks onto his back you say there are no prisoners in any of the other cells tambese asked turning to sabrina she nodded which means theyre moving out tambese concluded it looks like we got here just in time graham switched on the blowpipe then dropped to one knee and began cutting through the lock moving out sabrina repeated you mean theyre preparing to march on habane thats how id interpret it tambese answered why else would they clear the cell block we had it on good authority that they were holding at least twenty prisoners here yesterday morning where will they have been taken the garrison you spoke about earlier they wont have been taken anywhere tambese said shaking his head you mean theyve been executed more than likely tambese replied matteroffactly the security police will only spare your life if they think youll be of some use to them and when youve outlived that usefulness then theyll kill you thats the way theyve worked for the last fortyfive years why change now ive got the lock graham called out before sabrina could reply tambese hurried into the cell and checked mobutos pulse well graham asked behind him its steady tambese replied til carry him mike you take my uzi graham shouldered tambeses uzi sabrina replaced the oxyacetylene equipment in the holdall then picked it up and moved back towards the stairs graham helped to get mobuto to his feet then tambese bent down and draped him over his shoulders he nodded to graham then emerged from the cell and followed sabrina to the stairs graham brought up the rear his uzi at the ready when they reached the reception area tambese gratefully offloaded mobuto and eased him carefully onto the floor ill take him for a bit graham offered no tambese retorted sharply he smiled quickly to atone for his outburst thanks anyway mike but remys my friend if anything does happen out there ill be responsible for his safety im sure you understand yeah sure graham replied then gestured towards the double doors can we get through there i certainly hope so tambese replied itll save a lot of time if we can avoid using the window getting him down the manhole is going to be hard enough sabrina tried the door it was locked graham searched in vain through the dead guards pockets for the key then he looked through the drawers under the counter it wasnt there either he sighed deeply and shook his head well have to use the window sabrina said we cant risk shooting off the lock even with a silenced weapon it would still make a lot of noise ill go out first then you can graham stopped abruptly when someone rapped sharply on the door they exchanged anxious glances then sabrina stepped back and trained her uzi on the door graham took up a position by the window a voice called out through the door graham and sabrina looked to tambese for an interpretation they were names tambese whispered whoever it is probably saw that the two guards werent in the watchtower and thinks they might be in here with the guard im going outside graham said softly placing tambeses uzi on the table well be trapped in here if he raises the alarm both tambese and sabrina nodded their agreement graham pulled the blind up carefully then eased himself gingerly through the window and landed silently on the ground outside his breathing was shallow and ragged as he moved cautiously towards the edge of the building there was another knock at the door this time louder and the voice called out again in swahili he wiped his sweating face as he reached the end of the wall he gripped the uzi tightly in his hands then swivelled round to challenge the guard the man who was dressed in a pair of shorts and a vest looked round sharply at graham his eyes narrowed in surprise and amazement he held an ak at his side graham indicated for him to drop it the man swallowed nervously then jerked the barrel up towards graham who shot him in the chest with a burst from his silenced uzi the man stumbled backwards lost his footing on the steps and as he fell his finger squeezed the trigger and a row of bullets ripped into the wall several feet above grahams head the noise echoed around the delicate silence graham cursed loudly it would only be a matter of seconds before the whole compound converged on them he shot off the lock and kicked the door in tambese who already had mobuto in a firemans lift on his shoulders hurried down the stairs and lumbered laboriously towards the manhole he could already see several lights on in the barracks sabrina threw tambeses uzi to graham and they ran ahead waiting for the first of the rebels to appear they were still a good sixty yards away from the manhole a window pane was smashed in the barracks and the barrel of an ak pushed through the aperture graham holding an uzi in each hand raked all four of the windows facing out towards them spraying glass across the floor of the barracks the ak disappeared the door was flung open and a rebel darted through but was cut down by graham before he could fire the momentum of his body cartwheeled him across the ground and he came to rest in a crumpled heap several yards from where he had been shot graham and sabrina stood their ground and raked the windows and door of the barracks giving tambese precious seconds to get closer to the manhole graham tossed one of the uzis away when the magazine was spent then snapped a fresh clip into the other uzi and shouted to sabrina to keep up with tambese in case any of the rebels were waiting behind the building for them she nodded then sprinted after tambese as graham raked the side of the barracks again he continued until the clip was finished he ejected it pushed his last clip into place then ran towards the manhole the clip ran out as he reached the end of the building he darted round the side and stopped abruptly as he found himself facing halfadozen rebels all armed with aks he could see two of their dead colleagues sprawled close to the manhole and there was no sign of the others he grinned theyd made it a man who had been standing beside the manhole turned round and looked at graham he was dressed in a grey tracksuit graham immediately recognized him as tito ngune his face still bore the bruises from the lynching hed received several days earlier in habane that was quite a show mr graham ngune said dont worry though well catch your companions before very long they cant travel very fast under those conditions you speak good english for a barbarian graham retorted eyeing ngune contemptuously ngune smiled drop the gun please graham tossed it onto the ground he heard the footsteps behind him and was still turning when the butt of an ak crashed against the back of his head he was unconscious before he hit the ground we cant leave mike back there sabrina snapped well have to at least for the moment tambese replied through gritted teeth as he struggled to get a better grip on mobuto sabrina felt gutted what would happen to graham she refused to even think about it but she knew tambese was right there was nothing they could do for him not without getting caught themselves they had only managed to get out with seconds to spare before the rebels had descended on the manhole like a plague of rats she knew she had shot three of them from inside the sewer one had fallen through the opening and landed in the water she also knew it would only be a matter of time before a team would be sent after them theres a cover about five hundred yards from here we can get out there thats crazy sabrina shot back the rebels will have found the holdall by now and that means theyll have the blueprint theyre sure to have men waiting at all the manholes by now trust me sabrina she didnt pursue the matter it could wait she had to concentrate fully on keeping them alive until they reached safety wherever that may be after all she was the only one who was armed then she heard it footsteps it couldnt have been an echo of their own footsteps they were both wearing rubbersoled shoes these were boots and there were more than one pair she peered into the gloom behind them not that she could see much further than a few yards in front of her the lights which were mounted on the opposite wall at intervals of forty yards were weak and several of them had fused and never been replaced if her friends could see her now the thought brought a faint smile to her lips and helped to calm the sudden burst of anxiety that had swept over her had tambese heard the footsteps as well if he had he wasnt saying anything then she saw a movement in the shadows thirty yards behind them she was about to fire then she eased her finger off the trigger conserve your ammo girl she said to herself she was down to her last clip and she didnt know how many bullets were left in it she flicked the fire selector from automatic to single fire another silhouette flitted across the shadows again she held back but why hadnt they opened fire unless they had instructions to bring them back alive possibly the thought was still lingering when a figure appeared momentarily in a shaft of light behind her she fired there was an anguished cry followed a moment later by a loud splash what was that tambese called out over his shoulder that was one of the rebels sabrina replied why didnt you say we were being followed i thought youd have heard the footsteps no i didnt hear anything tambese replied guiltily dont worry about it you just keep moving how fars this manhole now a hundred yards or so tambese replied thank god for that she muttered a bullet cracked against the roof of the sewer above them sabrina cursed under her breath if only she had the torch then she saw another movement and she fired again but there wasnt any anguished cry this time this time she cursed herself for firing blindly the footsteps suddenly grew louder bullets began chipping against the walls around them but they were still only warning shots even so sabrina found herself doubled over as she moved backwards her eyes continually darting behind her to make sure she didnt get too close to the edge of the path then they came into view she counted at least seven of them and they were closing in fast their ak ys held in front of them how far to the manhole she shouted thirty yards tambese called back to hell with it she thought and flicked the uzi back onto automatic fire she fired a burst at the approaching men two fell and a third tripped over one of them and tumbled headlong into the water still they came they had to be a suicide squad there were probably another eight men behind them waiting to take over from their fallen colleagues and all because ngune wanted them alive they would continue coming until she ran out of bullets that had to be their strategy otherwise the three of them would be dead by now how many bullets left she fired again another man stumbled and fell were almost there tambese shouted to her she fired again another fell two left she pulled the trigger click the magazine was empty and they were closing in fast were there others behind them she couldnt see any she was confident she could disarm them when they came into range she discarded the uzi and stood her ground her hands held up protectively in front of her a sudden burst of gunfire behind her scythed over her head cutting them down when they were less than fifteen yards away from her she dropped to the ground and looked round in horror at how close the bullets had passed over her head tambese stood on the ladder leading up to the manhole an uzi in his hand are you ok he asked just where did you get that from she asked incredulously gesturing to the uzi come up ill show you she pulled the woollen hat from her head and followed him up the ladder a hand was held out towards her but after a sharp word from tambese it was quickly withdrawn she climbed out of the manhole and looked around her slowly her eyes narrowed in uncertainty the man standing next to tambese was dressed in army fatigues and wore the rank of captain an army jeep was parked at the side of the road behind them another eight soldiers stood beside the giant challenger tank which was guarding the end of the street the hatch was open and she could see the tank commander his arms resting on the turret goggles pulled up onto his forehead he was smoking a cigarette whats going on she finally asked looking round at tambese and wheres remy mobuto ive had him taken to hospital these are some of my men the others have been deployed throughout the city kondese is no longer in the hands of the rebels its all gone according to plan what plan she demanded why werent we told about it it was top security jamel and i were the only two who knew about it we couldnt afford to take any chances not with so much at stake theres a lot of sympathy for ngune within the army thats why i had to handpick these men personally for the operation and they were only given their orders before i left the house tambese held up his hand before she could speak i know i owe you an explanation later first weve got to get mike out of branco how youll see tambese smiled at her bewildered expression itll be quite a show that i can promise you when graham came round he found himself lying on a carpeted floor he rubbed the back of his head gingerly then after struggling to sit up he looked slowly around him it was an office then he saw the portrait of alphonse mobuto on the wall beside it was a framed photograph of mobuto and ngune shaking hands at some formal function both men were wearing tuxedos there was also a picture of ngune on the desk it wasnt difficult to work out where he was then he noticed the armed guard standing by the door the ak was pointing straight at him graham continued to massage his neck until he heard the sound of approaching footsteps the door opened and ngune entered still dressed in the grey tracksuit he nodded to the guard who had snapped to attention then told him to stand easy and keep the ak on graham please take a seat ngune said indicating the armchair in front of the desk he stepped behind the desk and eased himself onto his padded leather chair graham pulled himself to his feet and slumped into the chair his hand still rubbing the nape of his neck cigarette ngune said extending the silver box towards graham graham glared back at ngune as you wish ngune said then took one out for himself and lit it he exhaled the smoke then sat back and studied graham before smiling faintly at him as i said earlier you certainly put on quite a show here tonight eight dead at the last count there may be more i certainly hope so graham retorted they can be replaced ngune replied with a dismissive shrug unlike a wife and son you sonofabitch graham screamed and lunged at ngune the guard slammed the ak butt down onto grahams shoulder knocking him to the floor graham swung round on the guard but he was already out of striking range the ak was again aimed at his head he pulled himself to his feet ignoring the pain in his shoulder his breathing was shallow and ragged as he glared down the barrel of the walther ngune had taken from one of the desk drawers sit down mr graham before you do yourself an injury the intercom buzzed on the desk ngune waited until graham had sat down again before answering it its the control room here sir an anxious voice said in swahili we cant get through to any of the patrols theyre not answering their radios ngune wiped away a drop of sweat that trickled down his forehead send out a patrol to reconnoitre the area and keep trying to contact the other patrols thats not all sir we cant get through to garrison either have you checked that there isnt something wrong with our radio yes sir its working keep trying and keep me advised yes sir ngune switched off the intercom and looked across at graham we know you were working with your partner tonight who was the third member of your team mickey mouse graham replied contemptuously who was it ngune shouted aiming the walther at grahams head got some trouble have we graham said glancing at the intercom ngune lowered the gun killing you would be stupid either you answer my questions here in the comfort of my office or i will have you taken down to one of the interrogation rooms and tortured until you tell me what i want to know the choice is yours graham a choice graham said in mock surprise and i thought you abhorred democracy perhaps ive been underestimating you all along i will ask you for the last time who was the third member of your team i told you mickey mouse ngune sat back and stared at graham i have come across your kind before you think you can unnerve me by pretending to show no fear at the thought of being tortured but it never works i have never failed to get the answers i want from a prisoner never you will not be the exception graham no matter what you may think i will break you torture me as much as you want graham replied holding ngunes stare but you tell me this how can you break a man whos already immune to pain ngunes eyes narrowed fractionally as he waited for graham to continue do you honestly believe that whatever machinery youve got waiting for me down in your interrogation room can possibly match the pain i went through when i lost my family graham shook his head hell you do what you want ngune you cant hurt me not any more we will see ngune replied but the intercom buzzed again before he could arrange to have graham taken down to one of the interrogation rooms he activated the switch yes its the control room here again sir have you managed to reestablish contact with the outside yet no sir there was a nervous pause weve just picked up two aircraft on the radar scanner theyre headed this way and judging by their speed they have to be fighter jets that doesnt make any sense ngune said suspiciously i havent authorized the scrambling of any of our jets from the airbase in chad and wed have been told by one of our informers if the air force had scrambled any of their jets from habane they dont originate from habane sir theyve come from one of the neighbouring states in the south chad i cant say sir have you tried to establish radio contact with them yes sir but so far theyre both maintaining complete radio silence range forty miles sir and closing fast put out an alert but tell the men to hold their fire until we know the identity of the planes they could be ours and keep trying to get them on the radio yes sir ngune switched off the intercom and sat back in the chair what was going on first they lose contact with the patrols then they lose contact with the garrison and now two unidentified fighter jets were closing in on them it had already crossed his mind that the government forces could have already recaptured kondese but there had been no gunfire well no more than usual and if the city had been taken surely at least one patrol would have contacted the base then there was the mystery of the garrison on the chadzimbalan border if they had come under attack from government troops they too would have radioed through to the base but nothing absolute silence it was as if they had been isolated the thought lingered in his mind but how he pushed the thought from his mind and ordered the guard to take graham to one of the interrogation rooms he would join them presently the guard prodded graham in the back with the ak and indicated for him to walk to the door ngune waited until the two men had left the room then removed a pair of powerful nightvision binoculars from the desk and moved to the window he raised the binoculars to his eyes and scanned the horizon nothing then a moment later he saw the lights at first they were hazy and distorted in the distance but as they grew nearer he zi could make out the silhouettes of two jets he immediately recognized them as dornier alpha jets but he couldnt see the markings then the lead jet peeled away to the right and ngune was able to see the markings of the zimbalan air force on the underside of the wings he lowered the binoculars and wiped his hand across his clammy forehead it was impossible how could two fighter planes have been smuggled off the airbase in habane without at least one of his informers knowing about it dammit they lived on the airbase how could it have happened he switched on the intercom and gave the order to open fire as soon as the jets came into range he returned to the window and instinctively ducked as one of the jets buzzed overhead the first missile exploded several yards short of the fence but the men still had to take cover as a shower of rocks and stones rained down onto the yard the second missile ripped through the fence and detonated underneath one of the watchtowers ngune stared transfixed as the watchtower buckled under the impact of the explosion before toppling over and crashing down onto the barracks where many of his men had taken cover seconds earlier a handful of men tried to break cover from behind the barracks but were cut down by the concentrated gunfire that strafed across the yard the third missile hit the main gate ripping it off its hinges as though it were made of papier mache then the first of the armys challenger tanks rumbled into the compound its barrel already trained on the barracks where a handful of his men were making one last determined stand machinepistols against tanks but he knew they would fight to the last man it was a question of honour now suddenly it all made sense they hadnt been able to get through to the garrison because it had already been destroyed by the jets the garrison had no radar so the jets could have approached completely unnoticed he had always anticipated an attack from habane and to get to the garrison from habane the air force would have had to bypass kondese but the whole plan had backfired badly he had been outmanoeuvred by jamel mobuto the man he had despised for so many years and without men he couldnt mount a challenge on habane the dream was finally over now all that concerned him was staying alive selfpreservation and the longer his men held out the better his chances were of escaping he opened the wall safe and stuffed his pockets full of bank notes then unlocking the bottom drawer he removed a miniature transmitter but the door burst open before he could use it to make good his escape he put the transmitter down on the desk graham entered and levelled the a k at ngunes chest you should have trained your men to expect the unexpected it wasnt very difficult to disarm him ngune swallowed nervously we can make a deal graham take the money from the safe take it in return for letting you go yes ngune gestured towards the safe its all in pounds and dollars take it all of it oh i intend toall of itand ill hand it over to the authorities when i hand you over graham moved forward and peered into the safe he whistled softly christ theres enough in there to wipe out the trade deficit back home youll be crucified when you go on trial ngune i only wish i could stay around to watch it ngunes eyes flickered towards the walther on the desk could he reach it before graham shot him he doubted it but what other option did he have he would be crucified at his trial he had to take the chance and go for the gun then the moment was gone graham stepped forward and picked up the walther he ejected the clip and tossed the gun back onto the table empty your pockets graham snapped ngune pulled the bundles of bank notes from his pockets and tossed them reluctantly onto the desk all of it graham said pointing to the breast pocket on ngunes tracksuit top ngune pulled another bundle of notes from his breast pocket and dropped them onto the table lets go graham said indicating the door ngune had already moved round from behind the desk when the shell hit the side of the building the window shattered and plaster showered the room i ngune lashed out with his fist catching graham on the side of the head graham fell back heavily against the wall and the ak slipped from his hands ngune kicked graham viciously in the stomach then grabbed the transmitter and used it to activate the door behind the desk a panel hidden in the wall slid back revealing a set of concrete steps leading down to a tunnel ngune darted through the opening and immediately activated the panel behind him graham hauled himself to his feet and lunged at the door hooking his fingers around it when it was only inches away from resealing itself he gritted his teeth as he began to slowly painfully ease it open again after what seemed an age he managed to open it enough to be able to slip through the panel immediately closed behind him the tunnel was over three hundred yards in length and ngune had already covered half the distance graham bounded down the stairs and sprinted after him he was surprised by ngunes pace he was certainly fit for a man of his age although graham was able to close the gap considerably he still couldnt catch up with ngune before he reached another flight of steps at the other end of the tunnel ngune paused at the foot of the steps his face now bathed in sweat and ripped the chain off from around his neck from it hung a key he scrambled to the top of the steps and unlocked the door he pulled it open but made no attempt to retrieve the key from the lock that would just waste valuable time and yardage he disappeared through the doorway graham reached the foot of the steps a few seconds later he took them two at a time but paused at the door and peered cautiously into the room which was lit by a single naked bulb hanging from a frayed length of flex in the centre of the roof it was a lockup garage ngune had ignored the battered green ford station wagon and continued instead on foot the side door was ajar graham pulled open the door and cursed angrily to himself it led out onto a street where a group of locals were dancing and singing to celebrate the liberation of their city if ngune could blend in with the locals graham knew he would never find him he looked the length of the street but couldnt see any sign of him he couldnt have gone far graham said to himself not after that run even he felt exhausted then he noticed a movement in a doorway on the opposite side of the street he waited until the locals had passed then ran across the road and moved slowly towards the doorway a stray light swept across the street and for a split second ngunes face was illuminated in the darkness graham broke into a run then ngune saw him he darted out of the doorway but his legs wouldnt carry him any further and graham was quick to grab him from behind and slam him up against the wall ngunes body sagged and graham made the mistake of loosening his grip on the front of the tracksuit ngune caught graham with a hammering punch to the side of the face then hit him again as he stumbled off balance the second punch dropped graham to the pavement ngune ran towards the end of the street graham scrambled to his feet and sprinted after him he was quick to close the gap and felled ngune with a bruising football tackle both men landed heavily on the pavement but graham was the first to react and brought his elbow up sharply into ngunes midriff ngune slumped back against the wall temporarily winded graham stood up then hauled ngune to his feet and shoved him face first against the wall it was then he noticed the mob standing on the corner of the street he counted about a dozen of them mostly men and they were armed with sticks and chains one had a machete ngune also saw them and started shouting to them in swahili as he struggled to break free of grahams vicelike grip the mob moved towards them graham was caught in a dilemma he may need to defend himself but that would mean releasing ngune one of the men suddenly broke free from the others and ran towards the two men he caught graham painfully on the shoulder with his stick graham stumbled back and ngune began gesticulating wildly in his direction while continuing to incite the mob in swahili the men moved tdwards graham ngune sensed his chance and began to move away from the mob they had now surrounded graham and were shouting at him in swahili another blow was aimed at him but this time he was able to block it with his forearm he couldnt hold out like this for long but what could he do he couldnt communicate with them but you dont need to speak swahili he suddenly chided himself of course not tito ngune graham shouted and pointed an accusing finger towards the retreating figure tito ngune tito ngune the name caused an immediate response all heads turned towards ngune who immediately tried to bluff his way out of trouble a fat woman grabbed his arm and pulled him round to face her she stared at his bowed head for several seconds then looked across at graham and nodded in agreement she pushed ngune towards the men who shoved him roughly to the ground before beating him with their sticks graham was about to try and intervene when an army jeep appeared at the end of the street it pulled up beside the men and two soldiers jumped out and forced their way through to where ngune lay huddled against the wall his arms wrapped over his head an officer wearing the rank of lieutenant climbed out of the passenger seat and stopped in front of graham who estimated him to be no more than twentyfive graham asked him if he could speak english the lieutenant said nothing then turned and walked over to where ngune was slumped against the wall his tracksuit now matted with blood the fat woman pushed through the crowd and spoke to the lieutenant graham thought he heard ngunes name mentioned the lieutenant barked out an order and the two soldiers hauled ngune to his feet the lieutenant looked carefully at ngunes bloodied face then took a pair of handcuffs from his belt and manacled ngunes hands behind his back the two soldiers pushed ngune to his knees then stepped back to allow the lieutenant to approach him graham watched unsure what was going to happen next ngune had been handcuffed that implied arrest but why hadnt he been taken to the jeep then the lieutenant took his rf revolver from the holster on his belt and pressed it against the back of ngunes head graham stepped forward horrified at what he was witnessing it was barbaric ngunes guilt wasnt in doubt but he still had the right of a fair trial that was the law a universal law the lieutenant looked across at graham and said something to him in swahili graham shrugged helplessly but when he tried to get closer his path was blocked by the two soldiers their mi rifles aimed at his stomach the lieutenant looked down at ngune who was babbling incoherently as he pleaded pitifully for his life once the secondmost powerful man in the country ngune was now nothing more than a sad pathetic old man on the brink of death the lieutenant pulled the trigger ngunes body jerked grotesquely as the back of his head disintegrated in a spray of blood and bone the mob cheered triumphantly when he slumped forward onto the pavement the lieutenant bolstered his revolver then snapped an order at the two soldiers who quickly shouldered their rifles and returned to the jeep this time the lieutenant ignored graham as he walked back to the jeep the driver started the engine and drove away graham stared at the body still struggling to come to terms with the savage justice that had been meted out seconds earlier but then this was africa a continent where mercy was so often regarded as a sign of weakness and where brutality and violent death had become just another acceptable everyday occurrence he shook his head sadly as he watched the mob singing and dancing only a few feet away from ngunes crumpled body then turned away and walked off slowly down the street eleven sabrina sat forward in the chair her hands cupped over her face her eyes riveted on the telephone it had been over two hours since she had returned to the farm and there was still no news of graham she knew from tambese that he hadnt been one of the casualties at branco so where was he and how had he managed to get out of the prison before it was bombed the questions seemed irrelevant as she willed the telephone to ring moredi and laidlaw sat in the lounge with her neither of them had spoken for over thirty minutes each engrossed in their own thoughts she slumped back in her chair and banged the arm with her fist laidlaw glanced at her she looked pale and drawn and he could see the anxiety mirrored in her eyes she looked from laidlaw to moredi he had been playing patience on the coffee table when she had arrived back at the farm that had been an hour ago he was still playing he sensed she was watching him and looked up at her he smiled fleetingly she didnt respond he was about to resume the game when the telephone rang she was on her feet before she could check herself she bit her lip nervously as moredi lifted the receiver to his ear he listened momentarily then extended the receiver towards her is it about mike she asked anxiously it is mike moredi replied with a reassuring smile she took the receiver from him mike yeah graham replied nice of you to call she said where are you and where have you been for the past two hours im ok sabrina thanks for asking came the sharp reply she sighed deeply then rubbed her eyes wearily im sorry mike its been a long night tell me about it where are you calling from the hospital are you hurt no nothing a few hours sleep wont heal you ok im fine what happened how did you get out of branco its a long story ill tell you about it when i see you tambeses also here hes just finished questioning mobuto we should be with you soon sure and mike its good to hear your voice hey dont get sentimental on me now she grinned sheepishly see you later yeah graham replied and hung up she replaced the receiver and looked round at laidlaw and moredi hes ok hell be coming back with david moredi put a hand lightly on her shoulder now you know hes ok why dont you put your head down for a couple of hours you looked exhausted i couldnt sleep even if i wanted to there are too many unanswered questions up here she replied tapping her head then how about a coffee while you wait for them to get back from the hospital id love one thanks she replied then pointed to the door til be outside moredi nodded and left the room she pushed open the door and walked out onto the porch the sun was just beginning to creep over the horizon which was bathed in a mirage of orange and gold the unparalleled beauty of an african sunrise exquisite isnt it she looked round sharply at laidlaw who had emerged silently onto the porch a mug of coffee in each hand sorry i didnt mean to startle you he said handing one of the mugs to her thanks she said then moved to the edge of the porch and sat down on the top step do you mind if i sit down its a free country now she replied without looking round laidlaw sat in the wicker chair by the door can we talk she put the mug down and glanced round at him a look of irritation on her face talk what about look i know we havent exactly hit it off these last few days and a lot of its been my fault i realize that now im sure im not the first guy to have doubted your ability because youre a woman and you wont be the last either she replied then sat back against the railing and drew her knees up to her chest but ive come to expect it now its all part of being a woman in a maleorientated profession not that it bothers me ive got a job to do and ill do it to the best of my ability and if you guys cant accept that thats your problem not mine well you can count me as one of the converted after tonight hallelujah she retorted i should have known better than to try and talk to you he snapped getting to his feet then talk to me dont patronize me she said glaring up at him he sighed deeply then moved to the railing i didnt mean to sound patronizing im sorry like you said youre a woman in a maleorientated profession i guess im just not used to dealing with that at least youre honest most of my colleagues wouldnt have admitted to that you and mike seem to get along he said we do up to a point she smiled thoughtfully but it wasnt always this amicable weve been partners for two years now and its only been in the last few months that weve started to get along the first year was a nightmare an absolute nightmare all we seemed to do was argue and bicker about every little thing it got to the point where it was starting to affect our work thats when it came to a head we had to decide whether we could continue working together or whether wed be better off with different partners i dont think the outcome was ever in doubt we work well as a team we always have so we decided to bury the hatchet and get on with the job we still have our differences mainly because were both very independent but weve learned to live with that you care a lot about him dont you i guess she replied with a nonchalant shrug he is my partner the evasive answer wasnt lost on laidlaw he decided against pursuing the matter he leaned back against the railing and folded his arms across his chest i cant believe how much hes changed its hard to believe its the same mike graham i knew at delta you mentioned how independent he is if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes id never have believed you she shifted round until she was facing him it was the first time she had ever heard anyone talk about the mike graham she had never known and it fascinated her what do you mean she prompted desperately trying to keep the conversation alive mike always encouraged a team spirit at delta wed go places as a unit not as individuals and he was the worst practical joker ive ever come across you always had to be on your guard when mike was about you never knew what to expect yeah sabrina said with a grin laidlaw shook his head slowly its hard to believe its the same man it really is its understandable under the circumstances she said her face serious again from what hes told me about them i get the impression he doted on carrie and mikey yeah he did laidlaw replied then lapsed into silence a jeep appeared on the approach road to the farmhouse she scrambled to her feet as it turned into the driveway she could make out two occupants sitting up front but it was only when it reached the courtyard that she realized it was graham and tambese the jeep came to a stop in front of the porch and tambese killed the engine graham was the first to get out like the outfit sabrina said with a grin indicating the white tunic and trousers graham had borrowed from the hospital very chic isnt it he replied mounting the steps onto the porch youve got a couple of nasty bruises there buddy laidlaw said pointing to grahams face ngune caught me with a couple of good punches did you get him sabrina asked not personally hes under the tarpaulin in the back of the jeep the armys going to put the body on public display in habane he moved to the door im going to change ill be down in a minute sabrina watched graham disappear into the house then looked round at tambese what happened to ngune til explain everything inside tambese replied opening the door for them moredi and okoye were waiting in the lounge for tambese they shook hands and the three of them spoke amongst themselves until graham returned to the lounge dressed now in a pair of faded jeans and a black tshirt please wont you all sit down okoye said graham and sabrina sat on the sofa okoye laidlaw and moredi in the armchairs close by laidlaw reached down to put his mug on the floor and his hand brushed against sabrinas uzi which was propped up against the wall he immediately picked up the mug again and put it on the other side of his chair it made him feel better how is mr mobuto sabrina asked looking up at tambese who had decided to remain standing drowsy but otherwise hes fine the doctor who examined him said there would be no sideeffects from the drugs hell be discharged tomorrow morning i still dont understand why ngune didnt kill him if he was such a threat laidlaw said ngune needed him alive in case his coup failed then he could have used him as a hostage to get out of the country jamel and remy have always been close its a bond thats developed over the years through their mutual abhorrence of their fathers regime jamel refused to contemplate any military action against ngune until he knew remy was safe why was he kidnapped moredi asked what did he have on ngune plenty his mysterious informer was ngunes personal secretary moredi whistled softly no wonder remy was so secretive about him he must have been a mine of information oh he was he knew about the coup he also knew about the plot to assassinate jamel and he passed all this information on to remy when ngune found out what had happened he had to stop remy from printing the story so he had him kidnapped did ngunes secretary identify the third man sabrina asked it is bernard tambese replied but what really interested me was the fact that the actual plot to assassinate jamel didnt originate here in zimbala as our intelligence sources have been led to believe its been a cia operation all along ngune was their man hes been working for the cia for the past twentyfour years ngune cia moredi said in amazement why would he work for them tambese shrugged i couldnt tell you all i know is that its been one of the ci as bestkept secrets for all those years his secretary only found out by chance did he know who was behind the operation at langley sabrina asked no it could be bailey sabrina said looking at graham could be graham agreed but right now weve got more important things to worry about what do you mean she asked suspiciously graham looked at tambese tell her you know that jamel will be attending a trade fair in new york later this afternoon itll be his last public engagement before he flies out tonight yes she replied hesitantly bernard will be there as well armed with a highpowered sniper rifle ngune was told that a final attempt would be made to assassinate jamel at the trade center if he was still alive on the last day of his trip to america sabrina looked at her watch new yorks seven hours behind zimbalan time that means itll be almost eleven thirty at night back home she turned to graham til call sergei and tell him about bernard what can he do without alerting the cia graham asked holding her stare hed have to tell the nypd if he wanted to carry out a search of the building and theyre sure to have cia moles at the highest level it wouldnt take long for word to reach langley that bernard had been compromised and hed be told to pull out then wed be back to square one again surely the cia will abort the operation anyway when they find out the coup has failed and that ngune is dead okoye said looking from graham to sabrina but they dont know that tambese told him all theyll know at the moment is that branco and the rebel garrison have been destroyed by troops loyal to the government we havent released any casualty figures yet what mike suggested we do is put out some disinformation that ngune and about two hundred of his men have amassed on the chadian border to try and retake kondese within the next twelve hours so the cia will still believe that they can overthrow jamel and the government id like a word in private sabrina said to graham then looked round at the others would you excuse us for a moment please graham followed her out onto the porch yow suggested that they should spread some disinformation about ngune why mike she held up her hand before he could answer no let me guess so that it would give you enough time to get back to new york and deal with bernard yourself not me us he retorted this has become an obsession hasnt it youll go to any lengths to confront bernard yourself even to the point of deliberately putting an innocent mans life in danger it doesnt bother you does it graham rested his arms on the railing and nodded his head slowly to himself i admit i was wrong going after bernard like i did at the time it was an obsession but not any more ive seen what mobuto means to this country the people need him he glanced round at her dont get me wrong i still want to see bernard brought to justice but right now its more important to stop him before he can get to mobuto she sat down slowly on the wicker chair by the door her emotions had ranged from anger to guilt in the space of a few seconds and it wasnt the first time it had happened either she knew she was vulnerable to this quiet softly spoken side of him that rarely showed itself but he was the one who had given her an ultimatum in beirut to work with or without him to find bernard irrespective of the danger to jamel mobuto how was she to know hed had a change of heart she wasnt a mindreader so why the hell was she feeling guilty i know we should tell sergei whats happening but what could he do never mind the nypd that was just a smokescreen i put up in there what about the cia men working with cw theyre baileys men and if he is behind this whole operaton which im certain he is hed be the first to know if bernard was compromised how could sergei have a description of bernard circulated amongst the security staff at the trade fair without baileys men finding out he couldnt could he thats why we have to stop bernard ourselves it has to be done in complete secrecy so that by the time we get there itll be too late for bernard to pull out hell be trapped then we can take him and bust this whole case wide open she gave him a resigned nod how are we going to get back to new york in time tambeses arranged for one of the presidential planes to be put on standby for us in habane the cessnas already been refuelled all were waiting for now is a pilot tambese would have flown us to habane himself but hes still got a lot of loose ends to tie up down here he said we should reach new york with a couple of hours to spare and if we dont make it then well have to radio through to sergei and explain the situation to him he could still prevent mobuto from attending the trade fair but then bernard would almost certainly get away but it shouldnt come to that we do have time on our side god i hope so she replied rubbing her hands over her face if something does happen to mobuto cw will be breaking in two new partners well be out so fast our feet wont touch the ground nothings going to happen to mobuto graham replied the door opened and tambese looked out sorry to disturb you but i thought youd like to know that the pilots on his way he should be here in about ten minutes great graham said then looked around him slowly til be sad to leave this place it seems so tranquil tambese stepped out onto the porch it is believe me ive been coming down here with my wife for the last ten years its the perfect tonic when you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of habane i didnt know you were married sabrina said twelve years now matthew okoyes my brotherinlaw thats why we come down here so often weve always been close after all there werent many of us who could stand up to alphonse mobuto and get away with it jamel remy and matthew were his staunchest critics joseph moredi and i to a lesser degree because we didnt have the same clout that they did thats what brought us all together in the first place our revulsion at alphonse mobuto and his puppets like ngune and his deputy thomas massenga we were determined to bring peace to zimbala in our lifetime and you have graham said i certainly hope so tambese replied thoughtfully any news of massenga graham asked nothing yet theres a reward out for his capture it shouldnt be long before hes apprehended you still havent told me what happened after you got caught in branco sabrina said to graham graham recounted the events up to the time ngune was executed in the street have you found the officer who shot him she asked looking at tambese tm not looking for him tambese replied i know who it was but im not taking any further action these things happen in the heat of the moment so youre condoning murder she shot back thats lowering yourself to ngunes level id have to sink a lot lower to reach ngunes level tambese moved to the railing and looked down at the outline of the body underneath the tarpaulin he turned back to her ngunes dead the coup detat failed for the first time in fortyfive years theres peace in zimbala the officer concerned only did what twelve million other zimbalans would have done in the same situation the country would be up in arms if i persecuted him for that dont get me wrong im not condoning what happened but at the same time im not prepared to jeopardize this newfound peace just to see that ngunes death is avenged this is africa sabrina not america its a continent in turmoil coup detats are a regular occurrence one corrupt government replaces another and its always the people who suffer if its not the adults being massacred because they happen to belong to a different tribe to the one in power or to the one seeking power then its the children dying of malnutrition because their parents cant cultivate barren fields the african has come to accept death as part of his everyday life we put different values on life to say the americans or the europeans in europe and america youd say life is for living in africa we say life is for surviving and if the death of a butcher like ngune means the chances of survival are increased then the people will welcome it i know it sounds cynical but thats become the way of life in africa i guess values are different she replied glancing across at the tarpaulin but i take your point anyway you still havent told how you masterminded the attack on kondese graham said how did your troops manage to neutralize all those patrols without any gunfire there was gunfire but it was minimal we didnt hear it because we were down in the sewer at the time all the government troops were armed with silenced weapons they used a pincer movement to close in on the city and all had orders to shoot to kill the radio frequencies were jammed just before the troops moved in and opened again when they had recaptured the city that way the troops in branco couldnt be contacted and warned of the attack had they known ngune may have fled that was our main worry ngune was their mastermind and with him on the loose the threat of another coup detat could never have been ruled out we had to get him dead or alive and the garrison sabrina asked ngune had a radar scanner installed at branco but not one at the garrison that was his mistake he reasoned that any air attack would have to be launched from habane and his spies would tell him as soon as the jets were scrambled then they could counter the attack with the jets they had in chad but what he couldnt know was that jamel had come to an agreement with the niger government while he was in new york they agreed to let us use two of their jets on the condition that we put our own markings on them before they left niger they didnt want to be seen to be involved if we failed to stop ngune from seizing power theyve always had close links with zimbala and they wanted to keep it that way irrespective of who came to power again we jammed the radio frequencies just before the jets were scrambled and the garrison was levelled to the ground within a matter of minutes we had a division on standby to go in afterwards and capture any surviving rebels then when the garrison was destroyed we opened the radio frequencies again how many rebels survived sabrina asked seventeen out of a squad of nearly four hundred theyll be put on trial when theyve recovered from their injuries tambese looked at sabrina theyll be given a fair trial that i assure you and if found guilty theyll be locked up for the rest of their lives and i mean that quite literally were determined to stamp out the past the dictatorship is dead it must never be allowed to return when exactly was this plan agreed graham asked jamel thrashed it out with his entourage in new york and we finalized the details over the phone two days ago were we part of the plan sabrina asked tambese smiled only when we knew you were coming to zimbala thats why i had joseph tail you from the airport we needed to make contact only we didnt know how youd react its just as well he did tail you otherwise you wouldnt be here now massenga doesnt miss from that distance so he wasnt following massenga he was following me wed been watching massenga ever since he arrived in habane no joseph was at the airport waiting for you we just didnt know when youd arrive how did you know we were coming to zimbala graham asked suspiciously we have our sources meaning graham pressed weve been monitoring all communications between ngune and the outside since he retook branco the two of you were a regular topic of conversation when massenga contacted him you see massenga was ngunes link to bernard so everything bernard said to massenga was passed on to ngune bernard holds you in great esteem mike its almost a grudging admiration tm not flattered graham retorted youve used us from the start sabrina said shaking her head no tambese shot back the anger evident in his voice i respect you both too much for that weve been working on the same case only from different angles thats why i thought we could achieve a lot more by putting our heads together and i was right i know i held out on you and for that im sorry i wanted to tell you what was going on but jamel wouldnt hear of it what could i do i know i could have trusted you but i would never do anything behind jamels back weve been friends for too long i suppose its a bit like the two of you working together you keep each other informed and dont do anything without letting the other one know you must be joking sabrina replied then looked across at graham who was trying to hide the smile that was threatening the corners of his mouth she grinned and wagged an accusing finger at him tambese looked from sabrina to graham and smiled o k i get the point but you still make a damn good team we have our moments graham replied with a halfsmile tambese returned inside sabrina paused at the door and looked round at graham are you coming in graham nodded then followed her inside closing the door behind him thomas massenga who was crouched behind a tree two hundred yards away from the house waited until graham had closed the door before getting to his feet he propped the ak against the trunk and wiped the back of his hand across his sweating forehead he had arrived in kondese minutes before the government forces launched their attack to recapture the city there was nothing he could do against such odds he and his driver gubene had abandoned the car and gone on foot to a safe house in the city although the gunfire had been minimal it had quickly become obvious from the activity in and around the surrounding streets that the city had fallen to government troops then the jets had come sleek fast and deadly he had watched from a secondfloor window as they destroyed branco within a matter of minutes then the tanks had rolled into the compound to crush the last of the brave resistance it had left him stunned he had tried to call up the garrison on a radio in the loft silence he could only assume that it too had fajlen then came word that ngune was dead executed in the street by a young army lieutenant and that automatically put massenga in charge but in charge of what he had neither the men nor the hardware to mount a counterattack which meant he only had one option open to him revenge and as the head of the government forces tambese would be his first victim they had commandeered an army jeep and found out from its two occupants an officer and his driver that tambese was questioning remy mobuto at the city hospital after killing the soldiers they had changed into their uniforms and driven over to the hospital only to discover that tambese had left minutes earlier he had told the duty sister that he would be at the okoye farm in case she needed to contact him they went to the farm parking a hundred yards away from the main driveway massenga had left gubene in the jeep and approached the farm on foot he had been challenged by two soldiers in the grounds but had despatched them both with a hunting knife when they had made the mistake of coming to attention to salute him he had reached the tree moments before graham and sabrina appeared on the porch then tambese had joined them he didnt have a clear shot at tambese and although he could have sprayed the porch with gunfire there was no guarantee he would have killed him and tambese had to die he picked up the ak and moved cautiously towards the house ever vigilant for any other soldiers who may be patrolling the grounds he ducked down behind the jeep and gripped the side as he slowly raised his head to get a better look at the position of the steps in relation to the single window that looked out onto the porch he immediately felt something sticky on his fingers he peered into the jeep but when he eased back the corner of the tarpaulin he found himself looking into ngunes wide sightless eyes he dropped the tarpaulin as if it had stung him then sunk to his haunches and clasped his hands over his face it took him a few seconds to regain his composure he took several deep breaths then moved out from behind the jeep and ran doubled over to the steps and silently crossed the porch to the window he pressed himself against the wall and peered cautiously through the lace curtain into the room okoye and moredi were sitting on the sofa laidlaw and graham in the armchairs opposite and sabrina and tambese were standing in front of the mantelpiece and none of them were armed he would have a clear shot at tambese but to hell with that he could take them all out with one magazine and he still had two spare clips in his pocket in case he encountered any resistance on the way back to the jeep he kept close to the wall as he covered the few feet from the window to the door then tightening his grip on the a k he reached out for the handle he took a deep breath then pushing down the handle thrust open the door and swivelled round to fire into the room tambese knocked sabrina to the ground a splitsecond before a row of bullets peppered the wall above them it was sheer instinct that made laidlaw grab the uzi from beside his chair and as he dived low onto the carpet he raked the doorway with a fusillade of bullets massenga was hit several times in the chest and he fired wildly into the air as he stumbled back against the railing he could feel the blood bubbling in his throat and a trickle seeped from his mouth and ran down his chin he grimaced in agony as the pain tore through his body he knew he was dying but he was still determined to take as many of them with him as possible he moved unsteadily towards the door and was raising the ak when laidlaw fired again the bullets ripped into massengas body and the ak spun from his hand as he crashed through the railing and landed heavily on the ground in front of the porch laidlaw ran down the steps and checked for a pulse there was none only then did he look down at the uzi in his hand it was almost as if he were awakening from a dream he looked up slowly at the others who had congregated on the porch and his eyes finally settled on grahams face i cant believe i did it laidlaw said shaking his head slowly to himself graham smiled you did it buddy theres the proof four soldiers alerted by the gunfire appeared from behind the house mi s at the ready tambese told them to check the area for any other rebels they divided into pairs and hurried away we owe you our lives mr laidlaw moredi said breaking the silence thank you any time laidlaw replied giving graham a knowing smile who was he anyway massenga ngunes righthand man tambese replied then pointed to the door wed better go back inside until the areas been declared safe graham and sabrina went upstairs to get their holdalls and when they returned they found tambese talking to a man by the door tambese introduced him as the pilot he doesnt speak any english he added with an apologetic smile who cares as long as he can fly us to habane graham replied tambese translated grahams words and the pilot gave him a thumbsup sign a jeep turned into the courtyard and pulled up in front of the porch a sergeant climbed out and hurried up the steps tambese returned his salute and indicated that he should enter the room they spoke briefly then the sergeant saluted again before returning to the jeep the driver did a uturn and drove off the areas been secured tambese said turning to graham and sabrina the bodies of two of our soldiers were found in the grounds massenga must have killed them when he approached the house his drivers been arrested he was still waiting for massenga in an army jeep about five hundred yards from here so we can leave graham asked tambese nodded then asked okoye to take the pilot to the cessna on the runway moredi took up the offer of a walk and left the room with the two men ive got to get back to the city tambese said theres a press conference scheduled for later this morning i need to consult with my officers before i say anything ill put out that story about ngunes still being alive you just make sure you get to jamel before bernard does if jamel were to die now it could throw the country back into turmoil mike i know how much you want bernard the presidents safety comes first graham cut in putting a reassuring hand on tambeses arm you have my word on that thank you tambese shook hands with both of them then left the house so what are you going to do now graham asked laidlaw laidlaw shrugged i guess ill go back to beirut and take stock of the situation after that who knows i might go back to the states again sabrina held out a hand towards him good luck russell whatever you decide to do thanks laidlaw replied shaking her hand mike ill see you at the plane she said then picked up her holdall and left the room shes a good kid mike laidlaw said staring at the door kid shes twentyeight russ you know what i mean laidlaws face became serious id still be feeling sorry for myself in some beirut bar if you hadnt brought me out here you gave me back my dignity mike i can never repay you for that you can cut the schmaltz for a start graham replied i didnt do anything you pulled the trigger not me and just as well you did laidlaw shook grahams hand you take care of yourself buddy and you i got to go russ laidlaw watched graham leave and smiled sadly to himself he knew hed never see graham again he represented the past that graham so desperately wanted to forget but he had the memories and that was enough twelve whitlock pressed the combination into the bellpush then opened the door and entered he was surprised to find kolchinsky sitting behind sarahs desk kolchinsky indicated that he should close the door behind him whats this all about sergei whitlock asked stifling a yawn its seven thirty in the morning sit down cw kolchinsky said gesturing to the burgundycoloured couch against the wall why here whats wrong with the office its bugged kolchinsky replied bugged whitlock said in amazement but thats impossible dave forsythe checks these rooms every morning for bugs which means hes the only person who could have planted it dave come on sergei hes one of the most senior technicians in the command centre i read through his personnel file before you got here kolchinsky held up a sheet of computer paper this is the printout you probably know we recruited him from the cia yes i know he came over from langley whitlock replied do you know who he was working for when he resigned whitlocks eyes narrowed suspiciously ive got a horrible feeling youre going to say robert bailey the same hed been baileys electronic guru for seven years whitlock slumped back on the couch so baileys known everything thats been said in the office did you find any other bugs no i personally checked all the rooms this morning theyre clean im surprised he didnt bug the telephones as well too dangerous kolchinsky replied he knows the colonel and i regularly check the phones ourselves and anyway if sabrina called me i always briefed you on what she said where is the bug under the coffee table what are you going to do whitlock asked nothing yet i dont want to alert bailey lets get the president safely on his plane first ill confront dave in the morning but until then act as if nothings wrong whitlock nodded this certainly supports the theory that baileys behind this whole operation why else would he want the office bugged this way he could pass everything on to bernard to ensure hes always kept one step ahead of mike yes bailey has to be behind it kolchinsky replied but how to prove it is going to be another matter altogether were talking about the deputy director of the cia hes already being tipped as a future american president and that means hes got a lot of influential friends across the board we cant make any accusations without the proof to back them up and right now we dont have that proof even if dave forsythe confesses to bugging the office for bailey its not enough to prove involvement in a conspiracy to kill a foreign head of state whatever happens were going to be left with egg on our faces whitlock said grimly its been a serious breach of security for an organization that supposedly doesnt exist what if the bug has been planted for a newspaper then youll be spending christmas standing in a food queue in some moscow street and ill be on the first plane back to kenya whitlock got to his feet and winced as he tried to adjust the sling supporting his injured arm its not a newspaper it has to be bailey its too much of a coincidence for it not to be kolchinsky sighed deeply then pointed to whitlocks arm how is it a bit stiff whitlock replied with a dismissive shrug i assume you havent heard anything from sabrina in the last twentyfour hours the question caught whitlock by surprise but he was quick to regain his composure no he lied shaking his head nothing at all hasnt she contacted you the last time i spoke to her was yesterday morning after the attempt on her life she was thinking then about going down to kondese to spring remy mobuto from jail i told her to get on the next flight back here the last thing we need is for un ago to get involved in a civil war since then nothing im worried about her cw its not like her to disobey an order ive made enquiries through the american embassy but she hasnt been admitted to any hospitals out there she just seems to have disappeared shes probably on her way back now whitlock replied hating himself for his deceit but he had given her his word to keep silent i hope so kolchinsky said then got to his feet and moved round to the front of the desk she can look after herself sergei whitlock said noticing the concern on kolchinskys face its not that kolchinsky replied shaking his head the lab boys came back with positive id on a set of prints from that newspaper you lifted from the flat last night and whitlock asked his voice suddenly anxious theyre bernards oh my god whitlock said despairingly when did you find this out last night why didnt you call me whitlock demanded it wouldnt have done any good youd have just lain awake all night worrying about it i was awake most of the night with this arm anyway youre right though theres nothing i could have done whitlock sat down again then looked up at kolchinsky bailey must have tipped bernard off about rosie how else could bernard have found out who rosie was and where to find her i think it would be better if you stayed away from the trade center today cw i dont want any confrontations with bailey until the presidents out of american airspace baileys going to be at the trade center this afternoon yes he arrived in new york last night there wont be any confrontations that i promise you im not mike i can keep my emotions in check i still dont see why you want to be there youve already made the security arrangements with the nypd let them handle it and ill be there to keep an eye on things so will i whitlock said mobuto may be a pain in the arse at times but im still in charge of his security id never forgive myself if anything were to happen to him while i was swanning about at home o k kolchinsky replied is there anything we can do to try and find rosie before mobuto leaves for the trade center i had strike force nine check out all known cia safe houses in and around the new york area they didnt come up with anything but those were only the ones we knew about there are sure to be others bernard might not even be at a safe house all we can do now is wait for him to make the first move and you think hell try something at the trade center its possible if sabrinas theorys right about him being the third man kolchinsky shrugged there are so many unanswered questions at the moment but we have to take every precaution i had a photofit made up of bernard and sent over to the nypd itll be circulated to all the officers on duty at the trade center today there are already metal detectors positioned at all public entrances and all other doors will be guarded by uniformed officers its not foolproof by any means but itll make it that bit harder for him if he does intend to try and hit the president this afternoon you know something sergei ill be glad to see the back of him tonight youre not the only one kolchinsky replied with a weak smile have you eaten this morning i had a coffee while i was getting dressed fancy some breakfast at the plaza well chalk it up to expenses i wouldnt say no whitlock said ive got a feeling this is just the start of a very long day my thoughts exactly come on lets go bernard was watching the morning news when the doorbell rang he picked up his desert eagle automatic from the table and went to the door he peered through the spyhole it was brett he unlocked the door jesus what happened to your face brett asked staring at bernards halfclosed eye the girl tried to escape and she did that to you brett said unable to keep the smile from his face a sixteenyearold kid she caught me with the door bernard replied sullenly youre going to stand out like a sore thumb at the trade center you let me worry about that hey its not just your ass on the line i dont need a lecture from one of baileys flunkeys bernard snarled brett glared at bernard then brushed past him into the hall wheres the girl now in the bedroom bernard replied closing the front door she wont give you any trouble shes handcuffed to the radiator which door first on the right brett opened the door and entered the room a visitor rosie said facetiously then looked across at bernard who was standing in the doorway you should have told me your boyfriend was coming over you can cut the cute remarks brett snapped then left the room and closed the door behind him when are you leaving now and dont bother making her anything to eat she wont touch it she hasnt eaten since i brought her here yesterday what if she wants to go to the toilet then let her go there arent any windows in the bathroom if thats what youre worried about bernard took the key for the handcuffs from his pocket and gave it to brett youve been up all night havent you yeah i came straight over here from the hotel put your head down for a few hours youll feel better for it bernard noticed bretts frown you dont think i stayed up all night do you shes not going anywhere is there an alarm its by the front door but theres no need to activate it like i said shes not going anywhere id feel better if it were on suit yourself bernard replied then picked up the holdall and walked to the front door what time will you be back brett asked as bernard opened the door when the jobs done bernard replied dont wait up he added with a faint smile then left closing the door behind him ill be waiting brett said softly then unholstered his smith wesson and aimed it at the door you can count on it my friend why werent we told about this kolchinsky demanded dropping a folder onto the table and good morning to you too mobuto replied with a hint of sarcasm as he looked up at kolchinsky who had brushed past masala moments earlier when he answered the door he leaned forward in his chair and opened the folder inside were several sheets of computer paper he scanned the first paragraph of the top page then sat back and folded his arms across his chest its a resume of the offensive we launched against ngune last night forgive me if im a little slow on the uptake this morning mr kolchinsky but why should i have told you about this because two of our operatives could still be out there kolchinsky shot back they were up until a few hours ago mobuto replied theyre now on their way back to new york surely you knew that how did you know their movements kolchinsky asked ignoring mobutos question colonel tambese told me who david tambese the man ive appointed as the new head of the armed forces has he had them under surveillance surveillance mobuto replied with a look of puzzlement they were working together your operatives mike and sabrina helped david get my brother out of branco he told me he couldnt have done it without their help kolchinsky sat down slowly his eyes never leaving mobutos face michael and sabrina were working together mobuto nodded with david tambese i purposely kept the plans of the offensive a secret because i couldnt risk ngune finding out beforehand only david and i knew about them mike and sabrina were as much in the dark as you were no i dont believe they were kolchinsky said after a thoughtful pause barely able to contain his anger how long have you known that michael and sabrina were working as a team yesterday when david told me that hed intercepted mike and his friend laidlaw near the airport ngune had been tipped off that they would be going to the airport and hed dispatched a suicide squad to deal with them did he say why they were going to the airport sabrina had left a message at the airport to tell them where she was staying which means she was already working with michael in beirut kolchinsky said softly to himself pardon nothing i was just thinking out loud mobuto leaned forward his arms resting on his knees didnt you know they were working with david ive never even heard of david tambese kolchinsky snapped then held up a hand in apology im sorry its not your fault im grateful you brought this to my attention i hope i havent put them in any trouble mobuto said with genuine concern they saved my brothers life and thats something ill never forget kolchinsky sat back in the chair and stared at the folder on the table there were so many questions that needed to be answered but the one that stood out above all others was how long sabrina had been lying to him when did she and graham first make contact in beirut he knew she must have had her reasons for holding out on him she and whitlock had always been the two operatives he had trusted implicitly but he wouldnt pass judgement on her not yet she had the right to answer for her actions in person he could wait tambese the name suddenly entered his mind he had never heard of him until mobuto mentioned the name so it was fair to assume that sabrina wouldnt have heard of him either before she arrived in zimbala and she would never work that closely with someone unless she had first had him vetted all vetting procedures went through the command centre but that could have been risky what if word had got back to him no she would have had to confide in someone close someone she knew she could trust and he knew exactly who that was would you excuse me kolchinsky said getting to his feet of course mobuto replied then closed the folder and offered it to kolchinsky im sorry i didnt give un ago prior warning about the offensive last night but i had to take every precaution in case of a leak im sure you understand yes of course kolchinsky replied almost absently then took the folder from mobuto and moved to the door where can i reach you if any more news comes through from zimbala mobuto called out after him ill be at the trade center kolchinsky said ive got a few things to discuss with cw i gave her my word and i thought the only conspiracy around here was against the president kolchinsky retorted angrily now i find theres been another one against me not only that it involved the two people i trusted above all others at un a co youve disappointed me cw you really have whitlock remained silent what could he say he had no defence he had known it would have to come out if only it had remained under wraps until mobuto had left the country then the assignment would have been deemed a success and the damage would have been minimal well so he had thought until now had it been philpott he would have been reprimanded and that would have been the end of the matter philpott encouraged initiative in the field but he should have known better with kolchinsky everything had to be done by the book his years in the kgb had taught him that and nothing would change those views he was too damn pedantic but whitlock wisely chose not to voice his thoughts he was in enough trouble as it was he only hoped philpott would see the situation in a different light but that would mean undermining kolchinsky and philpott respected kolchinsky too much to do that the outlook was bleak whatever way he looked at it yet given the same circumstances he would have done it again sabrina was his partner and he had too much respect for her to go back on his word dont you have anything to say kolchinsky asked breaking the lingering silence what do you want me to say sergei i admit ive been helping mike and sabrina without your authorization but i still believe i did the right thing what if they had been caught un ac o personnel involved in a civil war wed have been crucified by the un were an anticrime organization the charter states quite clearly that un ago is not to involve itself in the politics of any country im sure youre familiar with the section in question then why are we guarding mobuto thats political his life is threatened it makes no difference that hes a politician its still a criminal offence remy mobuto was kidnapped against his will whitlock retorted thats a criminal offence of course it is kolchinsky replied but his release was linked directly to the government offensive against the rebels thats what makes it political and michael and sabrina were in the thick of it they didnt know about the offensive when they went into branco to free mobutos brother he told you that himself and a lot of good that would have done them if the offensive had failed and they had fallen into rebel hands their actions werent political sergei you knowthat they were told that remy mobuto had information that could be vital to the case what were they supposed to do pass up the chance to get that information they were supposed to have gone through the proper channels for a start would you have sanctioned the breakin at branco i would have told them to hold back and let tambese and his men go into branco then they could have questioned remy mobuto once he was out that way it couldnt have been misconstrued as a political move kolchinsky rubbed his hands over his face but its too late for that now the secretarygenerals going to kick up a stink when he finds out whats happened will we be suspended whitlock asked that will be up to the secretarygeneral but if we can see the president off safely tonight that will certainly count in your favour when did you last speak to sabrina when she asked me to check on tambese so we dont know whether they found out anything from remy mobuto kolchinsky said didnt mobuto say anything when you spoke to him i didnt ask him i was hoping you would have heard from sabrina in the last few hours im going back to the hotel now to speak to him again kolchinsky closed the folder in front of him then picked it up and got to his feet im especially disappointed in you cw this is hardly the sort of behaviour id expect from the next deputy director of unaco im still a field operative sergei my loyalties lie with mike and sabrina im sorry if you cant see that kolchinsky walked to the door then looked back at whitlock i only hope this doesnt affect your promotion youll have my letter of resignation if it does whitlock replied matteroffactly kolchinsky held whitlocks unyielding stare for several seconds then turned and left the room without another word the trade center had been built off the shore parkway in brooklyn it had cost nearly oneandahalfmillion dollars at a time when new york was crippled by mounting debts which had given rise to the theory that it had been financed largely by mob money the mayor at the time had been quick to denounce these rumours too quick according to most new yorkers then when a local tabloid ran an article about it under the headline mafia house the name had stuck it had become an expensive white elephant over the years despite its location overlooking jamaica bay and its proximity to john f kennedy international airport the visit of jamel mobuto had brought with it an unexpected publicity boost for the building the two attempts on his life had made him one of the most newsworthy faces in the country and although he was not due to arrive at the trade center for another forty minutes the front lawn was already seething with reporters and cameramen jostling for positions all hoping for a third attempt on his life that could be captured on film for their newspapers and television newsbulletins and they all had the same thought in the back of their minds third time lucky had they known the purpose of the rider on the red and white honda that pulled up at the boom gate a hundred yards away from where they were encamped they would have felt that their prayers had been answered an armed guard stepped out of the hut and approached the motorbike can i help you he asked brusquely bernard lifted the front of his visor fractionally careful to ensure that the guard couldnt see the bruise around his eye im from harris bond couriers i have a letter here for a robert bailey he is expecting it is he attending the conference the guard asked hey im just the dispatch rider i was told to bring the letter here to mafia house the guard returned to the hut and picked up a clipboard off the desk he paged through it until he found baileys name an extension number was written beside it he rang the number it was answered by rogers who told him that bailey hadnt yet arrived but that he was expecting a letter from washington the guard replaced the receiver and activated the boom gate leave the letter with the guard at the entrance hell see that mr bailey gets it bernard gave the guard a thumbsup sign and drove off he pulled up in front of the entrance and left the motorbike idling as he hurried across to the nearest guard and handed the envelope to him the guard checked the name against the printout on his clipboard then nodded and disappeared into the building bernard mounted the motorbike and headed back towards the boom gate he turned off into a narrow alley at the side of the building and pulled up in front of an adjacent door he climbed off the motorbike then unfastened the helmet and placed it on the seat he also removed the leather jacket he was wearing and was about to drape it over the seat as well when the door was pushed open and a man emerged bernard had never seen him before he was the same height and build as himself and was wearing a pale blue shirt navy trousers and a pair of black shoes the same outfit as bernard he nodded in greeting to bernard then pulled on the leather jacket and zipped it up then after slipping the helmet over his head he climbed onto the motorbike and headed off towards the boom gate any problems bernard looked round sharply at rogers who had appeared silently at the door behind him the envelope in his hand no bernard replied jesus what happened to your eye an accident bernard answered sharply come inside bernard stepped past rogers who immediately closed the door behind him and bolted it again he found himself in a narrow corridor with several whitepainted doors leading off from it rogers led the way to one of them then took a key from his pocket and opened it bernard went inside it was a small room with a wooden chair and a battered locker in the corner your clothes are in there rogers said indicating the locker what is this place these used to be storerooms up until a few months ago then all the stock was moved to bigger rooms closer to the conference centre theyre all empty now the cops have already checked them so you wont have to worry about being disturbed rogers gave the key to bernard just make sure you lock the door behind me is mobutos address still scheduled for two oclock rogers nodded then looked at his watch its now twelve fourteen you want to be in position no later than one forty til be there youll have to hide that bruise itll only draw attention to yourself ill get you a pair of sunglasses no need bernard said taking a pair of sunglasses from his pocket ok rogers replied then moved to the door good luck lucks for amateurs bernard answered then pointed to the envelope rogers was holding whats in there nothing rogers replied with a grin then left the room and closed the door behind him bernard locked the door then moved to the chair and sat down all he had to do now was wait it had been whitlocks idea to have mobuto brought to the trade center in a police helicopter that way he would not only avoid the posse of journalists expecting him to arrive by car but it would also thwart any planned hit from one of the adjacent buildings swat snipers had been in position on the surrounding rooftops since daybreak and the helipad itself situated on the roof of the trade center had been under armed guard for the past twentyfour hours he had deployed armed officers at all the strategic points inside the building and with no reported sightings of bernard he was quietly confident that he had the situation under control whitlock shielded his face with his hand as the helicopter pilot executed a perfect landing on the helipad rogers hurried forward his face screwed up against the swirling wind whipped up by the rotors and opened the passenger door masala was the first out he looked round slowly whitlock and kolchinsky were standing by the door and four swat snipers were positioned at each corner of the roof satisfied he nodded to mobuto who clambered out of the helicopter and hurried doubled over towards kolchinsky and whitlock kolchinsky opened the door and mobuto stepped inside grateful to be out of the choppy wind whitlock and masala followed him through the door kolchinsky gave the pilot a thumbsup sign and the helicopter immediately rose off the helipad and moments later peeled away to the right heading back towards manhattan he closed the door behind him and crossed to the four men at the end of the corridor are you alright sir a little windswept but otherwise im fine thank you mobuto replied to kolchinskys question what is the agenda for this afternoon is my speech still scheduled for two oclock yes kolchinsky said brushing down his doublebreasted jacket and the cocktail party will be held immediately after your speech excellent i look forward to hearing what the countrys leading financiers think of my proposed economic changes for zimbala mobuto smiled to himself i hope they approve enough to give their backing to the investment programme i have in mind well well just have to wait and see wont we the complex manager is waiting for us downstairs whitlock said to mobuto hes offered to give you a tour of the building if youre interested mobuto looked at his watch ive got fifty minutes to kill before im due to make my speech yes id be delighted to see the building they took the lift down to the fourth floor where the manager and his senior aides had their offices the manager a short dapper man in his late forties was waiting in his office for them the nameplate on his desk identified him as anthony lieberwitz would you care for something to drink sir lieberwitz asked after shaking mobutos hand no thank you i had a coffee before i left the hotel there was a knock at the door and the receptionist who had ushered them in moments earlier appeared again and announced that there was a mr bailey in her office lieberwitz told her to show him in bailey forced a quick smile for the receptionist as he entered the room and the door was closed behind him he nodded in greeting to lieberwitz then turned to mobuto and extended a hand in greeting nice to see you again mr president glad you could come mobuto said shaking baileys hand i wouldnt have missed it for the world bailey replied he shook kolchinskys hand then sat down in one of the vacant armchairs this came for you sir rogers said handing the envelope to bailey ah thank you bailey said taking the envelope from rogers i was worried it might not turn up it got here in good time sir rogers replied lieberwitz got up from behind his desk mr president would you care to see the rest of the building we have a telescope on the top floor the view of the city is quite breathtaking i look forward to seeing it mobuto replied getting to his feet the telephone rang excuse me lieberwitz said then answered it he put his hand over the mouthpiece its for you mr kolchinsky kolchinsky took the receiver from lieberwitz hello mr kolchinsky speaking is that you sarah yes she replied ive just spoken to mike graham hes with sabrina at jfk they touched down about ten minutes ago it seems theres been an accident near the airport which has completely blocked off the carriageway into the city hes asked for a helicopter to pick them up from the airport and take them to the trade center he says its an emergency have one of our helicopters scrambled immediately and sent over to the airport who should i speak to about having it cleared for landing at jfk she asked til see to that dont worry you just make sure the helicopter gets over there as soon as possible yes sir did he say anything else no sarah replied thanks sarah kolchinsky replaced the receiver then looked round at mobuto youll have to excuse cw and me we wont be joining you on the tour of the building somethings come up nothing serious i hope mobuto said nothing for you to worry about mr president kolchinsky replied with a reassuring smile lieberwitz opened the door and mobuto masala and rogers went into the outer office bailey remained in his seat lieberwitz looked from bailey to kolchinsky then withdrew discreetly closing the door behind him youre missing the tour kolchinsky said eyeing bailey coldly scramble one of your helicopters immediately and have it sent over to the airport why that doesnt concern you kolchinsky shot back if it concerns this case it does cw show mr bailey to the door no need im going bailey said getting to his feet youd better not be holding out on me kolchinsky because if you are you can be sure that will go in my report to the white house and un a c os in enough trouble as it is without my adding to your problems whitlock closed the door behind bailey who was that on the phone sarah kolchinsky replied michael and sabrina have just got back from zimbala michael wants a helicopter to fly them over here he says its an emergency an emergency that has to mean bernards already here did mike say where bernard intends to make the hit kolchinsky shook his head but they should be here before the president starts his speech and if theyre not we could stall for time but we dont even know if there is an assassin whether it be bernard or not let alone where and when the hits going to be made the securitys already been tightened in and around the main hall i dont know what else we can do nothing for the moment kolchinsky banged his fist angrily on the desk why couldnt he have called us he must know were here our hands are tied until they get here he must have had his reasons whitlock replied especially if it involves bernard kolchinsky snapped til see you down at the hall ive got to call the airport to get the necessary clearance for our helicopter to land there whitlock left the room kolchinsky ran his hands over his face then sat down behind the desk and picked up the receiver bernard finished applying the foundation and powder to the scar on his cheek then studied his reflection carefully in the cracked fulllength mirror attached to the inside of the open locker door he smiled to himself the scar was gone then taking the cap from the bottom shelf of the locker he placed it carefully on his head now the disguise was complete he was just another new york cop he picked up the identity tag that had been left in the locker for him and clipped it onto his jacket he unlocked the door then opened it fractionally and peered out into the corridor it was deserted he left the room locking it again behind him then slipped on his sunglasses before walking to the stairs at the end of the corridor he glanced at his watch one twentyfive he climbed the stairs and found himself in another corridor he knew where he was from the plans he had studied in beirut he made his way to a door further down the corridor which led onto another set of stairs he descended them to the next level there as in the plans were a mens and a ladies room and they had been specially set aside for the police for the day he entered the mens room and smiled at the policeman standing in front of the urinal he nodded in greeting bernard went to the nearest sink and washed his hands the policeman crossed to the row of sinks he looked at bernards reflection in the mirror that ran the length of the wall in front of them hey thats some bruise youve got there happened last night bernard replied affecting a new york accent guy caught me by surprise with a baseball bat but its nothing compared to what i did to his face the policeman chuckled then wiped his hands on the roller towel im hank medford eighteenth precinct jose mendoza twentysixth bernard shook medfords hand so where have they got you working today im up on the roof medford replied as they walked to the door its alright for some bernard said holding the door open for medford youve got the perfect weather to be outside and you good question bernard muttered im helping out wherever they need an extra pair of hands at least i get to see round the building big deal medford said facetiously yeah bernard replied with a twisted grin ive just been told to get my ass over to the hall where mobutos making his speech at two til walk with you its on my way back to the roof anyway great bernard said patting medford on the back two cops together were far less likely to draw attention to themselves than a single cop would by himself especially one wearing dark glasses to help conceal a badly bruised eye and by pretending to know medford it would add further credibility to his deception especially when they reached the hall they walked to the lift and once inside bernard pushed the button for the sixth floor he touched his cap to the two receptionists already in the lift but ignored their inquisitive eyes as he talked to medford the receptionists got off on the fifth floor and both looked back at bernard as the door closed over again behind them id say you made quite an impression medford said with a salacious grin so did the baseball bat and thats all they were interested in how i got the bruise nothing more how can you be so sure it was in their eyes bernard smiled at medfords puzzled frown you have a lot to learn about women my friend not much chance of that im married the lift stopped again and the door opened onto the sixthfloor corridor bernard stepped out of the lift then looked round at medford see you around hank sure thing medford replied and keep away from baseball bats bernard waited until the doors had closed before turning to the policeman who had approached him im looking for captain darcy hes in the hall if youve got a message for him ill see that he gets it ive been sent here as an extra pair of eyes on the catwalk mr whitlocks orders bernard took a sheet of paper from his pocket thats his authorization the policeman opened the letter and read it quickly ok ill let captain darcy know youre here youd better get up there the presidents due here any time now how do i get up there bernard replied feigning ignorance use that door over there the policeman said pointing further down the corridor report to sergeant mason hes up there already how many men have we got up there three bernard thanked the policeman and smiled to himself as he walked to the door everything was going according to plan the door was unlocked he went inside and locked it behind him with a key rogers had given him he found himself in a room behind two lengths of heavy grey curtain that hung at the back of the stage the irritating sound of bland muzak came from inside the hall he moved to the metal ladder mounted against the wall and climbed effortlessly to the catwalk situated fifty feet above the stage a tall blondhaired policeman challenged him as soon as he reached the catwalk bernard recognized him from the dossier bailey had prepared for him at the outset of the operation sergeant mason bernard said as a matter of formality yes came the terse reply im columbus bernard said taking off his sunglasses what happened to your eye an accident bernard replied dismissively what about the other two policemen whore supposed to be up here with you unconscious im impressed bernard said absently his eyes already scanning the catwalk for the best angle for the shot theyll be out for another couple of hours those were the instructions wheres the rifle bernard cut in it was brought up earlier ill get it for you bernard waited until mason had left then looked round him slowly everything was just as he had visualized it when he had studied the plans back in beirut the catwalk was hidden from the main body of the hall by the heavy grey curtains that hung from the ceiling to the floor on the sides of the room he found the break in the curtains behind the stage and tweaked one of them aside so that he could look out over the hall the first of the businessmen had already taken their seats close to the stage and were talking amongst themselves as they waited for their colleagues to arrive bernard looked down onto the stage the lectern was centrally positioned at the front perfectly placed for a head shot but he didnt intend to wait until mobuto reached the stage he would pick him off as he entered the hall through the doors at the back of the room that way all eyes would be on mobuto and nobody would notice the slight movement in the curtains high above the stage he let the curtain fall back into place then looked at his watch one thirtythree bailey had already told him that mobuto would reach the hall around one fortyfive plenty of time mason returned with the black attache case and gave it to bernard o k keep an eye on the door bernard said as mason turned away bernard clasped his hands on either side of the mans head and jerked it savagely to one side breaking his neck he grabbed mason under the arms as his body went limp and eased him down noiselessly onto the catwalk he was only carrying out baileys orders no witnesses he unlocked the case and opened it inside were the sections of the galil sniper rifle after he had put the rifle together he connected the nimrod x telescopicsightattachment and screwed the silencer onto the end of the barrel he picked up the magazine containing twenty rounds of subsonic ammunition and carefully clipped it into place he peered through the curtain again more of the businessmen had filed into the hall but there was still no sign of mobuto he carefully adjusted the telescopic sight until he had a perfect image of the doors it would be a simple shot one bullet through the head thats all it would take but he couldnt escape he knew that it would only take the authorities a few seconds to realize the bullet had come from the catwalk and there was only one way to get off the catwalk and that was down the ladder he would never make it but he had known that even before he accepted the assignment so once he had killed mobuto he would put the rifle down and wait for the police to arrest him not that he would be in custody for very long bailey had already paid off several senior policemen to arrange for bernard to escape later that night he would then be driven to an abandoned airstrip where a plane would be waiting to take him back to beirut it wouldnt be in baileys interests to doublecross him he had only gone along with baileys plan after he had written down a detailed account of all the cia operations he had been involved in over the years which he had then passed onto a lawyer with instructions that it be forwarded on to the new york times if anything were to happen to him before he made contact with the lawyer again and bailey had been made aware of the documents existence he knew he was safe as long as the document remained in the lawyers possession and he would be in no rush to collect the document no rush at all he looked at his watch one forty mobuto could appear any time now he picked up the rifle wrapped the strap tightly around his arm then rested the barrel lightly on the top railing the telescopic sight trained on the doors now all he had to do was wait kolchinsky and whitlock were already waiting on the helipad as the un ago helicopter came in to land the cabin door was thrown open before the pads touched the ground and graham jumped nimbly onto the helipad and ran doubled over to where they stood what the hell is going on kolchinsky demanded bernards here and hes got a sniper rifle with him graham shouted above the noise of the rotors mobutos due at the hall in a couple of minutes whitlock said glancing at his watch we have to warn him kolchinsky opened his mouth to speak but graham and whitlock had already disappeared through the door behind him wiutlock grabbed grahams arm and pointed to the fire escape graham pushed it open and they bounded down the stairs two at a time and arrived breathlessly at the sixth floor less than a minute later whitlocks arm was throbbing from where it had banged against his chest but he ignored the pain as he emerged into the corridor mobuto was talking to bailey at the door bailey looked up sharply at whitlock then his eyes narrowed with uncertainty when he saw graham appear behind him bailey knew something was wrong he had to get mobuto into the hall fast he was still opening the door when graham slammed it shut with his palm what are you doing bailey snarled whats going on clarence mobuto demanded looking from whitlock to graham and who is this man mike graham whitlock replied with evident satisfaction mike graham mobuto said in a startled voice he held out his hand its a pleasure finally to meet you likewise graham said shaking mobutos hand quickly he noticed darcy standing beside whitlock are you the senior officer here darcy nodded then arrest this sonofabitch graham said pointing to bailey rogers reached for his bolstered smith wesson but his hand froze on the butt when he saw the browning in whitlocks hand he slowly withdrew his hand you touch me and youll be walking the beat for the rest of your days bailey snapped glaring at darcy clarence what is going on mobuto said in desperation robert bailey was the mastermind behind the plot to assassinate you sir graham said ngune and bernard work for him is this true mobuto said staring at bailey of course not bailey retorted angrily are you calling the presidents brother a liar graham said his eyes never leaving baileys face remy told you that mobuto asked graham he told tambese and tambese told us who do you believe bailey or your brother there must be some arrest him mobuto said contemptuously cutting across baileys outburst whitlock nodded to darcy and take him while youre at it he said indicating rogers darcy had the two men handcuffed whitlock gave instructions for them to be taken to a lounge further down the corridor then turned to darcy and explained that bernard was already in the building i think it would be unwise of you to go ahead with your address until weve rechecked the hall sir graham said to mobuto theres only one area a sniper could use in the hall and thats the catwalk darcy said behind graham and weve got that covered he looked at whitlock it seems that extra man you sent could come in useful after all what extra man whitlock replied suspiciously the policeman you sent over ten minutes ago he had a letter of authorization signed by you i never sent a man over whitlock shot back bernard graham hissed im going up there cw give me your browning and that twoway radio on your belt take captain darcy and some of his men as backup whitlock said handing the browning and the radio to graham no graham replied quickly then put a hand on whitlocks arm if he is there i want to take him myself alive preferably whitlock said graham moved to the door its locked he called out it shouldnt be darcy said approaching the door you got a key darcy took a set of keys from his pocket i dont know which one it is graham tried several of the keys before he found the right one he unlocked the door then handed the keys back to darcy are you sure you dont want any backup darcy asked graham shook his head then eased the door open and slipped into the room closing it again behind him he looked up at the catwalk but couldnt see anything or anyone from where he stood he moved silently to the metal ladder and tucking the browning firmly into his belt began to climb slowly and carefully towards the catwalk he paused threequarters of the way up the ladder and pulled the browning from his belt when he reached the top he raised his head fractionally above the level of the catwalk floor bernard was kneeling on his right knee with the rifle resting lightly on the railing for added stability his body was at a fortyfivedegree angle to the ladder and his head bent low over the top of the rifle graham was on his blind side graham kept the browning trained on him as he climbed the last few rungs before he reached the catwalk what if bernard turned and fired when challenged graham knew it was a possibility could he afford to take that chance he could kill bernard with one shot thats all it would take then his revenge would be complete his finger tightened on the trigger as he aimed the browning at bernards head one shot he thought of carrie and mikey they deserved justice then he thought of ngunes execution in kondese and how much it had appalled him shot in cold blood it would be the same if he shot bernard without giving him the chance to surrender could he live with that on his conscience he eased the pressure on the trigger drop the gun bernard graham said softly but firmly his body tensed in anticipation of bernards reaction bernard raised his head and looked round slowly he wasnt surprised that it was graham it was almost as if he had expected it to be him the face that had haunted him ever since the incident in libya he had lost count of the times he had woken in the night his body soaked with sweat grahams face still fresh in his mind but it wasnt a nightmare any more now it was real he knew graham wouldnt kill him not unless in selfdefence that much was obvious he had already discounted any thoughts of trying to fire on the turn not against someone of grahams calibre he would be dead before he even had a chance to move the rifle and with graham there it meant mobuto would already have been warned not to enter the hall certainly not until the situation had been resolved one way or the other and he still had the escape plan as backup bailey couldnt afford not to fulfil his side of the bargain even if mobuto were still alive he unwound the strap from around his arm and laid the rifle carefully at his feet put your hands on your head and step away from the railing graham ordered bernard did as he was told graham undipped the twoway radio with his left hand and told whitlock to have a couple of policemen waiting for bernard at the foot of the ladder he clipped the radio back onto his belt then gestured towards the ladder his finger tightened on the trigger as bernard passed him bernard graham called out as bernard reached the top of the ladder he waited until bernard had looked round before speaking again was it a clean kill yes i believe it was bernard replied then began to slowly descend the ladder towards the waiting policemen he was handcuffed when he reached the ground before being led away flanked by two policemen graham climbed down the ladder again the rifles still up there he said to darcy who immediately dispatched one of his men to fetch it sabrina hurried over to where graham was standing mike are you ok she asked softly yeah sure he replied quickly then looked past her as kolchinsky entered the room here comes trouble with a capital t she said glancing round as kolchinsky approached them i want to see you both in my office in an hour kolchinsky said sharply well be there sabrina assured him kolchinskys eyes flickered from sabrina to graham why didnt you kill him when you had the chance its what you set out to do its what i set out to do graham agreed but sabrina talked me out of it when we were in zimbala well thats something in your favour kolchinsky said to her then walked back towards the door i never talked you out of it she said once kolchinsky was out of earshot i tried but you wouldnt listen maybe i did graham replied but thats not the point i called the plays in beirut and now ive got to deal with the consequences im not going to let you be dragged down with me we work as a team mike and that means we face the ups and downs of the partnership together no not this time sabrina he replied then crossed to the door and disappeared back out into the corridor hi sarah said as sabrina entered the office welcome back thanks sabrina said with a grin is sergei in sarah nodded then flicked the intercom button on her desk sabrina here mr kolchinsky send her in came the terse reply kolchinsky activated the door for sabrina and closed it again behind her isnt mike here yet she asked glancing at her watch hes been and gone kolchinsky replied but i thought you wanted to see us together sabrina said frowning that was what i had in mind kolchinsky indicated the nearest of the two black couches sit down she sat down slowly her eyes never leaving kolchinskys face somethings wrong sergei what is it kolchinsky shifted uncomfortably in his chair then reached for his cigarettes on the desk and lit one michael handed in his resignation this afternoon she clasped her hands over her face and shook her head slowly to herself i said he handed it in i didnt say i accepted it she sat back and looked across at him will you accept it that will all depend on the findings of the internal investigation the secretarygenerals asked me to set up to look into the way the three of you conducted yourselves during the operation how long will that take a couple of days kolchinsky tapped a folder on his desk michaels already given me a detailed account of what happened in both beirut and zimbala i want your report on my desk by tomorrow afternoon at the latest youll have it the investigation team will want to question you personally after youve submitted your report to make sure your account tallies with those forwarded by michael and cw he opened the folder removed several sheets of paper which were stapled together in the top lefthand corner and held them out towards her this is a photocopy of michaels report make sure your account tallies with his its your one chance of getting out of this with your job and your credibility intact she took the report hesitantly from him why are you doing this sergei if anyone finds out youve given this to me youd be in a lot of trouble michael told me youd try and cover for him i can believe that at least if you stick to the same story youll minimalize the damage not only for yourself but for michael as well ive already spoken to cw and he suggested the two of you work together on your reports tonight i think its a good idea he pointed to the copy of grahams report in her hand you and cw will have to share that one and make sure you shred it when youve finished using it as you said id be in a lot of trouble if that were to fall into the wrong hands does the colonel know about this she asked holding up the report no and lets keep it that way thanks sergei she said with a smile this doesnt mean im any less angry at the way in which the three of you conducted this whole operation especially you and cw im very disappointed in both of you there wasnt any other way sergei so michael kept saying its not a very convincing excuse is it i guess not she replied glumly well discuss it at length once all your reports are on my desk she got to her feet where are mike and cw now cws with the president at his hotel i dont know where michael is he said he wanted some time on his own which is understandable under the circumstances what about bailey bernard and rogers anything from them yet still nothing its obvious that bailey and rogers wont say a thing until theyve been fully briefed on their rights by top agency lawyers bernards already been charged with the double murder of the two policemen in murray hill but hes taken his lawyers advice and hasnt said a word since being taken into custody cws out of his mind with worry about rosie i presume hes told you about her she nodded isnt there anything we can do to find her weve checked all the known cia safe houses in and around the new york area she isnt at any of them i spoke to the cia director earlier and hes promised to fax us the list he has at langley well check them out as well but we could still come up with a blank all senior agency officials have a number of safe houses that only they know about if rosie is being held at one of baileys safe houses then we wont be able to find her without his cooperation which could mean some kind of deal sabrina said bitterly kolchinsky shrugged i dont know the colonels on his way to washington now to meet with the cia director i didnt know the colonel was back at work she said in surprise he left hospital last night he was supposed to be resting at home but with all this going on hes decided to come back to work what did his doctor say i dont think his doctor knows well not yet but you know the colonel once he decides to do something nothing will stop him until he has another heart attack its his choice sabrina i guess so she said tightlipped is there anything else not for the moment kolchinsky replied meet me in the foyer of the plaza at seven president mobuto asked if he could see you and michael before he flies out later tonight michaels already asked to be excused thats why its important that you make an appearance til be there she said then paused at the door and looked round at kolchinsky by the way what was this about dave forsythe cw said something about his working for bailey thats right he obviously bugged the office so that bailey could keep bernard informed on the latest developments in zimbala what will happen to him hes already been dismissed will he be prosecuted and cause us further embarrassment no but hes finished anyway none of the top intelligence agencies will take him on after what happened here he cant be trusted hell end up running an electrical store in some backwater that will be punishment enough i guess so she said thoughtfully then left the room kolchinsky closed the door behind her then lit another cigarette and returned to his paperwork a light drizzle had set in over the city by the time sabrina reached the hotel she parked her champagnecoloured mercedes benz sec close to the hotel and as she strode briskly towards the entrance her stiletto heels clicking noisily on the sidewalk she knew she was attracting the appreciative glances of the men on both sides of the street not that she gave them the satisfaction of looking back that would only encourage them it would also be a sign of vanity and she despised vanity in any form she was relieved finally to reach the hotel and as she entered the foyer she looked around slowly hoping to see kolchinsky he was sitting with whitlock close to the lift whitlock immediately got to his feet and waved to catch her attention she smiled back at him then crossed to where he was standing and kissed him lightly on the cheek kolchinsky nodded to her in greeting then looked at his watch she was fifteen minutes early he knew that was for his benefit good keep her on her toes he took another sip of coffee you look lovely whitlock said appraising her dark beige suit and eyecatching jungleprint blouse thanks she said hows the arm still a bit sensitive but its on the mend have you heard anything from mike she asked looking from whitlock to kolchinsky kolchinsky shook his head he said hed call me in the morning but he wanted to be alone tonight i can understand that coming face to face with bernard as he did this afternoon must have brought all the memories of carrie and mikey flooding back again hell be ok whitlock said with a reassuring smile when he noticed the look of uncertainty on her face i know she replied softly kolchinsky finished his coffee then got to his feet ill ring the presidents room and find out if hes ready to see us yet sabrina watched kolchinsky cross to the reception desk then turned back to whitlock any news of rosie no whitlock said grimly bernard and bailey are still refusing to cooperate with the authorities and theyre the only ones who know where rosies being held im sorry cw i only wish there were something i could do to help i know how much rosie means to you shes the daughter i never had whitlock said with a sad smile well thats what carmen says rosie and i have always been close eddies never been much of a father to her thats why she turns to me if she needs to talk to someone not that she bares her soul very often shes like mike the maverick kolchinsky returned and pressed the button for the lift the presidents waiting for us they rode the lift to the thirtieth floor masala was waiting in the corridor for them he ushered them into the lounge where mobuto was seated an open folder on the coffee table in front of him mobuto looked up and dismissed masala with a flick of his hand good evening mobuto said getting to his feet is mike graham not with you mike couldnt make it im afraid sabrina replied he sends his apologies you must be sabrina carver im sorry i didnt get to meet you at the trade center this afternoon mobutos eyes never left her face as he shook her hand david tambese was right you are beautiful thank you she said easing her hand gently from his lingering grip hows your brother kolchinsky asked breaking the sudden silence he left hospital this morning he should be back at work in the next couple of days mobuto gestured towards the chairs please wont you sit down would anyone like a drink they sat down but declined his offer do you mind if i smoke kolchinsky asked not at all mobuto replied then crossed to the drinks cabinet and poured himself a small scotch the reason i asked to see you tonight was so that i could thank you personally for all youve done for me and my country in these last three days i thought it would be better if we met here rather than at the airport its sure to be teeming with reporters and i know how much unaco values its secrecy we appreciate your discretion kolchinsky replied reaching for an ashtray i actually had a speech prepared for this moment but the more i thought about it the more i realized just how pretentious that would have been mobuto looked at whitlock you saved my life on more than one occasion and that bullet could just as easily have killed you as winged you he turned to sabrina you and mike pushed aside all thoughts of personal safety to help david get remy out of branco you didnt have to do it but you did i owe the three of you a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid words seem very hollow at a time like this but i can assure you that i shall be eternally grateful for what you did and for the professional way in which you did it thank you he took two small red boxes each no bigger than a compact case from his pocket and handed them to whitlock and sabrina their names were written in gold lettering across the lids they exchanged glances then carefully opened the boxes both contained a gold medallion with a portrait of mobutos face on one side and on the reverse an inscription bearing their names and the date of issue the zimbalan medal he told them for outstanding bravery in the face of adversity its only eve been awarded halfadozen times in the last forty years those are the first to be issued bearing my face as the new president of zimbala and its the first time the zimbalan medal has ever been awarded to a foreigner i would be honoured if you would accept them on behalf of my government and my people the un ago charter stipulated that no operative could accept any form of payment or gratuity from an individual or from a government which could be used to discredit the operative or the organization at a later date but did a medal constitute such a gratuity whitlock and sabrina looked at kolchinsky waiting for his reaction he knew that if the medals were sold they could theoretically lead a trail back to u n a c o but these were two of his most dependable operatives despite their deception of the past few days they were hardly likely to pawn the medals and he was also well aware that if he did have the medals returned it would not only embarrass mobuto in front of them but also in front of his own government who had obviously agreed to let him present the medals in the first place although it was a delicate situation he was satisfied that no part of the charter would be breached under the circumstances he nodded his consent both then thanked mobuto for the honour that he and his government had bestowed upon them mobuto removed a third box from his pocket and handed it to sabrina thats for mike graham will you see that he gets it of course she replied pocketing the box the telephone rang excuse me mobuto said picking up the receiver he spoke briefly in swahili then replaced the receiver again the zimbalan ambassador and his delegation have just arrived youll have to excuse me im only sorry we didnt have more time to talk til wait here and see the president to the airport kolchinsky said to whitlock you and sabrina can get started on your reports whitlock looked at his watch it was only another hour before mobuto would be leaving for the airport if youre sure thats o k i wouldnt have offered if it wasnt kolchinsky shot back now go on youve got a long night ahead of you its been a pleasure to finally meet you sir sabrina said shaking mobutos hand the pleasures been all mine and again thank you mobuto turned to whitlock i owe you my life clarence and to a zimbalan that means i will be forever in your debt if there is ever anything i can do for you there is whitlock cut in name it mobuto replied holding whitlocks stare stop calling me clarence mobuto chuckled and patted whitlock on the back im sorry its just that i always knew you as clarence when we were at oxford together weve both changed since then but you more than me and for the better i might add insolent to the last mobuto said with a smile goodbye cw goodbye mr president whitlock replied then followed sabrina to the door where do you want to work on the reports sabrina asked closing the door behind them eddie and rachel are probably with carmen at our apartment right now whitlock said as they walked to the lift it would save a lot of hassle if we could go to your place sure as long as we can stop off for a takeaway on the way over i havent eaten since i got off the plane this afternoon and im starving im also a bit peckish now that you mention it whitlock said stepping into the lift after her and as sergei said its going to be a long night dont remind me she said as the doors closed kolchinsky arrived back at his apartment in the bronx just before midnight he switched on his answering machine then went through to the kitchen to make himself a coffee there was only one message on the tape he was to call philpott as soon as he got home he finished making the coffee then unhooked the receiver from his wallphone in the kitchen and rang philpotts home number philpott answered it immediately malcolm its sergei i got your message whats wrong i got a call from the police commissioner half an hour ago philpott told him bailey bernard and rogers were released without charge earlier this evening on whose authority kolchinsky asked pulling up a stool and sitting down it seems that morgan chilvers the cia director got on to the white house after id finished talking to him this afternoon he spoke directly to the president who was adamant that he wanted to avoid a scandal at all costs especially one involving a senior agency figure like bailey but bailey couldnt be released without the other two being released as well so thats what happened what about the murder charges against bernard overruled the commissioner kicked up a big stink but as chilvers pointed out none of this was ever released to the press they could afford a coverup philpott replied angrily where is bernard now ive no idea i was only given the news after they were released so there was no chance to put a tail on him kolchinsky shook his head in frustration this is the sort of thing that used to happen in russia twenty years ago there is a slim chance of us picking up bernards trail again weve got rogers under surveillance at his house in yorkville its my guess that bailey will want bernard out of the way as soon as possible before we can get to him and hes sure to use rogers or brett to do the job wheres brett thats the problem hes not at home as i said its a slim chance but i still think rogers will come into it one way or the other all we can do now is wait what should i tell cw nothing yet lets give rogers some slack and see what he does with it ill call you if rogers does make a move well goodnight sergei night malcolm kolchinsky said softly and replaced the receiver thirteen bernard parked the car out of sight of the house then taking the desert eagle automatic from the glove compartment he climbed out and keeping to the dirt road moved cautiously towards the house his clothes still stank from the stench of the cell where he had spent part of his eight hours in custody it had felt like an eternity he had always known that the cia would have him released even after he had been officially charged with the murders of the two policemen at the flat in murray hill not only could they not afford to let him go on trial for fear of what he would say they also couldnt afford to let the detailed account of his cia activities reach the new york times either way they would have been crucified publicly and he would have had no qualms about shooting his mouth off if they had left him to the mercy of the courts a lawyer had been sent down from washington to brief him on his rights while in custody and to tell him to keep his mouth shut he was to refuse to answer any questions no matter how much the police provoked him and they certainly tried but to no avail he had taken his lawyers advice and remained silent he had been in his cell when the lawyer brought the news that he was free to go an unconditional release or so the lawyer had called it he was just glad to get out he had seen bailey outside the precinct house but both had wisely ignored each other bailey had disappeared into the back of a black limousine which had been sent to take him directly to la guardia airport where a chartered plane had been waiting to fly him back to washington rogers had also ignored bernard and caught a taxi at the end of the street bernard had ducked through several back alleys then satisfied he had shaken off any tail hailed a taxi which took him to grand central station he had picked up a key from the information desk which he had left there on the day he arrived in new york and gone directly to the corresponding locker inside was a black holdall containing a change of clothing a desert eagle automatic and a set of keys for a hired ford which was parked in a garage close to the station an emergency backup for just such a situation again he had made sure he wasnt being followed then gone to the garage and driven to the safe house he reached the edge of the clearing and crouched down behind a tree the hall light was on in the house not that it surprised him brett would already have been briefed probably by rogers about their release from custody but what else had he been told bernard knew he was probably overreacting why would bailey have him killed knowing that the lawyer would then hand the document over to the new york times it made no sense but he still felt uneasy he couldnt put his finger on the reason and thats what worried him he kept close to the trees as he made his way round to the back of the house he paused in the shadows to wipe his sweating forehead the house was two hundred yards away and he would have to break cover to get to it he could see a light on in the kitchen but the curtains were drawn he inched his way round the perimeter of the wood until he was able to see the flight of steps that led down to the cellar at the side of the house but he couldnt see the window beside the wooden door at the foot of the steps he had left the window off the latch and if brett had primed the alarm system it would be his only way into the house unless brett had latched it after he had left for the trade center there was only one way of finding out he broke cover and sprinted towards the house the automatic sensing security floodlight above the kitchen door detected his movement and bathed the area in bright piercing light he was still ten yards away from the steps when the back door was flung open and he hurled himself to the ground as brett sprayed the clearing with a fusillade from his silenced uzi he got off a couple of shots forcing brett to take cover and used those precious seconds to reach the steps where he paused gasping for breath he made his way to the bottom of the steps continually glancing over his shoulder for any sign of brett he tugged at the window it was locked then he saw the shadow fall across the steps above him brett had him cornered and he didnt have time to turn and fire he launched himself at the door hitting it squarely with his shoulder the lock buckled under the impact of the blow and the door flew open he tumbled headlong into the darkened room as brett raked the steps with another burst of gunfire he fell heavily on his shoulder and the automatic clattered noisily to the floor brett hearing the noise hurried down the steps and swivelled round the uzi clenched tightly in both hands he saw the movement out of the corner of his eye and was still turning when bernard brought the side of the spade down onto his head brett cried out in pain as he as slammed against the wall the uzi fell to the floor bernard kicked it away then picked up his automatic and trained it on brett who was on his knees his hand clenched over his ear the blood seeped through his fingers and ran down the side of his face soaking the collar of his light blue shirt did bailey tell you to kill me brett looked up slowly his face twisted in pain you were expendable didnt you realize that yes thats why i covered myself by writing a detailed account of my cia activities which bailey got from your lawyer friend a few days ago brett cut in allowing himself a faint smile of satisfaction so when you didnt have a hold on the company any more you became expendable how did he know who id given it to bernard demanded were a big organization bernard we have moles everywhere we managed to track down your friend to cairo after youd told bailey about the document i believe he put up quite a struggle before he died brett made a desperate grab for the gun in bernards hand but bernard sidestepped his clumsy lunge and shot him through the head he closed the door then propped the body against it to keep it shut he found a set of keys for the house in bretts pocket then made his way across to a door that opened onto a flight of stairs which led up to the kitchen the door at the top of the stairs was unlocked he eased it open and stepped carefully into the kitchen it was empty he checked the rooms apart from the bedroom where rosie was being held they too were empty he moved to the bedroom and tried the handle the door was locked he cursed under his breath he took the keys from his pocket selected the one for the bedroom then pressed himself against the wall as he unlocked the door if brett did have an accomplice in the bedroom which he doubted they would be sure to fire when the door was opened he pushed open the door and dived low through the doorway fanning the room with the automatic rosie was slumped in the corner of the room her hand still manacled to the radiator he scrambled to his feet and hurried over to where she lay genuine concern in his eyes he checked her pulse it was steady an overturned mug lay on the floor beside her the remains of the coffee having already formed a dark stain on the carpet he lifted one of her eyelids she had been drugged he eased her onto her back ensuring that she had some slack on her manacled wrist then slipped a pillow under her head he looked at his watch twelve twenty am how long before bretts silence aroused suspicion a couple of hours at the most the chartered flight hed arranged the previous day to take him to cuba where he would catch a connecting flight to the lebanon was only due to leave new york at five that morning that left him with fourandahalf hours to kill he looked down at rosie she would be going with him certainly as far as cuba then she would be released unharmed he had no intention of killing her unless the authorities forced his hand he doubted it would come to that they would have to find him first but for the moment she was exactly as he wanted her unconscious he still had some unfinished business to attend to before he left new york that would take about an hour then he would come back for her and drive out to the field on the outskirts of the city to wait for the plane and freedom he smiled to himself then locked the bedroom door behind him and left the house bretts audi avant was parked in the driveway he was momentarily tempted to use it then dismissed the thought and ran the three hundred yards to where the ford was parked at the side of the dirt road he started the engine turned the car round and headed back towards the highway it took bernard twenty minutes to reach his destination he parked the car in a sidestreet then after slipping the automatic into the back of his trousers he walked the short distance to the main street he looked around slowly it was almost deserted a couple returning from a late show a drunk slumped against a wall he waited until a car had driven past before crossing to the row of shops on the other side of the street the windows were all protected by wire mesh and each building had a powerful alarm system in operation he made his way to a shop near the end of the block a firm of estate agents it was actually a dubok a company fronting for an intelligence agency in this case u n a c o and he had a duplicate set of keys for the reinforced back door he had got them from dave forsythe they had known each other since forsythes days as baileys electronic expert and it was his knowledge from that time that had prompted them to put their heads together and come up with a way of making them both a lot of money but bernards intentions were a lot more sinister than the merely financial and forsythe had no inkling of those intentions bernard ducked up a narrow alley that ran parallel to the building and came out at the back of the shop although a security light illuminated the small courtyard he knew there was nobody in the building it was classified as a lowsecurity risk he took the two keys from his pocket and inserted them into the two locks one at the top and one at the foot of the metal door an electronic circuit had been built into the two locks that would set off the alarm both at the shop and at the command centre if the keys werent turned simultaneously he wiped his hands on his shirt then positioned himself in such a way as to be able to turn the keys together he counted to three then turned the keys the alarm remained silent he exhaled deeply then removed the keys and entered the shop closing the door behind him forsythe had told him that the computer suite was in a soundproofed room underneath the building and the only means of access was through the managers office bernard moved along the corridor and paused in front of a frosted glass door he unlocked it with the third key forsythe had duplicated for him once inside he went straight to the managers safe and opened it using the combination that forsythe had given him the previous day he removed the sonic transmitter from the safe and activated the door built into the wall behind the desk as it slid open a light came on revealing a flight of stairs he made his way to the foot of the stairs and used the sonic transmitter to open a second door the small room was dominated by a row of computers that ran the length of the far wall he crossed to one of the terminals sat down and accessed the system then using the modem telephone link he dialled out a number that forsythe had given to him he replaced the receiver in its special cradle on the vdu and tapped his fingers impatiently on the table as he waited for the program hed dialled to appear on the screen it came up moments later he had hacked into baileys home computer forsythe had set up the whole system in baileys study including all the access codes but for security reasons bailey had changed all the codes as soon as he took charge of the system all the codes that is except for the one forsythe had programmed in for himself it bypassed all existing codes and went to the very heart of the program showing all the new access codes forsythe who had set up several sensitive systems for the cia over the years had a secret code for each one of them and none could be detected bailey had several sensitive files in his system files that even morgan chilvers knew nothing about and now bernard could access all those files copy them onto another disc and sell them to the highest bidder the cia and the kgb would be the obvious customers but he didnt care whom he sold them to as long as the price was right he would split the money fiftyfifty with forsythe had he known that forsythe had been sacked from his position at un a co he could have negotiated a new deal but that wasnt his style jeanjacques bernard wasnt a greedy man he only needed the money to start a new life away from beirut a new face a new identity that was the deal he had made with forsythe but there was more to it than that especially now that bailey had sent his hatchet men after him yes there was certainly more to it than that it was time for revenge frances baileys eyes were red and puffy from hours of crying but she had made sure she had sent her two teenage daughters over to her parents house in alexandria before she had shed the first of those tears she had always been the perfect mother and the perfect wife her friends had said that she would make an ideal first lady when her husband was elected president of the united states of america their confidence in robert bailey like her own had never wavered now within the space of a few hours his career and his future lay in ruins she was shattered she was also bloody angry it wasnt just his future that lay in ruins what about their daughters they would have to carry the stigma of their fathers deceit with them for the rest of their lives what right had he to blight their lives with his devious schemes she knew morgan chilvers would do his utmost to keep her husbands arrest out of the papers but it would already have circulated around capitol hill and thats where it mattered as far as she was concerned samantha the elder daughter was already engaged to the son of a prominent republican senator what chance did they have now and kathleen had always wanted to become a political journalist on leaving school and that meant mixing with politicians who would be the first to snigger behind her back at her fathers misfortune she had always idolized her husband now she hated him why she asked looking up at her husband who stood by the window behind her you wouldnt understand frances he replied softly try me she snapped jerking her head round to look at him zimbalas in a strategic position in the centre of africa there are civil wars raging in all the neighbouring states if we could have put our own man in power we could have fed weapons into zimbala which in turn could have been distributed amongst the anticommunist forces in those neighbouring states if wed given them enough arms it could have swung the wars in favour of those anticommunist forces we could have ham mered another nail into the coffin of world communism why couldnt you have tried to negotiate with jamel mobuto hes a man of reason a man of intelligence that much was obvious from the way he came across on his visit to america jamel mobutos loyalty is to zimbala hell do deals with whoevers prepared to help him and that includes russia and china in other words his loyalty is to his people unlike your puppet ngune he was an animal robert how many people were killed while he ran the security police between them alphonse mobuto and tito ngune kept communism at bay in zimbala for fortyfive years thats quite an achievement for a small african country they kept it at bay with torture and murder how could you have stood by a man like that because he stood by me bailey replied turning away from the window tito ngune was one of the most loyal cia operatives ive ever known well i hope you were proud of your man robert and i always thought you were a person who believed in the ideology of democracy it shows just how much i really knew you she got to her feet ive already packed a suitcase its in the car ill be at my parents until ive found my feet were finished robert bailey didnt argue with her he knew how futile that would be in her mood he would call her in a few days give her time to calm down arent you even going to say anything she snapped scathingly whats there to say i said you wouldnt understand no i guess i didnt she walked to the door then turned back to look at him i feel sorry for you robert youre a pathetic bigoted little man god help this country if youd ever reached the white house well at least something goods come out of this hasnt it bailey winced as she slammed the door behind her the front door closed followed moments later by the sound of an engine revving into life the tyres screeched as she spun the car round and headed towards the gate he waited until the sound of the engine had faded into the distance then poured himself another bourbon before walking out into the corridor his bodyguard who was sitting discreetly at the end of the corridor got to his feet bailey waved him away then climbed the stairs and crossed to the study door he punched a code into the bellpush and the door slid open he closed it behind him and sat down in front of the vdu bailey thought about the meeting he had had with morgan chilvers in the morning he would be asked to resign failing that hed be fired chilvers had always been good to him he was a naive man when it came to some of the more clandestine operations carried out by cia personnel in both africa and central america and bailey was determined to destroy all those incriminating files before the auditors were sent in to analyse his system he switched on the computer and fed in his personal code the words access denied flashed across the screen he ran his hand through his hair and scratched the back of his head access denied he stifled a yawn then shook his head youre tired robert now concentrate this time feed in the right code this time his fingers froze over the keyboard hed never made a mistake like that before for a moment he wondered if somehow the access code had been tampered with by a professional hacker he dismissed the thought why change the code a hacker would be too busy reading the files and even if the code had been altered he could press the button which would automatically cancel the whole program that had been programmed into the system by dave forsythe the man was an expert when it came to computers he cursed himself for his suspicion you pressed a wrong key for god sake try again slowly this time he pressed each key carefully then immediately put his finger lightly on the just in case he did need to use it access denied he pressed the button nothing happened the door sealed behind him and the tensecond countdown began flashing on the screen he pressed the frantically someone had overridden it he kicked over the chair and ran to the door banging furiously on it but the whole room was soundproofed nobody could hear him he looked round at the screen again knowing he was going to die the countdown finished and the word activate began flashing across the screen a jet of nerve gas streamed from the nozzle of the canister built into the wall directly above the door he stumbled away and fell to the floor saliva bubbled on his lips and he clawed desperately at his throat as he struggled to breathe it felt as if his chest were about to burst his breathing became increasingly ragged as his body twisted uncontrollably on the floor the spasms ended with a final shudder then his head lolled to the side his breathing stopped the message which had appeared on the screen as bailey lay dying on the floor was still there the following morning when the body was discovered t o be terminated after the assassination of jamel mobuto fourteen jack rogers sat in his favourite armchair by the window his hand resting lightly on the telephone his mind was in turmoil hed lost count of the number of times hed called the safe house in the last hour and always the same he picked up the receiver and dialled the number again still no reply he looked at his watch it was already one fifteen in the morning where was brett why hadnt he called had bernard got to him rogers slipped on his shoulder holster then pulled on his jacket over it he checked his smith wesson then bolstered it he picked up the car keys off the hall table and left the house closing the door silently behind him he shivered as he walked down the footpath to the gate but it wasnt cold an omen he dismissed the idea he didnt believe in that nonsense he got into his fiat and started the engine then after checking the side mirror he pulled out into the road dave swain a former presidential bodyguard had been with unaco for five years he was the leader of strike force seven he sat behind the wheel of a mazda which was parked fifty yards away from the rogerss house hed been there since ten thirty the previous evening philpotts orders an empty coffee carton lay beside the halfeaten hamburger on the dashboard the radio was on and he was tapping his fingers on the wheel to the beat of the music when rogers emerged from the house he immediately radioed in to the command centre to let them know that rogers was on the move he switched off the radio and activated the tracking device on the seat beside him it would pick up the signal from the homer he had attached to the underside of the fiat he gave rogers a thirtysecond start then followed him at a discreet distance the man in the black sedan which was parked at the end of the street stubbed out his cigarette then started up the engine and followed the mazda the telephone rang kolchinsky rolled over in bed and patted the bedside table with his hand until he found the receiver sergei yes kolchinsky replied sleepily malcolm is that you yes philpott replied ive just had a call from the duty officer at the command centre dave swain followed rogers to a house off the garden state parkway rogers parked out of sight of the house and approached it on foot then dave heard a burst of gunfire when he went to investigate he saw rogers lying in a clearing close to the house wheres david now hes got the house under surveillance i dont want him to do anything until we get reinforcements to the area who are you bringing in strike force seven no strike forcfe three its their operation ive already told the duty officer to call cw mike and sabrina theyre meeting you outside the un in twenty minutes im going on ahead to talk to dave im on my way kolchinsky said pulling the duvet to one side ive sent a car over to pick you up philpott told him it should be with you in a few minutes thanks malcolm see you at the house philpott replied then the line went dead kolchinsky replaced the receiver stifled a yawn then hauled himself to his feet he took a cigarette from the packet on the bedside table lit it then got dressed and went outside to wait for the car what the hell are they doing here graham demanded angrily pointing to the row of police cars parked at the entrance to the approach road that led to the safe house were about to find out sabrina replied braking gently as a policeman stepped out into the road and waved down the car she stopped beside him and opened her window whats going on who are you the policeman demanded kolchinsky who was sitting in the passenger seat reached across to show his id card the policeman checked it then looked at graham and whitlock who were sitting in the back of the car before handing the card back to kolchinsky you can go through the policeman said to sabrina you still havent told us what the hells going on graham snapped what are you guys doing here theres a senior swat officer down there the policeman replied pointing to the approach road hell brief you theres a swat team here kolchinsky said incredulously thats all we need sabrina engaged the gears and turned down the approach road theres the colonel kolchinsky said pointing to philpott who was standing with swain beside a swat van sabrina pulled up behind the van then climbed out of her car and smiled at philpott its good to see you back on your feet sir how are you feeling i was feeling fine until i got here philpott gestured around him its like a bloody circus whats going on sir graham asked closing the back door behind him philpott shot swain a dirty look dave was followed by one of the swat boys thats why theyre here ill see you in my office tomorrow morning nine oclock sharp swain nodded sullenly then walked to his mazda and got behind the wheel he started the engine then turned the car round and drove back towards the highway philpott turned to whitlock i spoke to bernard on the phone soon after i got here hes got rosie in there is she alright whitlock asked anxiously yes he let me speak briefly to her shes fine considering the circumstances shes a remarkable girl cw you should be very proud of her shes a great kid whitlock replied has bernard made any demands yet not yet what about rogers kolchinsky asked dead bernard let the swat team take the body away philpott trailed off as an unmarked police car turned into the approach road well this is a surprise who is it sir sabrina asked sean hagen deputy commissioner of the n ypd what brings him out at this ungodly hour hagen waited until the driver opened the door for him then climbed out he was wearing a grey overcoat over his suit and had a trilby tucked firmly over his head i didnt realize you had such little confidence in your men sean philpott said as hagen approached him the swat unit falls directly under my command hagen replied digging his hands into his pockets who do you think ordered the tail on your man its the only way we could find bernard again like you we lost him when he was released from custody and now youve come to supervise his execution is that it philpott said coldly im here to liaise with my men hagen shot back angrily whats un ago doing here this is still a un ago operation sean and that puts me in overall command i want your swat team out of here their presence is putting rosie krugers life in danger i cant do that malcolm rosie kruger was kidnapped here in new york this is our jurisdiction ive already spoken to lieutenant stephens the officer in charge of the swat team and hes indicated that because of the situation hes prepared to work with un ago to help secure the release of miss kruger but thats as far as it goes they wont be pulled out until this situations been resolved this has got nothing to do with jurisdictions has it sean kolchinsky said struggling to contain his anger you dont give a damn about rosie do you all youre interested in is avenging the death of the two officers bernard shot at the apartment youre still smarting from what happened tonight and now that you know hell never be allowed to stand trial it only leaves you with one alternative youll have to kill him that may be the way they do it in russia sergei but not in this country hagen said after a moments silence i want to see miss kruger released unharmed just as much as you do and with that in mind im prepared to go in there and negotiate with bernard on a onetoone basis im sure we can resolve this situation without bloodshed whos to say that bernard will even want to talk to you philpott countered theres only one way to find out hagen replied then rapped on the back of the van the door was opened from the inside and he gave the order to get bernard on the line he waited until the communications officer had got through before climbing into the back of the van and taking the receiver from him bernard yes whos that my names hagen im the deputy commissioner of the new york police department sean hagen i am honoured you know me hagen retorted of you bernard replied what do you want to talk in person why i would have thought that was obvious hagen said glancing at philpott i want to resolve this without bloodshed that makes two of us there was a lengthy pause come in alone unarmed the door will be unlocked but i warn you hagen any attempt by your swat team to storm the house and rosie dies i dont have anything to lose not any more no attempt will be made to storm the house you have my word on that the line went dead hagen replaced the receiver and climbed out of the van hes agreed to see me at least its a start do you know where i can find lieutenant stephens i want to have a word with him before i go in hes with his men on the edge of the clearing philpott answered thank you hagen said excuse me sir the communications officer called out after hagen do you want me to make up a wire for you yes good idea hagen replied then walked towards the wood philpott was about to shout a warning about the animal traps when hagen stopped abruptly as he neared the edge of the wood he nodded to himself then turned away and continued walking down the road kolchinsky noticed the frown crease philpotts brow what is it malcolm nothing philpott replied with a dismissive shrug philpott watched hagen until he disappeared from sight around a bend in the road why had he suddenly changed his mind about entering the wood why would he purposely take the long way round to reach the clearing did he already know about the animal traps it seemed unlikely as stephens had only been told about them when one of his men had almost stood on one and philpott only knew about them through stephens he knew there was probably a logical explanation for hagens actions but he still felt uneasy it was a feeling he couldnt seem to shake off the only way bernard leaves that house is in a body bag understood no mark stephens didnt understand and what the hell was hagen doing there anyway stephens who was in his early thirties had been with the nypds swat unit for five years the last eighteen months of those as a lieutenant he had been trained to deal with hostage situations it was his job and now his authority was being undermined by hagens interference but what could he do hagen was officially the commanderinchief of the nypds swat unit and that meant his word was law he knew the men himself included held hagen in contempt a desk man who only ever showed his solidarity with them when they were being praised for a successful operation i asked you a question lieutenant hagen said sharply stephens removed his black peaked cap and ran his hand over his short blond hair that depends on the circumstances sir what circumstances if we can get a clear shot at him theres a sixteenyearold kid in there as well her safety is my main concern your main concern is preventing bernard from leaving the house alive sir he has hostage i dont give a damn about his hostage hagen cut in his eyes blazing shes a drug addict for christs sake whats her life compared to the lives of the two officers that sonofabitch gunned down in cold blood i had to break the news to their wives spare a thought for them lieutenant and spare a thought for those kids wholl never see their fathers again stephens had never seen hagen so agitated it was unnerving what the hell had got into him he knew the rules and now he was willing to bend and twist them in some warped pursuit of revenge stephens wanted nothing to do with it even if it meant losing his command he wouldnt be party to killing an innocent teenager think about it lieutenant your future in this unit may depend on it ill try and talk bernard into releasing the girl but if he refuses then the order will be given to storm the house and if you wont give it i will now give me that bullhorn stephens bit back his fury and handed hagen the bullhorn he was holding he looked around at least his men were out of earshot he certainly wouldnt give the order to storm the house not without first hearing bernards demands but would his men stand by him hagen could have them all suspended for insubordination was it worth putting his mens careers at risk he suddenly found himself caught in two minds and he hated himself for it bernard im coming in hagen shouted through the bullhorn ill be unarmed and alone he handed the bullhorn back to stephens think about your future lieutenant who knows there could even be a promotion in it for you stephens bit his up to prevent himself from telling hagen where to shove his promotion instead he undipped his twoway radio from his belt and told his men that hagen was about to approach the house adding that if any of them got a clear shot of bernard they were to take him out he knew it was wishful thinking the man was very professional and professionals rarely make mistakes hagen removed his overcoat and hat then stepped out into the clearing and walked slowly towards the house stephens looked round as philpott and whitlock appeared behind them philpott nodded in greeting then introduced whitlock as rosies uncle stephens wondered how they would have reacted if he told them what hagen had in mind if he failed to persuade bernard to surrender some chance of that happening anyway how he hoped he was wrong hagen reached the gate and paused to look at the house it was in complete darkness as it had been ever since the swat team took up their positions on the edge of the clearing the gate squeaked as he opened it well now bernard would definitely know he was there he walked up the path and was about to mount the steps to the porch when the outside light came on he froze midstep his eyes riveted on the closed door waiting he remained like that for several seconds almost as if in a trance then climbed the steps and moved slowly to the door he was about to try the handle then thought hed better warn bernard that it was him and not one of the swat team he knocked on the door bernard its hagen its open came the reply from inside the house hagen pushed the handle down and opened the door the light from the porch illuminated the hallway he stepped inside almost reluctant to close the door behind him the light was his sanctuary close the door bernard called out from the lounge at the end of the hallway hagen closed the door severing the light he had lost his sanctuary ive got the girl with me hagen bernard said any tricks and shes dead now switch on the hall light and step away from the door hagen did as he was told bernard emerged from the lounge alone the desert eagle in his hand it was aimed at hagens stomach wheres the girl hagen demanded safe bernard replied moving towards hagen he locked the door then frisked hagen quickly and professionally i told you i was unarmed hagen said once bernard had finished so you did bernard replied with a sneer i want to see the girl shes in there bernard replied pointing to the bedroom and dont switch on the light hagen opened the bedroom door rosie who had regained consciousness less than an hour earlier was still manacled to the radiator she had been gagged she stared at hagen her eyes wide and questioning im deputy commissioner hagen rosie were doing everything in our power to try and secure your release dont worry we wont let anything happen to you how touching now close the door hold in there rosie hagen said with a reassuring smile then closed the door again lets talk in the lounge shall we sure bernard replied with a shrug but no lights well manage with the reflection from the hall light after you hagen hagen glanced at the automatic in bernards hand then reluctantly turned his back on him and entered the lounge he made for the armchair by the window and sat down i assume youre carrying a mike of some sort bernard said from the doorway the tiepin no no youre not wired or no its not the tiepin both why dont i believe you bernard said then shrugged but then it doesnt bother me whether youre wired or not it might just backfire on you though what hagen said with a frown drink bernard said indicating the drinks cabinet against the far wall yes hagen said nodding slowly bourbon if you have one of course bernard replied crossing the room to the drinks cabinet what did you mean just now about its backfiring on me if i were wired hagen asked bernard used his free hand to pour the drink then placed it on the table beside hagens chair he crossed to the door then turned his back momentarily on hagen and looked out into the hallway when he swung round hagen was clawing desperately at the underside of the chair looking for this bernard said taking a smith t wesson from his pocket good place to hide a gun for an emergency but i found it when i first got here question is how did you know there was supposed to be a gun bolstered under that particular chair a chair that you made for as soon as you entered the room now if you are wired which im sure you are your colleagues are no doubt waiting for you to clear up this obvious misunderstanding well i dont know what youre talking about hagen said fidgeting nervously with his tiepin so i was right it is the tiepin bernard said with a knowing smile id say you were in a catchtwentytwo situation right now if you discard the mike its obviously a sign of guilt but if you leave it on your colleagues are going to find out how you knew the location of the gun its your choice hagen or should i call you seabird the blood drained from hagens face and his hand was trembling when he picked up the glass from the table he drank it down in one gulp lost for words bernard said sitting down on the sofa i can understand that you certainly had me fooled i thought bailey was seabird i guess it was a natural assumption to make under the circumstances but there it was when i hacked into baileys personal computer earlier tonight a whole file about seabird none other than the deputy commissioner of the new york police department sean matthew hagen it certainly surprised me but it makes sense when you think about it baileys inside man at the nypd a future police commissioner quite a coup for him you were the one who had forsythe bug un ago headquarters werent you not bailey and you would have arranged my escape had i been arrested after id killed mobuto you recruited mason to help me at the trade center who would have questioned your decision to put mason in charge of the police supportteam on the catwalk clever hagen very clever and youd have got away with it as well if i hadnt managed to access those files that bailey had hidden away in the depths of his home computer fascinating reading ive got it all on disc in case youre still thinking of trying to bluff your way out of this call it an insurance policy a very expensive insurance policy he shook his head slowly seabird who would have guessed hagen swallowed nervously and wiped the back of his hand across his clammy forehead he tired to speak but his mouth was dry he got to his feet and moved slowly pathetically to the drinks cabinet his shoulders were hunched his head drooping he poured himself a stiff bourbon and gulped it down you came here tonight to kill me didnt you brett failed so did rogers so it was left to you what were you going to do make out that you managed to disarm me then shoot me with the smith c wesson then by pocketing the desert eagle you could have made out that i had the smith wesson all along am i right youre a dead man bernard even if you do manage to get away from here theyll find you they wont stop looking for you they being the cia they being the cias top assassins youre good bernard but youre not in their league no probably not but ive made plans to cover for that eventuality bernard got to his feet well i think youve outstayed your welcome hagen im sure there are some people out there wholl want some answers starting with unaco i bet theyre pretty pissed off with you right now hagen hurled the empty glass at bernard it missed him by inches and smashed against the wall hagen then grabbed the bottle of bourbon and lunged at bernard bernard ducked as hagen lashed out wildly with the bottle and caught him with a vicious punch to the kidney hagen stumbled back against the door and the bottle fell to the floor bernard levelled the automatic at hagen come to think of it there would just be another coverup wouldnt there like there was today youd be pensioned off quietly and that would be the end of it no youre not going to get off that lightly see you in hell hagen bernard shot hagen through the chest the force of the bullet slammed him back against the wall the blood bubbled in his mouth and ran down his chin as he slid slowly to the floor leaving a streak on the wall above him bernard dialled the number of the telephone in the swat van let me speak to colonel philpott he said when it was answered this is philpott came the response seconds later i take it you heard our little conversation colonel is hagen dead philpott demanded bernard looked down at the crumpled figure by the door it certainly looks that way but i wouldnt lose any sleep over it he would have been immune from prosecution just like me dont even think of doing anything silly now colonel like sending in the stormtroopers rosie would be the first to die do i make myself clear perfectly philpott hissed bernard looked at his watch two seventeen am still twoandahalf hours before he was due to leave for cuba it would only be a matter of time before the swat team discovered the broken cellar door and the door connecting the cellar and the kitchen was only protected by a flimsy bolt no it wasnt safe here any more he would have to rethink his strategy stay by the phone philpott ill call you again in a few minutes is rosie bernard cut the connection before philpott had time to finish he left the receiver off the hook then crossed to the sideboard and opened the bottom drawer inside was a second telephone a scrambled line he placed it on the sideboard then sat down and dialled a number he had already committed to memory it was answered immediately its columbus bernard said what is it came the suspicious reply the plans have been changed is the plane refuelled and ready for takeoff its been ready since yesterday whats happened bernard explained the situation briefly you told me you can fly anything right yeah came the hesitant reply helicopter sure i flew them in nam i want you to get over here as fast as you can ill arrange to have a helicopter on standby you can fly us to the plane then we can get out of here come over there are you crazy listen demerest youve been well paid for your troubles if anything overpaid but believe me if i go down youre coming with me youll be inside for a long stretch i want a huey demerest said after a lengthy pause its the chopper i know best til arrange it bernard replied you said there were cops there how the hell am i supposed to get past them what car will you be driving a datsun colour light blue til see to it that you arent stopped when you get here drive round to the back of the house park as close to the back door as you can understood understood demerest replied if this backfires it wont as long as you play by my rules bernard said then dropped the receiver back into its cradle philpott hung up after hed finished talking to bernard then looked at the others who had congregated outside the van hes threatened to kill rosie unless we get him a helicopter by three oclock it has to be a huey he was very insistent on that weve got a huey at newark airport kolchinsky said can you fly it kolchinsky nodded hed flown almost every heli copter imaginable since hed got his licence when he was still with the kgb philpott looked at stephens we could have it here by three yeah sure stephens replied absently he was still stunned by what hed heard minutes earlier over the loudspeaker in the back of the van hagen worked for bailey a cia stooge much as he had disliked the man he wouldnt have believed it unless hed heard it with his own ears the sonofabitch til get over to the airport straight away kolchinsky said will you clear everything with the necessary people yes dont worry about that philpott replied sabrina take sergei in your car ill get one of the police cars to take me kolchinsky said with the siren on it wont take us long to reach the airport itll be even quicker in sabrinas car its fast and she knows how to handle it ill see to it that youre given a free passage to the airport sabrina held up the keys and grinned at kolchinsky well what are we waiting for kolchinsky shot philpott a despairing look then hurried after her i have some calls to make philpott said then indicated the telephone in front of him may i use it yes of course stephens replied they are private calls philpott said to the communications officer who was hovering behind him stephens nodded to the communications officer who climbed down the metal steps and closed the door behind him he waited until the man was out of earshot then told whitlock what hagen had said before he went into the house it makes sense whitlock said thoughtfully but i doubt he cared any more about those two officers than he did about rosie hed obviously been sent here by bailey to kill bernard thats why he was so insistent that bernard leaves the house in a body bag bernard knows too much about the cia and their operations hagen was right about the cia sending an assassination squad after bernard especially now that hes got the disc stephens said that would be sure to blow the lid off some of the cias most covert operations if it were ever made public which is exactly why i think hell be given a wide berth from now on at least until the discs been recovered whitlock replied bernards nobodys fool hell have stashed the disc away somewhere safe so that if the cia do hit him itll be made public and thats the last thing bailey would want to happen id have to go along with cw on that graham said bailey cant afford to have those files made public even if he has left the cia by then the whole point of their release tonight was to cover up a potential scandal but if this is made public he wont be able to hide behind the coverup any more there would be a public outcry if those responsible werent brought to trail starting with bailey youre forgetting one thing he still has to leave the house to get to the helicopter stephens said looking at each of them in turn if any of my men gets a clear shot theyll take him out those are their orders then lets see what happens to mr bailey and his precious files if anything happens to rosie as a direct result of your team you can be sure ill come after you whitlock said in a soft menacing voice you bear that in mind lieutenant these men are highly trained mr whitlock stephens shot back defensively theyll only fire if theyre one hundred per cent sure of hitting their target for your sake i hope youre right whitlock said then walked back towards the van it was a side of whitlock that graham had never seen before cold cynical threatening he hadnt realized until then just how close whitlock was to rosie had he not known better he would have sworn that whitlock was her father not just her uncle he smiled sadly to himself whitlock would make a great father well perhaps one day hell he was only in his midforties yeah a great father philpott removed a pair of headphones and placed them on the table in front of him sergeis on his way he should get here within the next ten minutes whitlock looked at his watch two fortysix am is sabrina with him no she driving back if she were to suddenly emerge from the helicopter after it landed bernard might think it was some sort of trap i dont care how much of a professional he is right now hell be on edge its only natural with a dozen highly trained snipers just waiting for him to make a mistake so theres no use in adding to the tension whitlock sat down next to philpott and looked across at graham who was sitting on the top step his back against the open door sipping hot coffee from a plastic cup graham sensed he was being watched and glanced round at whitlock you should try the coffee sometime in fact have this one whitlock smiled as graham extended the plastic cup towards him that good huh hell no graham retorted then tossed the remainder of the coffee into the bushes behind the van why is bad coffee always associated with cops making a drinkable cup of coffee should be part of their basics philpott smiled faintly then picked up the receiver and dialled the house bernard answered you told me to let you know when the helicopter was on its way is it a huey bernard demanded yes where do you want it to land as close to the house as possible then your pilots to shut down the engine switch off all lights and withdraw im using my own pilot hes on his way over here now hell be driving a light blue datsun hes not to be stopped is that clear quite clear philpott replied contemptuously when will rosie be released when im satisfied i havent been tricked by either you or the cia strange as it may seem colonel i dont want to see her hurt any more than you do shes a great kid dont make me do something well all regret how will i know when youve released her youll be the first to know colonel you can be sure of that then the line went dead bernard glanced at his watch as he heard the sound of the helicopter in the distance two fiftyseven am good timing he switched off the hall light then went into the front bedroom and pressing himself against the wall tweaked back the curtain and peered cautiously out across the clearing although it was in darkness he knew the swat team would be positioned on the edge of the wood their sniper rifles fined with the latest in hightech infrared sights he couldnt afford to make the slightest mistake or theyd cut him down without a moments hesitation it seemed to give him added confidence no cop was going to kill him the helicopter suddenly appeared from behind the wood and came to within a few feet of the front gate before descending carefully to the ground kolchinsky cut the engine switched off the lights then unstrapped himself and got out he looked towards the house then turned away and strode briskly to where philpott was waiting for him at the edge of the clearing bernard let the curtain fall back into place then left the room philpott had kept his side of the bargain so where the hell was demerest warren demerest touched the brakes when he saw the row of police cars in the distance their lights flashing menacingly in the semidarkness he took the balaclava off the dashboard and pulled it over his head then continued for another hundred yards to where a policeman stood in the middle of the road a flashlight in his hand he shone the flashlight into the car the beam lingered on the balaclava demerest swallowed nervously what if bernard had already been caught or killed jesus hed never thought of that another conviction and theyd throw away the key well thats what the governor had told him when hed been released from san quentin at the beginning of the year the policeman who had been instructed by stephens to let the car through stepped back and pointed to the approach road demerest put the car into gear and headed down it he passed the van and severalmembers of the swat team in their black uniforms they were all armed what the hell had bernard got him into here well it was too late to turn back now he turned up the narrow driveway at the side of the house just as bernard had instructed and drove round the back pulling up within a foot of the back door what the hell was he supposed to do now stay in the car go into the house where was bernard the door opened fractionally kill the lights bernard hissed from inside demerest switched off the lights get in here bernard snapped demerest climbed out of the car and slipped into the kitchen bernard had handcuffed himself to rosie he held the automatic in his free hand hey man careful with that thing demerest said nervously indicating the automatic which was pointed at his midriff take off the balaclava bernard said softly demerest pulled it off to reveal his face he was in his late thirties with cropped brown hair and a gold sleeper in his left ear satisfied he said sharply get that blanket bernard said pointing to the blanket on the table drape it over rosie and me then lead us out to the car well ride in the back they wont risk a shot if they cant see me demerest tugged the balaclava back over his face then glancing quickly at rosie unfolded the blanket and covered them with it bernard pulled rosie to him and pressed the automatic into her ribs she winced as the barrel dug into her but said nothing she wouldnt give bernard the satisfaction of knowing he was hurting her lets go bernard snapped from under the blanket demerest wiped the sweat from his face he knew there would be rifles trained on the back door what if they opened fire when he opened it demerest what the hells going on bernard snarled i said lets go ok demerest replied irritably he eased the door open and held his breath as he stepped outside no gunfire so far so good he grabbed bernards arm through the blanket and led them to the car he opened the back door bernard kept rosie close to him as he ducked into the back seat making it impossible for the snipers to distinguish between the shapes under the blanket demerest slammed the door shut behind them he got in behind the wheel and looked in the rearview mirror bernard and rosie were lying on the back seat the blanket over them no sniper would risk a shot demerest still felt vulnerable they could take him out at any time one bullet thats all it would take start the car dammit bernard shouted and no lights demerest muttered an apology as he grated the gears his hands were shaking he tried again this time he found first gear he turned the car round and headed back down the driveway but instead of branching off onto the approach road he headed towards the silhouette of the huey on the edge of the clearing park as close as you can to the helicopter bernard told him demerest pulled up beside the cabin door and killed the engine he climbed out of the car and glanced towards the wood he could see some figures standing in the shadows obviously not from the swat team they would be invisible in their black uniforms that only unnerved him even more how many unseen guns were aimed at him at that very moment he pushed the thought from his mind he was scared enough as it was he pulled open the cabin door and peered inside there was a small set of metal steps close to the door he unhooked them from the wall and placed them in front of the door ready he told bernard through the open drivers window open the back door demerest did so and bernard wriggled backwards taking rosie with him a hand pushed her head down as she felt her foot touch the ground the hand remained on her head until she was out of the car theres some steps in front a bullet ricocheted off the side of the helicopter inches above demerests head bernard froze as he forced himself not to pull the trigger he felt rosies body stiffen against his she closed her eyes waiting for him to kill her demerest was down on one knee his eyes wide with fear they heard the shouted order from the direction of the wood then silence bernard stephens yelled through the bullhorn dont harm the girl it was an accident therell be no more shooting bernard winced as the sweat seeped into his eyes he eased his finger off the trigger but kept the automatic pressed into her ribs he heard himself sigh it had been that close hed so nearly lost his ace demerest he hissed demerest im here demerest said straightening up lead us to the steps bernard ordered demerest took bernards arm through the blanket and talked them up the steps into the back of the helicopter he kicked the steps away slammed the door shut then scrambled into the cockpit and started up the engine bernard discarded the blanket and careful to remain flat on the cabin floor he unlocked the handcuff from his wrist and secured it around a metal pipe that ran the length of the wall he wiped the sweat from his face and inhaled sharply as his thumb brushed against the wound above his eye how long before we can take off he called out to demerest almost ready came the reply bernard allowed himself a faint smile of satisfaction he looked across at rosie she stared back at him her face expressionless then the helicopter began to rise graham and whitlock had used the cover of darkness to slip away unnoticed from the others but by the time they had reached the back of the house the car was already heading away down the driveway they waited until it had turned off into the clearing before breaking cover and sprinting to the steps at the side of the house it was then that whitlock had discovered the body of brett slumped against the halfopen cellar door graham had remained crouched at the top of the steps out of sight of the car which had by then pulled up next to the helicopter although armed he knew the beretta would be of little use from that range there were snipers all around the house who would take bernard out if he did make a mistake if but graham knew bernard better than any of them bernard wouldnt make a mistake which was why he and whitlock had come up with an alternative plan whitlock because of his injured arm could only be a bystander it simply added to his frustration but he wanted to be with graham when they put their plan into operation they had a bond an alliance bernard had escaped after carrie and mikey had gone missing and now he was threatening to do the same again only this time he was using rosie and they knew her life would be worthless if he did manage to flee the country and start up a new life somewhere else he had to be stopped whitlock put a hand lightly on grahams shoulder graham gave him a thumbsup then broke cover and sprinted towards the helicopter as it began to slowly lift off the ground demerest only saw graham out of the corner of his eye when he was within ten yards of the helicopter he instinctively applied more pressure on the collectivelever pitch to force the helicopter to climb further away from the ground graham realizing he wouldnt reach the nearest landing pad from the ground scrambled onto the datsuns bonnet then onto its roof before launching himself at the pad the fingers of his right hand touched the cold steel he clamped his hand in a vicelike grip around the pad as the helicopter continued to rise further away from the ground his arm felt as if it were going to be pulled out of its socket slowly carefully he brought up his left hand and his fingers curled around the pad easing the pressure off his right arm he began swaying from side to side then when he felt he had enough momentum he heaved himself upwards and managed to hook his right leg around the pad then he looked down the helicopter was already a hundred feet above the ground and still climbing demerest continued to glance anxiously out of the side window at graham mesmerized by the agility hed used to haul himself up onto the landing pad bernard who had already been alerted by demerest had his automatic at the ready waiting he knew instinctively it was graham it was exactly the sort of stunt he would pull the man had a death wish but he couldnt do anything until the helicopter was clear of the wood and the snipers and that was giving graham valuable seconds to stabilize himself on the landing pad bernard knew what he had to do when he pulled open the door his fingers tightened around the automatic demerest had initially wanted to drag the pads through the tops of the trees to try and dislodge graham from the helicopter bernard had quickly ruled the idea out as too dangerous what if one of the pads snagged on a thick branch it could result in the helicopter losing altitude and ploughing into the trees demerest seesawed the helicopter from side to side desperately trying to pitch graham off the padto no avail graham clung resolutely on waiting almost catlike for the moment when bernard would open the door the trees ended abruptly at the edge of the freeway demerest called out to bernard that they were clear of the wood bernard reached out a hand then yanked open the door he was still raising the automatic to fire when rosie slammed the sole of her boot against the side of his face ripping open the bruise above his eye he screamed in agony and the automatic fell from his grasp as he stumbled backwards his hand clasped over his eye the blood poured down through his fingers onto his shirt he caught her with a vicious backhand slap which slammed her against the side of the cabin knocking a wooden box off the wall above her he was still reaching for the fallen automatic when graham launched himself through the doorway and felled him with a low football tackle bernard landed heavily on the floor and the automatic skidded towards the open door it came to rest a foot away from the door graham pulled his beretta from his shoulder holster but bernard managed to grab his wrist and force the barrel up towards the ceiling he slammed the back of grahams hand against the side of the cabin and the beretta fell from his fingers he caught graham with a hammering jab to the side of the face rocking his head back against the floor graham lashed out with his elbow catching bernard squarely on his gashed eyebrow bernard recoiled in agony but was quick to react when graham reached for the fallen beretta they grappled for possession of the automatic but as bernard tore it from grahams hand graham butted him viciously in the face again catching him on the eyebrow bernard stumbled and as he fell the beretta spun from his hands and disappeared through die open doorway he brought his foot up sharply into grahams stomach and as graham buckled forward he caught him with a hammering punch to the face graham fell to his knees his eyes watering from the force of the punch bernard dived for the desert eagle graham knew he could never reach bernard before he recovered the automatic hey catch rosie shouted to graham graham turned to rosie she was holding the very pistol which had fallen out of the box when it landed on the floor she threw it to him he didnt even know if it was loaded but there wasnt time to find out bernard was already turning the automatic in his hand graham aimed the very pistol at him and pulled the trigger the aluminiumcased cartridge slammed into bernards chest with the force of a hammer he was rocked back on his heels and lost his balance as he stepped out of the doorway he clawed frantically at the side of the cabin but his bloodied fingers couldnt get a grip on the smooth surface and his eyes widened in horror as he fell backwards the wind tore the scream from his lips as he plunged to his death graham picked up the desert eagle which had slipped out of bernards hand as he fell and pressed it into the back of demerests neck go back to the house sure thing man demerest said nervously i dont want any trouble give me your piece graham demanded i aint carrying demerest replied shaking his head vigorously i never carry im just a flier man graham was convinced demerest was telling the truth give me the radio demerest unhooked the radio and handed it to graham who called philpott to let him know that they were returning to the safe house he closed the cabin door then sat down beside rosie and tilted her head gently as he looked at the discoloured bruise that was already beginning to form on her left cheek im okshe said softly did you load it graham asked gesturing to the very pistol on the floor in front of them she nodded i wanted to shoot him myself but i couldnt bring myself to pull the trigger im sorry graham smiled gently at her what are you apologizing for you saved my life rosie thanks who are you my names mike mike graham yeah how did you know she took a cassette from her pocket and handed it to him bernard that is his name isnt it graham nodded well he gave it to me before we left the house he said i was to give it to my uncle when i saw him again he was to give it to you did he say what was on the tape she shook her head graham sat back against the side of the cabin and turned the cassette around slowly in his fingers his name had been printed in capital letters on both sides in black pen it had to contain something about carrie and mikey but it didnt make any sense bernard wasnt the sort of man to gloat it wasnt in his nature so why had he made the cassette for him the question lingered in his mind for the rest of the journey back to the safe house the helicopter was surrounded by members of the swat team when it landed in the clearing demerest closed down the engine then unbuckled his safety belt and clambered out of the cockpit he was immediately handcuffed and led away towards a police car the door was pulled open from the outside and whitlock peered anxiously into the cabin rosie smiled at him then bit her lip as a tear trickled down her face graham helped whitlock into the cabin then went off to find something to use to cut rosie free thank god youre safe whitlock said hurrying over to her she hugged him and suddenly the tears began to spill down her face whitlock took a handkerchief from his pocket and gave it to her she smiled selfconsciously as she wiped her eyes who hit you he asked a sudden anger entering his voice bernard she nodded im ok what happened to your arm its nothing he replied with a dismissive shrug your parents are going to be over the moon when they find out youre safe so will carmen weve all been out of our minds with worry is it still alright if i come and stay with you and carmen for a few days just until i feel strong enough to face my parents again the spare beds already made up whitlock replied you can stay as long as you want you know that knock knock graham said peering into the cabin come in mike whitlock said looking round at graham graham climbed back into the helicopter a small hacksaw in his hand well have you out of here in no time rosie how come you two know each other rosie asked as graham crouched down beside her graham glanced at whitlock waiting for him to answer it was up to him to decide whether he was going to tell her about unaco in some ways graham felt she deserved an explanation but he wouldnt say anything not without whitlocks lead whitlock gave her a knowing smile you get to meet a lot of different people in the diplomatic corps i first met mike at a reception at the un weve bumped into each other a few times since then mike called me when theyd found out where bernard was holding you i got over here as quick as i could are you a cop she asked graham graham stopped cutting to look up at her yeah a sort of a cop a sort of a cop she queried what kind of an answers that the only one youre getting graham replied then went back to cutting through the handcuff around her wrist i can take a hint she said it took graham another minute to cut through the handcuff he plied apart the two halves and she pulled her wrist free well are you ready for a hot bath a good meal and a long sleep in a warm bed whitlock asked her you bet she replied rubbing her chafed wrist come on then whitlock said helping her to her feet thanks mike she said softly then kissed him lightly on the cheek get out of here he said goodhumouredly she followed whitlock to the door then looked back at graham are you an undercover cop d yeah a sort of an undercover cop graham replied pokerfaced she smiled bye mike see you rosie graham replied with a smile sabrina waited until whitlock and rosie had been helped out of the helicopter before looking in at graham youre crazy do you know that sure i know that graham replied nodding his head how come its taken you so long to realize it why didnt either of you say anything before you went off like that im sure the colonel would have sanctioned what we had in mind arent you i take it hes pretty pissed off about what we did hes only pissed off that neither of you told him what you were going to do he actually seems quite pleased with the outcome he wants to see you now graham moved to the door and was about to jump to the ground when something caught his eye on the floor in the corner of the cabin he went over for a closer look what is it sabrina asked its a computer disc he replied then picked it up and looked round at her are you thinking what im thinking aha she said slowly nodding her head bernards insurance policy it must have fallen out of his pocket when we were fighting this is quite a coup for un ago especially as the cia dont even know weve got it sabrina added and knowing the antagonism that exists between the colonel and langley you can bet your life hes going to keep it that way well have to return it to them of course philpott said taking the disc from graham return it to them graham said in disbelief i dont understand sir we could monitor all the operations on this disc for years to come without langleys ever knowing about it we will philpott replied these covert operations are obviously very important to the company so its highly unlikely that theyll be terminated after baileys gone theyll just be assigned to a new controller possibly baileys successor but if langley know were monitoring these operations theyll want to make sure that none of their agents are compromised and thats where we can turn it to our advantage our silence will have a price i think youll find that theyll be a lot more cooperative in the future and lets face it that cant be a bad thing can it no sir graham replied with a knowing smile philpott slipped the disc into his pocket now about this little escapade of yours it was my idea sir graham said strange those were cws exact words as well whose idea it was is irrelevant what does bother me is that neither of you said anything before you sloped off i thought youd have both learned your lesson by now about keeping things from sergei and me obviously you havent you wouldnt have sanctioned it anyway sir thats not the point michael kolchinsky said sharply were your superiors not that that seems to have made much impression on any of you these past few days especially you its because of your maverick tendencies that strike force three is the subject of this internal investigation bernard killed my family sergei my wife and my fiveyearold son what the hell was i supposed to do when i heard hed been seen in beirut graham held up his hand before kolchinsky could answer yeah i know tell you then you could have made the necessary arrangements to have him taken into custody then what would they have extradited him to face charges over here you know they wouldnt hed probably have been put on a plane bound for libya and been given a heros welcome when he got there i dont expect you to understand the torment ive been through these last two years hell im not going to stand here and explain myself to you sergei i did what i thought was right not only for the memory of my family but also for my own piece of mind my only regret is that i had to drag sabrina and cw into it as well thats why i resigned to spare them any further trouble and if youve got any sense youll accept my resignation and put an end to the matter your resignation is on my desk philpott said holding grahams stare and itll be considered more carefully when the results of the investigations are known until then youre still part of this organization and that means cooperating fully with the investigation youll each be interviewed individually this afternoon the panel will use my office as a base so be there at two oclock sharp when will the results be known sabrina asked late this afternoon im dining with the secretarygeneral tonight well discuss the findings then sabrina glanced at her watch three fortyseven am she stifled a yawn can we get some sleep now sir yes go on i wont see you this afternoon ill be in washington talking to morgan chilvers the cia director but sergei will be at the un well all meet again in my office at nine oclock tomorrow morning to discuss the implications of the findings by then ill also know how the secretarygeneral stands on the issue sabrina will you give mike a lift back to his hotel sure she replied does cw know about the meeting tomorrow morning yes i told him before he took rosie home philpotts eyes flickered towards graham you did well tonight mike rosies safe thats all that matters now graham looked at sabrina ready she nodded then said good night to philpott and kolchinsky before hurrying after him you got a tape deck in your car graham asked no only a cd player why he took the cassette from his pocket and showed it to her bernard gave this to rosie before they left the house its for me it has to be something about carrie and mikey ive got a tape deck at the apartment you can listen to it there he looked at his watch you sure you dont mind dont be silly she replied unlocking the drivers door thanks i appreciate it she climbed into the car and opened the passenger door for him he slipped the cassette back into his shirt pocket then got in beside her she drove back up the approach road and rejoined the highway thanks graham said taking the cup of hot chocolate from sabrina and placing it on the table beside him its a nice place youve got here liar she said with a grin sure its a bit arty for my taste but its still a lot better than i thought it would be seriously ill tell what does impress me though your cd collection youve got some good jazz there you know how much i love jazz music she said glancing down at the row of compact discs on the shelf beside the player her eyes shot to the cassette on the table til leave you alone to listen to the tape ill be in the kitchen when youre through yeah thanks he replied then waited until she had left the room before pressing the play button he sat down his arms resting on his knees his eyes riveted on the cassette as it turned slowly on the spools when you receive this tape graham ill have already left the country with the intention of starting up a new life in some distant corner of the world i know youll never stop looking for me and frankly i cant say i blame you i know youve always held me personally responsible for what happened to your wife carol and your son michael this tape isnt an attempt to try and exonerate myself i cant ill always be partly responsible for their deaths i know that but you have the right to know what really happened that afternoon outside your apartment in new york i was in libya at the time on the orders of the cia or robert bailey to be more specific as you no doubt know by now hes been my handler ever since i first started working for the company the reason i was there was because salim almakesh who was then a senior advisor in abu nidals black june movement had come up with a plan to mount a bombing operation across the united states the idea was to hit amongst others shopping malls sports stadiums and school buildings in other words a soft target campaign the cia found out about it through a mole they had in the black june movement but he was killed under mysterious circumstances before he could pass on all the information to them whether he was murdered or whether he died accidently was never established but the cia were worried because they still didnt know exactly where and when the bombs were due to go off thats why i was sent to meet with almakesh to fill in the missing dates so ù that the bombers could be arrested when they arrived in the united states wed been talking for about forty minutes without much success i might add when we first heard that you and your men had surrounded the base camp but at the time we had no idea who you were or where youd come from so i called bailey in washington and told him what was happening he knew that if almakesh were killed the cia would have lost their last chance to prevent the bombing campaign i dont know how he found out but it wasnt five minutes later when he rang back to say that it was a unit of the us antiterrorist squad delta then i knew we were in trouble apart from the two of us there were another eight men at the baseno match for a crack delta unit bailey said he would arrange something those were his exact words he called back a few minutes later to say that the delta unit would be pulled out that was great news until you attacked almakesh ordered his men to stand and fight then he took me to an underground tunnel and we managed to get out only minutes before your unit overran the camp i called bailey that night to find out what had gone wrong thats when he told me what had really happened he had found out that a delta unit was in the area under your command but he couldnt risk telling your commanding officer that i was a cia asset without compromising my position he knew it was your first operation as a unit leader and understandably he thought you might crack given the right pressure your wife and son were kidnapped on his orders to force you to give the order to pull back i know several eyewitnesses claimed that three arabs all wearing balaclavas were involved in the kidnapping because they were sure the men had been speaking a language similar to arabic it was arabic but they werent arabs they were americans speaking arabic baileys men paul brett jack rogers and a third man called kennedy rick kennedy he was killed in a light plane crash a few months ago your wife and son were brought here to this safe house thats why i came here after i was forced to leave the apartment in murray hill its the only other cia safe house that i know of in the united states i dont know whether bailey ever intended to let them go but it seems your wife went for one of the men after hed manhandled your son and in the ensuing struggle she managed to unmask him they couldnt let either of them go after that both were shot that same day and their bodies buried at the back of the house i dont know exactly where but it was somewhere close to the house thats what happened graham i dont expect you to take my word for it theres a file in baileys computer entitled operation delta its all there im sure your colonel philpott will be given access to it by the cia you must be wondering right now why i made this tape for you well i can answer that in one word respect like me youre a field man and one of the best by all accounts baileys a desk man who manipulates the lives of the people around him he may have been my controller but that didnt mean i had to respect him how could i you though gained my respect the moment you gave the order to attack you believed in your principles enough to sacrifice your own family for them thats the mark of a true soldier but having said that the past can never be undone we both have to live with what happened that day each of us has our own guilt to bear and no matter what happens well have to carry that guilt to our graves assalam alaikum graham sat back in the chair and rubbed his hands slowly over his face he knew the anger would come in time but at that moment all he felt was relief relief that the last pieces of the jigsaw had finally slotted into place at last he knew the truth the pain and the anguish of the past two years were at an end but most importantly of all carrie and mikey could now be laid to rest in sacred ground carrie had always been the religious one of the family and he knew she would have wanted it not only for herself but for mikey as well together side by side for ever he switched off the tape deck pocketed the cassette then picked up his cup and went through to the kitchen sabrina was sitting at the pine table are you ok she asked softly yeah he replied then went on to quickly outline the gist of what bernard had said on the cassette im sorry mike she said softly when hed finished speaking i always knew they were dead i cant explain why though i guess its just a feeling you have when youre as close as i was to them whats always preyed on my mind these last couple of years was the fact that theyd never had a proper burial but now i can rectify that then i can visit the graves every week and be with them again he shrugged uncomfortably i know that sounds kind of corny only to you youve never allowed your feelings to surface since they disappeared have you youve always made yourself out to be the hard uncaring maverick well thats the image you wanted to portray and its worked with most people it even worked with me at first but not now ive seen the other side of mike graham and hes not as hard as he likes the world to believe yeah he said then put the cup down on the table its late id better be going theres a spare room its only ever used when my parents come up from miami no i want to get back to the hotel but thanks anyway ok ill get my keys til get a cab you need your beauty sleep dont be silly im taking a cab graham indicated the cup on the table thanks for the hot chocolate she nodded then got up and walked him to the front door are you sure i cant give you a lift its no trouble im sure he opened the door then looked back at her see you this afternoon she kissed him lightly on the cheek night mike yeah he muttered and closed the door behind him epilogue hello mike sarah said as graham entered the room hi he replied closing the door behind him are cw and sabrina here yet theyve already gone through sarah replied then switched on the intercom and announced grahams arrival send him in sarah philpott replied the door slid open and graham walked into philpotts office he greeted philpott then nodded to sabrina and whitlock who were sitting on one of the black sofas im not late am i sir graham said looking at his watch you did say nine youre not late sit down graham sat on the second sofa is there any news from the safe house yet yes word came through about an hour ago the police have found something sergeis over there now im waiting for his call something sir philpott turned his empty pipe around slowly in his fingers then pushed it away from him human remains ive arranged to have you driven out there as soon as were through here thank you sir philpott tapped the folder in front of him these are the findings of the internal investigation its highly critical of cw and sabrina for withholding information from sergei during the course of the assignment especially you sabrina you became involved in the politics of a foreign power a point the secretarygeneral raised on several occasions i know its easy to fall into that trap when an assignment verges on the political but you have to know where to draw the line thats what the charters there for to clarify those boundaries and if youre still not sure you ask we have enough enemies at the un as it is without further aggravating the situation by blatantly taking sides as you did in zimbala what if it hadnt turned out the way it did what if ngune had seized power we would have been branded mercenaries there are already whispers to that effect amongst some of the more radical african and asian countries as it is why give them the ammunition they want to shoot us down youre here because youre regarded as the best in the business lets act that way shall we yes sir sabrina muttered guiltily philpotts eyes shifted to graham and he shook he head slowly i dont even know where to start with you im not going to go through all the rules youve broken in these past few days you know what they are already and thats what makes it all the more serious your blatant disregard for your colleagues and for un ago in general and even when sabrina went out to beirut to bring you back you gave her an ultimatum that put her in an impossible position she had no option but to go along with your plan and thats what got her into trouble in the first place it was my decision sir sabrina said i could have shopped mike when i spoke to sergei but i thought it best to work with him rather than against him and i doubt sergei would have understood that do you your loyaltys touching sabrina philpott said but the fact remains that mike disobeyed a directive to return home with you and can you blame him she shot back what would have happened if he had come back with me bernard would probably have succeeded in killing president mobuto it was only mikes determination that eventually led us to remy mobuto and to ultimately preventing a serious embarrassment to the white house but those werent mikes intentions when he went after bernard were they philpott said glancing from sabrina to graham your sole intention was to put a bullet in him wasnt it initially graham replied but when sabrina agreed to work with me my first duty was to prevent mobutos being assassinated not to put a bullet in bernard ive already explained all this at the hearing yesterday which brings me to another point you were even abusive to the panel of investigators why four desk men two excia two exfeds what the hell do they know about field work all theyve done is push pens all their lives their questions were loaded and misleading and my answers were twisted when i did try to explain myself what was i expected to do sir thank them philpott shook his head in dismay the secretarygeneral wants you thrown out do you know that you have my resignation sir yes i do but that doesnt mean im going to accept it im the director of unaco youre my operatives and i have the final say on whether anyone is to be dismissed from this organization and the secretarygeneral knows that philpott removed the letter from the folder and tossed it onto the desk get rid of it before it falls into the wrong hands graham got up and took it off the desk that doesnt mean i condone your actions for one moment mike i had to do a lot of hard talking to convince the secretarygeneral that you were worth a second chance i appreciate it sir i should hope so philpott shot back i realize this was a oneoff situation and now that bernard and bailey are dead perhaps we can expect a little more cooperation from you in the future believe me mike you screw up again and you will be out that goes without saying theres a black mark against your name right now and its up to you to prove to unaco and the secretarygeneral that youre worthy of another chance i wont let you down sir no you wont because i wont be here i dont understand sir graham said frowning my doctor nearly had a heart attack of his own when he found out i was back at work he thought i was resting at home hes told me that the next attack could be the big one thats why i submitted my resignation to the secretarygeneral last night ill be leaving as soon as ive handed over properly to sergei hell be taking over as the new director and whos taking his place sabrina asked philpott gestured towards whitlock i know all the strike force teams will give him their full support sabrina was the first to congratulate him kissing him lightly on the cheek graham pumped his hand firmly i know cw still has some reservations about the job because like you mike hes not a great admirer of the desk man but lets face it cw youre not getting any younger you know so carmen keeps reminding me whitlock said how long have you known about this sabrina asked whitlock a couple of months now look i would have told you guys before but i was sworn to silence has anyone been pencilled in to take cws place yet graham asked philpott nodded weve been grooming his successor for the last six weeks you worked with him on your last assignment when he was still with the italian antiterrorist squad the nocs fabio paluzzi sabrina said yes as you know hes been with strike force nine since he joined us from the nocs but that was just to let him get the feel of the organization hell be taking over from cw in the next couple of weeks thats great sabrina said with a grin then quickly patted whitlock on the arm dont take that the wrong way cw i would if i didnt know you better ill be briefing fabio this afternoon so if you do happen to see him before that dont say anything drinks at my apartment tonight whitlock said ill invite fabio after the colonels had a word with him mike i hope you can make it but id fully understand if you wanted to be by yourself tonight til be there buddy graham said wagging a finger at him you just make sure the perriers cold its already in the fridge whitlock replied with a smile cw sabrina id like a few words with mike ill see you both at the flat tonight sabrina paused in front of graham and put a hand lightly on his shoulder if you want to talk you know where to find me i might take you up on that graham replied it just depends what time i get away from the safe house see you mike whitlock said then followed sabrina from the room philpott activated the door behind them i spoke to sergei and cw after id seen the secretarygeneral last night theyre both behind you one hundred per cent dont let them down sergei hes been on my back ever since i got back from zimbala quite right too you screwed up mike badly but he also knows how valuable you are to the organiza tion we all do thats why youre still here i doubt any other operative would have been given another chance if theyd flouted the rules as youve done youve got the potential to be the best operative unacos ever had but youve got to work on this maverick streak that seems to come out at the worst possible times i know a lot of it has to do with what happened to your family you always felt that someone at delta had let slip your position to bernard and almakesh trust suddenly became a dirty word in your book but now you know the truth it had nothing to do with any of your men use that knowledge to channel your resources positively back into strike force three from now on i dont have to tell you how lucky you are to have sabrina as a partner there isnt a field operative here who wouldnt give his right arm to trade places with you not only that she also thinks the world of you thats a great compliment from a fellow professional and now fabios coming in hell need to draw off both of you until hes found his feet and that means supporting him what use will you be to him if youre going to continue with these maverick tendencies now that cws coming onto the management side youll be the most experienced field operative not only in strike force three but in the whole of unaco thats quite a responsibility mike added to which youll be officially promoted to team leader when fabio joins you and a good leader always leads by example doesnt he you of all people should know that yes sir i do theres a car waiting outside to take you over to the safe house thank you sir philpott activated the door then closed it again behind graham sarah looked up from her typing as graham approached her desk excuse me he said then leaned across the desk and dropped the letter into the shredding machine beside her things that are done it is needless to speak about things that are past it is needless to blame she frowned confucius he added she watched him leave the office then shrugging her shoulders went back to her typing the end
