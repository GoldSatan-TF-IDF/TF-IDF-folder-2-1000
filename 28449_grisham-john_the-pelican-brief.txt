part he seemed incapable of creating such chaos but much of what he saw below could be blamed on him and that was fine he was ninetyone paralyzed strapped in a wheelchair and hooked to oxygen his second stroke seven years ago had almost finished him off but abraham rosenberg was still alive and even with tubes in his nose his legal stick was bigger than the other eight he was the only legend remaining on the court and the fact that he was still breathing irritated most of the mob below he sat in a small wheelchair in an office on the main floor of the supreme court building his feet touched the edge of the window and he strained forward as the noise increased he hated cops but the sight of them standing in thick neat lines was somewhat comforting they stood straight and held ground as the mob of at least fifty thousand screamed for blood biggest crowd ever rosenberg yelled at the window he was almost deaf jason kline his senior law clerk stood behind him it was the first monday in october the opening day of the new term and this had become a traditional celebration of the first amendment a glorious celebration rosenberg was thrilled to him freedom of speech meant freedom to riot are the indians out there he asked loudly jason kline leaned closer to his right ear yes with war paint yes in full battle dress are they dancing yes the indians the blacks whites browns women gays tree lovers christians abortion activists aryans nazis atheists hunters animal lovers white supremacists black supremacists tax protestors loggers farmers it was a massive sea of protest and the riot police gripped their black sticks the indians should love me im sure they do kline nodded and smiled at the frail little man with clenched fists his ideology was simple government over business the individual over government the environment over everything and the indians give them whatever they want the heckling praying singing chanting and screaming grew louder and the riot police inched closer together the crowd was larger and rowdier than in recent years things were more tense violence had become common abortion clinics had been bombed doctors had been attacked and beaten one was killed in pensacola gagged and bound into the fetal position and burned with acid street fights were weekly events churches and priests had been abused by militant gays white supremacists operated from a dozen known shadowy paramilitary organizations and had become bolder in their attacks on blacks hispanics and asians hatred was now americas favorite pastime and the court of course was an easy target threats serious ones against the justices had increased tenfold since the supreme court police had tripled in size at least two fbi agents were assigned to guard each justice and another fifty were kept busy investigating threats they hate me dont they he said loudly staring out the window yes some of them do kline answered with amusement rosenberg liked to hear that he smiled and inhaled deeply eighty percent of the death threats were aimed at him see any of those signs he asked he was nearly blind quite a few what do they say the usual death to rosenberg retire rosenberg cut off the oxygen theyve been waving those same damned signs for years why dont they get some new ones the clerk did not answer abe shouldve retired years ago but they would carry him out one day on a stretcher his three law clerks did most of the research but rosenberg insisted on writing his own opinions he did so with a heavy felttip marker and his words were scrawled across a white legal pad much like a firstgrader learning to write slow work but with a lifetime appointment who cared about time the clerks proofed his opinions and rarely found mistakes rosenberg chuckled we oughta feed runyan to the indians the chief justice was john runyan a tough conservative appointed by a republican and hated by the indians and most other minorities seven of the nine had been appointed by republican presidents for fifteen years rosenberg had been waiting for a democrat in the white house he wanted to quit needed to quit but he could not stomach the idea of a rightwing runyan type taking his beloved seat he could wait he could sit here in his wheelchair and breathe oxygen and protect the indians the blacks the women the poor the handicapped and the environment until he was a hundred and five and not a single person in the world could do a damned thing about it unless they killed him and that wouldnt be such a bad idea either the great mans head nodded then wobbled and rested on his shoulder he was asleep again kline quietly stepped away and returned to his research in the library he would return in half an hour to check the oxygen and give abe his pills the office of the chief justice is on the main floor and is larger and more ornate than the other eight the outer office is used for small receptions and formal gatherings and the inner office is where the chief works the door to the inner office was closed and the room was filled with the chief his three law clerks the captain of the supreme court police three fbi agents and k o lewis deputy director fbi the mood was serious and a serious effort was under way to ignore the noise from the streets below it was difficult the chief and lewis discussed the latest series of death threats and everyone else just listened the clerks took notes in the past sixty days the bureau had logged over two hundred threats a new record there was the usual assortment of bomb the court threats but many came with specificslike names cases and issues runyan made no effort to hide his anxiety working from a confidential fbi summary he read the names of individuals and groups suspected of threats the klan the aryans the nazis the palestinians the black separatists the prolifers the homophobics even the ira everyone it seemed but the rotarians and the boy scouts a middle east group backed by the iranians had threatened blood on american soil in retaliation for the deaths of two justice ministers in tehran there was absolutely no evidence the murders were linked to the us a new domestic terrorist unit of recent fame known as the underground army had killed a federal trial judge in texas with a car bomb no arrests had been made but the ua claimed responsibility it was also the prime suspect in a dozen bombings of aclu offices but its work was very clean what about these puerto rican terrorists runyan asked without looking up lightweights were not worried k o lewis answered casually theyve been threatening for twenty years well maybe its time they did something the climate is right dont you think forget the puerto ricans chief runyan liked to be called chief not chief justice nor mr chief justice just chief theyre just threatening because everyone else is very funny the chief said without smiling very funny id hate for some group to be left out runyan threw the summary on his desk and rubbed his temples lets talk about security he closed his eyes k o lewis laid his copy of the summary on the chiefs desk well the director thinks we should place four agents with each justice at least for the next ninety days well use limousines with escorts to and from work and the supreme court police will provide backup and secure this building what about travel its not a good idea at least for now the director thinks the justices should remain in the dc area until the end of the year are you crazy is he crazy if i asked my brethren to follow that request they would all leave town tonight and travel for the next month thats absurd runyan frowned at his law clerks who shook their heads in disgust truly absurd lewis was unmoved this was expected as you wish just a suggestion a foolish suggestion the director did not expect your cooperation on that one he would however expect to be notified in advance of all travel plans so that we can arrange security you mean you plan to escort each justice each time he leaves the city yes chief thats our plan wont work these people are not accustomed to being babysat yes sir and theyre not accustomed to being stalked either were just trying to protect you and your honorable brethren sir of course no one says we have to do anything i think sir that you called us we can leave if you wish runyan rocked forward in his chair and attacked a paper clip prying the curves out of it and trying to make it perfectly straight what about around here lewis sighed and almost smiled were not worried about this building chief its an easy place to secure we dont expect trouble here then where lewis nodded at a window the noise was louder out there somewhere the streets are full of idiots and maniacs and zealots and they all hate us evidently listen chief were very concerned about justice rosenberg he still refuses to allow our men inside his home makes them sit in a car in the street all night he will allow his favorite supreme court officer whats his name ferguson to sit by the back door outside but only from pm to am no one gets in the house but justice rosenberg and his male nurse the place is not secure runyan picked his fingernails with the paper clip and smiled slightly to himself rosenbergs death by any means or method would be a relief no it would be a glorious occasion the chief would have to wear black and give a eulogy but behind locked doors he would chuckle with his law clerks runyan liked this thought what do you suggest he asked can you talk to him ive tried ive explained to him that he is probably the most hated man in america that millions of people curse him every day that most folks would like to see him dead that he receives four times the hate mail as the rest of us combined and that he would be a perfect and easy target for assassination lewis waited and told me to kiss his ass then fell asleep the law clerks giggled properly then the fbi agents realized humor was permitted and joined in for a quick laugh so what do we do asked lewis unamused you protect him as best you can put it in writing and dont worry about it he fears nothing including death and if hes not sweating it why should you the director is sweating so im sweating chief its very simple if one of you guys gets hurt the bureau looks bad the chief rocked quickly in his chair the racket from outside was unnerving this meeting had dragged on long enough forget rosenberg maybe hell die in his sleep im more concerned over jensen jensens a problem lewis said flipping pages i know hes a problem runyan said slowly hes an embarrassment now he thinks hes a liberal votes like rosenberg half the time next month hell be a white supremacist and support segregated schools then hell fall in love with the indians and want to give them montana its like having a retarded child hes being treated for depression you know i know i know he tells me about it im his father figure what drug prozac the chief dug under his fingernails what about that aerobics instructor he was seeing she still around not really chief i dont think he cares for women lewis was smug he knew more he glanced at one of his agents and confirmed this juicy little tidbit runyan ignored it didnt want to hear it is he cooperating of course not in many ways hes worse than rosenberg he allows us to escort him to his apartment building then makes us sit in the parking lot all night hes seven floors up remember we cant even sit in the lobby might upset his neighbors he says so we sit in the car there are ten ways in and out of the building and its impossible to protect him he likes to play hideandseek with us he sneaks around all the time so we never know if hes in the building or not at least with rosenberg we know where he is all night jensens impossible great if you cant follow him how could an assassin lewis hadnt thought of this he missed the humor the director is very concerned with justice jensens safety he doesnt receive that many threats number six on the list just a few less than you your honor oh so im in fifth place yes just behind justice manning hes cooperating by the way fully hes afraid of his shadow the chief said then hesitated i shouldnt have said that im sorry lewis ignored it in fact the cooperation has been reasonably good except for rosenberg and jensen justice stone bitches a lot but he listens to us he bitches at everyone so dont take it personally where do you suppose jensen sneaks off to lewis glanced at one of his agents we have no idea a large section of the mob suddenly came together in one unrestrained chorus and everyone on the streets seemed to join in the chief could not ignore it the windows vibrated he stood and called an end to this meeting justice glenn jensens office was on the second floor away from the streets and the noise it was a spacious room yet the smallest of the nine jensen was the youngest of the nine and he was lucky to have an office when nominated six years earlier at the age of fortytwo he was thought to be a strict constructionist with deep conservative beliefs much like the man who nominated him his senate confirmation had been a slugfest before the judiciary committee jensen performed poorly on sensitive issues he straddled the fence and got kicked from both sides the republicans were embarrassed the democrats smelled blood the president twisted arms until they broke and jensen was confirmed by one very reluctant vote but he made it for life in his six years he had pleased no one hurt deeply by his confirmation hearings he vowed to find compassion and rule with it this had angered republicans they felt betrayed especially when he discovered a latent passion for the rights of criminals with scarce ideological strain he quickly left the right moved to the center then to the left then with legal scholars scratching their little goatees jensen would bolt back to the right and join justice sloan in one of his obnoxious antiwomen dissents jensen was not fond of women he was neutral on prayer skeptical of free speech sympathetic to tax protestors indifferent to indians afraid of blacks tough on pornographers soft on criminals and fairly consistent in his protection of the environment and to the further dismay of the republicans who shed blood to get him confirmed jensen had shown a troubling sympathy for the rights of homosexuals at his request a nasty case called dumond had been assigned to him ronald dumond had lived with his male lover for eight years they were a happy couple totally devoted to each other and quite content to share lifes experiences they wanted to marry but ohio laws prohibited such a union then the lover caught aids and died a horrible death ronald knew exactly how to bury him but then the lovers family intervened and excluded ronald from the funeral and burial distraught ronald sued the family claiming emotional and psychological damage the case had bounced around the lower courts for six years and now had suddenly found itself sitting on jensens desk at issue was the rights of spouses of gays dumond had become a battle cry for gay activists the mere mention of dumond had caused street fights and jensen had the case the door to his smaller office was closed jensen and his three clerks sat around the conference table they had spent two hours on dumond and gone nowhere they were tired of arguing one clerk a liberal from cornell wanted a broad pronouncement granting sweeping rights to gay partners jensen wanted this too but was not ready to admit it the other two clerks were skeptical they knew as did jensen that a majority of five would be impossible talk turned to other matters the chiefs ticked off at you glenn said the clerk from duke they called him by his first name in chambers justice was such an awkward title glenn rubbed his eyes what else is new one of his clerks wanted me to know that the chief and the fbi are worried about your safety says youre not cooperating and the chiefs rather disturbed he wanted me to pass it along everything was passed along through the clerks network everything hes supposed to be worried thats his job he wants to assign two more fibbies as bodyguards and they want access to your apartment and the fbi wants to drive you to and from work and they want to restrict your travel ive already heard this yeah we know but the chiefs clerk said the chief wants us to prevail upon you to cooperate with the fbi so that they can save your life i see and so were just prevailing upon you thanks go back to the network and tell the chiefs clerk that you not only prevailed upon me but you raised all sorts of hell with me and that i appreciated all of your prevailing and hellraising but it went in one ear and out the other tell them glenn considers himself a big boy sure glenn youre not afraid are you not in the least homas callahan was one of tulanes more popular professors primarily because he refused to schedule classes before am he drank a lot as did most of his students and for him the first few hours of each morning were needed for sleep then resuscitation nine and ten oclock classes were abominations he was also popular because he was coolfaded jeans tweed jackets with wellworn elbow patches no socks no ties the liberalchicacademic look he was fortyfive but with dark hair and hornrimmed glasses he could pass for thirtyfive not that he gave a damn how old he looked he shaved once a week when it started itching and when the weather was cool which was seldom in new orleans he would grow a beard he had a history of closeness with female students he was also popular because he taught constitutional law a most unpopular course but a required one due to his sheer brilliance and coolness he actually made con law interesting no one else at tulane could do this no one wanted to really so the students fought to sit in con law under callahan at eleven three mornings a week eighty of them sat behind six elevated rows and whispered as callahan stood in front of his desk and cleaned his glasses it was exactly five after eleven still too early he thought who understands rosenbergs dissent in nash v new jersey all heads lowered and the room was silent must be a bad hangover his eyes were red when he started with rosenberg it usually meant a rough lecture no one volunteered nash callahan looked slowly methodically around the room and waited dead silence the doorknob clicked loudly and broke the tension the door opened quickly and an attractive young female in tight washed jeans and a cotton sweater slid elegantly through it and sort of glided along the wall to the third row where she deftly maneuvered between the crowded seats until she came to hers and sat down the guys on the fourth row watched in admiration the guys on the fifth row strained for a peek for two brutal years now one of the few pleasures of law school had been to watch as she graced the halls and rooms with her long legs and baggy sweaters there was a fabulous body in there somewhere they could tell but she was not one to flaunt it she was just one of the gang and adhered to the law school dress code of jeans and flannel shirts and old sweaters and oversized khakis what they wouldnt give for a black leather miniskirt she flashed a quick smile at the guy seated next to her and for a second callahan and his nash question were forgotten her dark red hair fell just to the shoulders she was that perfect little cheerleader with the perfect teeth and perfect hair that every boy fell in love with at least twice in high school and maybe at least once in law school callahan was ignoring this entry had she been a firstyear student and afraid of him he might have ripped into her and screamed a few times youre never late for court was the old standby law professors had beaten to death but callahan was not in a screaming mood and darby shaw was not afraid of him and for a split second he wondered if anyone knew he was sleeping with her probably not she had insisted on absolute secrecy has anyone read rosenbergs dissent in nash v new jersey suddenly he had the spotlight again and there was dead silence a raised hand could mean constant grilling for the next thirty minutes no volunteers the smokers on the back row fired up their cigarettes most of the eighty scribbled aimlessly on legal pads all heads were bowed it would be too obvious and risky to flip through the casebook and find nash too late for that any movement might attract attention someone was about to be nailed nash was not in the casebook it was one of a dozen minor cases callahan had hurriedly mentioned a week ago and now he was anxious to see if anyone had read it he was famous for this his final exam covered twelve hundred cases a thousand of which were not in the casebook the exam was a nightmare but he was really a sweetheart a soft grader and it was a rare dumbass who flunked the course he did not appear to be a sweetheart at this moment he looked around the room time for a victim how about it mr sallinger can you explain rosenbergs dissent instantly from the fourth row sallinger said no sir i see might that be because you havent read rosenbergs dissent it might yes sir callahan glared at him the red eyes made the arrogant scowl all the more menacing only sallinger saw it though since everyone else was glued to their legal pads and why not because i try not to read dissents especially rosenbergs stupid stupid stupid sallinger had opted to fight back but he had no ammo something against rosenberg mr sallinger callahan revered rosenberg worshiped him read books about the man and his opinions studied him even dined with him once sallinger fidgeted nervously oh no sir i just dont like dissents there was a bit of humor in sallingers responses but not a smile was cracked later over a beer he and his buddies would roar with laughter when it was told and retold about sallinger and his distaste for dissents especially rosenbergs but not now i see do you read majority opinions hesitation sallingers feeble attempt at sparring was about to cause humiliationyes sir lots of them great explain then if you will the majority opinion in nash v new jersey sallinger had never heard of nash but he would now remember it for the rest of his legal career i dont think ive read that one so you dont read dissents mr sallinger and now we learn that you also neglect majorities what do you read mr sallinger romance novels tabloids there was some extremely light laughter from behind the fourth row and it came from students who felt obligated to laugh but at the same time did not wish to call attention to themselves sallinger redfaced just stared at callahan why havent you read the case mr sallinger callahan demanded i dont know i uh just missed it i guess callahan took it well im not surprised i mentioned it last week last wednesday to be exact itll be on the final exam i dont understand why you would ignore a case that youll see on the final callahan was pacing now slowly in front of his desk staring at the students did anyone bother to read it silence callahan stared at the floor and allowed the silence to sink in all eyes were down all pens and pencils frozen smoke billowed from the back row finally slowly from the fourth seat on the third row darby shaw lifted her hand slightly and the class breathed a collective sigh of relief she had saved them again it was sort of expected of her number two in their class and within striking distance of number one she could recite the facts and holdings and concurrences and dissents and majority opinions to virtually every case callahan could spit at them she missed nothing the perfect little cheerleader had graduated magna cum laude with a degree in biology and planned to graduate magna cum laude with a degree in law and then make a nice living suing chemical companies for trashing the environment callahan stared at her in mock frustration she had left his apartment three hours earlier after a long night of wine and law but he had not mentioned nash to her well well ms shaw why is rosenberg upset he thinks the new jersey statute violates the second amendment she did not look at the professor thats good and for the benefit of the rest of the class what does the statute do outlaws semiautomatic machine guns among other things wonderful and just for fun what did mr nash possess at the time of his arrest an ak assault rifle and what happened to him he was convicted sentenced to three years and appealed she knew the details what was mr nashs occupation the opinion wasnt specific but there was mention of an additional charge of drug trafficking he had no criminal record at the time of his arrest so he was a dope pusher with an ak but he has a friend in rosenberg doesnt he of course she was watching him now the tension had eased most eyes followed him as he paced slowly looking around the room selecting another victim more often than not darby dominated these lectures and callahan wanted a broader participation why do you suppose rosenberg is sympathetic he asked the class he loves dope pushers it was sallinger wounded but trying to rally callahan placed a premium on class discussion he smiled at his prey as if to welcome him back to the bloodletting you think so mr sallinger sure dope pushers child fondlers gunrunners terrorists rosenberg greatly admires these people they are his weak and abused children so he must protect them sallinger was trying to appear righteously indignant and in your learned opinion mr sallinger what should be done with these people simple they should have a fair trial with a good lawyer then a fair speedy appeal then punished if they are guilty sallinger was perilously close to sounding like a lawandorder rightwinger a cardinal sin among tulane law students callahan folded his arms please continue sallinger smelled a trap but plowed ahead there was nothing to lose i mean weve read case after case where rosenberg has tried to rewrite the constitution to create a new loophole to exclude evidence to allow an obviously guilty defendant to go free its almost sickening he thinks all prisons are cruel and unusual places so therefore under the eighth amendment all prisoners should go free thankfully hes in the minority now a shrinking minority you like the direction of the court do you mr sallinger callahan was at once smiling and frowning damned right i do are you one of those normal redblooded patriotic middleoftheroad americans who wish the old bastard would die in his sleep there were a few chuckles around the room it was safer to laugh now sallinger knew better than to answer truthfully i wouldnt wish that on anyone he said almost embarrassed callahan was pacing again well thank you mr sallinger i always enjoy your comments you have as usual provided us with the laymans view of the law the laughter was much louder sallingers cheeks flushed and he sank in his seat callahan did not smile i would like to raise the intellectual level of this discussion okay now ms shaw why is rosenberg sympathetic to nash the second amendment grants the people the right to keep and bear arms to justice rosenberg it is literal and absolute nothing should be banned if nash wants to possess an ak or a hand grenade or a bazooka the state of new jersey cannot pass a law prohibiting it do you agree with him no and im not alone its an eighttoone decision no one followed him whats the rationale of the other eight its obvious really the states have compelling reasons to prohibit the sale and possession of certain types of arms the interests of the state of new jersey outweigh the second amendment rights of mr nash society cannot allow individuals to own sophisticated weaponry callahan watched her carefully attractive female law students were rare at tulane but when he found one he moved in quickly over the past eight years he had been quite successful easy work for the most part the women arrived at law school liberated and loose darby had been different he first spotted her in the library during the second semester of her first year and it took a month to get her to dinner who wrote the majority opinion he asked her runyan and you agree with him yes its an easy case really then what happened to rosenberg i think he hates the rest of the court so he dissents just for the hell of it often yes his opinions are becoming more indefensible take nash for a liberal like rosenberg the issue of gun control is easy he should have written the majority opinion and ten years ago he would have in fordice v oregon a case he took a much narrower interpretation of the second amendment his inconsistencies are almost embarrassing callahan had forgotten fordice are you suggesting justice rosenberg is senile much like a punchdrunk fighter sallinger waded in for the final round hes crazy as hell and you know it you cant defend his opinions not always mr sallinger but at least hes still there his bodys there but hes braindead hes breathing mr sallinger yeah breathing with a machine they have to pump oxygen up his nose but it counts mr sallinger hes the last of the great judicial activists and hes still breathing youd better call and check sallinger said as his words trailed off hed said enough no hed said too much he lowered his head as the professor glared at him he hunkered down next to his notebook and started wondering why hed said all that callahan stared him down then began pacing again it was indeed a bad hangover at least he looked like an old farmer with straw hat clean bib overalls neatly pressed khaki workshirt boots he chewed tobacco and spat in the black water beneath the pier he chewed like a farmer his pickup though of recent model was sufficiently weathered and had a dustyroad look about it north carolina plates it was a hundred yards away parked in the sand at the other end of the pier it was midnight monday the first monday in october and for the next thirty minutes he was to wait in the dark coolness of the deserted pier chewing pensively resting on the railing while staring intently at the sea he was alone as he knew he would be it was planned that way this pier at this hour was always deserted the headlights of an occasional car flickered along the shoreline but the headlights never stopped at this hour he watched the red and blue channel lights far from shore he checked his watch without moving his head the clouds were low and thick and it would be difficult to see it until it was almost to the pier it was planned this way the pickup was not from north carolina and neither was the farmer the license plates had been stolen from a wrecked truck at a scrap yard near durham the pickup had been stolen in baton rouge the farmer was not from anywhere and per formed none of the thievery he was a pro and so someone else did the dirty little deeds twenty minutes into the wait a dark object floated in the direction of the pier a quiet muffled engine hummed and grew louder the object became a small craft of some sort with a camouflaged silhouette crouching low and working the motor the farmer moved not an inch in anticipation the humming stopped and the black rubber raft stalled in the calm water thirty feet from the pier there were no headlights coming or going along the shore the farmer carefully placed a cigarette between his lips lit it puffed twice then thumped it down halfway to the raft what kind of cigarette the man on the water asked upward he could see the outline of the farmer on the railing but not the face lucky strike the farmer answered these passwords made for such a silly game how many other black rubber rafts could be expected to drift in from the atlantic and pinpoint this ancient pier at this precise hour silly but oh so important luke came the voice from the boat sam replied the farmer the name was khamel not sam but sam would do for the next five minutes until khamel parked his raft khamel did not answer was not required to but quickly started the engine and guided the raft along the edge of the pier to the beach luke followed from above they met at the pickup without a handshake khamel placed his black adidas gym bag between them on the seat and the truck started along the shoreline luke drove and khamel smoked and both did a perfect job of ignoring each other their eyes did not dare meet with khamels heavy beard dark glasses and black turtleneck his face was ominous but impossible to identify luke did not want to see it part of his assignment in addition to receiving this stranger from the sea was to refrain from looking at him it was easy really the face was wanted in nine countries across the bridge at manteo luke lit another lucky strike and determined they had met before it had been a brief but precisely timed meeting at the airport in rome five or six years earlier as best he could remember there had been no introductions it took place in a restroom luke then an impeccably tailored american executive had placed an eelskin attache case next to the wall next to the washbasin where he slowly rinsed his hands and suddenly it was gone he caught a glimpse of the manthis khamel he was now certainin the mirror thirty minutes later the attache case exploded between the legs of the british ambassador to nigeria in the guarded whispers of his invisible brotherhood luke had often heard of khamel a man of many names and faces and languages an assassin who struck quickly and left no trail a fastidious killer who roamed the world but could never be found as they rode north in the darkness luke settled low in his seat the brim of his hat almost on his nose limp wrist across the wheel trying to remember the stories hed heard about his passenger amazing feats of terror there was the british ambassador the ambush of seventeen israeli soldiers on the west bank in had been credited to khamel he was the only suspect in the carbomb murders of a wealthy german banker and his family his fee for that one was rumored to have been three million cash most intelligence experts believed he was the mastermind of the attempt to kill the pope but then khamel was blamed for almost every unsolved terrorist attack and assassination he was easy to blame because no one was certain he existed this excited luke khamel was about to perform on american soil the targets were unknown to luke but important blood was about to be shed at dawn the stolen farm truck stopped at the corner of thirtyfirst and m streets in georgetown khamel grabbed his gym bag said nothing and hit the sidewalk he walked east a few blocks to the four seasons hotel bought a post in the lobby and casually rode the elevator to the seventh floor at precisely sevenfifteen he knocked on a door at the end of the hall yes a nervous voice asked from inside looking for mr sneller khamel said slowly in a perfect generic american tongue as he stuck his thumb over the peephole mr sneller yes edwin f sneller the knob did not turn or click and the door did not open a few seconds passed and a white envelope eased from under the door khamel picked it up okay he said loud enough for sneller or whoever he was to hear its next door sneller said ill await your call he sounded like an american unlike luke hed never seen khamel and had no desire to really luke had seen him twice now and was indeed lucky to be alive khamels room had two beds and a small table near the window the shades were drawn tightly no chance of sunlight he placed his gym bag on one bed next to two thick briefcases he walked to the window and peeked out then to the phone its me he said to sneller tell me about the car its parked on the street plain white ford with connecticut plates the keys are on the table sneller spoke slowly stolen of course but sanitized its clean ill leave it at dulles shortly after midnight i want it destroyed okay the english was perfect those are my instructions yes sneller was proper and efficient its very important okay i intend to leave the gun in the car guns leave bullets and people see cars so its important to completely destroy the car and everything in it understand those are my instructions sneller repeated he did not appreciate this lecture he was no novice at the killing game khamel sat on the edge of the bed the four million was received a week ago a day late i should add im now in dc so i want the next three it will be wired before noon that was the agreement yes but im worried about the agreement you were a day late remember this irritated sneller and since the killer was in the next room and not about to come out he could sound a bit irritated the banks fault not ours this irritated khamel fine i want you and your bank to wire the next three million to the account in zurich as soon as new york opens that will be about two hours from now ill be checking okay okay and i want no problem when the job is finished ill be in paris in twentyfour hours and from there ill go straight to zurich i want all the money waiting for me when i arrive it will be there if the job is finished khamel smiled to himself the job will be finished mr sneller by midnight that is if your information is correct as of now it is correct and no changes are expected today our people are in the streets everything is in the two briefcases maps diagrams schedules the tools and articles you requested khamel glanced at the briefcases behind him he rubbed his eyes with his right hand i need a nap he mumbled into the phonei havent slept in twenty hours sneller could think of no response there was plenty of time and if khamel wanted a nap then khamel could have a nap they were paying him ten million would you like something to eat sneller asked awkwardly no call me in three hours at precisely tenthirty he placed the receiver on the phone and stretched across the bed the streets were clear and quiet for day two of the fall term the justices spent their day on the bench listening to lawyer after lawyer argue complex and quite dull cases rosenberg slept through most of it he came to life briefly when the attorney general from texas argued that a certain deathrow inmate should be given medication to make him lucid before being lethally injected if hes mentally ill how can he be executed rosenberg asked incredulously easy said the ag from texas his illness can be controlled with medication so just give him a little shot to make him sane then give him another shot to kill him it could all be very nice and constitutional rosenberg harangued and bitched for a brief spell then lost steam his little wheelchair sat much lower than the massive leather thrones of his brethren he looked rather pitiful in years past he was a tiger a ruthless intimidator who tied even the slickest lawyers in knots but no more he began to mumble and then faded away the ag sneered at him and continued during the last oral argument of the day a lifeless desegregation case from virginia rosenberg began snoring chief runyan glared down the bench and jason kline rosenbergs senior clerk took the hint he slowly pulled the wheelchair backward away from the bench and out of the courtroom he pushed it quickly through the back hallway the justice regained consciousness in his office took his pills and informed his clerks he wanted to go home kline notified the fbi and moments later rosenberg was wheeled into the rear of his van parked in the basement two fbi agents watched a male nurse frederic strapped the wheelchair in place and sergeant ferguson of the supreme court police slid behind the wheel of the van the justice allowed no fbi agents near him they could follow in their car and they could watch his townhouse from the street and they were lucky to get that close he didnt trust cops and he damned sure didnt trust fbi agents he didnt need protection on volta street in georgetown the van slowed and backed into a short driveway frederic the nurse and ferguson the cop gently rolled him inside the agents watched from the street in their black governmentissue dodge aries the lawn in front of the townhome was tiny and their car was a few feet from the front door it was almost pm after a few minutes ferguson made his mandatory exit and spoke to the agents after much debate rosenberg had acquiesced a week earlier and allowed ferguson to quietly inspect each room upstairs and down upon his arrival in the afternoons then ferguson had to leave but could return at exactly pm and sit outside the rear door until exactly am no one but ferguson could do it and he was tired of the overtime everythings fine he said to the agents i guess ill be back at ten is he still alive one of the agents asked standard question afraid so ferguson looked tired as he walked to the van frederic was chubby and weak but strength was not needed to handle his patient after arranging the pillows just so he lifted him from the wheelchair and placed him carefully on the sofa where he would remain motionless for the next two hours while dozing and watching cnn frederic fixed himself a ham sandwich and a plate of cookies and scanned a national enquirer at the kitchen table rosenberg mumbled something loudly and changed channels with the remote control at precisely seven his dinner of chicken bouillon boiled potatoes and stewed onions stroke food was placed neatly on the table and frederic rolled him up to it he insisted on feeding himself and it was not pretty frederic watched television he would clean up the mess later by nine he was bathed dressed in a gown and tucked tightly under the covers the bed was a narrow reclining pale green armyhospital job with a hard mattress pushbutton controls and collapsible rails that rosenberg insisted remain down it was in a room behind the kitchen that he had used as a small study for thirty years before the first stroke the room was now clinical and smelled of antiseptic and looming death next to his bed was a large table with a hospital lamp and at least twenty bottles of pills thick heavy law books were stacked in neat piles around the room next to the table the nurse sat close by in a worn recliner and began reading from a brief he would read until he heard snoringthe nightly ritual he read slowly yelling the words at rosenberg who was stiff motionless but listening the brief was from a case in which he would write the majority opinion he absorbed every word for a while after an hour of reading and yelling frederic was tired and the justice was drifting away he raised his hand slightly then closed his eyes with a button on the bed he lowered the lights the room was almost dark frederic jerked backward and the recliner unfolded he laid the brief on the floor and closed his eyes rosenberg was snoring he would not snore for long shortly after ten with the house dark and quiet the door to a bedroom closet upstairs opened slightly and khamel eased out his wristbands nylon cap and running shorts were royal blue his longsleeved shirt socks and reeboks were white with royal trim perfect color coordination khamel the jogger he was clean shaven and under the cap his very short hair was now blond almost white the bedroom was dark as was the hall the stairs creaked slightly under the reeboks he was fiveten and weighed less than a hundred and fifty pounds with no fat he kept himself taut and light so the movements would be quick and soundless the stairs landed in a foyer not far from the front door he knew there were two agents in a car by the curb probably not watching the house he knew ferguson had arrived seven minutes ago he could hear the snoring from the back room while waiting in the closet he had thought of striking earlier before ferguson arrived so he wouldnt have to kill him the killing was no problem but it created another body to worry about but he guessed wrongly that ferguson probably checked in with the male nurse when he came on duty if so then ferguson would find the carnage and khamel would lose a few hours so he waited until now he slid through the foyer without a sound in the kitchen a small light from the ventahood illuminated the countertop and made things a bit more dangerous khamel cursed himself for not checking the bulb and unscrewing it those small mistakes were inexcusable he dipped under a window looking into the backyard he could not see ferguson although he knew he was seventyfour inches tall sixtyone years old had cataracts and couldnt hit a barn with his magnum both of them were snoring khamel smiled to himself as he crouched in the doorway and quickly pulled the automatic and silencer from the ace bandage wrapped around his waist he screwed the fourinch tube onto the barrel and ducked into the room the nurse was sprawled deep in the recliner feet in the air hands dangling mouth open khamel placed the tip of the silencer an inch from his right temple and fired three times the hands flinched and the feet jerked but the eyes remained closed khamel quickly reached across to the wrinkled and pale head of justice abraham rosenberg and pumped three bullets into it the room had no windows he watched the bodies and listened for a full minute the nurses heels twitched a few times then stopped the bodies were still he wanted to kill ferguson inside it was eleven minutes after ten a good time for a neighbor to be out with the dog for one last time before bed he crept through the darkness to the rear door and spotted the cop strolling benignly along the wooden fence twenty feet away instinctively khamel opened the back door turned on the patio light and said ferguson loudly he left the door open and hid in a dark corner next to the refrigerator ferguson obediently lumbered across the small patio and into the kitchen this was not unusual frederic often called him in after his honor was asleep they would drink instant coffee and play gin rummy there was no coffee and frederic was not waiting khamel fired three bullets into the back of his head and he fell loudly on the kitchen table he turned out the patio light and unscrewed the silencer he would not need it again it and the pistol were stuffed into the ace bandage khamel peeked out the front window the dome light was on and the agents were reading he stepped over ferguson locked the back door and disappeared into the darkness of the small rear lawn he jumped two fences without a sound and found the street he began trotting khamel the jogger in the dark balcony of the montrose theatre glenn jensen sat by himself and watched the naked and quite active men on the screen below he ate popcorn from a large box and noticed nothing but the bodies he was dressed conservatively enough navy cardigan chinos loafers and wide sunglasses to hide his eyes and a suede fedora to cover his head he was blessed with a face that was easily forgotten and once camouflaged it could never be recognized especially in a deserted balcony of a nearempty gay porno house at midnight no earrings bandannas gold chains jewelry nothing to indicate he was in the market for a companion he wanted to be ignored it had become a challenge really this catandmouse game with the fbi and the rest of the world on this night they had dutifully stationed themselves in the parking lot outside his building another pair parked by the exit near the veranda in the rear and he allowed them all to sit for four and a half hours before he disguised himself and walked nonchalantly to the garage in the basement and drove away in a friends car the building had too many points of egress for the poor fibbies to monitor him he was sympathetic to a point but he had his life to live if the fibbies couldnt find him how could a killer the balcony was divided into three small sections with six rows each it was very dark the only light being the heavy blue stream from the projector behind broken seats and folded tables were piled along the outside aisles the velvet drapes along the walls were shredded and falling it was a marvelous place to hide he used to worry about getting caught in the months after his confirmation he was terrified he couldnt eat his popcorn and damned sure couldnt enjoy the movies he told himself that if he was caught or recognized or in some awful way exposed he would simply claim he was doing research for an obscenity case pending there was always one on the docket and maybe somehow this might be believed this excuse could work he told himself repeatedly and he grew bolder but one night in a theater caught fire and four people died their names were in the paper big story justice glenn jensen happened to be in the rest room when he heard the screams and smelled the smoke he rushed into the street and disappeared the dead were all found in the balcony he knew one of them he gave up movies for two months but then started back he needed more research he told himself and what if he got caught the appointment was for life the voters couldnt call him home he liked the montrose because on tuesdays the movies ran all night but there was never a crowd he liked the popcorn and draft beer cost fifty cents two old men in the center section groped and fondled each other jensen glanced at them occasionally but concentrated on the movie sad he thought to be seventy years old staring at death and dodging aids and banished to a dirty balcony to find happiness a fourth person soon joined them on the balcony he glanced at jensen and the two men locked together and he walked quietly with his draft beer and popcorn to the top row of the center section the projector room was directly behind him to his right and down three rows sat the justice in front of him the gray and mature lovers kissed and whispered and giggled oblivious to the world he was dressed appropriately tight jeans black silk shirt earring hornrimmed shades and the neatly trimmed hair and mustache of a regular gay khamel the homosexual he waited a few minutes then eased to his right and sat by the aisle no one noticed who would care where he sat at twelvetwenty the old men lost steam they stood arm in arm and tiptoed away still whispering and snickering jensen did not look at them he was engrossed in the movie a massive orgy on a yacht in the middle of a hurricane khamel moved like a cat across the narrow aisle to a seat three rows behind the justice he sipped the beer they were alone he waited for one minute and quickly moved down a row jensen was eight feet away as the hurricane intensified so did the orgy the roar of the wind and the screams of the partyers deafened the small theater khamel set the beer and popcorn on the floor and pulled a threefoot strand of yellow nylon ski rope from his waist he quickly wrapped the ends around both hands and stepped over the row of chairs in front of him his prey was breathing heavy the popcorn box was shaking the attack was quick and brutal khamel looped the rope just under the larynx and wrenched it violently he yanked the rope downward snapping the head over the back of the seat the neck broke cleanly he twisted the rope and tied it behind the neck he slid a sixinch steel rod through a loop in the knot and wound the tourniquet until the flesh tore and started to bleed it was over in ten seconds suddenly the hurricane was over and another orgy began in celebration jensen slumped in his seat his popcorn was scattered around his shoes khamel was not one to admire his handiwork he left the balcony walked casually through the racks of magazines and devices in the lobby then disappeared onto the sidewalk he drove the generic white ford with connecticut plates to dulles changed clothes in a rest room and waited on his flight to paris the first lady was on the west coast attending a series of fivethousanddollarsaplate breakfasts where the rich and pretentious gladly shucked out the money for cold eggs and cheap champagne and the chance to be seen and maybe photographed with the queen as she was known so the president was sleeping alone when the phone rang in the great tradition of american presidents he had in years past thought of keeping a mistress but now it seemed so nonrepublican besides he was old and tired he often slept alone when the queen was at the white house he was a heavy sleeper it rang twelve times before he heard it he grabbed it and stared at the clock fourthirty am he listened to the voice jumped to his feet and eight minutes later was in the oval office no shower no tie he stared at fletcher coal his chief of staff and sat properly behind his desk coal was smiling his perfect teeth and bald head were shining only thirtyseven he was the boy wonder who four years earlier had rescued a failing campaign and placed his boss in the white house he was a guileful manipulator and a nasty henchman who had cut and clawed his way through the inner circle until he was now second in command many viewed him as the real boss the mere mention of his name terrified lowly staffers what happened the president asked slowly coal paced in front of the presidents desk dont know much theyre both dead two fbi agents found rosenberg around am dead in bed his nurse and a supreme court policeman were also murdered all three shot in the head a very clean job while the fbi and dc police were investigating they got a call that jensen had been found dead in some queer club they found him a couple of hours ago voyles called me at four and i called you he and gminski should be here in a minute gminski the cia should be included at least for now the president folded his hands behind his head and stretched rosenberg is dead yes quite i suggest you address the nation in a couple of hours mabry is working on a rough draft ill finish it lets wait until daylight at least seven if not itll be too early and well lose much of our audience the press yes its out they filmed the ambulance crew rolling jensen into the morgue i didnt know he was gay not much doubt about it now this is the perfect crisis mr president think of it we didnt create it its not our fault no one can blame us and the nation will be shocked into some degree of solidarity its rally around the leader time its just great no downside the president sipped a cup of coffee and stared at the papers on his desk and ill get to restructure the court thats the best part itll be your legacy ive already called duvall at justice and instructed him to contact horton and begin a preliminary list of nominees horton gave a speech in omaha last night but hes flying in now i suggest we meet with him later this morning the president nodded with his customary approval of coals suggestions he allowed coal to sweat the details he had never been a detail man himself any suspects not yet i dont know really i told voyles that you would expect a briefing when he arrived i thought someone said the fbi was protecting the supreme court coal smiled wider and chuckled exactly the egg is on voyles face its quite embarrassing really great i want voyles to get his share of the blame take care of the press i want him humiliated then maybe we can run his ass off coal loved this thought he stopped pacing and scribbled a note on his legal pad a security guard knocked on the door then opened it directors voyles and gminski entered together the mood was suddenly somber as all four shook hands the two sat before the presidents desk as coal took his customary position standing near a window to the side of the president he hated voyles and gminski and they hated him coal thrived on hatred he had the presidents ear and that was all that mattered he would become quiet for a few minutes it was important to allow the president to take charge when others were present im very sorry youre here but thanks for coming the president said they nodded grimly and acknowledged this obvious lie what happened voyles spoke quickly and to the point he described the scene at rosenbergs home when the bodies were found at am each night sergeant ferguson routinely checked in with the agents sitting in the street when he didnt show they investigated the killings were very clean and professional he described what he knew about jensen broken neck strangulation found by another character in the balcony no one saw anything evidently voyles was not as gruff and blunt as usual it was a dark day for the bureau and he could feel the heat coming but hed survived five presidents and he could certainly outmaneuver this idiot the two are obviously related the president said staring at voyles maybe certainly looks that way but come on director in two hundred and twenty years weve assassinated four presidents two or three candidates a handful of civil rights leaders couple of governors but never a supreme court justice and now in one night within two hours two are assassinated and youre not convinced theyre related i didnt say that there must be a link somewhere its just that the methods were so different and so professional you must remember weve had thousands of threats against the court fine then who are your suspects no one crossexamined f denton voyles he glared at the president its too early for suspects were still gathering evidence howd the killer get into rosenbergs place no one knows we didnt watch him go in you understand evidently he was there for some time hiding in a closet or an attic maybe again we werent invited rosenberg refused to allow us into his home ferguson routinely inspected the place each afternoon when the justice arrived from work its still too early but weve found no evidence of the murderer none except three bodies well have ballistics and autopsies by late this afternoon i want to see them here as soon as you have them yes mr president i also want a short list of suspects by pm today is that clear certainly mr president and i would like a report on your security and where it broke down youre assuming it broke down we have two dead judges both of whom were being protected by the fbi i think the american people deserve to know what went wrong director yes it broke down do i report to you or the american people you report to me and then you call a press conference and report to the american people right are you afraid of the scrutiny director not one bit rosenberg and jensen are dead because they refused to cooperate with us they were very much aware of the danger yet they couldnt be bothered the other seven are cooperating and theyre still alive for the moment wed better check theyre dropping like flies the president smiled at coal who snickered and almost sneered at voyles coal decided it was time to speak director did you know jensen was hanging around such places he was a grown man with a lifetime appointment if he chose to dance naked on tables we couldnt stop him yes sir coal said politely but you didnt answer my question voyles breathed deeply and looked away yes we suspected he was a homosexual and we knew he liked certain movie houses we have neither the authority nor the desire mr coal to divulge such information i want those reports by this afternoon the president said voyles was watching a window listening but not responding the president looked at robert gminski director of the cia bob i want a straight answer gminski tightened and frowned yes sir what is it i want to know if these killings are in any way linked to any agency operation group whatever of the united states government come on are you serious mr president thats absurd gminski appeared to be shocked but the president coal even voyles knew anything was possible these days at the cia dead serious bob im serious too and i assure you we had nothing to do with it im shocked you would even think it ridiculous check it out bob i want to be damned certain rosenberg did not believe in national security he made thousands of enemies in intelligence just check it out okay okay okay and i want a report by five today sure okay but its a waste of time fletcher coal moved to the desk next to the presidenti suggest we meet here at five this afternoon gentlemen is that agreeable they both nodded and stood coal escorted them to the door without a word he closed it you handled it real well he said to the presidentvoyles knows hes vulnerable i smell blood well go to work on him with the press rosenberg is dead the president repeated to himself i just cant believe it ive got an idea for television coal was pacing again very much in chargewe need to cash in on the shock of it all you need to appear tired as if you were up all night handling the crisis right the entire nation will be watching waiting for you to give details and to reassure i think you should wear something warm and comforting a coat and tie at am may seem a bit rehearsed lets relax a little the president was listening intently a bathrobe not quite but how about a cardigan and slacks no tie white buttondown sort of the grandfather image you want me to address the nation in this hour of crisis in a sweater yes i like it a brown cardigan with a white shirt i dont know the image is good look chief the election is a year from next month this is our first crisis in ninety days and what a wonderful crisis it is the people need to see you in something different especially at seven in the morning you need to look casual downhome but in control itll be worth five maybe ten points in the ratings trust me chief i dont like sweaters just trust me i dont know darby shaw awoke in the early darkness with a touch of a hangover after fifteen months of law school her mind refused to rest for more than six hours she was often up before daybreak and for this reason she did not sleep well with callahan the sex was great but sleep was often a tugofwar with pillows and sheets pulled back and forth she watched the ceiling and listened to him snore occasionally in his scotchinduced coma the sheets were wrapped like ropes around his knees she had no cover but she was not cold october in new orleans is still muggy and warm the heavy air rose from dauphine street below across the small balcony outside the bedroom and through the open french doors it brought with it the first stream of morning light she stood in the doors and covered herself with his terrycloth robe the sun was rising but dauphine was dark daybreaks went unnoticed in the french quarter her mouth was dry downstairs in the kitchen darby brewed a pot of thick french market chicory the blue numbers on the microwave said it was now ten minutes before six for a light drinker life with callahan was a constant struggle her limit was three glasses of wine she had neither a law license nor a job and she could not afford to get drunk every night and sleep late and she weighed a hundred and twelve pounds and was determined to keep it there he had no limit she drank three glasses of ice water then poured a tall mug full of chicory she flipped on lights as she climbed the stairs and eased back into the bed she flicked the remote controls and suddenly there was the president sitting behind his desk looking somehow rather odd in a brown cardigan with no tie it was an nbc news special report thomas she slapped him on his shoulder no movement thomas wake up she pressed a button and the volume roared the president said good morning thomas she leaned toward the television callahan kicked at the sheets and sat up rubbing his eyes and trying to focus she handed him the coffee the president had tragic news his eyes were tired and he looked sad but the rich baritone exuded confidence he had notes but didnt use them he looked deep into the camera and explained to the american people the shocking events of last night what the hell callahan mumbled after announcing the deaths the president launched into a flowery obituary for abraham rosenberg a towering legend he called him it was a strain but the president kept a straight face while lauding the distinguished career of one of the most hated men in america callahan gaped at the television darby stared at it thats very touching she said she was frozen on the end of the bed he had been briefed by the fbi and cia he explained and they were assuming the killings were related he had ordered an immediate thorough investigation and those responsible would be brought to justice callahan sat upright and covered himself with the sheets he blinked his eyes and combed his wild hair with his fingers rosenberg murdered he mumbled glaring at the screen his foggy head had cleared immediately and the pain was there but he couldnt feel it check out the sweater darby said sipping the coffee staring at the orange face with heavy makeup and the brilliant silver hair plastered carefully in place he was a wonderfully handsome man with a soothing voice thus he had succeeded greatly in politics the wrinkles in his forehead squeezed to gether and he was even sadder now as he talked of his close friend justice glenn jensen the montrose theatre at midnight callahan repeated where is it she asked callahan had finished law school at georgetown not sure but i think its in the gay section was he gay ive heard rumors evidently they were both sitting on the end of the bed with the sheets over their legs the president was ordering a week of national mourning flags at halfstaff federal offices closed tomorrow funeral arrangements were incomplete he rambled for a few more minutes still deeply saddened even shocked very human but nonetheless the president and clearly in charge he signed off with his patented grandfathers smile of complete trust and wisdom and reassurance an nbc reporter on the white house lawn appeared and filled in the gaps the police were mute but there appeared to be no suspects at the moment and no leads yes both justices had been under the protection of the fbi which had no comment yes the montrose was a place frequented by homosexuals yes there had been many threats against both men especially rosenberg and there could be many suspects before it was all over callahan turned off the set and walked to the french doors where the early air was growing thicker no suspects he mumbled i can think of at least twenty darby said yeah but why the combination rosenberg is easy but why jensen why not mcdowell or yount both of whom are consistently more liberal than jensen it doesnt make sense callahan sat in a wicker chair by the doors and fluffed his hair ill get you some more coffee darby said no no im awake hows your head fine if i couldve slept for three more hours i think ill cancel class im not in the mood great damn i cant believe this that fool has two nominations that means eight of the nine will be republican choices they have to be confirmed first we wont recognize the constitution in ten years this is sick thats why they were killed thomas someone or some group wants a different court one with an absolute conservative majority the election is next year rosenberg is or was ninetyone manning is eightyfour yount is early eighties they could die soon or live ten more years a democrat may be elected president why take a chance kill them now a year before the election makes perfect sense if one was so inclined but why jensen he was an embarrassment and obviously he was an easier target yes but he was basically a moderate with an occasional leftward impulse and he was nominated by a republican you want a bloody mary good idea in a minute im trying to think darby reclined on the bed sipped the coffee and watched the sunlight filter across the balcony think of it thomas the timing is beautiful reelection nominations politics all that but think of the violence and the radicals the zealots the prolifers and gay haters the aryans and nazis think of all the groups capable of killing and all the threats against the court and the timing is perfect for an unknown inconspicuous group to knock them off its morbid but the timing is great and who is such a group who knows the underground army theyre not exactly inconspicuous they killed judge fernandez in texas dont they use bombs yeah experts with plastic explosives scratch them im not scratching anybody right now darby stood and retied the robe come on ill fix you a bloody mary only if you drink with me thomas youre a professor you can cancel your classes if you want to i am a student and i understand the relationship i cannot cut any more classes ill flunk you in con law if you dont cut classes and get drunk with me ive got a book of rosenberg opinions lets read them sip bloody marys then wine then whatever i miss him already i have federal procedure at nine and i cant miss it i intend to call the dean and have all classes canceled then will you drink with me no come on thomas he followed her down the stairs to the kitchen and the coffee and the liquor wthout removing the receiver from his shoulder fletcher coal punched another button on the phone on the desk in the oval office three lines were blinking holding he paced slowly in front of the desk and listened while scanning a twopage report from horton at justice he ignored the president who was crouched in front of the windows gripping his putter with gloved hands staring fiercely first at the yellow ball then slowly across the blue carpet to the brass putting cup ten feet away coal growled something into the receiver his words were unheard by the president who lightly tapped the ball and watched it roll precisely into the cup the cup clicked cleared itself and the ball rolled three feet to the side the president inched forward in his socks to the next ball and breathed downward at it it was an orange one he tapped it just so and it rolled straight into the cup eight in a row twentyseven out of thirty that was chief runyan coal said slamming the receiver down hes quite upset he wanted to meet with you this afternoon tell him to take a number i told him to be here at ten tomorrow morning you have the cabinet at tenthirty and national security at eleventhirty without looking up the president gripped the putter and studied the next ball i cant wait what about the polls he swung carefully and followed the ball i just talked to nellson he ran two beginning at noon the computer is digesting it now but he thinks the approval rating will be somewhere around fiftytwo or fiftythree the golfer looked up briefly and smiled then returned to his gamewhat was it last week fortyfour it was the cardigan without the tie just like i said i thought it was fortyfive he said as he tapped a yellow one and watched it roll perfectly into the cup youre right fortyfive thats the highest in eleven months we havent been above fifty since flight in november of last year this is a wonderful crisis chief the people are shocked yet many of them are happy rosenberg is gone and youre the man in the middle just wonderful coal punched a blinking button and picked up the receiver he slammed it down without a word he straightened his tie and buttoned his jacket its fivethirty chief voyles and gminski are waiting he putted and watched the ball it was an inch to the right and he grimaced let them wait lets do a press conference at nine in the morning ill take voyles with me but ill keep his mouth shut make him stand behind me ill give some more details and answer a few questions networksll carry it live dont you think of course good idea ill get it started he picked off his gloves and threw them in a corner show them in he carefully leaned his putter against the wall and slid into his bally loafers as usual he had changed clothes six times since breakfast and now wore a glen plaid doublebreasted suit with a red and navy polkadot tie office attire the jacket hung on a rack by the door he sat at his desk and scowled at some papers he nodded at voyles and gminski but neither stood nor offered to shake hands they sat across the desk and coal took his usual standing position like a sentry who couldnt wait to fire the president pinched the bridge of his nose as if the stress of the day had delivered a migraine its been a long day mr president bob gminski said to break the ice voyles looked at the windows coal nodded and the president said yes bob a very long day and i have a bunch of ethiopians invited for dinner tonight so lets be brief lets start with you bob who killed them i do not know mr president but i assure you we had nothing to do with it do you promise me bob he was almost prayerful gminski raised his right hand with the palm facing the desk i swear on my mothers grave i swear coal nodded smugly as if he believed him and as if his approval meant everything the president glared at voyles whose stocky figure filled the chair and was still draped with a bulky trench coat the director chewed his gum slowly and sneered at the president ballistics autopsies got em voyles said as he opened his briefcase just tell me ill read it later the gun was smallcaliber probably a pointblank range for rosenberg and his nurse powder burns indicate hard to tell for ferguson but the shots were fired from no farther than twelve inches away we didnt see the shooting you understand three bullets into each head they picked two out of rosenberg found another in his pillow looks like he and the nurse were asleep same type slugs same gun same gunman evidently complete autopsy summaries are being prepared but there were no surprises causes of deaths are quite obvious fingerprints none were still looking but it was a very clean job appears as if he left nothing but the slugs and the bodies howd he get into the house no apparent signs of entry ferguson searched the place when rosenberg arrived around four routine procedure he filed his written report two hours later and it says he inspected two bedrooms a bath and three closets upstairs and each room downstairs and of course found nothing says he checked all windows and doors pursuant to rosenbergs instructions our agents were outside and they estimate fergusons four oclock inspection took from three to four minutes i suspect the killer was waiting and hiding when the justice returned and ferguson walked through why coal insisted voyles red eyes watched the president and ignored his hatchet man this man is obviously very talented he killed a supreme court justice maybe two and left virtually no trail a professional assassin i would guess entry would not be a problem for him eluding a cursory inspection by ferguson would be no problem for him hes probably very patient he wouldnt risk an entry when the house was occupied and cops around i think he entered sometime in the afternoon and simply waited probably in a closet upstairs or perhaps in the attic we found two small pieces of attic insulation on the floor under the retractable stairs suggests they had recently been used really doesnt matter where he was hiding the president said he wasnt discovered thats correct we were not allowed to inspect the house you understand i understand hes dead what about jensen hes dead too broken neck strangled with a piece of yellow nylon rope that can be found in any hardware store the medical examiners doubt the broken neck killed him theyre reasonably confident the rope did no fingerprints no witnesses this is not the sort of place where witnesses come rushing forward so i dont expect to find any time of death was around twelvethirty this morning the killings were two hours apart the president scribbled notes when did jensen leave his apartment dont know were relegated to the parking lot remember we followed him home around pm then watched the building for seven hours until we found out hed been strangled in a queer joint we were following his demands of course he sneaked out of the building in a friends car found it two blocks from the joint coal took two steps forward with his hands clasped rigidly behind him director do you think one assassin did both jobs who in hell knows the bodies are still warm give us a break theres precious little evidence right now with no witnesses no prints no screwups itll take time to piece this thing together could be the same man i dont know its too early surely you have a gut feeling the president said voyles paused and glanced at the windows could be the same guy but he must be superman probably two or three but regardless they had to have a lot of help someone fed them a lot of information such as such as how often jensen goes to the movies where does he sit what time does he get there does he go by himself does he meet a friend information we didnt have obviously take rosenberg someone had to know his little house had no security system that our boys were kept outside that ferguson arrived at ten and left at six and had to sit in the backyard that you knew all this the president interrupted of course we did but i assure you we didnt share it with anyone the president shot a quick conspiratorial glance at coal who was scratching his chin deep in thought voyles shifted his rather wide rear and gave gminski a smile as if to say lets play along with them youre suggesting a conspiracy coal said intelligently with deep eyebrows im not suggesting a damned thing i am proclaiming to you mr coal and to you mr president that yes in fact a large number of people conspired to kill them there may be only one or two killers but they had a lot of help it was too quick and clean and well organized coal seemed satisfied he stood straight and again clasped his hands behind him then who are the conspirators the president asked who are your suspects voyles breathed deeply and seemed to settle in his chair he closed the briefcase and laid it at his feet we dont have a prime suspect at the moment just a few good possibilities and this must be kept very quiet coal sprang a step closer of course its confidential he snappedyoure in the oval office and ive been here many times before in fact i was here when you were running around in dirty diapers mr coal things have a way of leaking out i think youve had leaks yourself coal said the president raised his hand its confidential denton you have my word coal retreated a step voyles watched the presidentcourt opened monday as you know and the maniacs have been in town for a few days for the past two weeks weve been monitoring various movements we know of at least eleven members of the underground army whove been in the dc area for a week we questioned a couple today and released them we know the group has the capability and the desire its our strongest possibility for now could change tomorrow coal was not impressed the underground army was on everyones list ive heard of them the president said stupidly oh yes theyre becoming quite popular we believe they killed a trial judge in texas cant prove it though theyre very proficient with explosives we suspect them in at least a hundred bombings of abortion clinics aclu offices porno houses gay clubs all over the country theyre just the people who would hate rosenberg and jensen other suspects coal asked theres an aryan group called white resistance that weve been watching for two years it operates out of idaho and oregon the leader gave a speech in west virginia last week and has been in the area for a few days he was spotted monday in the demonstration outside the supreme court well try to talk to him tomorrow but are these people professional assassins coal asked they dont advertise you understand i doubt if any group performed the actual killings they just hired the assassins and provided the legwork so whore the assassins the president asked we may never know frankly the president stood and stretched his legs another hard day at the office he smiled down at voyles across the desk you have a difficult task it was the grandfathers voice filled with warmth and understanding i dont envy you if possible i would like a twopage typewritten doublespaced report by pm each day seven days a week on the progress of the investigation if something breaks i expect you to call me immediately voyles nodded but did not speak im having a press conference in the morning at nine i would like for you to be here voyles nodded but did not speak seconds passed and no one spoke voyles stood noisily and tied the strap around the trench coat oh well well be going youve got the ethiopians and all he handed the ballistics and autopsy reports to coal knowing the president would never read them thanks for coming gentlemen the president said warmly coal closed the door behind them and the president grabbed the putter im not eating with the ethiopians he said staring at the carpet and a yellow ball i know it ive already sent your apologies this is a great hour of crisis mr president and you are expected to be here in this office surrounded by your advisers hard at work he putted and the ball rolled perfectly into the cup i want to talk to horton these nominations must be perfect hes sent a short list of ten looks pretty good i want young conservative white men opposed to abortion pornography queers gun control racial quotas all that crap he missed a putt and kicked off his loafers i want judges who hate dope and criminals and are enthusiastic about the death penalty understand coal was on the phone punching numbers and nodding at his boss he would select the nominees then convince the president k o lewis sat with the director in the back of the quiet limousine as it left the white house and crawled through rushhour traffic voyles had nothing to say so far in the early hours of the tragedy the press had been brutal the buzzards were circling no less than three congressional subcommittees had already announced hearings and investigations into the deaths and the bodies were still warm the politicians were giddy and wrestling for the spotlight one outrageous statement fueled another senator larkin from ohio hated voyles and voyles hated senator larkin from ohio and the senator had called a press conference three hours earlier and announced his subcommittee would immediately begin investigating the fbis protection of the two dead justices but larkin had a girlfriend a rather young one and the fbi had some photographs and voyles was confident the investigation could be delayed hows the president lewis finally asked which one not coal the other one swell just swell hes awfully tore up about rosenberg though i bet they rode in silence in the direction of the hoover building it would be a long night weve got a new suspect lewis finally said do tell a man named nelson muncie voyles slowly shook his head never heard of him neither have i its a long story gimme the short version muncie is a very wealthy industrialist from florida sixteen years ago his niece was raped and murdered by an afroamerican named buck tyrone the little girl was twelve very very brutal rape and murder ill spare you the details muncie has no children and idolized his niece tyrone was tried in orlando and given the death penalty he was guarded heavily because there were a bunch of threats some jewish lawyers in a big new york firm filed all sorts of appeals and in the case arrives at the supreme court you guessed it rosenberg falls in love with tyrone and concocts this ridiculous fifth amendment selfincrimination argument to exclude a confession the punk gave a week after he was arrested an eightpage confession that he tyrone wrote himself no confession no case rosenberg writes a convoluted fivetofour opinion overturning the conviction an extremely controversial decision tyrone goes free then two years later he disappears and has not been seen since rumor has it muncie paid to have tyrone castrated mutilated and fed to the sharks just a rumor say the florida authorities then in tyrones main lawyer on the case man named kaplan is gunned down by an apparent mugger outside his apartment in manhattan what a coincidence who tipped you florida called two hours ago theyre convinced muncie paid a bunch of money to eliminate both tyrone and his lawyer they just cant prove it theyve got a reluctant unidentified informant who says he knows muncie and feeds them a little info he says muncie has been talking for years about eliminating rosenberg they think he went a little over the edge when his niece was murdered how much money has he got enough millions no one is sure hes very secretive florida is convinced hes capable lets check it out sounds interesting ill get on it tonight are you sure you want three hundred agents on this case voyles lit a cigar and cracked his window yeah maybe four hundred we need to crack this baby before the press eats us alive it wont be easy except for the slugs and the rope these guys left nothing voyles blew smoke out the window i know its almost too clean he chief slouched behind his desk with a loosened tie and a haggard look around the room three of his brethren and a halfdozen clerks sat and talked in subdued tones the shock and fatigue were evident jason kline rosenbergs senior clerk looked especially hardhit he sat on a small sofa and stared blankly at the floor while justice archibald manning now the senior justice talked of protocol and funerals jensens mother wanted a small private episcopal service friday in providence rosenbergs son a lawyer had delivered to runyan a list of instructions the justice had prepared after his second stroke in which he wanted to be cremated after a nonmilitary ceremony and his ashes dropped over the sioux indian reservation in south dakota though rosenberg was jewish he had abandoned the religion and claimed to be agnostic he wanted to be buried with the indians runyan thought that was appropriate but did not say so in the outer office six fbi agents sipped coffee and whispered nervously there had been more threats during the day several coming within hours of the presidents early morning address it was dark now almost time to escort the remaining justices home each had four agents as bodyguards justice andrew mcdowell at sixtyone now the youngest member of the court stood in the window smoking his pipe and watching traffic if jensen had a friend on the court it was mcdowell fletcher coal had informed runyan that the president would not only attend jensens service but wanted to deliver a eulogy no one in the inner office wanted the president to say a word the chief had asked mcdowell to prepare a few words a shy man who avoided speeches mcdowell twirled his bow tie and tried to picture his friend in the balcony with a rope around his neck it was too awful to think about a justice of the supreme court one of his distinguished brethren one of the nine hiding in such a place watching those movies and being exposed in such a ghastly manner what a tragic embarrassment he thought of himself standing before the crowd in the church and looking at jensens mother and family and knowing that every thought would be on the montrose theatre they would ask each other in whispered voices did you know he was gay mcdowell for one did not know nor did he suspect nor did he want to say anything at the funeral justice ben thurow age sixtyeight was not as concerned about burying the dead as he was about catching the killers he had been a federal prosecutor in minnesota and his theory grouped the suspects into two classes those acting out of hatred and revenge and those seeking to affect future decisions he had instructed his clerks to begin the research thurow was pacing around the room we have twentyseven clerks and seven justices he said to the group but to no one in particular its obvious we wont get much work done for the next couple of weeks and all close decisions must wait until we have a full bench that could take months i suggest we put our clerks to work trying to solve the killings were not police manning said patiently can we at least wait until after the burials before we start playing dick tracy mcdowell said without turning from the window thurow ignored them as usual ill direct the research loan me your clerks for two weeks and i think we can put together a short list of solid suspects the fbi is very capable ben the chief said they havent asked for our help id rather not discuss the fbi thurow said we can mope around here in official mourning for two weeks or we can go to work and find these bastards what makes you so sure you can solve this manning asked im not sure i can but i think its worth a try our brethren were murdered for a reason and that reason is directly related to a case or an issue already decided or now pending before this court if its retribution then our task is almost impossible hell everybody hates us for one reason or another but if its not revenge or hatred then perhaps someone wanted a different court for a future decision thats whats intriguing who would kill abe and glenn because of how they might vote on a case this year next year or five years from now i want the clerks to pull up every case now pending in the eleven circuits below justice mcdowell shook his head come on ben thats over five thousand cases a small fraction of which will eventually end up here its a wildgoose chase manning was equally unimpressed listen fellas i served with abe rosenberg for thirtyone years and i often thought of shooting him myself but i loved him like a brother his liberal ideas were accepted in the sixties and seventies but grew old in the eighties and are now resented in the nineties he became a symbol for everything thats wrong in this country he has been killed i believe by one of these radical rightwing hate groups and we can research cases till hell freezes over and not find anything its retribution ben pure and simple and glenn thurow asked evidently our friend had some strange proclivities word must have spread and he was an easy target for such groups they hate homosexuals ben ben was still pacing still ignoring they hate all of us and if they killed out of hatred the copsll catch them maybe but what if they killed to manipulate this court what if some group seized this moment of unrest and violence to eliminate two of us and thus realign the court i think its very possible the chief cleared his throat and i think well do nothing until after they are buried or scattered im not saying no ben just wait a few days let the dust settle the rest of us are still in shock thurow excused himself and left the room his bodyguards followed him down the hall justice manning stood with his cane and addressed the chief i will not make it to providence i hate flying and i hate funerals ill be having one myself before long and i do not enjoy the reminder ill send my sympathies to the family when you see them please apologize for me im a very old man he left with a clerk i think justice thurow has a point said jason kline we at least need to review the pending cases and those likely to arrive here from the lower circuits its a long shot but we may stumble across something i agree said the chief its just a bit premature dont you think yes but id like to get started anyway no wait till monday and ill assign you to thurow kline shrugged and excused himself two clerks followed him to rosenbergs office where they sat in the darkness and sipped the last of abes brandy in a cluttered study carrel on the fifth level of the law library between the racks of thick seldomused law books darby shaw scanned a printout of the supreme courts docket she had been through it twice and though it was loaded with controversy she found nothing that interested her dumond was causing riots there was a child pornography case from new jersey a sodomy case from kentucky a dozen death penalty appeals a dozen assorted civil rights cases and the usual array of tax zoning indian and antitrust cases from the computer she had pulled summaries of each then reviewed them twice she compiled a neat list of possible suspects but they would be obvious to everyone the list was now in the garbage callahan was certain it was the aryans or the nazis or the klan some easily identifiable collection of domestic terrorists some radical band of vigilantes it had to be rightwingers that much was obvious he felt darby was not so sure the hate groups were too obvious they had made too many threats thrown too many rocks held too many parades made too many speeches they needed rosenberg alive because he was such an irresistible target for their hatred rosenberg kept them in business she thought it was somebody much more sinister he was sitting in a bar on canal street drunk by now waiting on her though she had not promised to join him she had checked on him at lunch and found him on the balcony upstairs drunk and reading his book of rosenberg opinions he had decided to cancel con law for a week said he might not be able to teach it anymore now that his hero was dead she told him to sober up and she left a few minutes after ten she walked to the computer room on the fourth level of the library and sat before a monitor the room was empty she pecked away at the keyboard found what she wanted and soon the printer was spewing forth page after page of appeals pending in the eleven federal appellate courts around the country an hour later the printer stopped and she now possessed a sixinchthick summary of the eleven dockets she hauled it back to her study carrel and placed it in the center of the cluttered desk it was after eleven and the fifth level was deserted a narrow window gave an uninspiring view of a parking lot and trees below she kicked off her shoes again and inspected the red paint on the toes she sipped a warm fresca and stared blankly at the parking lot the first assumption was easythe killings were done by the same group for the same reasons if not then the search was hopeless the second assumption was difficultthe motive was not hatred or revenge but rather manipulation there was a case or an issue out there on its way to the supreme court and someone wanted different justices the third assumption was a bit easierthe case or issue involved a great deal of money the answer would not be found in the printout sitting before her she flipped through it until midnight and left when the library closed at noon thursday a secretary carried a large sack decorated with grease spots and filled with deli sandwiches and onion rings into a humid conference room on the fifth floor of the hoover building in the center of the square room a mahogany table with twenty chairs along each side was surrounded with the top fbi people from across the country all ties were loosened and sleeves rolled up a thin cloud of blue smoke hung around the cheap government chandelier five feet above the table director voyles was talking tired and angry he puffed on his fourth cigar of the morning and walked slowly in front of the screen at his end of the table half the men were listening the other half had pulled reports from the pile in the center of the table and read about the autopsies the lab report on the nylon rope nelson muncie and a few other quickly researched subjects the reports were quite thin listening carefully and reading intently was special agent eric east only a tenyear man but a brilliant investigator six hours earlier voyles had picked him to lead the investigation the rest of the team had been selected throughout the morning and this was the organizational meeting east was listening and hearing what he already knew the investigation could take weeks probably months other than the slugs nine of them the rope and the steel rod used in the tourniquet there was no evidence the neighbors in georgetown had seen nothing no exceptionally suspicious characters at the montrose no prints no fibers nothing it takes remarkable talent to kill so cleanly and it takes a lot of money to hire such talent voyles was pessimistic about finding the gunmen they must concentrate on whoever hired them voyles was talking and puffing theres a memo on the table regarding one nelson muncie a millionaire from jacksonville florida whos allegedly made threats against rosenberg the florida authorities are convinced muncie paid a bunch of money to have the rapist and his lawyer killed the memo covers it two of our men talked with muncies lawyer this morning and were met with great hostility muncie is out of the country according to his lawyer and of course he has no idea when he will return ive assigned twenty men to investigate him voyles relit his cigar and looked at a sheet of paper on the table number four is a group called white resistance a small group of middleaged commandos weve been watching for about three years youve got a memo pretty weak suspect really theyd rather throw firebombs and burn crosses not a lot of finesse and most importantly not much money i doubt seriously if they could hire guns as slick as these but ive assigned twenty men anyway east unwrapped a heavy sandwich sniffed it but decided to leave it alone the onion rings were cold his appetite had vanished he listened and made notes number six on the list was a bit unusual a psycho named clinton lane had declared war on homosexuals his only son had moved from their family farm in iowa to san francisco to enjoy the gay life but had quickly died of aids lane cracked up and burned the gay coalition office in des moines caught and sentenced to four years he escaped in and had not been found according to the memo he had set up an extensive cokesmuggling operation and made millions and he used the money in his own little private war against gays and lesbians the fbi had been trying to catch him for five years but it was believed he operated out of mexico for years he had written hate mail to the congress the supreme court the president voyles was not impressed with lane as a suspect he was a nut who was way out in left field but no stone would go unturned he assigned only six agents the list had ten names between six and twenty of the best special agents were assigned to each suspect a leader was chosen for each unit they were to report twice daily to east who would meet each morning and each afternoon with the director a hundred or so more agents would scour the streets and countryside for clues voyles talked of secrecy the press would follow like bloodhounds so the investigation must be extremely confidential only he the director would speak to the press and he would have precious little to say he sat down and k o lewis delivered a rambling monologue about the funerals and security and a request from chief runyan to assist in the investigation eric east sipped cold coffee and stared at the list in thirtyfour years abraham rosenberg wrote no fewer than twelve hundred opinions his production was a constant source of amazement to constitutional scholars he occasionally ignored the dull antitrust cases and tax appeals but if the issue showed the barest hint of real controversy he waded in with both fists he wrote majority opinions concurrences to majorities concurrences to dissents and many many dissents often he dissented alone every hot issue in thirtyfour years had received an opinion of some sort from rosenberg the scholars and critics loved him they published books and essays and critiques about him and his work darby found five separate hardback compilations of his opinions with editorial notes and annotations one book contained nothing but his great dissents she skipped class thursday and secluded herself in the study carrel on the fifth level of the library the computer printouts were scattered neatly on the floor the rosenberg books were open and marked and stacked on top of each other there was a reason for the killings revenge and hatred would be acceptable for rosenberg alone but add jensen to the equation and revenge and hatred made less sense sure he was hateable but he had not aroused passions like yount or even manning she found no books of critical thought on the writings of justice glenn jensen in six years he had authored only twentyeight majority opinions the lowest production on the court he had written a few dissents and joined a few concurrences but he was a painfully slow worker at times his writing was clear and lucid at times disjointed and pathetic she studied jensens opinions his ideology swung radically from year to year he was generally consistent in his protection of the rights of criminal defendants but there were enough exceptions to astound any scholar in seven attempts he had voted with the indians five times he had written three majority opinions strongly protective of the environment he was near perfect in support of tax protestors but there were no clues jensen was too erratic to take seriously compared to the other eight he was harmless she finished another warm fresca and put away for the moment her notes on jensen her watch was hidden in a drawer she had no idea what time it was callahan had sobered up and wanted a late dinner at mr bs in the quarter she needed to call him dick mabry the current speechwriter and word wizard sat in a chair beside the presidents desk and watched as fletcher coal and the president read the third draft of a proposed eulogy for justice jensen coal had rejected the first two and mabry was still uncertain about what they wanted coal would suggest one thing the president wanted something else earlier in the day coal had called and said to forget the eulogy because the president would not attend the funeral then the president had called and asked him to prepare a few words because jensen was a friend and even though he was a queer he was still a friend mabry knew jensen was not a friend but he was a freshly assassinated justice who would enjoy a highly visible funeral then coal had called and said they werent sure if the president was going but work up something just in case mabrys office was in the old executive office building next door to the white house and during the day small bets had been placed on whether the president would attend the funeral of a known homosexual the office odds were three to one that he would not much better dick coal said folding the paper i like it too the president said mabry had noticed that the president usually waited for coal to express approval or displeasure over his words i can try again mabry said standing no no coal insisted this has the right touch very poignant i like it he walked mabry to the door and closed it behind him what do you think the president asked lets call it off im getting bad vibes publicity would be great but youd be speaking these beautiful words over a body found in a gay porno house too risky yeah i think youre this is our crisis chief the ratings continue to improve and i just dont want to take a chance should we send someone of course what about the vice president where is he flying in from guatemala hell be in tonight coal suddenly smiled to himself this is great vp stuff you know a gay funeral the president chuckled perfect coal stopped smiling and began pacing in front of the desk slight problem rosenbergs service is saturday only eight blocks from here id rather go to hell for a day i know but your absence would be very conspicuous i could check into walter reed with back spasms it worked before no chief reelection is next year you must stay away from hospitals the president slapped both hands on his desk and stood dammit fletcher i cant go to his service because i cant keep from smiling he was hated by ninety percent of the american people theyll love me if i dont go protocol chief good taste youll be burned by the press if you dont go look it wont hurt okay you dont have to say a word just ease in and out look real sad and allow the cameras to get a good look wont take an hour the president was gripping his putter and crouching over an orange ball then ill have to go to jensens exactly but forget the eulogy he putted i met him only twice you know i know lets quietly attend both services say nothing then disappear he putted again i think youre right thomas callahan slept late and alone he had gone to bed early and sober and alone for the third day in a row he had canceled classes it was friday and rosenbergs service was tomorrow and out of respect for his idol he would not teach con law until the man was properly put to rest he fixed coffee and sat on the balcony in his robe the temperature was in the sixties the first cold snap of the fall and dauphine street below bustled with brisk energy he nodded to the old woman without a name on the balcony across the street bourbon was a block away and the tourists were already out with their little maps and cameras dawn went unnoticed in the quarter but by ten the narrow streets were busy with delivery trucks and cabs on these late mornings and they were many in number callahan cherished his freedom he was twenty years out of law school and most of his contemporaries were strapped into seventyhour weeks in pressurized law factories he had lasted two years in private practice a behemoth in bc with two hundred lawyers hired him fresh out of georgetown and stuck him in a cubbyhole office writing briefs for the first six months then he was placed on an assembly line answering interrogatories about luds twelve hours a day and expected to bill sixteen he was told that if he could cram the next twenty years into the next ten he just might make partner at the weary age of thirtyfive callahan wanted to live past fifty so he retired from the boredom of private law he earned a masters in law and became a professor he slept late worked five hours a day wrote an occasional article and for the most part enjoyed himself immensely with no family to support his salary of seventy thousand a year was more than sufficient to pay for his twostory bungalow his porsche and his liquor if death came early it would be from whiskey and not work he had sacrificed many of his pals from law school were partners in the big firms with fancy letterheads and halfmilliondollar earnings they rubbed shoulders with ceos from ibm and texaco and state farm they powerschmoozed with senators they had offices in tokyo and london but he did not envy them one of his best friends from law school was gavin verheek another dropout from private practice who had gone to work for the government he first worked in the civil rights division at justice then transferred to the fbi he was now special counsel to the director callahan was due in washington monday for a conference of con law professors he and verheek planned to eat and get drunk monday night he needed to call and confirm their eating and drinking and to pick his brain he dialed the number from memory the call was routed then rerouted and after five minutes of asking for gavin verheek the man was on the phone make it quick verheek said so nice to hear your voice callahan said how are you thomas its tenthirty im not dressed im sitting here in the french quarter sipping coffee and watching pedestrians on dauphine whatre you doing what a life here its eleventhirty and i havent left the office since they found

and shes not invited maybe later maybe gotta run pal i meet with the director in thirty minutes the tension is so thick around here you can smell it callahan punched the number for the law school library and asked if darby shaw had been seen she had not darby parked in the nearempty lot of the federal building in lafayette and entered the clerks office on the first floor it was noon friday court was not in session and the hallways were deserted she stopped at the counter and looked through an open window and waited a deputy clerk late for lunch and with an attitude walked to the window can i help you she asked in the tone of a lowly civil servant who wanted to do anything but help darby slid a strip of paper through the window i would like to see this file the clerk took a quick glance at the name of the case and looked at darby why she asked i dont have to explain its public record isnt it semipublic darby took the strip of paper and folded it are you familiar with the freedom of information act are you a lawyer i dont have to be a lawyer to look at this file the clerk opened a drawer in the counter and took out a key ring she nodded pointing with her forehead follow me the sign on the door said jury room but inside there were no tables or chairs only file cabinets and boxes lining the walls darby looked around the room the clerk pointed to a wall thats it on this wall the rest of the room is other junk this first file cabinet has all the pleadings and correspondence the rest is discovery exhibits and the trial when was the trial last summer it went on for two months wheres the appeal not perfected yet i think the deadline is november are you a reporter or something no good as you obviously know these are indeed public records but the trial judge has placed certain restrictions first i must have your name and the precise hours you visited this room second nothing can be taken from this room third nothing in this file can be copied until the appeal is perfected fourth anything you touch in here must be put back exactly where you found it judges orders darby stared at the wall of file cabinets why cant i make copies ask his honor okay now whats your name darby shaw the clerk scribbled the information on a clipboard hanging near the door how long will you be i dont know three or four hours we close at five find me at the office when you leave she closed the door with a smirk darby opened a drawer full of pleadings and began flipping through files and taking notes the lawsuit was seven years old with one plaintiff and thirtyeight wealthy corporate defendants who had collectively hired and fired no less than fifteen law firms from all over the country big firms many with hundreds of lawyers in dozens of offices seven years of expensive legal warfare and the outcome was far from certain bitter litigation the trial verdict was only a temporary victory for the defendants the verdict had been purchased or in some other way illegally obtained clairned the plaintiff in its motions for a new trial boxes of motions accusations and counteraccusations requests for sanctions and fines flowing rapidly to and from both sides pages and pages of affi davits detailing lies and abuses by the lawyers and their clients one lawyer was dead another had tried suicide according to a classmate of darbys who had worked on the fringes of the case during the trial her friend had been employed in a summer clerkship with a big firm in houston and was kept in the dark but heard a little darby unfolded a chair and stared at the file cabinets it would take five hours just to find everything the publicity had not been good for the montrose most of its customers wore dark sunglasses after dark and tended to enter and exit rather quickly and now that a us supreme court justice had been found in the balcony the place was famous and the curious drove by at all hours pointing and taking pictures most of the regulars went elsewhere the bravest darted in when the traffic was light he looked just like a regular when he darted in and paid his money inside the door without looking at the cashier baseball cap black sunglasses jeans neat hair leather jacket he was well disguised but not because he was a homosexual and ashamed to be hanging around such places it was midnight he climbed the stairs to the balcony smiling at the thought of jensen wearing the tourniquet the door was locked he took a seat in the center section on the floor away from anyone else he had never watched queer movies before and after this night he had no plans to watch another one this was his third such smut house in the past ninety minutes he kept the sunglasses on and tried to avoid the screen but it was difficult and this irritated him there were five other people in the theater four rows up and to his right were two lovebirds kissing and playing oh for a baseball bat and he could put them out of their misery or a nice little piece of yellow ski rope he suffered for twenty minutes and was about to reach in his pocket when a hand touched his shoulder a gentle hand he played it cool could i sit by you came the rather deep and manly voice from just over his shoulder no and you can remove your hand the hand moved seconds passed and it was obvious there would be no more requests then he was gone this was torture for a man violently opposed to pornography he wanted to vomit he glanced behind him then reached carefully into the leather jacket and removed a black box six inches by five and three inches thick he laid it on the floor between his legs with a scalpel he made a careful incision in the cushion of the seat next to him then while glancing around inserted the black box into the cushion there were springs in this one a real antique and he delicately twisted the box from one side to the other until it was in place with the switch and the tube barely visible through the incision he took a deep breath although the device had been built by a true professional a legendary genius at miniature explosives it was not pleasant carrying the damned thing around in a coat pocket just centimeters from his heart and most other vital organs and he wasnt particularly comfortable sitting next to it now this was his third plant of the night and he had one more at another movie house where they showed oldfashioned heterosexual pornography he was almost looking forward to it and this irritated him he looked at the two lovers who were oblivious to the movie and growing more excited by the minute and wished they could be sitting right there when the little black box began silently spewing forth its gas and then thirty seconds later when the fireball would flashfry every object between the screen and the popcorn machine he would like that but his was a nonviolent group opposed to the indiscriminate killing of innocent andor insignificant people they had killed a few necessary victims their specialty however was the demolition of structures used by the enemy they picked easy targets unarmed abortion clinics unprotected aclu offices unsuspecting smut houses they were having a field day not one single arrest in eighteen months it was twelveforty time to leave and hurry four blocks to his car for another black box then six blocks over to the pussycat cinema which closed at onethirty the pussycat was either eighteen or nineteen on the list he couldnt remember which but he was certain that in exactly three hours and twenty minutes the dirty movie business in dc would take a helluva blow twentytwo of these little joints were supposed to receive black boxes tonight and at am they were all supposed to be closed and deserted and demolished three allnighters were scratched from the list because his was a nonviolent group he adjusted his sunglasses and took one last look at the cushion next to him judging from the cups and popcorn on the floor the place got swept once a week no one would notice the switch and tube barely visible between the ragged threads he cautiously flipped the switch and left the montrose eric east had never met the president nor been in the white house and hed never met fletcher coal but he knew he wouldnt like him he followed director voyles and k o lewis into the oval office at seven saturday morning there were no smiles or handshakes east was introduced by voyles the president nodded from behind the desk but did not stand coal was reading something twenty porno houses had been torched in the bc area and many were still smoldering they had seen the smoke above the city from the back of the limo at a dump called angels a janitor had been badly burned and was not expected to live an hour ago they had received word that an anonymous caller to a radio station had claimed responsibility for the underground army and he promised more of the same in celebration of the death of rosenberg the president spoke first he looked tired east thought it was such an early hour for him how many places got bombed twenty here voyles answered seventeen in baltimore and around fifteen in atlanta it appears as though the assault was carefully coordinated because all the explosions happened at precisely am coal looked up from his memo director do you believe its the underground army as of now theyre the only ones claiming responsibility it looks like some of their work could be voyles did not look at coal when he spoke to him so when do you start making arrests the president asked at the precise moment we obtain probable cause mr president thats the law you understand i understand this outfit is your top suspect in the killings of rosenberg and jensen and that youre certain it killed a federal trial judge in texas and it most likely bombed at least fiftytwo smut houses last night i dont understand why theyre bombing and killing with immunity hell director were under siege voyles neck turned red but he said nothing he just looked away while the president glared at him k o lewis cleared his throat mr president if i may we are not convinced the underground army was involved with the deaths of rosenberg and jensen in fact we have no evidence linking them they are only one of a dozen suspects as ive said before the killings were remarkably clean well organized and very professional extremely professional coal stepped forward what youre trying to say mr lewis is that you have no idea who killed them and you may never know no thats not what im saying well find them but it will take time how much time asked the president it was an obvious sophomoric question with no good answer east immediately disliked the president for asking it months lewis said how many months many months the president rolled his eyes and shook his head then with great disgust stood and walked to the window he spoke to the window i cant believe theres no relation between what happened last night and the dead judges i dont know maybe im just paranoid voyles shot a quick smirk at lewis paranoid insecure clueless dumb out of touch voyles could think of many others the president continued still pondering the window i just get nervous when assassins are loose around here and bombs are going off who can blame me we havent killed a president in over thirty years oh i think youre safe mr president voyles said with a trace of amusement the secret service has things under control great then why do i feel as though im in beirut he was almost mumbling into the window coal sensed the awkwardness and picked up a thick memo from the desk he held it and spoke to voyles much like a professor lecturing to his class this is the short list of potential nominees to the supreme court there are eight names each with a biography it was prepared by justice we started with twenty names then the president attorney general horton and myself cut it to eight none of whom have any idea they are being considered voyles still looked away the president slowly returned to his desk and picked up his copy of the memo coal continued some of these people are controversial and if they are ultimately nominated well have a small war getting them approved by the senate wed prefer not to start fighting now this must be kept confidential voyles suddenly turned and glared at coalyoure an idiot coal weve done this before and i can assure you when we start checking on these people the cats out of the bag you want a thorough background investigation and yet you expect everyone contacted to keep quiet it doesnt work that way son coal stepped closer to voyles his eyes were glowing you bust your ass to make sure these names are kept out of the papers until theyre nominated you make it work director you plug the leaks and keep it out of the papers understand voyles was on his feet pointing at coal listen asshole you want them checked out you do it yourself dont start giving me a bunch of boy scout orders lewis stood between them and the president stood behind his desk and for a second or two nothing was said coal placed his memo on the desk and retreated a few steps looking away the president was now the peacemaker sit down denton sit down voyles returned to his seat while staring at coal the president smiled at lewis and everyone took a seat were all under a lot of pressure the president said warmly lewis spoke calmly well perform the routine investigations on your names mr president and it will be done in the strictest of confidence you know however that we cannot control every person we talk to yes mr lewis i know that but i want extra caution these men are young and will shape and reshape the constitution long after im dead theyre staunchly conservative and the press will eat them alive they must be free from warts and skeletons in the closet no dope smokers or illegitimate children or duis or radical student activity or divorces understand no surprises yes mr president but we cannot guarantee total secrecy in our investigations just try okay yes sir lewis handed the memo to eric east is that all voyles asked the president glanced at coal who was ignoring them all and standing before the window yes denton thats all id like to have these names checked out in ten days i want to move fast on this voyles was standing youll have it in ten days callahan was irritated when he knocked on the door to darbys apartment he was quite perturbed and had a lot on his mind a lot that he wanted to say but he knew better than to start a fight because there was something he wanted much worse than to blow off a little steam she had avoided him for four days now while she played detective and barricaded herself in the law library she had skipped classes and failed to return his calls and in general neglected him during his hour of crisis but he knew when she opened the door he would smile and forget about being neglected he held a liter of wine and a real pizza from mama rosas it was after ten saturday night he knocked again and looked up and down the street at the neat duplexes and bungalows the chain rattled from inside and he instantly smiled the neglect vanished who is it she asked through the chain thomas callahan remember im at your door begging you to let me in so we can play and be friends again the door opened and callahan stepped in she took the wine and pecked him on the cheek are we still buddies he asked yes thomas ive been busy he followed her through the cluttered den to the kitchen a computer and an assortment of thick books covered the table i called why didnt you call me back ive been out she said opening a drawer and removing a corkscrew youve got a machine ive been talking to it are you trying to fight thomas he looked at her bare legs no i swear im not mad i promise please forgive me if i appear to be upset stop it when can we go to bed are you sleepy anything but come on darby its been three nights five what kind of pizza she removed the cork and poured two glasses callahan watched every move oh its one of those saturday night specials where they throw on everything headed for the garbage shrimp tails eggs crawfish heads cheap wine too im a little low on cash and im leaving town tomorrow so i have to watch what i spend and since im leaving i thought id just come on over and get laid tonight so i wouldnt be tempted by some contagious woman in dc what do you think darby was opening the pizza box looks like sausage and peppers can i still get laid maybe later drink your wine and lets chat we havent had a long talk in a while i have ive been talking to your machine all week he took his wineglass and the bottle and followed her closely to the den where she turned on the stereo they relaxed on the sofa lets get drunk he said youre so romantic ive got some romance for you youve been drunk for a week no i havent eighty percent of a week its your fault for avoiding me whats wrong with you thomas ive got the shakes im all keyed up and i need companionship to knock the edge off whatta you say lets get half drunk she sipped her wine and draped her legs across his lap he held his breath as if in pain what time is your flight she asked he was gulping now onethirty nonstop to national im supposed to register at five and theres a dinner at eight after that i may be forced to roam the streets looking for love she smiled okay okay well do it in a minute but lets talk first callahan breathed a sigh of relief i can talk for ten minutes then ill just collapse whats up for monday the usual eight hours of airhead debate on the future of the fifth amendment then a committee will draft a proposed conference report that no one will approve more debate tuesday another report perhaps an altercation or two then we adjourn with nothing accomplished and go home ill be in late tuesday evening and id like a date at a very nice restaurant after which we can go back to my place for an intellectual discussion and animal sex wheres the pizza in there ill get it he was stroking her legs dont move im not the least bit hungry why do you go to these conferences im a member and im a professor and were just sort of expected to roam the country attending meetings with other educated idiots and adopting reports nobody reads if i didnt go the dean would think i was not contributing to the academic environment she refilled the wineglasses youre uptight thomas i know its been a rough week i hate the thought of a bunch of neanderthals rewriting the constitution well live in a police state in ten years i cant do anything about it so ill probably resort to alcohol darby sipped slowly and watched him the music was soft and the lights low im getting a buzz she said thats about right for you a glass and a half and youre history if you were irish you could drink all night my father was half scottish not good enough callahan crossed his feet on the coffee table and relaxed he gently rubbed her ankles can i paint your toes she said nothing he had a fetish for her toes and insisted on doing the nails with bright red polish at least twice a month theyd seen it in bull durham and though he wasnt as neat and sober as kevin costner she had grown to enjoy the intimacy of it no toes tonight he asked maybe later you look tired im relaxing but im filled with virile male electricity and you will not put me off by telling me i look tired have some more wine callahan had more wine and sank deeper in the sofa so ms shaw who done it professionals havent you read the papers of course but whos behind the professionals i dont know after last night the unanimous choice seems to be the underground army but youre not convinced no there have been no arrests im not convinced and youve got some obscure suspect unknown to the rest of the country i had one but now im not so sure i spent three days tracking it down even summarized it all real nice and neat in my little computer and printed out a thin rough draft of a brief which i have now discarded callahan stared at her youre telling me you skipped classes for three days ignored me worked around the clock playing sherlock holmes and now youre throwing it away its over there on the table i cant believe this while i sulked around in loneliness all week i knew it was for a worthy cause i knew my suffering was for the good of the country because you would peel away the onion and tell me tonight or perhaps tomorrow who done it it cant be done at least not with legal research theres no pattern no common thread in the murders i almost burned up the computers at the law school ha i told you so you forget dear that i am a genius at constitutional law and i knew immediately that rosenberg and jensen had nothing in common but black robes and death threats the nazis or aryans or kluxers or mafia or some other group killed them because rosenberg was rosenberg and because jensen was the easiest target and somewhat of an embarrassment well why dont you call the fbi and share your insights with them im sure theyre sitting by the phone dont be angry im sorry please forgive me youre an ass thomas yes but you love me dont you i dont know can we still go to bed you promised well see callahan placed his glass on the table and attacked her look baby ill read your brief okay and then well talk about it okay but im not thinking clearly right now and i wont be able to continue until you take my weak and trembling hand and lead me to your bed forget my little brief please dammit darby please she grabbed his neck and pulled him to her they kissed long and hard a wet almost violent kiss the cop stuck his thumb on the button next to the name of gray grantham and held it down for twenty seconds then a brief pause then another twenty seconds pause twenty seconds pause twenty seconds he thought this was funny because grantham was a night owl and had probably slept less than three or four hours and now all this incessant buzzing echoing throughout his hallway he pushed again and looked at his patrol car parked illegally on the curb under the streetlight it was almost dawn sunday and the street was empty twenty seconds pause twenty seconds maybe grantham was dead or maybe he was comatose from booze and a late night on the town maybe he had someones woman up there and had no plans to answer the door pause twenty seconds the mike crackled who is it police answered the cop who was black and emphasized the po in police just for the fun of it what do you want grantham demanded maybe i gotta warrant the cop was near laughter granthams voice softened and he sounded wounded is this cleve it is what time is it cleve almost fivethirty it must be good dont know sarge didnt say you know he just said to wake you up cause he wanted to talk why does he always want to talk before the sun comes up stupid question grantham a slight pause yeah i guess so i presume he wants to talk right now no you got thirty minutes he said be there at six where theres a little coffee shop on fourteenth near the trinidad playground its dark and safe and sarge likes it where does he find these places you know for a reporter you can ask the dumbest questions the name of the place is glendas and i suggest you get going or youll be late will you be there ill drop in just to make sure youre okay i thought you said it was safe it is safe for that part of town can you find it yeah ill be there as soon as i can have a nice day grantham sarge was old very black with a head full of brilliant white hair that sprang out in all directions he wore thick sunglasses whenever he was awake and most of his coworkers in the west wing of the white house thought he was half blind he held his head sideways and smiled like ray charles he sometimes bumped into door facings and desks as he unloaded trash cans and dusted furniture he walked slowly and gingerly as if counting his steps he worked patiently always with a smile always with a kind word for anyone willing to give him one for the most part he was ignored and dismissed as just another friendly old partially disabled black janitor sarge could see around corners his territory was the west wing where he had been cleaning for thirty years now cleaning and listening cleaning and seeing he picked up after some terribly important people who were often too busy to watch their words especially in the presence of poor old sarge he knew which doors stayed open and which walls were thin and which air vents carried sound he could disappear in an instant then reappear in a shadow where the terribly important people could not see him he kept most of it to himself but from time to time he fell heir to a juicy bit of information that could be pieced together with another one and sarge would make the judgment call that it should be repeated he was very careful he had three years until retirement and he took no chances no one ever suspected sarge of leaking stories to the press there were usually enough big mouths within any white house to lay blame on each other it was hilarious really sarge would talk to grantham at the post then wait excitedly for the story then listen to the wailing in the basement when the heads rolled he was an impeccable source and he talked only to grantham his son cleve the cop arranged the meetings always at odd hours at dark and inconspicuous places sarge wore his sunglasses grantham wore the same with a hat or cap of some sort cleve usually sat with them and watched the crowd grantham arrived at glendas a few minutes after six and walked to a booth in the rear there were three other customers glenda herself was frying eggs on a grill near the register cleve sat on a stool watching her they shook hands a cup of coffee had been poured for grantham sorry im late he said no problem my friend good to see you sarge had a raspy voice that was difficult to suppress with a whisper no one was listening grantham gulped coffee busy week at the white house you could say that lot of excitement lot of happiness you dont say grantham could not take notes at these meetings it would be too obvious sarge said when he laid the ground rules yes the president and his boys were elated with the news of justice rosenberg this made them very happy what about justice jensen well as you noticed the president attended the memorial service but did not speak he had planned to give a eulogy but backed out because he would have been saying nice things about a gay fella who wrote the eulogy the speechwriters mainly mabry worked on it all day thursday then he backed out he also went to rosenbergs service yes he did but he didnt want to said hed rather go to hell for a day but in the end he chickened out and went anyway hes quite happy rosenberg was murdered there was almost a festive mood around the place wednesday fate has dealt him a wonderful hand he now gets to restructure the court and hes very excited about this grantham listened hard sarge continued theres a short list of nominees the original had twenty or so names then it was cut to eight who did the cutting who do you think the president and fletcher coal theyre terrified of leaks at this point evidently the list is nothing but young conservative judges most of whom are obscure any names just two a certain man named pryce from idaho and one named maclawrence from vermont thats all i know about names i think they are both federal judges nothing more on this what about the investigation i havent heard much but as usual ill keep my ears open there doesnt appear to be much going on anything else no when will you run it in the morning itll be fun thanks sarge the sun was up now and the cafe was noisier cleve strolled over and sat next to his father you guys about finished we are sarge said cleve glanced around i think we need to leave grantham goes first ill follow then pop here can stay as long as he wants mighty nice of you sarge said thanks fellas grantham said as he headed for the door verheek was late as usual in the twentythreeyear history of their friendship he had never been on time and it was never a matter of being only a few minutes late he had no concept of time and wasnt bothered with it he wore a watch but never looked at it late for verheek meant at least an hour sometimes two especially when the person kept waiting was a friend who expected him to be late and would forgive him so callahan sat for an hour in the bar which suited him just fine after eight hours of scholarly debate he despised the constitution and those who taught it he needed chivas in his veins and after two doubles on the rocks he was feeling better he watched himself in the mirror behind the rows of liquor and in the distance over his shoulder he watched and waited for gavin verheek small wonder his friend couldnt cut it in private practice where life depended upon the clock when the third double was served an hour and eleven minutes after pm verheek strolled to the bar and ordered a moosehead sorry im late he said as they shook hands i knew youd appreciate the extra time alone with your chivas you look tired callahan said as he inspected him old and tired verheek was aging badly and gaining weight his forehead had grown an inch since their last visit and his pale skin highlighted the heavy circles under his eyes how much do you weigh none of your business he said gulping the beer wheres our table its reserved for eightthirty i figured you would be at least ninety minutes late then im early you could say that did you come from work i live at work now the director wants no less than a hundred hours a week until something breaks i told my wife id be home for christmas how is she fine a very patient lady we get along much better when i live at the office she was wife number three in seventeen years id like to meet her no you wouldnt i married the first two for sex and they enjoyed it so much they shared it with others i married this one for money and shes not much to look at you wouldnt be impressed he emptied the bottle i doubt if i can hang on until she dies how old is she dont ask i really love her you know honest but after two years i now realize we have nothing in common but an acute awareness of the stock market he looked at the bartender another beer please callahan chuckled and sipped his drink how much is she worth not nearly as much as i thought im not sure really somewhere around five million i think she cleaned out husbands one and two and i think she was attracted to me for the challenge of marrying just an average joe that and the sex is great she said they all say that you know you always picked losers gavin even in law school youre attracted to neurotic and depressed women and theyre attracted to me he turned the bottle up and drained half of it why do we always eat in this place i dont know its sort of traditional it brings back fond memories of law school we hated law school thomas everyone hates law school everyone hates lawyers youre in a fine mood sorry ive slept six hours since they found the bodies the director screams at me at least five times a day i scream at everybody under me its one big brawl over there drink up big boy our tables ready lets drink and eat and talk and try to enjoy these few hours together i love you more than my wife thomas do you know that thats not saying much youre right they followed the maitre d to a small table in the corner the same table they always requested callahan ordered another round and explained they would be in no hurry to eat did you see that damned thing in the post verheek asked i saw it who leaked it who knows the director got the short list saturday morning handdelivered by the president himself with rather explicit demands about secrecy he showed the list to no one over the weekend then this morning the story hit with the names of pryce and maclawrence voyles went berserk when he saw it and a few minutes later the president called he rushed to the white house and they had a huge cuss fight voyles tried to attack fletcher coal and had to be restrained by k o lewis very nasty callahan hung on every word this is pretty good yeah im telling you this part because later after a few more drinks youll expect me to tell you who else is on the list and i wont do it im trying to be a friend thomas keep going anyway theres no way the leak came from us impossible it had to come from the white house the place is full of people who hate coal and its leaking like rusty pipes coal probably leaked it maybe so hes a sleazy bastard and one theory has him leaking pryce and maclawrence to scare everyone then later announcing two nominees who appear more moderate it sounds like something he would do ive never heard of pryce and maclawrence join the club theyre both very young early forties with precious little experience on the bench we havent checked them out but they appear to be radically conservative and the rest of the list that was quick two beers down and youve already popped the question the drinks arrivedi want some of those mushrooms stuffed with crabmeat verheek told the waiter just to munch on im starving callahan handed over his empty glass bring me an order too dont ask again thomas you may have to carry me out of here in three hours but ill never tell you know that lets say that pryce and maclawrence seem to be reflective of the entire list all unknowns basically yes callahan sipped the scotch slowly and shook his head verheek removed his jacket and loosened his tie lets talk about women no how old is she twentyfour but very mature you could be her father i may be who knows wheres she from denver i told you that i love western girls theyre so independent and unpretentious and they tend to wear levis and have long legs i may marry one does she have money no her father was killed in a plane crash four years ago and her mother got a nice settlement then she has money shes comfortable ill bet she is do you have a photo no shes not a grandchild or a poodle why didnt you bring a picture ill get her to send you one why is this so amusing to you its hilarious the great thomas callahan he of the disposable women has fallen hard i have not it must be a record what nine ten months now youve actually maintained a steady relationship for almost a year havent you eight months and three weeks but dont tell anyone gavin its not easy for me your secrets safe just give me all the details how tall is she fiveeight hundred and twelve pounds long legs tight levis independent unpretentious your typical western girl i must find one for myself are you gonna marry her of course not finish your drink are you like monogamous now are you hell no never have been but were not talking about me thomas were talking about peter pan here cool hand callahan the man with the monthly version of the worlds most gorgeous woman tell me thomas and dont lie to your best friend just look me in the eyes and tell me if you have succumbed to a state of monogamy verheek was leaning halfway across the table watching and grinning stupidly not so loud callahan said looking around answer me give me the other names on the list and ill tell you verheek withdrew nice try i think the answer is yes i think youre in love with this gal but too cowardly to admit it i think shes got your number pal okay she does do you feel better yeah much better when can i meet her when can i meet your wife youre confused thomas theres a basic difference here you dont want to meet my wife but i do want to meet darby you see i assure you they are very dissimilar callahan smiled and sipped verheek relaxed and crossed his legs in the aisle he tilted the green bottle to his lips youre wired buddy callahan said im sorry im drinking as fast as i can the mushrooms were served in simmering skillets verheek stuffed two in his mouth and chewed furiously callahan watched the chivas had knocked off the hunger pains and he would wait a few minutes he preferred alcohol over food anyway four arabs noisily filled a table next to them yakking and jabbering in their language all four ordered jack daniels who killed them gavin he chewed for a minute then swallowed hard if i knew i wouldnt tell but i swear i do not know its baffling the killers vanished without a trace it was meticulously planned and perfectly executed not a clue why the combination he stuffed another in his mouth quite simple its so simple its easy to overlook they were such natural targets rosenberg had no security system in his townhouse any decent cat burglar could come and go and poor jensen was hanging around those places at midnight they were exposed at the exact moment each died the other seven supremes had fbi agents in their homes thats why they were selected they were stupid then who selected them someone with a lot of money the killers were professionals and they were probably out of the country within hours we figure there were three maybe more the mess at rosenbergs could have been done by just one we figure there were at least two working on jensen one or more looking out while the guy with the rope did his thing even though it was a dirty little place it was open to the public and quite risky but they were good very good ive read a lone assassin theory forget it its impossible for one man to kill both of them impossible how much would these killers charge millions and it took a bunch of money to plan it all and you have no idea look thomas im not involved in the investigation so youll have to ask those guys im sure they know a helluva lot more than i do im just a lowly government lawyer yeah who just happens to be on a firstname basis with the chief justice he calls occasionally this is boring lets get back to women i hate lawyer talk have you talked to him lately picking thomas always picking yes we chatted briefly this morning hes got all twentyseven law clerks scouring the federal dockets high and low looking for clues its fruitless and i told him so every case that reaches the supreme court has at least two parties and each party involved would certainly benefit if one or two or three justices would disappear and be replaced by one or two or three more sympathetic to its cause there are thousands of appeals that could eventually end up here and you cant just pick one and say this is it this is the one that got em killed its silly what did he say of course he agreed with my brilliant analysis i think he called after he read the post story to see if he could squeeze something out of me can you believe the nerve the waiter hovered over them with a hurried look verheek glanced at the menu closed it and handed it to him grilled swordfish blue cheese no vegetable ill eat the mushrooms callahan said the waiter disappeared callahan reached into his coat pocket and removed a thick envelope he laid it on the table next to the empty moosehead take a look at this when you get a chance what is it its sort of a brief i hate briefs thomas in fact i hate the law and the lawyers and with the exception of you i hate law professors darby wrote it ill read it tonight whats it about i think i told you she is very bright and intelligent and a very aggressive student she writes better than most her passion other than me of course is constitutional law poor thing she took off four days last week totally ignored me and the rest of the world and came up with her own theory which she has now discarded but read it anyway its fascinating whos the suspect the arabs erupted in screaming laughter slapping each other and spilling whiskey they watched them for a minute until they died down dont you hate a bunch of drunks verheek said its sickening verheek stuffed the envelope into his coat on the back of his chair whats her theory its a bit unusual but read it i mean it cant hurt can it you guys need the help ill read it only because she wrote it how is she in bed hows your wife in bed rich in the shower in the kitchen at the grocery shes rich in everything she does it cant last shell file by the end of the year maybe ill get the townhouse and some change no prenuptial agreement yes there is but im a lawyer remember its got more loopholes than a tax reform act a buddy of mine prepared it dont you love the law lets talk about something else women ive got an idea you want to meet the girl right were talking about darby yes darby id love to meet her were going to st thomas during thanksgiving why dont you meet us there do i have to bring my wife no shes not invited will she run around in a little string job on the beach sort of put on a show for us probably wow i cant believe this you can get a condo next to us and well have a ball beautiful beautiful just beautiful he phone rang four times the answering machine clicked on the recorded voice echoed through the apartment the beep then no message it rang again four times same routine and no message a minute later it rang again and gray grantham grabbed it from bed he sat on a pillow trying to focus who is it he asked in pain there was no light coming through the window the voice on the other end was low and timid is this gray grantham with the washington post it is whos calling slowly i cant give you my name the fog lifted and he focused on the clock it was fiveforty okay forget the name why are you calling i saw your story yesterday about the white house and the nominees thats good you and a million others why are you calling me at this obscene hour im sorry im on my way to work and stopped at a pay phone i cant call from home or the office the voice was clear articulate and appeared to be intelligent what kind of office im an attorney great washington was home for half a million lawyers private or government a slight hesitation uh id rather not say okay look id rather be sleeping why exactly did you call i may know something about rosenberg and jensen grantham sat on the edge of the bed such as a much longer pause are you recording this no should i i dont know im really very scared and confused mr grantham i prefer not to record this maybe the next call okay whatever you want im listening can this call be traced possibly i guess but youre at a pay phone right what difference does it make i dont know im just scared its okay i swear im not recording and i swear i wont trace it now whats on your mind well i think i may know who killed them grantham was standing thats some pretty valuable knowledge it could get me killed do you think theyre following me who who would be following you i dont know the voice trailed off as if he was looking over his shoulder grantham was pacing by the bed relax why dont you tell me your name okay i swear its confidential garcia thats not a real name is it of course not but its the best i can do okay garcia talk to me im not certain okay but i think i stumbled across something at the office that i was not supposed to see do you have a copy of it maybe look garcia you called me right do you want to talk or not im not sure what will you do if i tell you something check it out thoroughly if were gonna accuse someone of the assassinations of two supreme court justices believe me the story will be handled delicately there was a very long silence grantham froze by the rocker and waited garcia are you there yeah can we talk later of course we can talk now i need to think about this i havent eaten or slept in a week and im not thinking rationally i might call you later okay okay thrts fine you can call me at work at no i wont call you at work sorry i woke you he hung up grantham looked at the row of numbers on his phone and punched seven digits waited then six more then four more he scribbled a number on a pad by the phone and hung up the pay phone was on fifteenth street in pentagon city gavin verheek slept four hours and woke up drunk when he arrived at the hoover building an hour later the alcohol was fading and the pain was settling in he cursed himself and he cursed callahan who no doubt would sleep until noon and wake up fresh and alive and ready for the flight to new orleans they had left the restaurant when it closed at midnight then hit a few bars and joked about catching a skin flick or two but since their favorite movie house had been bombed they couldnt so they just drank until three or four he had a meeting with director voyles at eleven and it was imperative to appear sober and alert it would be impossible he told his secretary to close the door and explained to her that he had caught a nasty virus maybe the flu and he was to be left alone at his desk unless it was awfully damned important she studied his eyes and seemed to sniff more than usual the smell of beer does not always evaporate with sleep she left and closed the door behind her he locked it to make things equal he called callahans room but no one answered what a life his best friend earned almost as much as he did but worked thirty hours in a busy week and had his pick of pliant young things twenty years his junior then he remembered their grand plans for the week in st thomas and the thought of darby strolling along the beach he would go even if it caused a divorce a wave of nausea rippled through his chest and up his esophagus and he quickly lay still on the floor cheap government carpet he breathed deeply and the pounding started at the top of his head the plaster ceiling was not spinning and this was encouraging after three minutes it was evident he would not vomit at least not now his briefcase was within reach and he carefully slid it next to him he found the envelope inside with the morning paper he opened it unfolded the brief and held it with both hands six inches above his face it was thirteen lettersized pages of computer paper all doublespaced with wide margins he could handle it notes were scribbled in the margins by hand and whole sections were marked through the words first draft were handwritten with a felt pen across the top her name address and phone number were typed on the cover sheet he would skim it for a few minutes while he was on the floor then hopefully he would feel like sitting at the desk and going through the motions of being an important government lawyer he thought of voyles and the pounding intensified she wrote well in the standard scholarly legal fashion of long sentences filled with large words but she was clear she avoided the doubletalk and legal lingo most students strive so desperately for she would never make it as an attorney employed by the united states government gavin had never heard of her suspect and was certain it was not on anyones list technically it was not a brief but more of a story about a lawsuit in louisiana she told the facts succinctly and made them interesting fascinating really he was not skimming the facts took four pages then she filled the next three with brief histories of the parties it dragged a bit here but he kept reading he was hooked on page eight the briefer whatever it was summarized the trial on nine it mentioned the appeal and the final three pages laid an implausible trail to the removal of rosenberg and jensen from the court callahan said she had already discarded this theory and she appeared to lose steam at the end but it was highly readable for a moment he had forgotten his current state of pain and read thirteen pages of a law students brief while lying on the floor on dirty carpet with a million things to do there was a soft knock at the door he slowly sat up gingerly stood and walked to the door yes it was the secretary i hate to bother but the director wants you in his office in ten minutes verheek opened the door what yes sir ten minutes he rubbed his eyes and breathed rapidly what for i get demoted for asking those questions sir do you have any mouthwash well yes i believe so do you want it i wouldnt have asked if i didnt want it bring it to me do you have any gum gum chewing gum yes sir do you want it too just bring me the mouthwash and gum and some aspirin if you have it he walked to his desk and sat down holding his head in his hands and rubbing his temples he heard her banging drawers and then she was before him with the goods thanks im sorry i snapped he pointed at the brief in a chair by the door send that brief to eric east hes on the fourth floor write a note from me tell him to look it over when he has a minute she left with the brief fletcher coal opened the door to the oval office and spoke gravely to k o lewis and eric east the president was in puerto rico viewing hurricane damage and director voyles now refused to meet with coal alone he sent his underlings coal waved them to a sofa and he sat across the coffee table his coat was buttoned and his tie was perfect he never relaxed east had heard tales about his habits he worked twenty hours a day seven days a week drank nothing but water and ate most meals from a vending machine in the basement he could read like a computer and spent hours each day reviewing memos reports correspondence and mountains of pending legislation he had perfect recall for a week now they had brought daily reports of their investigation to this office and handed them to coal who devoured the material and memorized it for the next meeting if they misstated something he would terrorize them he was hated but it was impossible not to respect him he was smarter than them and he worked harder and he knew it he was smug in the emptiness of the oval office his boss was away performing for the cameras but the real power had stayed behind to run the country k o lewis placed a fourinch stack of the latest on the table anything new coal asked maybe the french authorities were routinely reviewing footage taken by the security cameras at the paris airport and they thought they recognized a face they checked it against two other cameras in the concourse different angles then reported to interpol the face is disguised but interpol believes it is khamel the terrorist im sure youve heard of i have theyve studied the footage at length and are almost certain he exited a plane that arrived nonstop from dulles last wednesday about ten hours after jensen was found the concorde no united based on the time and the locations of the cameras they have ways of determining the gates and flights and interpol contacted the cia yes they talked to gminski around one this afternoon coals face registered nothing how certain are they eighty percent hes a master of disguise and it would be a bit unusual for him to travel in such a manner so theres room for doubt weve got photos and a summary for the presidents review frankly ive studied the pictures and i cant tell anything but interpol knows him he hasnt been willingly photographed in years has he not that we know of and rumor has it he goes under the knife and gets a new face every two or three years coal pondered this for a second okay what if its khamel and what if he was involved in the killings what does it mean it means well never find him there are at least nine countries including israel actively stalking him right now it means he was paid a bunch of money by someone to use his talents here weve said all along the killer or killers were professionals who were gone before the bodies were cold so it means little you could say that fine what else do you have lewis glanced at eric east well we have the usual daily summary theyve been rather dry as of late yes they have we have three hundred and eighty agents working twelve hours a day yesterday they interviewed one hundred and sixty people in thirty states we have coal held up his handsave it ill read the summary it seems safe to say there is nothing new maybe a small new wrinkle lewis looked at eric east who was holding a copy of the brief what is it coal asked east shifted uncomfortably the brief had been passed upward all day until voyles read it and liked it he viewed it as a long shot unworthy of serious attention but the brief mentioned the president and he loved the idea of making coal and his boss sweat he instructed lewis and east to deliver the brief to coal and to treat it as an important theory the bureau was taking seriously for the first time in a week voyles had smiled when he talked of the idiots in the oval office reading this little brief and running for cover play it up voyles said tell them we intend to pursue with twenty agents its a theory that has surfaced in the last twentyfour hours and director voyles is quite intrigued by it hes afraid it could be damaging to the president coal was stonefaced never flinching hows that east placed the brief on the tableits all here in this report coal glanced at it then studied east fine ill read it later is that all lewis stood and buttoned his jacket yes well be going coal followed them to the door there was no fanfare when air force one landed at andrews a few minutes after ten the queen was off raising money and no friends or family greeted the president as he bounced off the plane and darted into his limousine coal was waiting the president sunk low in the seat i didnt expect you he said im sorry we need to talk the limo sped away toward the white house its late and im tired how was the hurricane impressive it blew away a million shacks and cardboard huts and now well rush down with a couple of billion and build new homes and power plants they need a good hurricane every five years ive got the disaster declaration ready okay whats so important coal handed over a copy of what was now known as the pelican brief i dont want to read said the president just tell me about it voyles and his motley crew have stumbled across a suspect that no one has mentioned until now a most obscure unlikely suspect an eagerbeaver law student at tulane wrote this damned thing and it somehow made its way to voyles who read it and decided it had merit keep in mind they are desperate for suspects the theory is so farfetched its incredible and on its face it doesnt worry me but voyles worries me hes decided he must pursue with enthusiasm and the press is watching every move he makes there could be leaks we cant control his investigation we can manipulate it gminski is waiting at the white house and gminski relax chief i personally handed him a copy of this three hours ago and swore him to secrecy he may be incompetent but he can keep a secret i trust him much more than voyles i dont trust either one of them coal liked to hear this he wanted the president to trust no one but him i think you should ask the cia to immediately investigate this i would like to know everything before voyles starts digging neither will find anything but if we know more than voyles you can convince him to back off it makes sense chief the president was frustrated its domestic cia has no business snooping around its probably illegal it is illegal technically but gminski will do it for you and he can do it quickly secretly and more thoroughly than the fbi its illegal its been done before chief many times the president watched the traffic his eyes were puffy and red but not from fatigue he had slept three hours on the plane but hed spent the day looking sad and concerned for the cameras and it was hard to snap out of it he took the brief and tossed it on the empty seat next to him is it someone we know yes because it is a city of the night new orleans wakes slowly its quiet until well after dawn then shakes the cobwebs and eases into the morning theres no early rush except on the corridors to and from the suburbs and the busy streets downtown this is the same for all cities but in the french quarter the soul of new orleans the smell of last nights whiskey and jambalaya and blackened redfish lingers not far above the empty streets until the sun can be seen an hour or two later it is replaced with the aroma of french market coffee and beignets and around this time the sidewalks reluctantly show signs of life darby curled herself in a chair on the small balcony sipping coffee and waiting on the sun callahan was a few feet away through the open french doors still wrapped in sheets and dead to the world there was a trace of a breeze but the humidity would return by noon she pulled his robe closer around her neck and inhaled the richness of his cologne she thought of her father and his baggy cotton buttondowns he allowed her to wear when she was a teenager she would roll the sleeves tightly to her elbows and let the tails hang to her knees then walk the malls with her friends secure in her belief that no one was cooler her father was her friend by the time she finished high school she had the run of his closet as long as things were washed and neatly pressed and put back on the hangers she could still smell the grey flannel he splashed on his face every day if he was living he would be four years older than thomas callahan her mother had remarried and moved to boise darby had a brother in germany the three seldom talked her father had been the glue in a fractious family and his death had scattered them twenty other people died in the plane crash and before the funeral arrangements were complete the lawyers were calling it was her first real exposure to the legal world and it was not pleasant the family attorney was a real estate type who knew nothing about litigation a slick ambulance chaser got next to her brother and he persuaded the family to sue quickly his name was herschel and for two years the family suffered as herschel stalled and lied and bungled the case they settled a week before trial for half a million after herschels cut and darby got a hundred thousand she decided to be a lawyer if a clown like herschel could do it and make big bucks while wreaking havoc on society then she certainly could do it for a nobler purpose she thought of herschel often when she passed the bar exam her first lawsuit would be filed against him for malpractice she wanted to work for an environmental firm finding a job she knew would not be a problem the hundred thousand was intact her mothers new husband was a paper company executive who was a little older and a lot wealthier and shortly after their marriage she divided her portion of the settlement between darby and her brother she said the money reminded her of her deceased husband and the gesture was symbolic though she still loved their father she had a new life in a new city with a new husband who would retire in five years with money to burn darby had been confused by the symbolic gesture but appreciated it and took the money the hundred thousand had doubled she placed most of it in mutual funds but only in those without holdings in chemical and petroleum companies she drove an accord and lived modestly her wardrobe was basic law school purchased from factory outlet stores she and callahan enjoyed the better restaurants in town and never ate at the same place twice it was always dutch treat he cared little for money and never pressed her for information she had more than the typical law student but tulane had its share of rich kids they dated for a month before they went to bed she laid the ground rules and he anxiously agreed to them there would be no other women they would be very discreet and he had to stop drinking so much he stuck to the first two but the drinking continued his father grandfather and brothers were heavy drinkers and it was sort of expected of him but for the first time in his life thomas callahan was in love madly in love and he knew the point at which the scotch was interfering with his woman he was careful with the exception of last week and the personal trauma of losing rosenberg he never drank before pm when they were together he abandoned the chivas when hed had enough and thought it might affect his performance it was amusing to watch a fortyfiveyearold man fall for the first time he struggled to maintain a level of coolness but in their private little moments he was as silly as a sophomore she kissed him on the cheek and covered him with a quilt her clothes were placed neatly on a chair she locked the front door quietly behind her the sun was up now peeking through the buildings across dauphine the sidewalk was empty she had a class in three hours then callahan and con law at eleven there was a mock court appellate brief due in a week her casenote for law review was gathering dust she was behind in classwork for two courses it was time to be a student again she had wasted four days playing detective and she cursed herself for it the accord was around the corner and down a half a block they watched her and it was enjoyable tight jeans baggy sweater long legs sunglasses to hide the eyes with no makeup they watched her close the door and walk quickly along royale then disappear around the corner the hair was shoulderlength and appeared to be dark red it was her he carried his lunch in a little brown paper bag and found an empty park bench with his back to new hampshire he hated dupont circle with its bums druggies perverts aging hippies and blackleather punks with red spiked hair and vicious tongues across the fountain a welldressed man with a loudspeaker was assembling his group of animal rights activists for a march to the white house the leather people jeered and cursed them but four mounted policemen were close enough to prevent trouble he looked at his watch and peeled a banana noon and he preferred to eat elsewhere the meeting would be brief he watched the cursing and jeering and saw his contact emerge through the crowd their eyes met a nod and he was sitting on the bench next to him his name was booker from langley they met here occasionally when the lines of communication became tangled or blurred and their bosses needed to hear real words that no one else would hear booker had no lunch he began shelling roasted peanuts and throwing the hulls under the circular bench hows mr voyles mean as hell the usual he threw peanuts in his mouth gminski was in the white house until midnight last night booker said there was no response to this voyles knew it booker continued theyve panicked over there this little pelican thing has scared them weve read it too you know and were almost certain you guys are not impressed but for some reason coal is terrified of it and hes got the president upset we sort of figure you guys are just having a little fun with coal and his boss and since the brief mentions the president and has that photo in it we figure its sort of fun for you guys know what i mean he took an inch off the banana and said nothing the animal lovers moved away in ragged formation as the leather lovers hissed at them anyway its none of our business and should be none of our business except the president now wants us to secretly investigate the pelican brief before you guys can get to it hes convinced well find nothing and he wants to know theres nothing to it so he can convince voyles to back off theres nothing to it booker watched a drunk urinate in the fountain the cops were riding off into the sun then voyles is having a little fun right we are pursuing all leads no real suspects though no the banana was history why are they so worried about us investigating this little thing booker crunched on a small peanut still in the hull well to them its quite simple they are livid over the revelation of pryce and maclawrence as nominees and of course its all your fault they distrust voyles immensely and if you guys start digging into the pelican brief theyre terrified the press will find out and the president will take a beating reelection is next year blah blah blah what did gminski tell the president that he had no desire to interfere with an fbi investigation that we had better things to do and that it would be illegal as hell but since the president was begging so hard and coal was threatening so much wed do it anyway and here i am talking to you voyles appreciates it were gonna start digging today but the whole thing is absurd well go through the motions stay out of the way and in a week or so tell the president the whole theory is a shot in the dark he folded down the top of his brown bag and stood good ill report to voyles thanks he walked toward connecticut away from the leather punks and was gone the monitor was on a cluttered table in the center of the newsroom and gray grantham glared at it amid the hum and roar of the gathering and reporting the words were not coming and he sat and glared the phone rang he punched his button and grabbed the receiver without leaving the monitor gray grantham its garcia he forgot the monitor yeah so whats up i have two questions first do you record these calls and second can you trace them no and yes we dont record until we ask permission and we can trace but we dont i thought you said you would not call me at work do you want me to hang up no its fine id rather talk at pm at the office than am in bed sorry im just scared thats all ill talk to you as long as i can trust you but if you ever lie to me mr grantham ill quit talking its a deal when do you start talking i cant talk now im at a pay phone downtown and im in a hurry you said you had a copy of something no i said i might have a copy of something well see okay so when might you call again do i have to make an appointment no but im in and out a lot ill call during lunch tomorrow ill be waiting right here garcia was gone grantham punched seven digits then six then four he wrote the number then flipped through the yellow pages until he found pay phones inc the vendor location listed the number on pennsylvania avenue near the justice department the argument started with dessert a portion of the meal callahan preferred to drink she was nice enough when she clicked off the drinks hed already consumed with dinner two double scotches while they waited on a table one more before they ordered and with the fish two bottles of wine of which shed had two glasses he was drinking too fast and getting sloppy and by the time she finished rattling off this accounting he was angry he ordered drambuie for dessert because it was his favorite and because it was suddenly a matter of principle he gulped it and ordered another and she was furious darby spooned her coffee and ignored him moutons was packed and she just wanted to leave without a scene and get to her apartment alone the argument turned nasty on the sidewalk as they walked away from the restaurant he pulled the keys to the porsche from his pocket and she said he was too drunk to drive give her the keys he gripped them and staggered on in the direction of the parking lot three blocks away she said she would walk have a nice one he said she followed a few steps behind embarrassed at the stumbling figure in front of her she pleaded with him his blood level was at least pointtwozero he was a law professor dammit he would kill someone he staggered faster coming perilously close to the curb then weaving away he yelled over his shoulder something about driving better drunk than she could sober she fell behind shed taken a ride before when he was like this and she knew what a drunk could do in a porsche he crossed the street blindly hands stuck deep in his pockets as if out for a casual stroll in the late night he misjudged the curb hit it with the toes instead of the sole and went sprawling and bouncing and cursing along the sidewalk he scrambled up quickly before she could reach him leave me alone dammit he told her just give me the keys she begged or im walking he shoved her away have a nice one he said with a laugh shed never seen him this drunk hed never touched her in anger drunk or not next to the parking lot was a greasy little dive with neon beer signs covering the windows she looked inside the open door for help but thought how stupid it was filled with drunks she yelled at him as he approached the porsche thomas please let me drive she was on the sidewalk and would go no farther he stumbled on waving her off mumbling to himself he unlocked the door squeezed downward and disappeared between the other cars the engine started and roared as he gunned it darby leaned on the side of the building a few feet from the parking lots exit she looked at the street and almost hoped for a cop she would rather have him arrested than dead it was too far to walk she would watch him drive away then call a cab then ignore him for a week at least a week have a nice one she repeated to herself he gunned it again and squealed tires the explosion knocked her to the sidewalk she landed on all fours face down stunned for a second then immediately aware of the heat and the tiny pieces of fiery debris falling in the street she gaped in horror at the parking lot the porsche flipped in a perfect violent somersault and landed upside down the tires and wheels and doors and fenders slung free the car was a brilliant fireball roaring away with flames instantly devouring it darby started toward it screaming for him debris fell around her and the heat slowed her she stopped thirty feet away screaming with hands over her mouth then a second explosion flipped it again and drove her away she tripped and her head fell hard on the bumper of another car the pavement was hot to her face and that was the last she remembered for a moment the dive emptied and the drunks were everywhere they stood along the sidewalk and stared a couple tried to advance but the heat reddened their faces and kept them away thick heavy smoke billowed from the fireball and within seconds two other cars were on fire there were shouts and voices in panic whose car is it call is anybody in it call they dragged her by the elbows back to the sidewalk to the center of the crowd she was repeating the name thomas a cold cloth came from the dive and was placed on her forehead the crowd thickened and the street was busy sirens she heard sirens as she came around there was a knot on the back of her head and a coldness on her face her mouth was dry thomas thomas she repeated its okay its okay said a black face just above her he was carefully holding her head and patting her arm other faces stared downward they all nodded in agreement its okay the sirens were screaming now she gently removed the cloth and her eyes focused there were red and blue lights flashing from the street the sirens were deafening she sat up they leaned her against the building beneath the neon beer signs they eased away watching her carefully you all right miss asked the black man she couldnt answer didnt try to her head was broken where is thomas she asked looking at the crack in the sidewalk they looked at each other the first fire truck screamed to a halt twenty feet away and the crowd parted firemen jumped and scrambled in all directions where is thomas she repeated miss who is thomas asked the black man thomas callahan she said softly as if everyone knew him was he in that car she nodded then closed her eyes the sirens wailed and died and in between she heard the shouts of anxious men and the popping of the fire she could smell the burning the second and third fire trucks came blaring in from different directions a cop shoved his way through the crowd police outta the way police he pushed and shoved until he found her he fell to his knees and waved a badge under her nose maam sergeant rupert nopd darby heard this but thought nothing of it he was in her face this rupert with bushy hair a baseball cap black and gold saints jacket she stared blankly at him is that your car maam someone said it was your car she shook her head no rupert was grabbing her elbows and pulling up he was talking to her asking if she was all right and at the same time pulling her up and it hurt like hell the head was fractured split busted and she was in shock but what did this moron care she was on her feet the knees wouldnt lock and she was limp he kept asking if she was all right the black man looked at rupert as if he was crazy there the legs worked now and she and rupert were walking through the crowd behind a fire truck around another one to an unmarked cop car she lowered her head and refused to look at the parking lot rupert chatted incessantly something about an ambulance he opened the front door and gingerly placed her in the passengers seat another cop squatted in the door and started asking questions he wore jeans and cowboy boots with pointed toes darby leaned forward and placed her head in her handsi think i need help she said sure lady helps on the way just a coupla questions whats your name darby shaw i think im in shock im very dizzy and i think i need to throw up the ambulance is on the way is that your car over there no another cop car one with decals and words and lights squealed to a stop in front of ruperts rupert disappeared for a moment the cowboy cop suddenly closed her door and she was all alone in the car she leaned forward and vomited between her legs she started crying she was cold she slowly laid her head on the drivers seat and curled into a knot silence then darkness someone was knocking on the window above her she opened her eyes and the man wore a uniform and a hat with a badge on it the door was locked open the door lady he yelled she sat up and opened the door are you drunk lady the head was pounding no she said desperately he opened the door wider is this your car she rubbed her eyes she had to think lady is this your car no she glared at him no its ruperts okay who the hell is rupert there was one fire truck left and most of the crowd was gone this man in the door was obviously a cop sergeant rupert one of you guys she said this made him mad get outta the car lady gladly darby crawled out on the passengers side and stood on the sidewalk in the distance a solitary fireman hosed down the burnt frame of the porsche another cop in a uniform joined him and they met her on the sidewalk the first cop asked whats your name darby shaw why were you passed out in the car she looked at the car i dont know i got hurt and rupert put me in the car wheres rupert the cops looked at each other who the hells rupert the first cop asked this made her mad and the anger cleared away the cobwebs rupert said he was a cop the second cop asked howd you get hurt darby glared at him she pointed to the parking lot across the street i was supposed to be in that car over there but i wasnt so im here listening to your stupid questions wheres rupert they looked blankly at each other the first cop said stay here and he walked across the street to another cop car where a man in a suit was talking to a small group they whispered then the first cop and the man in the suit walked back to the sidewalk where darby waited the man in the suit said im lieutenant olson new orleans pd did you know the man in the car he pointed to the parking lot the knees went weak and she bit her lip she nodded whats his name thomas callahan olson looked at the first cop thats what the computer said now whos this rupert darby screamed he said he was a cop olson looked sympathetic im sorry theres no cop named rupert she was sobbing loudly olson helped her to the hood of ruperts car and held her shoulders while the crying subsided and she fought to regain control check the plates olson told the second cop who quickly scribbled down the tag number from ruperts car and called it in olson gently held both her shoulders with his hands and looked at her eyes were you with callahan she nodded still crying but much quieter olson glanced at the first cop how did you get in this car olson asked slowly and softly she wiped her eyes with her finger and stared at olson this guy rupert who said he was a cop came and got me from over there and brought me over here he put me in the car and this other cop with cowboy boots starting asking questions another cop car pulled up and they left then i guess i passed out i dont know i would like to see a doctor get my car olson said to the first cop the second cop was back with a puzzled lookthe computer has no record of this tag number must be fake tags olson took her arm and led her to his car he spoke quickly to the two cops im taking her to charity wrap this up and meet me there impound the car well check it later she sat in olsons car listening to the radio squawk and staring at the parking lot four cars had burned the porsche was upside down in the center nothing but a crumpled frame a handful of firemen and other emergency types milled about a cop was stringing yellow crimescene tape around the lot she touched the knot on the back of her head no blood tears dripped off her chin olson slammed his door and they eased through the parked cars and headed for st charles he had the blue lights on but no sirens do you feel like talking he asked they were on st charles i guess she saidhes dead isnt he yes darby im sorry i take it he was the only one in the car yes howd you get hurt he gave her a handkerchief and she wiped her eyes i fell or something there were two explosions and i think the second one knocked me down i dont remember everything please tell me who rupert is i have no idea i dont know a cop named rupert and there was no cop here with cowboy boots she thought about this for a block and a half what did callahan do for a living a law professor at tulane im a student there who would want to kill him she stared at the traffic lights and shook her head youre certain it was intentional no doubt about it it was a very powerful explosive we found a piece of a foot stuck in a chainlink fence eighty feet away im sorry okay he was murdered maybe someone got the wrong car thats always possible well check out everything i take it you were supposed to be in the car with him she tried to speak but could not hold the tears she buried her face in the handkerchief he parked between two ambulances near the emergency entrance at charity and left the blue lights on he helped her quickly inside to a dirty room where fifty people sat in various degrees of pain and discomfort she found a seat by the water fountain olson talked to the lady behind the window and he raised his voice but darby couldnt understand him a small boy with a bloody towel around his foot cried in his mothers lap a young black girl was about to give birth there was not a doctor or nurse in sight no one was in a hurry olson crouched in front of her itll be a few minutes sit tight im gonna move the car and ill be back in a minute do you feel like talking yeah sure he was gone she checked again for blood and found none the double doors opened wide and two angry nurses came after the girl in labor they sort of dragged her away back through the doors and down the hall darby waited then followed with the red eyes and handkerchief she looked like some childs mother the hall was a zoo with nurses and orderlies and the wounded yelling and moving about she turned a corner and saw an exit sign through the door into another hall much quieter another door and she was on a loading dock there were lights in the alley dont run be strong its okay no ones watching she was on the street walking briskly the cool air cleared her eyes she refused to cry olson would take his time and when he returned he would figure they had called her name and she was back there getting worked on he would wait and wait she turned corners and saw rampart the quarter was just ahead she could get lost there there were people on royal tourist types strolling along she felt safer she entered the holiday inn paid with plastic and got a room on the fifth floor after the door was bolted and chained she curled up on the bed with all the lights on mrs verheek rolled her plump but rich ass away from the center of the bed and grabbed the phone its for you gavin she yelled into the bathroom gavin emerged with shaving cream on half his face and took the receiver from his wife who burrowed deep into the bed like a hog rutting in mud he thought hello he snapped it was a female voice hed never heard before this is darby shaw do you know who i am he smiled instantly and for a second thought of the string bikini on st thomas well yes i believe we have a mutual friend did you read the little theory i wrote ah yes the pelican brief as we refer to it and who is we verheek sat in a chair by the night table this was no social call why are you calling darby i need some answers mr verheek im scared to death its gavin okay gavin where is the brief now here and there whats wrong ill tell you in a minute just tell me what you did with the brief well i read it then sent it to another division and it was seen by some folks within the bureau then shown to director voyles who sort of liked it has it been seen outside the fbi i cant answer that darby then i wont tell you whats happened to thomas verheek pondered this for a long minute she waited patiently okay yes its been seen outside the fbi by whom and by how many i dont know hes dead gavin he was murdered around ten last night someone planted a car bomb for both of us i got lucky but now theyre after me verheek was hovering over the phone scribbling notes are you hurt physically im okay where are you new orleans are you certain darby i mean i know youre

please darby ill go straight to the director when i get there call me at eight your time give me the number the bomb exploded too late to make the thursday morning edition of the timespicayune darby flipped through it hurriedly in the hotel room nothing she watched the television and there it was a live shot of the burnedout porsche still sitting amid the debris in the parking lot secluded nicely with yellow tape running everywhere the police were treating it as a homicide no suspects no comment then the name of thomas callahan age fortyfive a prominent professor of law at tulane the dean was suddenly there with a microphone in his face talking about professor callahan and the shock of it all the shock of it all the fatigue the fear the pain and darby buried her head in the pillow she hated crying and this would be the last of it for a while mourning would only get her killed even though it was a wonderful crisis with the ratings up and rosenberg dead with his image clean and polished and america feeling good about itself because he was in command with the democrats running for cover and reelection next year in the bag he was sick of this crisis and its relentless predawn meetings he was sick of f denton voyles and his smugness and arrogance and his squatty little figure sitting on the other side of his desk in a wrinkled trench coat looking out a window while he addressed the president of the united states he would be here in a minute for another meeting before breakfast another tense encounter in which voyles would tell only a portion of what he knew he was sick of being in the dark and fed only what bits and crumbs voyles chose to throw his way gminski would throw him a few and somehow in the midst of all this crumb scattering and gathering he was supposed to get enough and be satisfied he knew nothing compared to them at least he had coal to plow through their paper and memorize it all and keep them honest he was sick of coal too sick of his perfectness and sleeplessness sick of his brilliance sick of his penchant for beginning each day when the sun was somewhere over the atlantic and planning every damned minute of every damned hour until it was over the pacific then he coal would load up a box of the days junk take it home read it decipher it store it then come in a few hours later blazing away with all the painfully boring mishmash he had just devoured when coal was tired he slept five hours a night but normal was three or four he left his office in the west wing at eleven each night read all the way home in the back of his limo then about the time the limo cooled off coal was waiting on it for the return ride to the white house he considered it a sin to arrive at his desk after am and if he could work a hundred and twenty hours a week then everyone else should be able to do at least eighty he demanded eighty after three years no one in this administration could remember all the people fired by fletcher coal for not working eighty hours a week happened at least three times a month coal was happiest on mornings when the tension was thick and a nasty meeting was planned in the past week this thing with voyles had kept him smiling he was standing beside the desk going through the mail while the president scanned the post and two secretaries scurried about the president glanced at him perfect black suit white shirt red silk tie a bit too much grease on the hair above the ears he was sick of him but hed get over it when the crisis passed and he could get back to golf and coal could sweat the details he told himself he had that kind of energy and stamina when he was only thirtyseven but he knew better coal snapped his fingers glared at the secretaries and they happily ran from the oval office and he said he wouldnt come if i was here thats hilarious coal was clearly amused i dont think he likes you the president said he loves people he can run over i guess i need to be sweet to him lay it on thick chief he has to back off this theory is so weak its comical but in his hands it could be dangerous what about the law student were checking she appears harmless the president stood and stretched coal shuffled papers a secretary on the intercom announced the arrival of voyles ill be going coal said he would listen and watch from around the corner at his insistence three closedcircuit cameras were installed in the oval office the monitors were in a small locked room in the west wing he had the only key sarge knew of the room but had not bothered to enter yet the cameras were invisible and supposedly a big secret the president felt better knowing coal would at least be watching he met voyles at the door with a warm handshake and guided him to the sofa for a warm friendly little chat voyles was not impressed he knew coal would be listening and watching but in the spirit of the moment voyles removed his trench coat and laid it properly on a chair he did not want coffee the president crossed his legs he was wearing the brown cardigan the grandfather denton he said gravely i want to apologize for fletcher coal he doesnt have much finesse voyles nodded slightly you stupid bastard there are enough wires in this office to electrocute half the bureaucrats in bc coal was somewhere in the basement hearing about his lack of finesse he can be an ass cant he voyles grunted yes he can i have to really watch him hes very bright and drives hard but he tends to overdo it at times hes a son of a bitch and ill say it to his face voyles glanced at an air vent above the portrait of thomas jefferson where a camera watched it all below yes well ill keep him out of your way until this thing is over you do that the president slowly sipped from his coffee and pondered what to say next voyles was not known for his conversation i need a favor voyles stared with rigid and unblinking eyes yes sir i need the scoop on this pelican thing its a wild idea but hell it mentions me sort of how serious are you taking it oh this was funny voyles fought off a smile it was working mr president and mr coal were sweating the pelican brief they had received it late tuesday worried with it all day wednesday and now in the waking hours of thursday were on their knees begging about something one notch above a practical joke were investigating mr president it was a lie but how could he know we are pursuing all leads all suspects i wouldnt have sent it over if i wasnt serious the wrinkles squeezed together on the tanned forehead and voyles wanted to laugh what have you learned not much but we just started we got it less than fortyeight hours ago and i assigned fourteen agents in new orleans to start digging its all routine the lies sounded so good he could almost hear coal choking fourteen it hit him in the gut so hard he sat up straight and placed the coffee on a table fourteen fibbies out there flashing badges asking questions and it was just a matter of time before this thing got out fourteen you say sounds like its pretty serious voyles was unyielding were very serious mr president theyve been dead a week and the trails growing colder were tracking leads as fast as we can my men are working around the clock i understand all that but how serious is this pelican theory damn this was fun the brief had yet to be sent to new orleans in fact new orleans had not been contacted he had instructed eric east to mail a copy to that office with orders to quietly ask a few questions it was a dead end just like a hundred others they were chasing i doubt if theres anything to it mr president but weve got to check it out the wrinkles relaxed and there was a touch of a smilei dont have to tell you denton how much this nonsense could hurt if the press found out we dont consult the press when we investigate i know lets not get into that i just wish you would back off this thing i mean what the hell its absurd and i could really get burned know what im saying voyles was brutalare you asking me to ignore a suspect mr president coal leaned toward the screen no im telling you to forget this pelican brief he almost said it out loud he could make it real plain for voyles he could spell it out then slap the dumpy little wretch if he got smart but he was hiding in a locked room away from the action and for the moment he knew he was where he belonged the president shifted and recrossed his legs at the kneescome on denton you know what im saying there are bigger fish in the pond the press is watching this investigation just dying to find out whos a suspect you know how they are i dont have to tell you that i have no friends with the press even my own press secretary dislikes me ha ha ha forget about it for a while back off and chase the real suspects this thing is a joke but it could embarrass the hell out of me denton looked hard at him relentless the president shifted again what about this khamel thing sounds pretty good huh could be yeah since were talking numbers how many men have you assigned to khamel voyles said fifteen and almost laughed the presidents mouth fell open the hottest suspect in the game gets fifteen and this damned pelican thing gets fourteen coal smiled and shook his head voyles had been caught in his own lies on the bottom of page four of the wednesday report eric east and k o lewis gave the number at thirty not fifteen relax chief coal whispered to the screen hes playing with you the president was anything but relaxed good god denton why only fifteen i thought this was a significant break maybe a few more than that im running this investigation mr president i know and youre doing a fine job im not meddling i just wish youd consider spending your time elsewhere thats all when i read the pelican brief i almost vomited if the press saw it and started digging id be crucified so youre asking me to back off the president leaned forward and stared fiercely at voyles im not asking denton im telling you to leave it alone ignore it for a couple of weeks spend your time elsewhere if it flares up again take another look im still the boss around here remember voyles relented and managed a tiny smile ill make you a deal your hatchet man coal has done a number on me with the press theyve eaten my lunch over the security we provided to rosenberg and jensen the president nodded solemnly you get that pit bull off my ass keep him away from me and ill forget the pelican theory i dont make deals voyles sneered but kept his cool good ill send fifty agents to new orleans tomorrow and fifty the next day well be flashing badges all over town and doing our damnedest to attract attention the president jumped to his feet and walked to the windows overlooking the rose garden voyles sat motionless and waited all right all right its a deal i can control fletcher coal voyles stood and walked slowly to the desk i dont trust him and if i smell him one more time during this investigation the deals off and we investigate the pelican brief with all the weight i can muster the president held up his hands and smiled warmly its a deal voyles was smiling and the president was smiling and in the closet near the cabinet room fletcher coal was smiling at a screen hatchet man pit bull he loved it those were the words that created legends he turned off the screens and locked the door behind him they would talk another ten minutes about the background checks on the short list and he would listen in his office where he had audio but no video he had a staff meeting at nine a firing at ten and he had some typing to do with most memos he simply dictated into the machine and handed the tape to a secretary but occasionally coal found it necessary to resort to the phantom memo these were always widely circulated in the west wing and always controversial as hell and usually dripped to the press because they came from no one they could be found lying on almost every desk coal would scream and accuse he had fired people for phantom memos all of which came from his typewriter it was four singlespaced paragraphs on one page and it summarized what he knew about khamel and his recent flight out of washington and there were vague links to the libyans and palestinians coal admired it how long before it would be in the post or the times he made little bets with himself about which paper would get it first the director was at the white house and from there would fly to new york and return tomorrow gavin camped outside the office of k o lewis until there was a small opening he was in lewis was irritated but always the gentleman you look scared ive just lost my best friend lewis waited for more his name was thomas callahan hes the guy from tulane who brought me the pelican brief and it got passed around then sent to the white house and who knows where else and now hes dead blown to bits by a car bomb last night in new orleans murdered ko im sorry its not a matter of being sorry evidently the bomb was intended for callahan and the student who wrote it a girl by the name of darby shaw i saw her name on the brief thats right theyve been dating and were supposed to be in the car together when it exploded but she survived and i get this call this morning at five and its her scared to death lewis listened but was already dismissing it youre not certain it was a bomb she said it was a bomb okay it went boom and blew the hell out of everything okay im certain hes dead and you think theres a connection between his death and the brief gavin was a lawyer untrained in the art of investigation and he did not wish to appear gullible there could be i think so yes dont you doesnt matter gavin i just got off the phone with the director pelicans off our list im not sure it was ever on but were spending no more time on it but my friends been killed with a car bomb im sorry im sure the authorities down there are investigating listen to me ko im asking for a favor listen to me gavin i dont have any favors were chasing enough rabbits right now and if the director says stop then we stop youre free to talk to him i wouldnt advise it maybe im not handling this right i thought you would listen to me and at least act interested lewis was walking around the desk gavin you look bad take the day off no ill go to my office wait an hour and come back in here and do this again can we try it again in an hour no voyles was explicit so was the girl ko he was murdered and now shes hiding somewhere in new orleans afraid of her shadow calling us for help and were too busy im sorry no youre not its my fault i shouldve thrown the damned thing in the garbage it served a valuable purpose gavin lewis placed his hand on his shoulder as if his time was up and he was tired of this drivel gavin jerked away and headed for the door yeah it gave you guys something to play with i shouldve burned it its too good to burn gavin im not giving up ill be back in an hour and well do this again this didnt go right verheek slammed the door behind him she entered rubinstein brothers from canal street and got lost between the racks of mens shirts no one followed her in she quickly picked out a navy parka mens small a genderless pair of aviator sunglasses and a british driving cap that was also a mens small but fit she paid for it with plastic as the clerk ran the card through she picked the tags off and put the parka on it was baggy like something she would wear to class she stuffed her hair under the hooded collar the clerk watched discreetly she exited on magazine street and got lost in the crowd back on canal a busload of tourists swarmed into the sheraton and she joined them she went to the wall of phones found the number and called mrs chen her neighbor in the duplex next door had she seen or heard anyone very early there was a knock on the door it was still dark and woke them she didnt see anyone just heard the knock her car was still on the street everything okay yes alls fine thanks she watched the tourists and punched the inside number for gavin verheek inside meant a minor hassle only and after three minutes of refusing to give her name and repeating his she had him where are you he asked let me explain something for the moment i will not tell you or anyone else where i am so dont ask all right i guess youre making the rules thank you what did mr voyles say mr voyles was at the white house and unavailable ill try to talk to him later today thats pretty weak gavin youve been at the office for almost four hours and you have nothing i expected more be patient darby patience will get me killed theyre after me arent they gavin i dont know what would you do if you knew you were supposed to be dead and the people trying to kill you have had assassinated two supreme court justices and knocked off a simple law pro fessor and they have billions of dollars which they obviously dont mind using to kill with what would you do gavin go to the fbi thomas went to the fbi and hes dead thanks darby thats not fair im not worried about fairness or feelings im more concerned with staying alive until noon dont go to your apartment im not stupid theyve already been there and im sure theyre watching his apartment wheres his family his parents live in naples florida i guess the university will contact them i dont know he has a brother in mobile and i thought of calling him and trying to explain all this she saw a face he walked among the tourists at the registration desk he held a folded newspaper and tried to appear at home just another guest but his walk was a bit hesitant and his eyes were searching the face was long and thin with round glasses and a shiny forehead gavin listen to me write this down i see a man ive seen before not long ago an hour maybe six feet two or three thin thirty years old glasses receding hair dark in color hes gone hes gone who the hell is it we havent met dammit did he see you where the hell are you in a hotel lobby i dont know if he saw me im gone darby listen to me whatever you do keep in touch with me okay ill try the rest room was around the corner she went to the last stall locked the door behind her and stayed there for an hour the photographers name was croft and hed worked for the post for seven years until his third drug conviction sent him away for nine months upon parole he declared himself to be a freelance artist and advertised as such in the yellow pages the phone seldom rang he did a little of this work this slithering around shooting people who did not know they were targets many of his clients were divorce lawyers who needed dirt for trial after two years of freelancing he had picked up a few tricks and now considered himself a halfass private investigator he charged forty bucks an hour when he could get it another client was gray grantham an old friend from his newspaper days who called when he needed dirt grantham was a serious ethical reporter with just a touch of sleaze and when he needed a dirty trick he called he liked grantham because he was honest about his sleaziness the rest were so pious he was in granthams volvo because it had a phone it was noon and he was smoking his lunch wondering if the smell would linger with all the windows down he did his best work halfstoned when you stare at motels for a living you need to be stoned there was a nice breeze coming in from the passengers side blowing the smell onto pennsylvania he was parked illegally smoking dope and not really concerned he had less than an ounce on him and his probation officer smoked it too so what the hell the phone booth was a block and a half ahead on the sidewalk but away from the street with his telephoto lens he could almost read the phone book hanging from the rack piece of cake a large woman was inside filling the booth and talking with her hands croft took a drag and watched the mirror for cops this was a towaway zone traffic was heavy on pennsylvania at twenty after twelve the woman fought her way out of the booth and from nowhere a young man with a nice suit appeared and closed the door croft got his nikon and rested the lens on the steering wheel it was cool and sunny and the sidewalk bustled with lunch traffic the shoulders and heads moved quickly by a gap click a gap click the subject was punching numbers and glancing around this was their man he talked for thirty seconds and the car phone rang three times and stopped it was the signal from grantham at the post this was their man and he was talking croft fired away get all you can get grantham had said a gap click click heads and shoulders a gap click click his eyes darted around as he talked but he kept his back to the street full face click croft burned a roll of thirtysix in two minutes then grabbed another nikon he screwed on the lens and waited for a mob to pass he took the last drag and thumped it into the street this was so easy oh sure it took talent to capture the image in a studio but this street work was much more fun there was something felonious about stealing a face with a hidden camera the subject was a man of few words he hung up looked around opened the door looked around and started toward croft click click click full face full figure walking faster getting closer beautiful beautiful croft worked feverishly then at the last moment laid the nikon in the seat and looked at pennsylvania as their man walked by and disappeared in a group of secretaries what a fool when youre on the run never use the same pay phone twice garcia was shadow boxing he had a wife and child he said and he was scared there was a career ahead with plenty of money and if he paid his dues and kept his mouth shut he would be a wealthy man but he wanted to talk he rambled on about how he wanted to talk had something to say and all but just couldnt make the decision he didnt trust anyone grantham didnt push he let him ramble long enough for croft to do his number garcia would eventually spill his guts he wanted to so badly he had called three times now and was growing comfortable with his new friend grantham whod played this game many times and knew how it worked the first step was to relax and build trust to treat them with warmth and respect to talk about right and wrong and moralities then they would talk the pictures were beautiful croft was not his first choice he was usually so bombed you could tell it in the photography but croft was sleazy and discreet with a working knowledge of journalism and he happened to be available on short notice he had picked twelve and blown them to five by seven and they were outstanding right profile left profile full face into the phone full face looking at the camera full figure less than twenty feet away piece of cake croft said garcia was under thirty a very nicelooking cleancut lawyer dark short hair dark eyes maybe hispanic but the skin was not dark the clothes were expensive navy suit probably wool no stripes or patterns basic white spread collar with a silk tie basic black or burgundy wing tips with a sparkling shine the absence of a briefcase was puzzling but then it was lunch and he probably ran from the office to make the call then back to the office the justice department was a block away grantham studied the pictures and kept an eye on the door sarge was never late it was dark and the club was filling up granthams was the only white face within three blocks of the tens of thousands of government lawyers in dc he had seen a few who knew how to dress but not many especially the younger ones they started at forty a year and clothes were not important clothes were important to garcia and he was too young and well dressed to be a government lawyer so he was a private one in a firm for about three or four years now and hitting somewhere around eighty grand great that narrowed it down to fifty thousand lawyers and no doubt expanding by the moment the door opened and a cop walked in through the smoke and haze he could tell it was cleve this was a respectable joint with no dice or whores so the presence of a cop was not alarming he sat in the booth across from grantham did you pick this place grantham asked yeah you like it lets put it like this were trying to be inconspicuous right im here picking up secrets from a white house employee pretty heavy stuff now tell me cleve do i look inconspicuous sitting here in all my whiteness i hate to tell you this grantham but youre not nearly as famous as you think you see those dudes at the bar they looked at the bar lined with construction workers id give you my paycheck if any dude there has ever read the washington post heard of gray grantham or gives a damn what happens at the white house okay okay wheres sarge sarge is not feeling well he gave me a message for you wouldnt work he could use sarge as an unnamed source but not sarges son or anyone else sarge talked towhats wrong with him old age he didnt want to talk tonight but its urgent he says grantham listened and waited ive got an envelope in my car all licked and sealed real tight sarge got real blunt when he gave it to me and told me not to open it just take it to mr grantham i think its important lets go they made their way through the crowd to the door the patrol car was parked illegally at the curb cleve opened the passenger door and pulled the envelope from the glove box he got this in the west wing grantham stuffed it in his pocket sarge was not one to lift things and in the course of their relationship he had never produced a document thanks cleve he wouldnt tell me what it is told me ill just have to wait and read it in the paper tell sarge i love him im sure thatll give him a thrill the patrol car drove away and grantham hurried to his volvo now filled with the stench of burnt grass he locked the door turned on the dome light and ripped open the envelope it was clearly an internal white house memo and it was about an assassin named khamel he was flying across town out of brightwood onto sixteenth and south toward central washington it was almost seventhirty and if he could put it together in an hour it would make the late city edition the largest of half a dozen editions that began rolling off the presses at tenthirty thank god for the little yuppie car phone he had been embarrassed to buy he called smith keen the assistant managing editorinvestigations who was still in the newsroom on the fifth floor he called a friend at the foreign desk and asked him to pull everything on khamel he was suspicious of the memo the words were too sensitive to put on paper then sling around the office like the latest policy on coffee or bottled water or vacations someone probably fletcher coal wanted the world to know that khamel had emerged as a suspect and that he was an arab of all things and had close ties to libya and iran and iraq countries led by fiery idiots who hated america someone in the white house of fools wanted the story on the front page but it was a helluva story and it was frontpage news he and smith keen had it finished by nine they found two old pictures of a man widely believed to be khamel but so dissimilar they appeared to be of different people keen said run both of them the file on khamel was thin much rumor and legend but little meat grantham mentioned the pope the british diplomat the german banker and the ambush of the israeli soldiers and now according to a confidential source at the white house a most reliable and trusted source khamel was a suspect in the killings of justices rosenberg and jensen twentyfour hours after hitting the street she was still alive if she could make it to morning she could start another day with new ideas about what to do and where to go for now she was tired she was in a room on the fifteenth floor of the marriott with the door bolted lights on and the mighty can of mace lying on the bedspread her thick dark red hair was now in a paper sack in the closet the last time she cut her hair she was three years old and her mother whipped her tail it took two painful hours with dull scissors to cut it off yet leave some semblance of style she would keep it under a cap or hat until who knows when it took another two hours to color it black she couldve bleached it and gone blonde but that would be obvious she assumed she was dealing with professionals and for some unfathomable reason she determined at the drugstore that they might expect her to do this and become a blonde and what the hell the stuff came in a bottle and if she woke up tomorrow with a wild hair she could go blonde the chameleon strategy change colors every day and drive em crazy clairol had at least eightyfive shades she was dead tired but afraid of sleep she had not seen her friend from the sheraton during the day but the more she moved around the more the faces looked the same he was out there she knew and he had friends if they could assassinate rosenberg and jensen and knock off thomas callahan she would be easy she couldnt go near her car and she didnt want to rent one rentals leave records and they were probably watching she could fly but they were stalking the airports take a bus but shed never bought a ticket or seen the inside of a greyhound and after they realized she had disappeared they would expect her to run she was just an amateur a little college girl brokenhearted after watching her man blown to bits and fried she would make a mad dash somewhere get out of the city and they would pick her off she rather liked the city at this moment it had a million hotel rooms almost as many alleys and dives and bars and it always had crowds of people strolling along bourbon chartres dauphine and royal she knew it well especially the quarter where life was within walking distance she would move from hotel to hotel for a few days until when she didnt know when she didnt know why moving just seemed intelligent under the circumstances she would stay off the streets in the mornings and try to sleep then she would change clothes and hats and sunglasses she would start smoking and keep one in her face she would move until she got tired of moving then she might leave it was okay to be scared she had to keep thinking she would survive she thought of calling the cops but not now they took names and kept records and they could be dangerous she thought of calling thomas brother in mobile but there wasnt a single thing the poor man could do to help her at this moment she thought of calling the dean but how could she explain the brief gavin verheek the fbi the car bomb rosenberg and jensen and her on the run and make it sound believable forget the dean she didnt like him anyway she thought of calling a couple of friends from law school but people talk and people listen and they could be out there listening to the people talking about poor callahan she wanted to talk to alice stark her best friend alice was worried and alice would go to the cops and tell them her friend darby shaw was missing she would call alice tomorrow she dialed room service and ordered a mexican salad and a bottle of red wine she would drink all of it then sit in a chair with the mace and watch the door until she fell asleep gminskis limo made a wild uturn on canal as if it owned the street and came to a sudden stop in front of the sheraton both rear doors flew open gminski was out first followed quickly by three aides who scurried after him with bags and briefcases it was almost am and the director was obviously in a hurry he did not stop at the front desk but went straight for the elevators the aides ran behind him and held the elevator door for him and no one spoke as they rode up six floors three of his agents were waiting in a corner room one of them opened the door and gminski barged through it without any sort of greeting the aides threw the bags on one bed the director yanked off his jacket and threw it in a chair where is she he snapped at an agent by the name of hooten the one named swank opened the curtains and gminski walked to the window swank was pointing to the marriott across the street and down a block shes on the fifteenth floor third room from the street lights are still on gminski stared at the marriott youre certain yes we saw her go in and she paid with a credit card poor kid gminski said as he walked away from the window where was she last night holiday inn on royal paid with a credit card have you seen anyone following her the director asked no i need some water he said to an aide who jumped toward the ice bucket and rattled cubes gminski sat on the edge of the bed laced his fingers together and cracked every possible knuckle what do you think he asked hooten the oldest of the three agents theyre chasing her theyre looking under rocks shes using credit cards shell be dead in fortyeight hours shes not completely stupid swank inserted she cut her hair and colored it black shes moving around its apparent she has no plans to leave the city any time soon ill give her seventytwo hours before they find her gminski sipped his water this means her little brief is directly on point and it means our friend is now a very desperate man where is he hooten answered quickly we have no idea we have to find him he hasnt been seen in three weeks gminski set the glass on the desk and picked up a room key so what do you think he asked hooten do we bring her in hooten asked it wont be easy swank said she may have a gun someone could get hurt shes a scared kid gminski said shes also a civilian not a member we cant go around snatching civilians off the sidewalk then she wont last long swank said how do you take her gminski asked there are ways hooten answered catch her on the street go to her room i could be inside her room in less than ten minutes if i left right now its not that difficult shes not a pro gminski paced slowly around the room and everyone watched him he glanced at his watchim not inclined to take her lets sleep four hours and meet here at sixthirty sleep on it if you can convince me to snatch her then ill say do it okay they nodded obediently the wine worked she dozed in the chair then made it to the bed and slept hard the phone was ringing the bedspread was hanging to the floor and her feet were on the pillows the phone was ringing the eyelids were glued together the mind was numb and lost in dreams but somewhere in the deep recesses something worked and told her the phone was ringing the eyes opened but saw little the sun was up the lights were on and she stared at the phone no she did not ask for a wakeup call she thought about this for a second then she was certain no wakeup call she sat on the edge of the bed and listened to it ring five times ten fifteen twenty it would not stop could be a wrong number but they would stop after twenty rings it was not a wrong number the cobwebs began to clear and she moved closer to the phone with the exception of the registration clerk and maybe his boss and perhaps room service not a single living soul knew she was in this room she had ordered food but made no other calls it stopped ringing good wrong number she walked to the bathroom and it was ringing again she counted after the fourteenth ring she lifted the receiver hello darby its gavin verheek are you okay she sat on the bed howd you get the number we have ways listen have wait gavin wait a minute let me think the credit card right yes the credit card the paper trail its the fbi darby we have ways ifsnot that difficult then they could do it too i suppose stay in the small joints and pay with cash there was a thick knot in her stomach and she stretched on the bed just like that not difficult the paper trail she could be dead killed along the paper trail darby are you there yes she looked at the door to make sure it was chained yes im here are you safe i thought so weve got some information

decision yesterday to back off the pelican brief and gave instructions to leave it alone thats all i can tell you thats not very much does he know about thomas does he know that im supposed to be dead because i wrote it and fortyeight hours after thomas gave it to you his old buddy from law school they whoever in hell they are tried to kill both of us does he know all this gavin i dont think so that means no doesnt it yes it means no okay listen to me do you think he was killed because of the brief probably that means yes doesnt it yes thanks if thomas was murdered because of the brief then we know who killed him and if we know who killed thomas then we know who killed rosenberg and jensen right verheek hesitated just say yes dammit darby snapped ill say probably fine probably means yes for a lawyer i know its the best you can do its a very strong probably yet youre telling me the fbi is backing off my little suspect settle down darby lets meet tonight and talk about it i could save your life she carefully laid the receiver under a pillow and walked to the bathroom she brushed her teeth and what was left of her hair then threw the toiletries and change of clothes into a new canvas bag she put on the parka cap and sunglasses and quietly closed the door behind her the hall was empty she walked up two flights to the seventeenth then took the elevator to the tenth then casually walked down ten flights to the lobby the door from the stairway opened near the rest rooms and she was quickly inside the womens the lobby appeared to be deserted she went to a stall locked the door and waited for a while friday morning in the quarter the air was cool and clean without the lingering smell of food and sin eight amtoo early for people she walked a few blocks to clear her head and plan the day on dumaine near jackson square she found a coffee shop shed seen before it was nearly empty and had a pay phone in the back she poured her own thick coffee and set it on a table near the phone she could talk here verheek was on the phone in less than a minute im listening he said where will you stay tonight she asked watching the front door hilton by the river i know where it is ill call late tonight or early in the morning dont track me again im into cash now no plastic thats smart darby keep moving i may be dead by the time you get here no you wont can you find a washington post down there maybe why get one quick this mornings nice little story about rosenberg and jensen and perhaps who done it i cant wait ill call later the first newsstand did not have the post she zigzagged toward canal covering her tracks watching her rear down st ann along the antique shops on royal through the seedy bars on both sides of bienville and finally to the french market along decatur and north peters she was quick but nonchalant she walked with an air of business her eyes darting in all directions behind the shades if they were back there somewhere in the shadows watching and keeping up they were good she bought a post and a timespicayune from a sidewalk vendor and found a table in a deserted corner of cafe du monde front page citing a confidential source the story dwelt on the legend of khamel and his sudden involvement in the killings in his younger days it said he had killed for his beliefs but now he just did it for money lots of money speculated a retired intelligence expert who allowed himself to be quoted but certainly not identified the photos were blurred and indistinct but ominous beside each other they could not be of the same person but then said the expert he was unidentifiable and had not been photographed in over a decade a waiter finally made it by and she ordered coffee and a plain bagel the expert said many thought he was dead interpol believed he had killed as recently as six months ago the expert doubted he would travel by commercial air the fbi had him at the top of their list she opened the new orleans paper slowly thomas did not make page one but his picture was on page two with a long story the cops were treating it as a homicide but there wasnt much to go on a white female had been seen in the area shortly before the explosion the law school was in shock according to the dean the cops said little services were tomorrow on campus a horrible mistake had been made the dean said if it was murder then someone had obviously killed the wrong person her eyes were wet and suddenly she was afraid again maybe it was simply a mistake it was a violent city with crazy people and maybe someone got their wires crossed and the wrong car was chosen maybe there was no one out there stalking her she put the sunglasses on and looked at his photo they had pulled it from the law school annual and there was that smirk he habitually wore when he was the professor he was clean shaven and so handsome granthams khamel story electrified washington friday morning it mentioned neither the memo nor the white house so the hottest game in town was speculating about the source the game was especially hot in the hoover building in the office of the director eric east and k o lewis paced nervously about while voyles talked to the president for the third time in two hours voyles was cussing not directly at the president but all around him he cussed coal and when the president cussed back voyles suggested they set up the polygraph strap in everyone on his staff beginning with coal and just see where the damned leaks were coming from yes hell yes he voyles would take the test and so would everyone who worked in the hoover building and they cussed back and forth voyles was red and sweating and the fact that he was yelling into the telephone and the president was on the other end receiving all this mattered not a bit he knew coal was listening somewhere evidently the president gained control of the conversation and launched into a longwinded sermon of some sort voyles wiped his forehead with a handkerchief sat in his ancient leather swivel and began controlled breathing to lower the pressure and pulse he had survived one heart attack and was due for another and had told k o lewis many times that fletcher coal and his idiot boss would eventually kill him but hed said that about the last three presidents he pinched the fat wrinkles on his forehead and sunk lower into the chair we can do that mr president he was almost pleasant now he was a man of swift and radical mood swings and suddenly before their eyes he was courteous a real charmerthank you mr president ill be there tomorrow he hung up gently and spoke with his eyes closed he wants us to place that post reporter under surveillance says weve done it before so will we do it again i told him we would what type of surveillance asked ko lets just follow him in the city around the clock with two men see where he goes at night who he sleeps with hes single isnt he divorced seven years ago lewis answered make damned sure we dont get caught do it with plainclothes and switch em up every three days does he really believe the leaks are coming from us no i dont think so if we were leaking why would he want us to trail the reporter i think he knows its his own people and he wants to catch them its a small favor lewis added helpfully yeah just dont get caught okay the office of l matthew barr was tucked away on the third floor of a tacky and decaying office building on m street in georgetown there were no signs on the doors an armed guard in a coat and tie turned people away at the elevator the carpet was worn and the furniture was old dust covered it and it was apparent the unit spent no money on housekeeping barr ran the unit which was an unofficial hidden little division of the committee to reeled the president crp had a vast suite of plush offices across the river in rosslyn it had windows that opened and secretaries who smiled and maids that cleaned every night but not this dump fletcher coal stepped off the elevator and nodded at the security guard who nodded back without making another move they were old acquaintances he made his way through the small maze of dingy offices in the direction of barrs coal took pride in being honest with himself and he honestly did not fear any man in washington maybe with the possible exception of matthew barr sometimes he feared him sometimes not but he always admired him barr was an exmarine excia exspy with two felony convictions for security scams from which he earned millions and buried the money he had served a few months in one of the country clubs but no real time coal had personally recruited barr to head the unit which officially did not exist it had an annual budget of four million all cash from various slush funds and barr supervised a small band of highly trained thugs who quietly did the work of the unit barrs door was always locked he opened it and coal entered the meeting would be brief as usual let me guess barr startedyou want to find the leak in a way yes i want you to follow this reporter grantham around the clock and see who hes talking to hes getting some awfully good stuff and im afraid its coming from us youre leaking like cardboard weve got some problems but the khamel story was a plant did it myself barr smiled at this i thought so it seemed too clean and pat did you ever run across khamel no ten years ago we were sure he was dead he likes it that way he has no ego so hell never get caught he can live in a paper shack in sao paulo for six months eating roots and rats then fly off to rome to murder a diplomat then off to singapore for a few months he doesnt read his press clippings how old is he why are you interested im fascinated i think i know who hired him to kill rosenberg and jensen oh really can you share this bit of gossip no not yet hes between forty and fortyfive which is not that old but he killed a lebanese general when he was fifteen so hes had a long career this is all legend you understand he can kill with either hand either foot a car key a pencil whatever hes an expert marksman with all weapons speaks twelve languages youve heard all this havent you yeah but its fun okay hes believed to be the most proficient and expensive assassin in the world in his early years he was just another terrorist but he was much too talented for simple bomb throwing so he became an assassin for hire hes a bit older now and kills just for money how much money good question hes probably in the tentotwentymillionajob range and theres not but one other guy i know of in that league one theory believes he shares it with other terrorist groups no one knows really let me guess you want me to find khamel and bring him back alive you leave khamel alone i sort of like the work he did here hes very talented i want you to follow gray grantham and find out who hes talking to any ideas a couple theres a man by the name of milton hardy who works as a janitor in the west wing coal threw an envelope on the desk hes been around for a long time appears to be half blind but i think he sees and hears a lot follow him for a week or two everyone calls him sarge make plans to take him out this is great coal were spending all this money to track blind negroes just do as i say make it three weeks coal stood and headed for the door so you know who hired the killer barr said were getting close the unit is more than anxious to help im sure mrs chen owned the duplex and had been renting the other half to female law students for fifteen years she was picky but private and lived and let live as long as all was quiet it was six blocks from campus it was dark when she answered the door the person on the porch was an attractive young lady with short dark hair and a nervous smile very nervous mrs chen frowned at her until she spoke im alice stark a friend of darbys may i come in she glanced over her shoulder the street was quiet and still mrs chen lived alone with the doors and windows locked tightly but she was a pretty girl with an innocent smile and if she was a friend of darbys then she could be trusted she opened the door and alice was inside somethings wrong mrs chen said yes darby is in a bit of trouble but we cant talk about it did she call this afternoon yes she said a young woman would look through her apartment alice breathed deeply and tried to appear calm itll just take a minute she said there was a door through a wall somewhere i prefer not to use the front or rear doors mrs chen frowned and her eyes asked why not but she said nothing has anyone been in the apartment in the last two days alice asked she followed mrs chen down a narrow hallway ive seen no one there was a knock early yesterday before the sun but i didnt look she moved a table away from a door pushed a key around and opened it alice stepped in front of her she wanted me to go in alone okay mrs chen wanted to check it out but she nodded and closed the door behind alice it opened into a tiny hallway that was suddenly dark to the left was the den and a light switch that couldnt be used alice froze in the darkness the apartment was black and hot with a thick smell of old garbage shed expected to be alone but she was a secondyear law student dammit not some hotshot private detective get a grip she fumbled through a large purse and found a pencilthin flashlight there were three of them in there just in case in case of what she didnt know darby had been quite specific no lights could be seen through the windows they could be watching who in hell are they alice wanted to know darby didnt know said she would explain it later but first the apartment had to be examined alice had been in the apartment a dozen times in the past year but shed been allowed to enter through the front door with a full array of lights and other conveniences she had been in all the rooms and felt confident she could feel around in the darkness the confidence was gone vanished replaced with trembling fear get a grip youre all alone they wouldnt camp out here with a nosy woman next door if they had indeed been here it was only for a brief visit after staring at the end of it she determined that the flashlight worked it glowed with all the energy of a fading match she pointed it at the floor and saw a faint round circle the size of a small orange the circle was shaking she tiptoed around a corner in the direction of the den darby said there was a small lamp on the bookshelves next to the television and that the light was always on she used it as a nightlight and it was supposed to cast a faint glow across the den to the kitchen either darby lied or the bulb was gone or someone had unscrewed it it didnt matter really at this point because the den and kitchen were pitchblack she was on the rug in the center of the den inching toward the kitchen table where there was supposed to be a computer she kicked the edge of the coffee table and the flashlight quit she shook it nothing she found number two in the purse the odor was heavier in the kitchen the computer was on the table along with an assortment of empty files and casebooks she examined the mainframe with her dinky little light the power switch was on the front she pushed it and the monochrome screen slowly warmed up it emitted a greenish light that covered the table but did not escape the kitchen alice sat down in front of the keyboard and began pecking she found menu then list then files the directory covered the screen she studied it closely there were supposed to be somewhere around forty entries but she saw no more than ten most of the harddrive memory was gone she turned on the laser printer and within seconds the directory was on paper she tore it off and stuffed it in the purse she stood with her flashlight and inspected the clutter around the computer darby estimated the number of floppy disks at twenty but they were all gone not a single floppy the casebooks were for con law and civil procedure and so dull and generic no one would want them the red expandable files were stacked neatly together but empty it was a clean patient job he or they had spent a couple of hours erasing and gathering then left with no more than one briefcase or bag of goods in the den by the television alice peeked out the side window the red accord was still there not four feet from the window it looked fine she twisted the bulb in the nightlight and quickly flicked the switch on then off worked perfectly she unscrewed it just as he or they had left it her eyes had focused she could see the outlines of doors and furniture she turned the computer off and eased through the den to the hall mrs chen was waiting exactly where shed left her okay she asked everythings fine alice said just watch it real close ill call you in a day or two to see if anyone has been by and please dont tell anyone i was here mrs chen listened intently as she moved the table in front of the door what about her car itll be fine just watch it is she all right they were in the den almost to the front door shes gonna be fine i think shell be back in a few days thank you mrs chen mrs chen closed the door bolted it and watched from the small window the lady was on the sidewalk then gone in the darkness alice walked three blocks to her car friday night in the quarter tulane played in the dome tomorrow then the saints on sunday and the rowdies were out by the thousands parking everywhere blocking streets roaming in noisy mobs drinking from go cups crowding bars just having a delightful time raising hell and enjoying themselves the inner quarter was gridlocked by nine alice parked on poydras far away from where she wanted to park and was an hour late when she arrived at the crowded oyster bar on st peter deep in the quarter there were no tables they were packed three deep at the bar she retreated to a corner with a cigarette machine and surveyed the people most were students in town for the game a waiter walked directly to her are you looking for another female he asked she hesitated well yes he pointed beyond the bararound the corner first room on the right theres some small tables i think your friend is there darby was in a tiny booth crouched over a beer bottle with sunglasses and a hat alice squeezed her hand its good to see you she studied the hairdo and was amused by it darby removed the sunglasses the eyes were red and tired i didnt know who else to call alice listened with a blank face unable to think of something appropriate and unable to take her eyes off the hair who did the hair she asked nice huh its sort of the punk look which i think is making a comeback and will certainly impress folks when i start interviewing for a job why someone tried to kill me alice my names on a list that some very nasty people are holding i think theyre following me kill did you say kill who would want to kill you darby im not sure what about my apartment alice stopped looking at the hair and handed her the printout of the directory darby studied it it was real this was not a dream or a mistake the bomb had found the right car rupert and the cowboy had had their hands on her the face she had seen was looking for her they had gone to her apartment and erased what they wanted to erase they were out there what about floppies none not a single one the expandable files on the kitchen table were placed together real neat and are real empty everything else appears to be in order they unscrewed the bulb in the nightlight so theres total darkness i checked it works fine these are very patient people what about mrs chen shes seen nothing darby stuffed the printout into a pocket look alice suddenly im very scared you dont need to be seen with me maybe this was not a good idea who are these people i dont know they killed thomas and they tried to kill me i got lucky and now theyre after me but why darby you dont want to know and im not going to tell the more you know the more danger youre in trust me alice i cant tell you what i know but i wont tell i swear what if they make you tell alice glanced around as if all was fine she studied her friend they had been close since freshman orientation they had studied hours together shared notes sweated exams teamed up for mock trials gossiped about men alice was hopefully the only student who knew about darby and callahan i want to help darby im not afraid darby had not touched the beer she slowly spun the bottle well im terrified i was there when he died alice the ground shook he was blown to pieces and i was supposed to be with him it was intended for me then go to the cops not yet maybe later im afraid to thomas went to the fbi and two days later we were supposed to be dead so the fbi is after you i dont think so they started talking and someone was listening very closely and it found the wrong ears talked about what come on darby its me your best friend stop playing games darby took the first tiny swallow from the bottle eye contact was avoided she stared at the table please alice allow me to wait theres no sense telling you something that could get you killed a long pause if you want to help go to the memorial service tomorrow watch everything spread the word that i called you from denver where im staying with an aunt with a name you dont know and that ive dropped out this semester but ill be back in the spring make sure that rumor gets started i think some people will be listening carefully okay the paper mentioned a white female near the scene when he was killed as if she might be a suspect or something or something i was there and i was supposed to be a victim im reading the papers with a magnifying glass the cops are clueless okay darby youre smarter than i am youre smarter than every person ive ever met so what now first go out the back door theres a white door at the end of the hall where the rest rooms are it goes into a storage room then to the kitchen then out the back door dont stop the alley leads to royal catch a cab and ride back to your car watch your rear are you serious look at this hair alice would i mutilate myself like this if i was playing games okay okay then what go to the service tomorrow start the rumor and ill call you within two days where are you staying here and there i move around a lot alice stood and pecked her on the cheek then she was gone for two hours verheek stomped the floor picking up magazines tossing them around ordering room service unpacking stomping then for the next two hours he sat on the bed sipping a hot beer and staring at the phone he would do this until midnight he told himself and then well then what she said she would call he could save her life if she would only call at midnight he threw another magazine and left the room an agent in the new orleans office had helped a little and given him a couple of law school hangouts close to campus he would go there and mix and mingle drink a beer and listen the students were in town for the game she wouldnt be there and it wouldnt matter because hed never seen her but maybe he would hear something and he could drop a name leave a card make a friend who knew her or maybe knew someone who knew her a long shot but a helluva lot more productive than staring at the phone he found a seat at the bar in a joint called barristers three blocks from campus it had a nice little varsity look to it with football schedules and pinups on the walls the crowd was rowdy and under thirty the bartender looked like a student after two beers the crowd thinned and the bar was half empty there would be another wave in a moment verheek ordered number three it was onethirty are you a law student he asked the bartender afraid so its not that bad is it he was wiping around the peanuts ive had more fun verheek longed for the bartenders who served his beer in law school those guys knew the art of conversation never met a stranger talk about anything im a lawyer verheek said in desperation oh hey wow this guys a lawyer how rare someone special the kid walked off little son of a bitch i hope you flunk out verheek grabbed his bottle and turned to face the tables he felt like a grandfather amid the children though he hated law school and the memories of it there had been some long friday nights in the bars of georgetown with his pal callahan those were good memories so what kind of law the bartender was back gavin turned to the bar and smiled special counsel fbi he was still wiping so youre in washington yeah in town for the game sunday im a redskins freak he hated the redskins and every other organized football team dont get the kid started on footballwhere do you go to school here tulane ill finish in may then where probably cincinnati for a clerkship for a year or two you must be a good student he shrugged it off you need a beer no did you have thomas callahan sure you know him i was in law school with him at georgetown verheek pulled a card from his pocket and handed it to the kid im gavin verheek the kid looked at it then politely laid it next to the ice the bar was quiet and the kid was tired of chitchat do you know a student by the name of darby shaw the kid glanced at the tables no i havent met her but i know who she is i think shes second year a long rather suspicious pause why we need to talk to her we as in fbi not simply he as in gavin verheek the we part sounded much graverdoes she hang out in here ive seen her a few times shes hard to miss ive heard gavin looked at the tablesdo you think these guys might know her doubt it theyre all first year cant you tell theyre over there arguing property rights and search and seizure yeah those were the days gavin pulled a dozen cards from his pocket and laid them on the barill be at the hilton for a few days if you see her or hear anything drop one of these sure there was a cop in last night asking questions you dont think she was involved in his death no not at all we just need to talk to her ill keep my eyes open verheek paid for the beer thanked the kid again and was on the sidewalk he walked three blocks to the half shell it was almost two he was dead tired half drunk and a band cranked up the second he walked through the door the place was dark packed and fifty fraternity joes with their sorority sues were immediately dancing on tables he weaved through the uprising and found safety in the back near the bar they were three deep shoulder to shoulder and no one moved he clawed his way forward got a beer to be cool and realized again he was by far the oldest one there he retreated to a dark but crowded corner it was hopeless he couldnt hear himself think let alone carry on a conversation he watched the bartenders all young all students the oldest looked late twenties and he rang up check after check as if he was closing out his moves were hurried as if it was time to go gavin studied every move he quickly untied his apron flung it in a corner ducked under the bar and was gone gavin elbowed through the mob and caught him as he stepped through the kitchen door he had an fbi business card ready im sorry im with the fbi he stuck the card in his faceyour name is the kid froze and looked wildly at verheek uh fountain jeff fountain fine jeff look nothings wrong okay just a couple of questions the kitchen had shut down hours ago and they were alonejust take a second well okay whats up youre a law student right please say yes his friend said most of the bartenders here were law students yes at loyola loyola where the hell yeah well thats what i thought youve heard about professor callahan at tulane funerals tomorrow sure its all over the papers most of my friends go to tulane do you know a secondyear student there by the name of darby shaw very attractive female fountain smiledyeah she dated a friend of mine last year shes in here occasionally how long ago its been a month or two whats wrong we need to talk to her he handed fountain a stack of cardshang on to these ill be at the hilton for a few days if you see her around or if you hear anything drop one of these what might i hear something about callahan we need to see her real bad okay sure he stuck the cards in a pocket verheek thanked him and returned to the revelry he inched through the mob listening to the attempts at conversation a fresh mob was entering and he wrestled his way out the door he was too old for this six blocks away he parked illegally in front of a fraternity house next to the campus his last stop for the night would be a dark little pool hall which at the moment was not crowded he paid for beer at the bar and surveyed the place there were four pool tables and the action was light a young man in a tshirt walked to the bar and ordered another beer the shirt was green and gray with the words tulane law school stamped across the front with what appeared to be an inmate identification number under the words verheek spoke without hesitating you a law student the young man glanced at him while pulling money from his jeans afraid so did you know thomas callahan who are you fbi callahan was a friend of mine the student sipped the beer and was suspicious i was in his con law class bingo so was darby verheek tried to appear uninterested do you know darby shaw why do you want to know we need to talk to her thats all who is we the student was even more suspicious he took a step closer to gavin as if he wanted some hard answers fbi verheek said nonchalantly you got a badge or something sure he said as he pulled a card from his pocket the student read it carefully then handed it back youre a lawyer not an agent this was a very valid point and the lawyer knew he would lose his job if his boss knew he was asking questions and in general impersonating an agent yes im a lawyer callahan and i were in law school together then why do you want to see darby shaw the bartender had eased closer and was eavesdropping do you know her i dont know the student said and it was obvious he did in fact know her but was not about to talk is she in trouble no you know her dont you maybe maybe not look whats your name show me a badge and ill tell you my name gavin took a long drink from the bottle and smiled at the bartender i need to see her okay its very important ill be at the hilton for a few days if you see her ask her to call he offered the card to the student who looked at it and walked away at three he unlocked the door to his room and checked the phone no messages wherever darby was she still had not called assuming of course she was still alive garcia called for the last time grantham took the call before dawn saturday less than two hours before they were to meet for the first time he was backing out he said the time was not right if the story broke then some very powerful lawyers and their very rich clients would fall hard and these people were not accustomed to falling and they would take people with them and garcia might get hurt he had a wife and little daughter he had a job that he could endure because the money was great why take chances he had done nothing wrong his conscience was clear then why do you keep calling me grantham asked i think i know why they were killed im not certain but ive got a good idea i saw something okay weve had this conversation for a week now garcia you saw something or you have something and its all useless unless you show it to me grantham opened a file and took out the five by sevens of the man on the phoneyoure driven by a sense of morality garcia thats why you want to talk yeah but theres a chance they know that i know theyve been treating me funny as if they want to ask if i saw it but they cant ask because theyre not sure these are the guys in your firm yeah no wait howd you know i was in a firm i havent told you that its easy you go to work too early to be a government lawyer youre in one of those twohundredlawyer firms where they expect the associates and junior partners to work a hundred hours a week the first time you called me you said you were on the way to the office and it was something like am well well what else do you know not much were playing games garcia if youre not willing to talk then hang up and leave me alone im losing sleep sweet dreams garcia hung up grantham stared at the receiver three times in the past eight years he had unlisted his phone number he lived by the phone and his biggest stories came out of nowhere over the phone but after or during each big one there had been a thousand insignificant ones from sources who felt compelled to call at all hours of the night with their hot little morsels he was known as a reporter who would face a firing squad before revealing a source so they called and called and called hed get sick of it and get a new unlisted number then hit a dry spell then rush to get back in the bc directory he was there now gray s grantham the only one in the book they could get him at work twelve hours a day but it was so much more secretive and private to call him at home especially at odd hours when he was trying to sleep he fumed over garcia for thirty minutes then fell asleep he was in a rhythm and dead to the world when it rang again he found it in the darkness hello it was not garcia it was a female is this gray grantham with the washington post it is and who are you are you still on the story about rosenberg and jensen he sat in the darkness and stared at the clock fivethirty its a big story weve got a lot of people on it but yes im investigating have you heard of the pelican brief he breathed deeply and tried to think the pelican brief no what is it its a harmless little theory about who killed them it was taken to washington last sunday by a man named thomas callahan a professor of law at tulane he gave it to a friend with the fbi and it was passed around things snowballed and callahan was killed in a car bombing wednesday night in new orleans the lamp was on and he was scribbling where are you calling from new orleans a pay phone so dont bother how do you know all this i wrote the brief he was wide awake now wildeyed and breathing rapidlyokay if you wrote it tell me about it i dont want to do it that way because even if you had a copy you couldnt run the story try me you couldnt itll take some thorough verification okay weve got the klan the terrorist khamel the underground army the aryans the nope none of the above theyre a bit obvious the brief is about an obscure suspect he was pacing at the foot of the bed holding the phone why cant you tell me who it is maybe later you seem to have these magical sources lets see what you find callahan will be easy to check out thats one phone call give me twentyfour hours ill try to call monday morning if were gonna do business mr grantham you must show me something the next time i call tell me something i dont know she was at a pay phone in the dark are you in danger he asked i think so but im okay for now she sounded young midtwenties maybe she wrote a brief she knew the law professor are you a lawyer no and dont spend your time digging after me youve got work to do mr grantham or ill go elsewhere fine you need a name ive got one i mean a code name you mean like spies and all gee this could be fun either that or give me your real name nice try just call me pelican his parents were good irish catholics but he had sort of quit many years ago they were a handsome couple dignified in mourning well tanned and dressed he had seldom mentioned them they walked handinhand with the rest of the family into rogers chapel his brother from mobile was shorter and looked much older thomas said he had a drinking problem for half an hour students and faculty had streamed into the small chapel the game was tonight and there was a nice crowd on campus a television van was parked in the street a cameraman kept a respectable distance and shot the front of the chapel a campus policeman watched him carefully and kept him in place it was odd seeing these law students with dresses and heels and coats and ties in a dark room on the third floor of newcomb hall the pelican sat with her face to the window and watched the students mill about and speak softly and finish their cigarettes under her chair were four newspapers already read and discarded shed been there for two hours reading by sunlight and waiting on the service there was no other place to be she was certain the bad guys were lurking in the bushes around the chapel but she was learning patience she had come early would stay late and move in the shadows if they found her maybe they would do it quick and it would be over she gripped a wadded paper towel and dried her eyes it was okay to cry now but this was the last one the people were all inside and the television van left the paper said it was a memorial service with private burial later there was no casket inside she had selected this moment to run to rent a car and drive to baton rouge then jump on the first plane headed to any place except new orleans she would get out of the country perhaps montreal or calgary she would hide there for a year and hope the crime would be solved and the bad guys put away but it was a dream the quickest route to justice ran smack through her she knew more than anyone the fibbies had circled close then backed off and were now chasing who knows who verheek had gotten nowhere and he was close to the director she would have to piece it together her little brief had killed thomas and now they were after her she knew the identity of the man behind the murders of rosenberg and jensen and callahan and this knowledge made her rather unique suddenly she leaned forward the tears dried on her cheeks there he was the thin man with the narrow face he was wearing a coat and tie and looked properly mournful as he walked quickly to the chapel it was him the man shed last seen in the lobby of the sheraton on when was it thursday morning shed been talking to verheek when he strolled suspiciously through he stopped at the door jerked his head nervously around he was a klutz really a giveaway he stared for a second at three cars parked innocently on the street less than fifty yards away he opened the door and was in the chapel beautiful the bastards killed him and now they joined his family and friends for last respects her nose touched the window the cars were too far away but she was certain there was a man in one watching for her surely they knew she was not so dumb and so heartbroken as to show up and mourn her lover they knew that she had eluded them for two and a half days the tears were gone ten minutes later the thin man came out by himself lit a cigarette and strolled with hands stuck deep in his pockets toward the three cars he was sad what a guy he walked in front of the cars but did not stop when he was out of sight a door opened and a man in a green tulane sweatshirt emerged from the middle car he walked down the street after the thin one he was not thin he was short thick and powerful a regular stump he disappeared down the sidewalk behind the thin man be hind the chapel darby poised on the edge of the folding chair within a minute they emerged on the sidewalk from behind the building they were together now whispering but for only a moment because the thin man peeled off and disappeared down the street stump walked quickly to his car and got in he just sat there waiting for the service to break up and get one last look at the crowd on the off chance that she was in fact stupid enough to show up it had taken less than ten minutes for the thin man to sneak inside scan the crowd of say two hundred people and determine she was not there perhaps he was looking for the red hair or bleached blond no it made more sense for them to have people already in there sitting around prayerfully and looking sad looking for her or anyone who might resemble her they could nod or shake or wink at the thin man this place was crawling with them havana was a perfect sanctuary it mattered not if ten or a hundred countries had bounties on his throat fidel was an admirer and occasional client they drank together shared women and smoked cigars he had the run of the place a nice little apartment on calle de torre in the old section a car with a driver a banker who was a wizard at blitzing money around the world any size boat he wanted a military plane if needed and plenty of young women he spoke the language and his skin was not pale he loved the place he had once agreed to kill fidel but couldnt do it he was in place and two hours away from the murder but just wouldnt pull it off there was too much admiration it was back in the days when he did not always kill for money he pulled a double cross and confessed to fidel they faked an ambush and word spread that the great khamel had been gunned down in the streets of havana never again would he travel by commercial air the photographs in paris were embarrassing for such a professional he was losing his touch getting careless in the twilight of his career got his picture on the front pages in america how shameful his client was not pleased the boat was a fortyfoot schooner with two crew members and a young woman all cubans she was below in the cabin he had finished with her a few minutes before they saw the lights of biloxi he was all business now inspecting his raft packing his bag saying nothing the crew members crouched on the deck and stayed away from him at exactly nine they lowered the raft onto the water he dropped his bag into it and was gone they heard the trolling motor as he disappeared into the blackness of the sound they were to remain anchored until dawn then haul it back to havana they held perfect papers declaring them to be americans in the event they were discovered and someone began asking questions he eased patiently through the still water dodging buoy lights and the sight of an occasional small craft he held perfect papers too and three weapons in the bag it had been years since he struck twice in one month after he was allegedly gunned down in cuba there had been a fiveyear drought patience was his forte he averaged one a year and this little victim would go unnoticed no one would suspect him it was such a small job but his client was adamant and he happened to be in the neighborhood and the money was right so here he was in another sixfoot rubber raft cruising toward a beach hoping like hell his pal luke would be there dressed not as a farmer but a fisherman this time this would be the last for a long time maybe forever he had more money than he could ever spend or give away and he had started making small mistakes he saw the pier in the distance and moved away from it he had thirty minutes to waste he followed the shoreline for a quarter of a mile then headed for it two hundred yards out he turned off the trolling motor unhitched it and dropped it into the water he lay low in the raft worked a plastic oar when necessary and gently guided himself to a dark spot behind a row of cheap brick buildings thirty feet ashore he stood in two feet of water and ripped holes in the raft with a small pocketknife it sank and disappeared the beach was deserted luke was alone at the end of the pier it was exactly eleven and he was in place with a rod and reel he wore a white cap and the bill moved slowly back and forth as he scanned the water in search of the raft he checked his watch suddenly a man was beside him appearing from nowhere like an angel luke the man said this was not the code luke was startled he had a gun in the tackle box at his feet but there was no way sam he asked maybe he had missed something maybe khamel couldnt find the pier from the raft yes luke its me sorry about the deviation trouble with the raft lukes heart settled and he breathed relief wheres the vehicle khamel asked luke glanced at him ever so quickly yes it was khamel and he was staring at the ocean behind dark glasses luke nodded at a building red pontiac next to the liquor store how far to new orleans half an hour luke said as he reeled in nothing khamel stepped back and hit him twice at the base of the neck once with each hand the vertebrae burst and snapped the spinal cord luke fell hard and moaned once khamel watched him die then found the keys in a pocket he kicked the corpse off into the water edwin sneller or whatever his name was did not open the door but quietly slid the key under it khamel picked it up and opened the door to the next room he walked in and moved quickly to the bed where he placed his bag then to the window where the curtains were open and the river was in the distance he pulled the curtains together and studied the lights of the french quarter below he walked to the phone and punched snellers number tell me about her khamel said softly to the floor there are two photos in the briefcase khamel opened it and removed the photos ive got them theyre numbered one and two one we got from the law school yearbook its about a year old and the most current we have its a blowup from a tiny picture so we lost a lot of detail the other photo is two years old we lifted it from a yearbook at arizona state khamel held both picturesa beautiful woman yes quite beautiful all that lovely hair is gone though thursday night she paid for a hotel room with a credit card we barely missed her friday morning we found long strands of hair on the floor and a small sample of something we now know to be black hair color very black what a shame we havent seen her since wednesday night shes proven to be elusive credit card for a room wednesday credit card at another hotel thursday then nothing from last night she withdrew five thousand in cash from her checking account friday afternoon so the trail has become cold maybe shes gone could be but i dont think so someone was in her apartment last night weve got the place wired and we were late by two minutes moving sort of slow arent you its a big town weve camped out at the airport and train station were watching her mothers house in idaho no sign i think shes still here where would she be moving around changing hotels using pay phones staying away from the usual places the new orleans police are looking for her they talked to her after the bomb wednesday then lost her were looking theyre looking shell turn up what happened with the bomb very simple she didnt get in the car who made the bomb sneller hesitated cant say khamel smiled slightly as he took some street maps from the briefcasetell me about the maps oh just a few points of interest around town her place his place the law school the hotels shes been to the bomb site a few little bars she enjoys as a student shes stayed in the quarter so far shes smart there are a million places to hide khamel picked up the most recent photo and sat on the other bed he liked this face even with short dark hair it would be an intriguing face he could kill it but it would not be pleasant its a shame isnt it he said almost to himself yes its a shame gavin verheek had been a tired old man when he arrived in new orleans and after two nights ofbarhopping he was drained and weakened he had hit the first bar not long after the burial and for seven hours had sipped beer with the young and restless while talking of torts and contracts and wall street firms and other things he despised he knew he shouldnt tell strangers he was fbi he wasnt fbi there was no badge he prowled five or six bars saturday night tulane lost again and after the game the bars filled with rowdies things got hopeless and he quit at midnight he was sleeping hard with his shoes on when the phone rang he lunged for it hello hello gavin she asked darby is this you who else why havent you called before now please dont start asking a bunch of stupid questions im at a pay phone so no funny stuff come on darby i swear you can trust me okay i trust you now what he looked at his watch and began untying his shoelaces well you tell me whats next how long do you plan to hide in new orleans how do you know im in new orleans he paused for a second im in new orleans she said and i assume you want me to meet with you and become close friends then come in as you say and trust you guys to protect me forever thats correct youll be dead in a matter of days if you dont get right to the point dont you yes youre playing games and you dont know what youre doing whos after me gavin could be a number of people who are they i dont know now youre playing games gavin how can i trust you if you wont talk to me okay i think its safe to say your little brief hit someone in the gut you guessed right the wrong people learned of the brief and now thomas is dead and theyll kill you the instant they find you we know who killed rosenberg and jensen dont we gavin i think we do then why doesnt the fbi do something we may be in the midst of a coverup bless you for saying that bless you i could lose my job who would i tell gavin whos covering up what im not sure we were very interested in the brief until the white house pressed hard now weve dismissed it i can understand that why do they think they can kill me and it will be kept quiet i cant answer that maybe they think you know more can i tell you something moments after the bomb while thomas was in the car burning and i was semiconscious a cop named rupert took me to his car and put me inside another cop with cowboy boots and jeans started asking me questions i was sick and in shock they disappeared rupert and his cow boy and they never returned they were not cops gavin they watched the bomb and went to plan b when i wasnt in the car i didnt know it but i was probably a minute or two away from a bullet in the head verheek listened with his eyes closed what happened to them not sure i think they got scared when the real cops swarmed on the scene they vanished i was in their car gavin they had me you have to come in darby listen to me do you remember our phone chat thursday morning when i suddenly saw a face that looked familiar and i described it to you of course that face was at the memorial service yesterday along with some friends where were you watching he walked in a few minutes late stayed ten minutes then sneaked out and met with stump stump yes hes one of the gang stump rupert cowboy and the thin man great characters im sure there are others but i havent met them yet the next meeting will be the last darby you have about fortyeight hours to live well see how long will you be in town a few days id planned to stay until i found you here i am i may call you tomorrow verheek breathed deeply okay darby whatever you say just be careful she hung up he threw the phone across the room and cursed it two blocks away and fifteen floors up khamel stared at the television and mumbled rapidly to himself it was a movie about people in a big city they spoke english his third language and he repeated every word in his best generic american tongue he did this for hours he had absorbed the language while hiding in belfast and in the past twenty years had watched thousands of american movies his favorite was three days of the condor he watched it four times before he figured out who was killing whom and why he could have killed redford he repeated every word out loud he had been told his english could pass for that of an american but one slip one tiny mistake and she would be gone the volvo was parked in a lot a block and a half from its owner who paid one hundred dollars a month for the space and for what he thought was security they eased through the gate that was supposed to be locked it was a gl without a security system and within seconds the drivers door was open one sat on the trunk and lit a cigarette it was almost am sunday the other one opened a small tool case he kept in his pocket and went to work on the yuppie car phone that grantham had been embarrassed to buy the dome light was enough and he worked quickly easy work with the receiver open he installed a tiny transmitter and glued it in place a minute later he eased out of the car and squatted at the rear bumper the one with the cigarette handed him a small black cube which he stuck under the car to a grille and behind the gas tank it was a magnetized transmitter and it would send signals for six days before it died and needed replacing they were gone in less than seven minutes monday as soon as he was spotted entering the post building on fifteenth they would enter his apartment and fix his phones part her second night in the bed and breakfast was better than the first she slept until midmorning maybe she was used to it now she stared at the curtains over the tiny window and determined that there had been no nightmares no movements in the dark with guns and knives emerging and attacking it was a thick heavy sleep and she studied the curtains for a long time while the brain woke up she tried to be disciplined about her thinking this was her fourth day as the pelican and to see number five she would have to think like a fastidious killer it was day number four of the rest of her life she was supposed to be dead but after the eyes opened and she realized she was indeed alive and safe and the door wasnt squeaking and the floor wasnt cracking and there was no gunman lurking in the closet her first thought was always of thomas the shock of his death was fading and she found it easier to put aside the sound of the explosion and the roar of the fire she knew he had been blown to pieces and killed instantly she knew he did not suffer so she thought of other things like the feel of him next to her and his whispering and snickering when they were in bed and the sex was over and he wanted to cuddle he was a cuddler and he wanted to play and kiss and caress after the lovemaking and giggle he loved her madly had fallen hard and for the first time in his life could be silly with a woman many times in the middle of his lectures she had thought of his cooing and snickering and bit her lip to keep from smiling she loved him too and it hurt so badly she wanted to stay in bed and cry for a week the day after her fathers funeral a psychiatrist had explained that the soul needs a brief very intense period of grieving then it moves to the next phase but it must have the pain it must suffer without restraint before it can properly move on she took his advice and grieved without courage for two weeks then got tired of it and moved to the next stage it worked but it wasnt working with thomas she couldnt scream and throw things the way she wanted rupert and thin man and the rest of the boys were denying her a healthy mourning after a few minutes of thomas she thought of them next where would they be today where could she go without being seen after two nights in this place should she find another room yes she would do that after dark she would call and reserve a room at another tiny guest house where were they staying were they patrolling the streets hoping to simply bump into her did they know where she was at this moment no she would be dead did they know she was now a blonde the hair got her out of bed she walked to the mirror over the desk and looked at herself it was even shorter now and very white not a bad job she had worked on it for three hours last night if she lived another two days she would cut some more and go back to black if she lived another week she might be bald a hunger pain hit and for a second she thought about food she was not eating and this would have to change it was almost ten oddly this bed and breakfast didnt cook on sunday mornings she would venture out to find food and a sunday post and to see if they could catch her now that she was a butch blonde she showered quickly and the hair took less than a minute no makeup she put on a new pair of army fatigues and a new flight jacket and she was ready for battle the eyes were covered with aviator shades although she had made a few entrances she had not exited a building through the front door in four days she crept through the dark kitchen unlocked the rear door and stepped into the alley behind the little inn it was cool enough to wear the flight jacket without being suspicious silly she thought in the french quarter she could wear the hide and head of a polar bear and not appear suspicious she walked briskly through the alley with her hands deep in the fatigues and her eyes darting behind the shades he saw her when she stepped onto the sidewalk next to burgundy street the hair under the cap was different but she was still fiveeight and she couldnt change that the legs were still long and she walked a certain way and after four days he could pick her out of a crowd regardless of the face and hair the cowboy boots snakeskin with pointed toes hit the sidewalk and started following she was a smart girl turning every corner changing streets every block walking quickly but not too fast he figured she was headed for jackson square where there was a crowd on sundays and she thought she could disappear she could stroll about with the tourists and the locals maybe eat a bite enjoy the sun pick up a paper darby casually lit a cigarette and puffed as she walked she could not inhale she tried three days ago and got dizzy such a nasty habit how ironic it would be if she lived through all this only to die from lung cancer please let her die of cancer he was sitting at a table in a crowded sidewalk cafe at the corner of st peter and chartres and he was less than ten feet away when she saw him a split second later he saw her and she probably would have made it if she hadnt hesitated for a step and swallowed hard when she saw him he saw her and probably would have been only suspicious but the slight hesitation and the curious look gave her away she kept walking but faster now it was stump he was on his feet and weaving through the tables when she lost sight of him at ground level he was anything but chubby he seemed quick and muscular she lost him for a second on chartres as she ducked between the arches of st louis cathedral the church was open and she thought maybe she should get inside as if it would be a sanctuary and he would not kill her there yes he would kill her there or on the street or in a crowd anywhere he caught her he was back there and darby wanted to know how fast he was coming was he just walking real fast and trying to play it cool was he sort of jogging or was he barreling down the sidewalk preparing to make a flying tackle as soon as he caught sight of her she kept moving she hung a left on st ann crossed the street and was almost to royal when she took a quick glance behind her he was coming he was on the other side of the street but very much in pursuit the nervous look over the shoulder nailed her it was a dead giveaway and he was into a jog now get to bourbon street she decided kickoff was four hours away and the saints fans were out in force celebrating before the game because there would be little to celebrate afterward she turned on royal and ran hard for a few steps then slowed to a fast walk he turned on royal and was trotting he was poised to break and run hard at any second darby moved to the center of the street where a group of football rowdies were moving around killing time she turned left on dumaine and started running bourbon was ahead and there were people everywhere she could hear him now no sense looking anymore he was back there running and gaining when she turned onto bourbon mr stump was fifty feet behind her and the race was over she saw her angels as they made a noisy exit from a bar three large overweight young men dressed in a wild assortment of black and gold saints garb stepped into the middle of the street just as darby ran to them help she screamed wildly and pointed at stump help me that man is after me hes trying to rape me well hell now sex in the streets of new orleans is not at all uncommon but theyd be damned if this girl was going to be abused please help me she screamed pitifully suddenly the street was silent everyone froze including stump who stopped for a step or two then rushed forward the three saints stepped in front of him with folded arms and glowing eyes it was over in seconds stump used both hands at once a right to the throat of the first one and a vicious blow to the mouth of the second they squealed and fell hard number three was not about to run his two buddies were hurt and this upset him he would have been a piece of cake for stump but number one fell on stumps right foot and this threw him off as he yanked his foot away mr benjamin chop of thibodaux louisiana number three kicked him squarely in the crotch and stump was history as darby eased back into the crowd she heard him cry in pain while he was falling mr chop kicked him in the ribs number two with blood all over his face charged wildeyed into stump and the massacre was on he curled around his hands which were curled around his severely damaged testicles and they kicked him and cursed him without mercy until someone yelled cops and this saved his life mr chop and number two helped number one to his feet and the saints were last seen darting into a bar stump made it to his feet and crawled away like a dog hit by a mack truck but still alive and determined to die at home she hid in a dark corner of a pub on decatur drinking coffee then a beer coffee then a beer her hands shook and her stomach flipped the poboys smelled delicious but she could not eat after three beers in three hours she ordered a plate of boiled shrimp and switched to spring water the alcohol had calmed her and the shrimp settled her she was safe in here she thought so why not watch the game and just sit here maybe until it closed the pub was packed at kickoff they watched the wide screen above the bar and got drunk she was a saints fan now she hoped her three buddies were okay and enjoying the game the crowd yelled and cursed the redskins darby stayed in her little corner until the game was long over then slid into the darkness at some point in the fourth quarter with the saints down by four field goals edwin sneller hung up the phone and turned off the television he stretched his legs then returned to the phone and called khamel next door listen to my english the assassin said tell me if you hear a trace of an accent okay shes here sneller said one of our men saw her this morning at jackson square he followed her for three blocks then lost her how did he lose her doesnt matter does it she got away but shes here her hair is very short and almost white white sneller hated to repeat himself especially to this mongrel he said it was not blond but white and she was wearing green army pants and a brown bomber jacket somehow she recognized him and took off how would she recognize him has she seen him before these idiot questions it was hard to believe he was considered superman i cant answer that hows my english perfect theres a small card under your door you need to see it khamel laid the phone on a pillow and walked to the door in a second he was back on the phone who is this the name is verheek dutch but hes an american works for the fbi in washington evidently he and callahan were friends they finished law school together at georgetown and verheek was an honorary pallbearer at the memorial service yesterday last night he was hanging out in a bar not far from the campus and was asking questions about the girl two hours ago one of our men was in the same bar posing as an fbi agent and he struck up a conversation with the bartender who turns out to be a law student who knows the girl they watched football and talked for a while then the kid produced the card look on the back hes in room at the hilton thats a fiveminute walk the street maps were scattered on one bed yes weve made a few phone calls to washington hes not an agent just a lawyer he knew callahan and he might know the girl its obvious hes trying to find her she would talk to him wouldnt she probably hows my english perfect khamel waited an hour and left the hotel with the coat and tie he was just an average joe strolling along canal at dusk headed for the river he carried a large gym bag and smoked a cigarette and five minutes later entered the lobby of the hilton he worked his way through the crowd of fans returning from the dome the elevator stopped on the twentieth floor and he walked one flight down to the nineteenth there was no answer at if the door had opened with the chain locked he would have apologized and explained he had the wrong room if the door had opened without the chain and with a fate in the crack he would have kicked it sharply and been inside but it did not open his new pal verheek was probably hanging around a bar passing out cards begging kids to talk to him about darby shaw what a nut he knocked again and while he waited he slid a sixinch plastic ruler between the door and the facing and worked it gently until the bolt clicked locks were minor nuisances for khamel without a key he could open a locked car and start the engine in less than thirty seconds inside he locked the door behind him and placed his bag on the bed like a surgeon he picked the gloves from a pocket and pulled them tightly over his fingers he laid a and silencer on the table the phone was quick work he plugged the recorder into the jack under the bed where it could sit for weeks before it was noticed he called the weather station twice to test the recorder perfect his new pal verheek was a slob most of the clothes in the room were dirty and simply thrown in the direction of the suit case sitting on a table he had not unpacked a cheap garment bag hung in the closet with one solitary shirt khamel covered his tracks and settled low in the closet he was a patient man and he could wait for hours he held the just in case this clown happened to barge into the closet and he had to kill him with bullets if not he would just listen gavin quit the bars sunday he was getting nowhere she had called him and she was not hanging around those places so what the hell he was drinking too much and eating too much and he was tired of new orleans he already had a flight booked for late monday afternoon and if she didnt call again he was finished playing detective he couldnt find her and it wasnt his fault cabdrivers got lost in this city voyles would be screaming by noon he had done his best he was stretched on the bed in nothing but boxer shorts flipping through a magazine and ignoring the television it was almost eleven he would wait on her until twelve then try to sleep it rang at exactly eleven he pushed a button and remotely killed the television hello it was herits me gavin so youre alive barely he sat on the edge of the bed whats happened they saw me today and one of their goons my friend stump chased me through the quarter you havent met stump but hes the one who watched you and everyone else walk into the chapel but you got away yeah a small miracle but i got away what happened to stump he was mortally wounded hes probably lying in a bed somewhere wearing an ice pack in his shorts he was just a few steps from me when he picked a fight with the wrong guys im scared gavin did he follow you from somewhere no we just sort of met on the street verheek paused a second her voice was shaking but under control she was losing her cool look darby ive got a flight out of here tomorrow afternoon i have this little job and my boss expects me to be at the office so i cant hang around new orleans for the next month hoping you dont get killed and hoping you come to your senses and trust me im leaving tomorrow and i

not involved but it may be then where do the three agents come from ive got friends she thought for a moment and her voice was suddenly stronger behind your hotel is a place called riverwalk its a shopping area with restaurants and i spent two hours there this afternoon good on the second level is a clothing store called frenchmens bend i saw it at precisely noon tomorrow i want you to stand by the entrance and wait for five minutes come on darby you wont be alive at noon tomorrow enough of this cat and mouse just do as i say gavin weve never met so i have no idea what you look like wear a

not in a silly mood and if you dont shut up well call it off its your neck please gavin im sorry ill do whatever you say thats a very busy spot to be yes it is i just feel safer in a crowd stand by the door for five minutes or so and hold a folded newspaper ill be watching after five minutes walk inside the store and go to the right rear corner where theres a rack of safari jackets browse around a bit and ill find you and what might you be wearing dont worry about me fine then what do we do you and i and only you and i will leave the city i dont want anyone else to know of this do you

too i dont like any of your plans darby these thugs are breathing down your neck and now youre getting me in the middle of it this is not what i wanted its much safer to do it my way safer for you safer for me but youll be there at noon wont you he stood by the bed and spoke with his eyes closed yes ill be there i just hope you make it how tall are you fiveten how much do you weigh i was afraid of this i usually lie you know two hundred but i plan to lose it i swear ill see you tomorrow gavin i hope i see you dear she was gone he hung up son of a bitch he yelled to the walls son of a bitch he walked along the end of the bed a few times then to the bathroom where he closed the door and turned on the shower he cussed her in the shower for ten minutes then stepped out and dried himself it was more like two hundred and fifteen pounds and all of it was situated badly on the fivenine frame it was painful to look at here he was about to meet this gorgeous woman who suddenly trusted him with her life and what a slob he was he opened the door the room was dark dark he had left on the lights what the hell he headed for the switch next to the dresser the first blow crushed his larynx it was a perfect blow that came from the side somewhere near the wall he grunted painfully and fell to one knee which made the second blow so easy like an ax on a fat log it hit like a rock at the base of the skull and gavin was dead khamel flipped on a light and looked at the pitiful nude figure frozen on the floor he was not one to admire his work he didnt want carpet burns so he lifted the pudgy corpse onto his shoulders and laid it across the bed working quickly without any wasted motion khamel turned on the television and raised it to full volume unzipped his bag removed a cheap caliber automatic and placed it precisely on the right temple of the late gavin verheek he covered the gun and the head with two pillows and pulled the trigger now the critical part he took one pillow and placed it under the head threw the other one on the floor and carefully curled the fingers of the right hand around the pistol leaving it twelve inches from the head he took the recorder from under the bed and ran the telephone wire directly into the wall he punched a button listened and there she was he turned off the television every job was different he had once stalked his prey for three weeks in mexico city then caught him in bed with two prostitutes it was a dumb mistake and during his career he had been assisted by numerous dumb mistakes by the opposition this guy was a dumb mistake a stupid lawyer pilfering around running his mouth passing out cards with his room number on the back he had stuck his nose into the world of bigleague killing and look at him now with a little luck the cops would look around the room for a few minutes and declare it to be another suicide they would go through the motions and ask themselves a couple of questions they could not answer but there were always some of those because he was an important fbi lawyer an autopsy would be done in a day or so and probably by tuesday an examiner would suddenly discover it was not a suicide by tuesday the girl would be dead and he would be in managua his usual official sources at the white house denied any knowledge of the pelican brief sarge had never heard of it longshot phone calls to the fbi produced nothing a friend at justice denied ever hearing about it he dug all weekend and had nothing to show for it the story about callahan was verified when he found a copy of the new orleans paper when her call came in at the newsroom monday he had nothing fresh to tell her but at least she called the pelican said she was at a pay phone so dont bother im still digging he said if theres such a brief in town its being closely protected i assure you its there and i understand why its being protected im sure you can tell me more lots more the brief almost got me killed yesterday so i may be ready to talk sooner than i thought i need to spill my guts while im still alive whos trying to kill you same people who killed rosenberg and jensen and thomas callahan do you know their names no but ive seen at least four of them since wednesday theyre here in new orleans snooping around hoping ill do something stupid and they can kill me how many people know about the pelican brief good question callahan took it to the fbi and i think from there it went to the white house where it evidently caused quite a fuss and from there who knows two days after he handed it to the fbi callahan was dead i of course was supposed to have been killed with him were you with him i was close but not close enough so youre the unidentified female on the scene thats how the paper described me then the police have your name my name is darby shaw i am a secondyear law student at tulane thomas callahan was my professor and lover i wrote the brief gave it to him and you know the rest are you getting all this grantham scribbled furiously yes im listening im rather tired of the french quarter and i plan to leave today ill call you from somewhere tomorrow do you have access to presidential campaign disclosure forms its public record i know that but how quickly can you get the information what information a list of all major contributors to the presidents last election thats not difficult i can have it by this afternoon do that and ill call you in the morning okay do you have a copy of the brief she hesitated no but its memorized and you know whos doing the killing yes and as soon as i tell you theyll put your name on the hit list tell me now lets take it slow ill call you tomorrow grantham listened hard then hung up he took his notepad and zigzagged through the maze of desks and people to the glass office of his editor smith keen keen was a hale and hearty type with an opendoor policy that ensured chaos in his office he was finishing a phone chat when grantham barged in and closed the door that door stays open keen said sharply we have to talk smith well talk with the door open open the damned door ill open it in just a second grantham spoke with both palms facing the editor yes it was serious lets talk okay what is it its big smith i know its big you shut the damned door so i know its big i just finished my second phone conversation with a young lady by the name of darby shaw and she knows who killed rosenberg and jensen keen sat slowly and glared at grantham yes son thats big but how do you know how does she know what can you prove i dont have a story yet smith but shes talking to me read this grantham handed over a copy of the newspaper account of callahans death keen read it slowly okay whos callahan one week ago today he handed a little paper known as the pelican brief to the fbi here in town evidently the brief implicates an obscure person in the killings the brief gets passed around then sent to the white house then beyond that no one knows two days later callahan cranks his porsche for the last time darby shaw claims to be the unidentified female mentioned there she was with callahan and was supposed to die with him why was she supposed to die she wrote the brief smith or she claims she did keen sank deeper into his seat and placed his feet on the desk he studied the photo of callahan wheres the brief i dont know whats in it dont know that either then we dont have anything do we not yet but what if she tells me everything thats in it and when will she do this grantham hesitated soon i think real soon keen shook his head and threw the copy on the desk if we had the brief wed have a helluva story gray but we couldnt run it theres gotta be some heavy painful flawless and accurate verification before we can run it but ive got the green light yeah but you keep me posted every hour dont write a word until we talk grantham smiled and opened the door this was not fortybucksanhour work not even thirty or twenty croft knew hed be lucky to squeeze fifteen out of grantham for this needleinthehaystack mickey mouse crap if hed had other work hed have told grantham to find someone else or better yet do it himself but things had been slow and he could do a lot worse than fifteen bucks an hour he finished a joint in the last stall flushed it and opened the door he stuck the dark sunglasses over his ears and entered the hallway that led to the atrium where four escalators carried a thousand lawyers up to their little rooms where they would spend the day bitching and threatening by the hour he had garcias face memorized he was even dreaming of this kid with the bright face and good looks the slim physique draped with an expensive suit he would know him if he saw him he stood by a pillar holding a newspaper and trying to watch everyone from behind the dark shades lawyers everywhere scurrying upward with their smug little faces and carrying their smug little attache cases man how he hated lawyers why did they all dress alike dark suits dark shoes dark faces an occasional nonconformist with a daring little bow tie where did they all come from shortly after his arrest with the drugs the first lawyers had been a group of angry mouthpieces hired by the post then he hired his own an overpriced moron who couldnt find the courtroom then the prosecutor was of course a lawyer lawyers lawyers two hours in the morning two hours at lunch two hours during the evening and then grantham would have another building for him to patrol ninety bucks a day was cheap and he would give this up as soon as he got a better deal he told grantham this was hopeless just shooting in the dark grantham agreed but said to keep shooting its all they could do he said garcia was scared and wouldnt call anymore they had to find him in his pocket he had two photos just in case and from the directory he had made a list of the firms in the building it was a long list the building had twelve floors filled mainly with firms filled with nothing but these fancy little esquires he was in a den of snakes by ninethirty the rush was over and some of the faces looked familiar coming back down the escalators headed no doubt for the courtrooms and agencies and commissions croft eased through the revolving doors and wiped his feet on the sidewalk four blocks away fletcher coal paced in front of the presidents desk and listened intently to the phone in his ear he frowned then closed his eyes then glared at the president as if to say bad news chief really bad news the president held a letter and peered at coal over his reading glasses coals pacing back and forth like der fuehrer really irritated him and he made a mental note to say something about it coal slammed the phone down dont slam the damned phones the president said coal was unfazed sorry that was zikman gray grantham called thirty minutes ago and asked if he had any knowledge of the pelican brief wonderful fabulous howd he get a copy of it coal was still pacing zikman knows nothing about it so his ignorance was genuine his ignorance is always genuine hes the dumbest ass on my staff fletcher and i want him gone whatever coal sat in a chair across the desk and folded his hands in a little steeple in front of his chin he was very deep in thought and the president tried to ignore him they thought for a moment voyles leaked it the president finally said maybe if it was leaked grantham is known for bluffing we cant be certain hes seen the brief maybe he heard about it and hes fishing maybe my ass what if they run some crazy story about that damned thing what then the president slapped his desk and bolted to his feetwhat then fletcher that paper hates me he moped to the windows they cant run it without another source and there cant be another source because theres no truth to it its a wild idea thats gone much further than it deserves the president sulked for a while and stared through the glasshow did grantham find out about it coal stood and began pacing but much slower now he was still painfully in thought who knows no one here knows about it but you and i they brought one copy and its locked away in my office i personally xeroxed it once and gave it to gminski i swore him to secrecy the president sneered at the windows coal continued okay youre right there could be a thousand copies out there by now but its harmless unless of course our friend actually did these dirty deeds then then my ass is cooked yes i would say our asses are cooked how much money did we take millions directly and indirectly and legally and illegally but the president knew little of these transactions and coal chose to stay quiet the president walked slowly to the sofa why dont you call grantham pick his brain see what he knows if hes bluffing itll be obvious what do you think i dont know youve talked to him before havent you everyone knows grantham coal was now pacing behind the sofayeah ive talked to him but if i suddenly call out of nowhere hell be suspicious yeah i guess youre right the president paced on one end of the sofa and coal on the other whats the downside the president finally asked our friend could be involved you asked voyles to back off our friend our friend could be exposed by the press voyles covers his tail and says you told him to chase other suspects and ignore our friend the post goes berserk with another coverup smear and we can forget reelection anything else coal thought for a second yeah this is all completely off the wall the brief is fantasy grantham will find nothing and im late for a staff meeting he walked to the doorive got a squash game for lunch be back at one the president watched the door close and breathed easier he had eighteen holes planned for the afternoon so forget the pelican thing if coal wasnt worried neither was he he punched numbers on his phone waited patiently and finally had bob gminski on the line the director of the cia was a terrible golfer one of the few the president could humiliate and he invited him to play this afternoon certainly said gminski a man with a thousand things to do but well it was the president so he would be delighted to join him by the way bob what about this pelican thing in new orleans gminski cleared his throat and tried to sound relaxed well chief i told fletcher coal friday that it was very imaginative and a fine work of fiction i think its author should forget about law school and pursue a career as a novelist ha ha ha great bob nothing to it then were digging see you at three the president hung up and went straight for his putter riverwalk runs for a quarter of a mile along the water and is always crowded it is packed with two hundred shops and cafes and restaurants on several levels most under the same roof and several with doors leading onto a boardwalk next to the river its at the foot of poydras street a stones throw from the quarter she arrived at eleven and sipped espresso in the rear of a tiny bistro while trying to read the paper and appear calm frenchmens bend was one level down and around a corner she was nervous and the espresso didnt help she had a list in her pocket of things to do specific steps at specific moments even words and sentences she had memorized in the event things went terribly wrong and verheek got out of control she had slept two hours and spent the rest of the time with a legal pad diagraming and charting if she died it would not be from a lack of preparation she could not trust gavin verheek he was employed by a law enforcement agency that at times operated by its own rules he took orders from a man with a history of paranoia and dirty tricks his boss reported to a president in charge of an administration run by fools the president had rich sleazy friends who gave him lots of money but at this moment dear there was no one else to trust after five days and two near misses she was throwing in the towel new orleans had lost its allure she needed help and if she had to trust cops the fibbies were as clean as any eleven fortyfive she paid for the espresso waited for a crowd of shoppers and fell in behind them there were a dozen people browsing in frenchmens bend as she walked past the entrance where her friend should be in about ten minutes she eased into a bookstore two doors down there were at least three stores in the vicinity from which she could shop and hide and watch the front door of frenchmens bend she chose the bookstore because the clerks werent pushy and killing time was expected of the customers she looked at the magazines first then with three minutes to go she stepped between two rows of cookbooks and watched for gavin thomas said he was never on time an hour late was early for him but she would give him fifteen minutes and shed be gone she expected him at precisely noon and there he was black sweatshirt red baseball cap folded newspaper he was a bit thinner than she expected but he could lose a few pounds her heart pounded away be cool she said just be cool dammit she held a cookbook to her eyes and peered over it he had gray hair and dark skin the eyes were hidden behind sunglasses he fidgeted and looked irritated the way he sounded on the phone he passed the newspaper from hand to hand shifted his weight from foot to foot and glanced around nervously he was okay she liked the way he looked he had a vulnerable nonprofessional manner about him that said he was scared too after five minutes he walked through the door as he was told and went to the right rear of the store khamel had been trained to welcome death he had been close to it many times but never afraid of it and after thirty years of expecting it nothing absolutely nothing made him tense he got somewhat excited about sex but that was it the fidgeting was an act the jittery little movements were contrived hed survived faceoffs with men almost as talented as he and he could certainly handle this little rendezvous with a desperate child he picked through the safari jackets and tried to appear nervous he had a handkerchief in his pocket because he suddenly had caught a cold so his voice was a bit thick and scratchy he had listened to the recording a hundred times and he was confident he had the inflection and rhythm and slight upper midwest accent but verheek was a bit more nasal thus the handkerchief for the cold it was difficult to allow anyone to approach from the rear but he knew he must he did not see her she was behind him but very close when she said gavin he jerked quickly around she was holding a white panama hat and speaking to it darby he said pulling the handkerchief out for a fake sneeze her hair was a gold color and shorter than his he sneezed and coughed lets get out of here he said i dont like this idea darby didnt like it either it was monday and her classmates were going about their business of clawing through law school and here she was camouflaged to the max and playing cloak and dagger with this man who could get her killed just do as i say okay whered you get the cold he sneezed into the handkerchief and talked as low as possible it sounded painful last night i left the air on too low lets get out of here follow me they left the store darby took his hand and they walked quickly down a flight of stairs leading to the boardwalk have you seen them he asked no not yet but im sure theyre around where the hell are we going the voice was scratchy they were on the boardwalk almost jogging talking without looking at each other just come with me youre going too fast darby we look suspicious slow down look this is crazy let me make a phone call and well be safe and secure i can have three agents here in ten minutes he was sounding good this was working they were holding hands running for their lives nope she slowed the boardwalk was crowded and a line had formed beside the bayou queen a paddle wheeler they stopped at the end of the line what the hell is this he asked do you bitch about everything she almost whispered yes especially stupid things and this is very stupid are we getting on this boat yes why he sneezed again then coughed out of control he could take her out now with one hand but there were people everywhere people in front people behind he took great pride in his cleanliness and this would be a dirty place to do it get on the boat play along for a few more minutes see what happens he would get her on the upper deck kill her dump her in the river then start yelling another terrible drowning accident that might work if not hed be patient shed be dead in an hour gavin was a bitch so keep bitching because ive got a car a mile upriver at a park where well stop in thirty minutes she explained in a low voice we get off the boat into the car and we haul ass the line was moving now i dont like boats they make me seasick this is dangerous darby he coughed and looked around like a man pursued relax gavin its gonna work khamel tugged at his pants they were thirtysix inches in the waist and covered eight layers of briefs and gym shorts the sweatshirt was extra large and instead of weighing onefifty he could pass for oneninety whatever it seemed to be working they were almost to the steps of the bayou queen i dont like this he mumbled loud enough for her to hear just shut up she said the man with the gun ran to the end of the line and elbowed his way through the people with their bags and cameras the tourists were packed tightly together as if a ride on the riverboat was the greatest trip in the world he had killed before but never in such a public place as this the back of her head was visible through the crowd he shoved his way desperately through the line a few cursed him but he couldnt care less the gun was in a pocket but as he neared the girl he yanked it out and kept it by his right leg she was almost to the steps almost on the boat he shoved harder and knocked people out of the way they protested angrily until they saw the gun then they began yelling she was holding hands with the man who was talking nonstop she was about to step up onto the boat when he knocked the last person out of the way and quickly stuck the gun into the base of the skull just below the red baseball cap he fired once and people screamed and fell to the ground gavin fell hard into the steps darby screamed and backed away in horror her ears were ringing from the shot and voices were yelling and people were pointing the man with the gun was running hard toward a row of shops and a crowd of people a heavy man with a camera was yelling at him and darby watched for a second as he disappeared maybe shed seen him before but she couldnt think now she was yelling and couldnt stop hes got a gun a woman near the boat yelled and the crowd backed away from gavin who was on all fours with a small pistol in his right hand he rocked pitifully back and forth like an infant trying to crawl blood streamed from his chin and puddled under his face his head hung almost to the boards his eyes were closed he moved forward just a few inches his knees now in the dark red puddle the crowd backed farther away horrified at the sight of this wounded man fighting death he teetered and wobbled forward again headed nowhere but wanting to move to live he started yelling loud painful moans in a language darby did not recognize the blood was pouring gushing from the nose and chin he was wailing in that unknown tongue two crew members from the boat hovered on the steps watching but afraid to move the pistol concerned them a woman was crying then another darby inched farther back hes egyptian a small dark woman said that news meant nothing to the crowd now mesmerized he rocked forward and lunged to the edge of the boardwalk the gun dropped into the water he collapsed on his stomach with his head hanging over and dripping into the river shouts came from the rear and two policemen rushed to him a hundred people now inched forward to see the dead man darby shuffled backward then left the scene the cops would have questions and since she had no answers she preferred not to talk she was weak and needed to sit for a while and think there was an oyster bar inside riverwalk it was crowded for lunch and she found the rest rooms in the back she locked the door and sat on a toilet shortly after dark she left riverwalk the westin hotel is two blocks away and she hoped maybe she could make it there without being gunned down on the sidewalk her clothes were different and hidden under a new black trench coat the sunglasses and hat were also new she was tired of spending good money on disposable clothes she was tired of a lot of things she made it to the westin in one piece there were no rooms and she sat in the welllit lounge for an hour drinking coffee it was time to run but she couldnt get careless she had to think maybe she was thinking too damned much maybe they now thought of her as a thinker and planned accordingly she left the westin and walked to poydras where she flagged a cab an elderly black man sat low behind the wheel i need to go to baton rouge she said lord honey thats a heckuva ride how much she asked quickly he thought a second a hundred and fifty she crawled in the backseat and threw two bills over the seattheres two hundred get there as fast as you can and watch your rear we may be followed he turned off the meter and stuffed the money in his shirt pocket darby lay down in the backseat and closed her eyes this was not an intelligent move but playing the percentages was getting nowhere the old man was a fast driver and within minutes they were on the expressway the ringing in her ears had stopped but she still heard the gunshot and saw him on all fours rocking back and forth try ing to live just a moment longer thomas had once referred to him as dutch verheek but said the nickname was dropped after law school when they became serious about their careers dutch verheek was not an egyptian she had caught just a glimpse of his killer as he was running away there was something familiar about him he had glanced to his right just once as he was running and something clicked but she was screaming and hysterical and it was a blur everything blurred halfway to baton rouge she fell into a deep sleep director voyles stood behind his executive swivel chair his jacket was off and most of the buttons on his tired and wrinkled shirt were unfastened it was pm and judging from the shirt he had been at the office at least fifteen hours and he hadnt thought of leaving he listened to the receiver mumbled a few instructions and hung it up k o lewis sat across the desk the door was open the lights were on no one had left the mood was somber with small huddles of soft whispers that was eric east voyles said sitting gently into the chairhes been there about two hours and they just finished the autopsy he watched it his first single bullet to the right temple but death came sooner from a single blow at c and the vertebrae were shattered into tiny chips and pieces no powder burns on his hand another blow severely bruised his larynx but did not cause death he was nude estimate of between ten and eleven last night who found him lewis asked maids checked in around eleven this morning will you deliver the news to his wife yea sure ko said whens the body coming back east said theyll release it in a couple of hours and it should be here by am tell her well do whatever she wants tell her im sending a hundred agents in tomorrow to blanket the city tell her well find the killer etc etc any evidence probably not east said theyve had the hotel room since pm and it appears to be a clean job no forced entry no signs of resistance nothing that would be of any help but its a bit early voyles rubbed his red eyes and thought for a while how could he go down for a simple funeral and end up dead lewis asked he was snooping around on this pelican thing one of our agents guy named carlton told east that gavin was trying to find the girl and that the girl had called him and that he might need some help bringing her in carlton talked to him a few times and gave him the names of a few student hangouts in the city that was all so he says carlton says that he carlton was a bit worried about gavin throwing his fbi weight around said he thought he was sort of a klutz has anyone seen the girl shes probably dead ive instructed new orleans to find her if possible her little brief is getting folks killed right and left when do we take it seriously voyles nodded at the door and lewis got up and closed it the director was standing again cracking his knuckles and thinking aloud we have to cover our asses i think we should assign at least two hundred agents to pelican but try like hell to keep it quiet theres something there ko something really nasty but at the same time i promised the president we would back off he personally asked me to back off the pelican brief remember and i said we would in part because we thought it was a joke voyles managed a tight smile well i taped our little conversation when he asked me to back off i figure he and coal tape everything within a half mile of the white house so why cant i i had my best body mike and ive listened to the tape clear as a bell im not following simple we go in and investigate like mad if this is it we crack the case get the indictments and everyones happy but itll be a bitch to do in a hurry meanwhile idiot and coal over there know nothing about the investigation if the press gets wind of it and if the pelican brief is on target then ill make damned sure the country knows the president asked us to back off because its one of his pals lewis was smiling itll kill him yes coal will hemorrhage and the president will never recover the election is next year ko i like it denton but we have to solve this thing denton walked slowly behind his chair and slid out of his shoes he was even shorter now well look under every stone ko but it wont be easy if its mattiece then weve got a very wealthy man in a very elaborate plot to use very talented killers to take out two justices these people dont talk and they dont leave trails look at our friend gavin well spend two thousand hours digging around that hotel and ill bet you there wont be a shred of useful evidence just like rosenberg and jensen and callahan and callahan and probably the girl if we ever find her body im somewhat responsible denton gavin came to me thursday morning after he learned of callahan and i didnt listen i knew he was going down there but i just didnt listen look im sorry hes dead he was a fine lawyer and he was loyal to me i value that i trusted gavin but he got himself killed because he stepped out of bounds he had no business playing cop and trying to find the girl lewis stood and stretchedid better go see mrs verheek how much do i tell her lets say it looks like a burglary cops aint sure down there still investigating well know more tomorrow etc tell her im devastated and well do whatever she wants coals hmo stopped abruptly at the curb so an ambulance could scream by the limo was wandering aimlessly through the city a ritual not unusual when coal and matthew barr met to talk about really dirty business they sat deep in the back of it sipping drinks coal was indulging in a spring water barr had a sixteenounce bud purchased from a convenience store they ignored the ambulance i must know what grantham knows coal was saying today he called zikman zikmans aide trandell nelson devan one of my many former assistants whos now with the committee to reelect and these are just the ones i know of all in one day hes hot on this pelican brief you think hes seen it the limo was moving again no not at all if he knew what was in it he wouldnt be fishing for it but dammit he knows about it hes good ive watched him for years he seems to move in the shadows and keeps in touch with an odd network of sources hes written some crazy stuff but its usually accurate as hell thats what worries me hes tenacious and he smells blood with this story barr sipped from the can of course it would be asking too much if i wanted to know what was in the brief dont ask its so damned confidential its frightening then how does grantham know about it perfect question and thats what i want to know howd he find out and how much does he know where are his sources we got his car phone but we havent been inside the apartment yet why not we almost got caught this morning by his cleaning lady well try again tomorrow dont get caught barr remember watergate they were morons fletcher we on the other hand are quite talented thats right so tell me can you and your quite talented associates bug granthams phone at the post barr turned and frowned at coalhave you lost your mind impossible that place is busy at all hours they have security guards the works it could be done then do it coal if you know so damned much you do it start thinking about ways to do it okay just give it some thought okay ive thought about it its impossible coal was amused by this thought and his amusement irritated barr the limo eased into downtown tap his apartment coal instructedi want a report twice a day on all his calls the limo stopped and barr climbed out breakfast at dupont circle it was quite chilly but at least the addicts and transvestites were still unconscious somewhere in their sick little worlds a few winos lay about like driftwood but the sun was up and he felt safe and anyway he was still an fbi agent with a shoulder harness and a piece under his arm who was he to fear he hadnt used it in fifteen years and he seldom left the office but hed love to yank it out and blast away his name was trope a very special assistant to mr voyles he was so special that no one except he and mr voyles knew about these secret little chats with booker from langley he sat on a circular bench with his back to new hampshire and unpacked a storebought breakfast of banana and muffin he checked his watch booker was never late trope always arrived first then booker five minutes later and they always talked quickly and trope left first then booker they were both office boys now far into their twilights but very close to their bosses who from time to time grew weary of trying to figure out what the hell the other was doing or perhaps just needed to know something quick his real name was trope and he wondered if booker was a real name probably not booker was from langley and they were so paranoid even the pencil pushers probably had fakes he took an inch off the banana hell the secretaries over there probably had three or four names booker strolled near the fountain with a tall white cup of coffee he glanced around then sat down next to his friend voyles wanted this meeting so trope would speak first we lost a man in new orleans he said booker cuddled the hot cup and sipped he got himself killed yeah but hes still dead were you there yes but we didnt know he was there we were close but watching others what was he doing trope unwrapped the cold muffin we dont know went down for the funeral tried to find the girl found someone else and here we are he took a long bite and the banana was finished now to the muffinit was a clean job wasnt it booker shrugged what did the fbi know about killing people it was okay pretty weak effort at suicide from what we hear he sipped the hot coffee wheres the girl trope asked we lost her at ohare maybe shes in manhattan but were not certain were looking and theyre looking trope sipped cold coffee im sure they are they watched a wino stagger from his bench and fall his head hit first with a thud but he probably felt nothing he rolled over and his forehead was bleeding booker checked his watch these meetings were extremely brief what are mr voyles plans oh hes going in he sent fifty troops last night with more today he doesnt like losing people especially someone he knows what about the white house not going to tell them and maybe they wont find out what do they know they know mattiece trope managed a slight smile at this thought where is mr mattiece who knows in the past three years hes been seen little in this country he owns at least a halfdozen homes in as many countries and hes got jets and boats so who knows trope finished the muffin and stuffed the wrapper in the sack the brief nailed him didnt it its beautiful and if hed played it cool the brief would have been ignored but he goes berserk starts killing people and the more he kills the more credibility the brief has trope glanced at his watch too long already but this was good stuff voyles says we may need your help booker nodded done but this will be a very difficult matter first the probable gunman is dead second the probable bagman is very elusive there was an elaborate conspiracy but the conspirators are gone well try to find mattiece and the girl yes well try whats she thinking how to stay alive cant you bring her in trope asked no we dont know where she is and we cant just snatch innocent civilians off the streets she doesnt trust anyone right now trope stood with his coffee and sack i cant blame her he was gone grantham held a cloudy fax photo sent to him from phoenix she was a junior at arizona state a very attractive twentyyearold coed she was listed as a biology major from denver he had called twenty shaws in denver before he stopped the second fax was sent by an ap stringer in new orleans it was a copy of her freshman photo at tulane the hair was longer somewhere in the middle of the yearbook the stringer had found a photo of darby shaw drinking a diet coke at a law school picnic she wore a baggy sweater with faded jeans that fit just right and it was obvious the photo was placed in the yearbook by a great admirer of darbys it looked like something out of vogue she was laughing at something or someone at the picnic the teeth were perfect and the face was warm he had tacked this one onto the small corkboard beside his news desk there was a fourth fax a photo of thomas callahan just for the record he placed his feet on the desk it was almost ninethirty tuesday the newsroom hummed and rocked like a wellorganized riot hed made eighty phone calls in the last twentyfour hours and had nothing to show but the four photos and a stack of campaign finance forms he was getting nowhere and really why bother she was about to tell all he skimmed the post and saw the strange story about one gavin verheek and his demise the phone rang it was darby seen the post she asked i write the post remember she was not in the mood for small talk the story about the fbi lawyer murdered in new orleans have you seen it im just reading it does it mean something to you you could say that listen carefully grantham callahan gave the brief to verheek who was his best friend friday verheek came to new orleans for the funeral i talked to him by phone over the weekend he wanted to help me but i was scared we agreed to meet yesterday at noon verheek was murdered in his room around eleven sunday night got all that yeah i got it verheek didnt show for our meeting he was of course dead by then i got scared and left the city im in new york okay grantham wrote furiously who killed verheek i do not know theres a lot more to the story ive read the post and the new york times from front to back and ive seen nothing about another killing in new orleans it happened to a man i was talking to and i thought was verheek its a long story sounds like it when do i get this long story when can you come to new york i can be there by noon thats a little quick lets plan on tomorrow ill call you at this time tomorrow with instructions you must be careful grantham he admired the jeans and the smile on the corkboard its gray okay not grantham whatever there are some powerful people afraid of what i know if i tell you it could kill you ive seen the bodies okay gray ive heard bombs and gunshots i saw a mans brains yesterday and i have no idea who he was or why he was killed except that he knew about the pelican brief i thought he was my friend i trusted him with my life and he was shot in the head in front of fifty people as i watched him die it occurred to me that perhaps he was not my friend i read the paper this morning and i realize he was definitely not my friend who killed him well talk about it when you get here okay darby theres one small point to cover ill tell you everything i know but you can never use my name ive already written enough to get at least three people killed and im quite confident ill be next but i dont want to ask for more trouble i shall always be unidentified okay gray its a deal im putting a lot of trust in you and im not sure why if i ever doubt you ill disappear you have my word darby i swear i think youre making a mistake this is not your average investigative job this one could get you killed by the same people who killed rosenberg and jensen yes do you know who killed rosenberg and jensen i know who paid for the killings i know his name i know his business i know his politics and youll tell me tomorrow if im still alive there was a long pause as both thought of something appropriate perhaps we should talk immediately he said perhaps but ill call you in the morning grantham hung up and for a moment admired the slightly blurred photo of this very beautiful law student who was convinced she was about to die for a second he succumbed to thoughts of chivalry and gallantry and rescue she was in her early twenties liked older men according to the photo of callahan and suddenly she trusted him to the exclusion of all others he would make it work and he would protect her the motorcade moved quietly out of downtown he was due for a speech at college park in an hour and he relaxed in his limo with his jacket off reading the words mabry had put together he shook his head and wrote in the margins on a normal day this would be a pleasant drive out of the city to a beautiful campus for a light little speech but it wasnt working out coal was seated next to him in the limo the chief of staff routinely avoided these trips he treasured the moments the president was out of the white house and he had the run of the place but they needed to talk im tired of mabrys speeches the president said in frustrationtheyre all sounding the same i swear i gave this one last week at the rotary convention hes the best weve got but im exploring coal said without looking up from his memo hed read the speech and it wasnt that bad but mabry had been writing for six months and the ideas were stale and coal wanted to fire him anyway the president glanced at coals memo whats that the short list whos left silerspence watson and calderon coal flipped a page thats just great fletcher a woman a black and a cuban whatever happened to white men i thought i said i wanted young white men young tough conservative judges with impeccable credentials and years to live didnt i say that coal kept reading they have to be confirmed chief well get em confirmed ill twist arms until they break but theyll be confirmed do you realize that nine of every ten white men in this country voted for me eightyfour percent right so whats wrong with white men this is not exactly patronage the hell its not its patronage pure and simple i reward my friends and i punish my enemies thats how you survive in politics you dance with the ones that brought you i cant believe you want a female and a black youre getting soft fletcher coal flipped another page hed heard this before im more concerned with reelection he said quietly and im not ive appointed so many asians and hispanics and women and blacks youd think i was a democrat hell fletcher whats wrong with white people look there must be a hundred good qualified conservative judges out there right why cant you find just two only two who look and think like i do you got ninety percent of the cuban vote the president tossed the speech in a seat and picked up the mornings post okay lets go with calderon how old is he fiftyone married eight kids catholic poor background worked his way through yale very solid very conservative no warts or skeletons except he was treated for alcoholism twenty years ago hes been sober since a teetotaler has he ever smoked dope he denies it i like him the president was reading the front page so do i justice and fbi have checked his underwear and hes very clean now do you want silerspence or watson what kind of name is silerspence i mean whats wrong with these women who use hyphens what if her name was skowinski and she married a guy named levondowski would her little liberated soul insist she go through life as f gwendolyn skowinskilevondowski give me a break ill never appoint a woman with a hyphen you already have who kay jonesroddy ambassador to brazil then call her home and fire her coal managed a slight grin and placed the memo on the seat he watched the traffic through his window they would decide on number two later calderon was in the bag and he wanted linda silerspence so he would keep pushing the black and force the president to the woman basic manipulation i think we should wait another two weeks before announcing them he said whatever the president mumbled as he read a story on page one he would announce them when he got ready regardless of coals timetable he was not yet convinced they should be announced together judge watson is a very conservative black judge with a reputation for toughness he would be ideal i dont know the president mumbled as he read about gavin verheek coal had seen the story on page two verheek was found dead in a room at the hilton in new orleans under strange circumstances according to the story official fbi was in the dark and had nothing to say about why verheek was in new orleans voyles was deeply saddened fine loyal employee etc the president flipped through the paper our friend grantham has been quiet hes digging i think hes heard of the brief but just cant get a handle on it hes called everyone in town but doesnt know what to ask hes chasing rabbits well i played golf with gminski yesterday the president said smugly and he assures me everythings under control we had a real hearttoheart talk over eighteen holes hes a horrible golfer couldnt stay out of the sand and water it was funny really coal had never touched a golf club and hated the idle chatter about handicaps and such do you think voyles is investigating down there no he gave me his word he would not not that i trust him but gminski didnt mention voyles how much do you trust gminski coal asked with a quick glance and frown at the president none but if he knew something about the pelican brief i think he would tell me the presidents words trailed off and he knew he sounded naive coal grunted his disbelief they crossed the anacostia river and were in prince georges county the president picked up the speech and looked out his window two weeks after the killings and the ratings were still above fifty percent the democrats had no visible candidate out there making noise he was strong and getting stronger americans were tired of dope and crime and noisy minorities getting all the attention and liberal idiots interpreting the constitution in favor of criminals and radicals this was his moment two nominations to the supreme court at the same time it would be his legacy he smiled to himself what a wonderful tragedy the taxi stopped abruptly at the corner of fifth and fiftysecond and gray doing exactly what he was told paid quickly and jumped out with his bag the car behind was honking and flipping birds and he thought how nice it was to be back in new york city it was almost pm and the pedestrians were thick on fifth and he figured that was precisely what she wanted she had been specific take this flight from national to la guardia take a cab to the vista hotel in the world trade center go to the bar have a drink maybe two watch your rear then after an hour catch a cab to the corner of fifth and fiftysecond move quickly wear sunglasses and watch for everything because if he was being followed he could get them killed she made him write it all down it was a bit silly a bit of overkill but she had a voice he couldnt argue with didnt want to really she was lucky to be alive she said and she would take no more chances and if he wanted to talk to her then he would do exactly as he was told he wrote it down he fought the crowd and walked as fast as possible up fifth to fiftyninth to the plaza up the steps and through its lobby then out onto central park south no one could follow him and if she was this cautious no one could follow her the sidewalk was packed along central park south and as he neared sixth avenue he walked even faster he was keyed up and regardless of how restrained he tried to be he was terribly excited about meeting her on the phone she had been cool and methodical but with a trace of fear and uncertainty she was just a law student she said and she didnt know what she was doing and she would probably be dead in a week if not sooner but anyway this was the way the game would be played always assume youre being followed she said she had survived seven days of being chased by bloodhounds so please do as she said she said to duck into the st moritz at the corner of sixth and he did she had reserved a room for him under the name of warren clark he paid cash for the room and rode the elevator to the ninth floor he was to wait just sit and wait shed said he stood in the window for an hour and watched central park grow dark the phone rang mr clark a female asked uh yes its me did you arrive alone yes where are you six floors up take the elevator to the eighteenth then walk down to the fifteenth room okay now yes im waiting he brushed his teeth again checked his hair and ten minutes later was standing before room he felt like a sophomore on his first date he hadnt had butterflies this bad since high school football but he was gray grantham of the washington post and this was just another story and she was just another woman so grab the reins buddy he knocked and waited who is it grantham he said to the door the bolt clicked and she opened the door slowly the hair was gone but she smiled and there was the cover girl she shook his hand firmly come in she closed and bolted the door behind him would you care for a drink she asked sure what do you have water with ice sounds great she walked into a small sitting room where the television was on with no sound in here she said he set his bag on the table and took a seat on the sofa she was standing at the bar and for a quick second he admired the jeans no shoes extralarge sweatshirt with the collar to one side where a bra strap peeked through she handed him the water and sat in a chair by the door thanks he said have you eaten she asked you didnt tell me to she chuckled at this forgive me ive been through a lot lets order room service he nodded and smiled at her sure anything you want is fine with me id love a greasy cheeseburger with fries and a cold beer perfect she picked up the phone and ordered the food grantham walked to the window and watched the lights crawling along fifth avenue im twentyfour how old are you she was on the sofa now sipping ice water he took the chair nearest to her thirtyeight married once divorced seven years and three months ago no children live alone with a cat whyd you pick the st moritz rooms were available and i convinced them it was important to pay with cash and present no identification do you like it its fine sort of past its prime this is not exactly a vacation its fine how long do you think we might be here she watched him carefully hed published a book six years earlier on hud scandals and though it didnt sell shed found a copy in a public library in new orleans he looked six years older than the photo on the dust jacket but he was aging nicely with a touch of gray over the ears i dont know how long youll stay she said my plans are subject to change by the minute i may see a face on the street and fly to new zealand when did you leave new orleans monday night i took a cab to baton rouge and that would have been easy to follow i flew to chicago where i bought four tickets to four different cities including boise where my mother lives i jumped on the plane to la guardia at the last moment i dont think anyone followed youre safe maybe for the moment well both be hunted when this story is published assuming its published gray rattled his ice and studied her depends on what you tell me and it depends on how much can be verified from other sources the verification is up to you ill tell you what i know and from there youre on your own okay when do we start talking after dinner id rather do it on a full stomach youre in no hurry are you of course not ive got all night and all day tomorrow and the next day and the next i mean youre talking about the biggest story in twenty years so ill hang around as long as youll talk to me darby smiled and looked away exactly a week ago she and thomas were waiting for dinner in the bar at moutons he was wearing a black silk blazer denim shirt red paisley tie and heavily starched khakis shoes but no socks the shirt was unbuttoned and the tie was loose they had talked about the virgin islands and thanksgiving and gavin verheek while they waited on a table he was drinking fast and that was not unusual he got drunk later and it saved her life she had lived a year in the past seven days and she was having a real conversation with a live person who did not wish her dead she crossed her feet on the coffee table it was not uncomfortable having him here in her room she relaxed his face said trust me and why not whom else could she trust what are you thinking about he asked its been a long week seven days ago i was just another law student busting my tail to get to the top now look at me he was looking at her trying to be cool not like a gawking sophomore but he was looking the hair was dark and very short and quite stylish but he liked the long version in yesterdays fax tell me about thomas callahan he said why i dont know hes part of the story isnt he yeah ill get to it later fine your mother lives in boise yes but she knows nothing wheres your mother short hills new jersey he answered with a smile he crunched on an ice cube and waited for her she was thinking what do you like about new york she asked the airport its the quickest way out thomas and i were here in the summer its hotter than new orleans suddenly grantham realized she was not just a hot little coed but a widow in mourning the poor lady was suffering she had not been checking out his hair or his clothes or his eyes she was in pain dammit im very sorry about thomas he said i wont ask about him again she smiled but said nothing there was a loud knock darby jerked her feet off the table and glared at the door then she breathed deeply it was the food ill get it gray said just relax for centuries a quiet but mammoth battle of nature raged without interference along the coastline of what would become louisiana it was a battle for territory no humans were involved until recent years from the south the ocean pushed inland with its tides and winds and floods from the north the mississippi river hauled down an inexhaustible supply of freshwater and sediment and fed the marshes with the soil they needed to vegetate and thrive the saltwater from the gulf eroded the coastline and burned the freshwater marshes by killing the grasses that held them together the river responded by draining half the continent and depositing its soil in lower louisiana it slowly built a long succession of sedimentary deltas each of which in turn eventually blocked the rivers path and forced it to change course yet again the lush wetlands were built by the deltas it was an epic struggle of giveandtake with the forces of nature firmly in control with the constant replenishment from the mighty river the deltas not only held their own against the gulf but expanded the marshlands were a marvel of natural evolution using the rich sediment as food they grew into a green paradise of cypress and oak and dense patches of pickerelweed and bulrush and cattails the water was filled with crawfish shrimp oysters red snappers flounder pompano bream crabs and alligators the coastal plain was a sanctuary for wildlife hundreds of species of migratory birds came to roost the wetlands were vast and limitless rich and abundant then oil was discovered there in and the rape was on the oil companies dredged ten thousand miles of canals to get to the riches they crisscrossed the fragile delta with a slashing array of neat little ditches they sliced the marshes to ribbons they drilled found oil then dredged like maniacs to get to it their canals were perfect conduits for the gulf and its saltwater which ate away at the marshes since oil was found tens of thousands of acres of wetlands have been devoured by the ocean sixty square miles of louisiana vanishes every year every fourteen minutes another acre disappears under water in an oil company punched a hole deep in terrebonne parish and hit oil it was a routine day on just another rig but it was not a routine hit there was a lot of oil they drilled again an eighth of a mile away and hit another big one they backed off a mile drilled and hit an even bigger one three miles away they struck gold again the oil company capped the wells and pondered the situation which had all the markings of a major new field the oil company was owned by victor mattiece a cajun from lafayette whod made and lost several fortunes drilling for oil in south louisiana in he happened to be wealthy and more importantly he had access to other peoples money he was quickly convinced he had just tapped a major reserve he began buying land around the capped wells secrets are crucial but hard to keep in the oilfields and mattiece knew if he threw around too much money there would soon be a mad rush of drilling around his new gold mine a man of infinite patience and planning he looked at the big picture and said no to the quick buck he decided he would have it all he huddled with his lawyers and other advisers and devised a plan to methodically buy the surrounding land under a myriad of corporate names they formed new companies used some of his old ones purchased all or portions of struggling firms and went about the business of acquiring acreage those in the business knew mattiece and knew he had money and could get more mattiece knew they knew so he quietly unleashed two dozen faceless entities upon the landowners of terrebonne parish it worked without a major hitch the plan was to consolidate territory then dredge yet another channel through the hapless and beleaguered marshlands so that the men and their equipment could get to the rigs and the oil could be brought out with haste the canal would be thirtyfive miles long and twice as wide as the others there would be a lot of traffic because mattiece had money he was a popular man with the politicians and bureaucrats he played their game skillfully he sprinkled money around where needed he loved politics but hated publicity he was paranoid and reclusive as the land acquisition sailed smoothly along mattiece suddenly found himself short of cash the industry turned downward in the early eighties and his other rigs stopped pumping he needed big money and he wanted partners adept at putting it up and remaining silent about it so he stayed away from texas he went overseas and found some arabs who studied his maps and believed his estimate of a mammoth reserve of crude and natural gas they bought a piece of the action and mattiece had plenty of cash again he did the sprinkling act and obtained official permission to gouge his way through the delicate marshes and cypress swamps the pieces were falling majestically into place and victor mattiece could smell a billion dollars maybe two or three then an odd thing happened a lawsuit was filed to stop the dredging and drilling the plaintiff was an obscure environmental outfit known simply as green fund the lawsuit was unexpected because for fifty years louisiana had allowed itself to be devoured and polluted by oil companies and people like victor mattiece it had been a tradeoff the oil business employed many and paid well the oil and gas taxes collected in baton rouge paid the salaries of state employees the small bayou villages had been turned into boomtowns the politicians from the governors down took the oil money and played along all was well and so what if some of the marshlands suffered green fund filed the lawsuit in the us district court in lafayette a federal judge halted the project pending a trial on all issues mattiece went over the edge he spent weeks with his lawyers plotting and scheming he would spare no expense to win do whatever it took he instructed them break any rule violate any ethic hire any expert commission any study cut any throat spend any amount of money just win the damned lawsuit never one to be seen he assumed an even lower profile he moved to the bahamas and operated from an armed fortress at lyford cay he flew to new orleans once a week to meet with the lawyers then returned to the island though invisible now he made certain his political contributions increased his jackpot was still safe beneath terrebonne parish and he would one day extract it but one never knows when one will be forced to call in favors by the time the green fund lawyers both of them had waded in ankle deep they had identified over thirty separate defendants some owned land some did exploring others laid pipe others drilled the joint ventures and limited partnerships and corporate associations were an impenetrable maze the defendants and their legions of highpriced lawyers answered with a vengeance they filed a thick motion asking the judge to dismiss the lawsuit as frivolous denied they asked him to allow the drilling to continue while they waited on a trial denied they squealed with pain and explained in another heavy motion how much money was already tied up in exploration drilling etc denied again they filed motions by the truckload and when they were all denied and it was evident there would one day be a trial by jury the oil lawyers dug in and played dirty luckily for green funds lawsuit the heart of the new oil reserve was near a ring of marshes that had been for years a natural refuge for waterfowl ospreys egrets pelicans ducks cranes geese and many others migrated to it though louisiana has not always been kind to its land it has shown a bit more sympathy for its animals since the verdict would one day be rendered by a jury of average and hopefully ordinary people the green fund lawyers played heavy on the birds the pelican became the hero after thirty years of insidious contamination by ddt and other pesticides the louisiana brown pelican perched on the brink of extinction almost too late it was classified as an endangered species and afforded a higher class of protection green fund seized the majestic bird and enlisted a halfdozen experts from around the country to testify on its behalf with a hundred lawyers involved the lawsuit moved slowly at times it went nowhere which suited green fund just fine the rigs were idle seven years after mattiece first buzzed over terrebonne bay in his jet helicopter and followed the swamplands along the route his precious canal would take the pelican suit went to trial in lake charles it was a bitter trial that lasted ten weeks green fund sought money damages for the havoc already inflicted and it wanted a permanent injunction against further drilling the oil companies brought in a fancy litigator from houston to talk to the jury he wore elephantskin boots and a stetson and could talk like a cajun when necessary he was stout medicine especially when compared to the green fund lawyers both of whom had beards and very intense faces green fund lost the trial and it was not altogether unexpected the oil companies spent millions and its difficult to whip a bear with a switch david pulled it off but the best bet is always on goliath the jurors were not impressed with the dire warnings about pollution and the frailness of wetland ecology oil meant money and folks needed jobs the judge kept the injunction in place for two reasons first he thought green fund had proven its point about the pelican a federally protected species and it was apparent to all that green fund would appeal so the matter was far from over the dust settled for a while and mattiece had a small victory but he knew there would be other days in other courtrooms he was a man of infinite patience and planning the tape recorder was in the center of the small table with four empty beer bottles around he made notes as he talked who told you about the lawsuit a guy named john del greco hes a law student at tulane a year ahead of me he clerked last summer for a big firm in houston and the firm was on the periphery of the hostilities he was not close to the trial but the rumors and gossip were heavy and all the firms were from new orleans and houston yes the principal litigation firms but these companies are from a dozen different cities so of course they brought their local counsel with them there were lawyers from dallas chicago and several other cities it was a circus whats the status of the lawsuit from the trial level it will be appealed to the fifth circuit court of appeals that appeal has not been perfected but should be in a month or so wheres the fifth circuit new orleans about twentyfour months after it arrives there a threejudge panel will hear and decide the losing party will undoubtedly request a rehearing by the full panel and this will take another three or four months there are enough defects in the verdict to insure either a reversal or a remand whats a remand the appellate court can do any of three things affirm the verdict reverse the verdict or find enough error to send the whole thing back for a new trial if it goes back its been remanded they can also affirm part reverse part remand part sort of scramble things up gray shook his head in frustration as he scribbled away why would anyone want to be a lawyer ive asked myself that a few times in the past week any idea what the fifth circuit might do none they havent even seen it yet the plaintiffs are alleging a multitude of procedural sins by the defendants and given the nature of the conspiracy a lot of its probably true it could be reversed then what happens the fun starts if either side is unhappy with the fifth circuit they can appeal to the supreme court surprise surprise each year the supreme court receives thousands of appeals but is very selective about what it takes because of the money and pressure and issues involved this one has a decent chance of being heard from today how long would it take for the case to be decided by the supreme court anywhere from three to five years rosenberg would have died from natural causes yes but there could be a democrat in the white house when he died from natural causes so take him out now when you can sort of predict his replacement makes sense oh its beautiful if youre victor mattiece and youve only got fifty million or so and you want to be a billionaire and you dont mind killing a couple of supremes then now is the time but what if the supreme court refused to hear the case hes in good shape if the fifth circuit affirms the trial verdict but if it reverses and the supreme court denies cert hes got problems my guess is that he would go back to square one stir up some new litigation and try it all again theres too much money involved to lick his wounds and go home when he took care of rosenberg and jensen one has to assume he committed himself to a cause where was he during the trial completely invisible keep in mind it is not public knowledge that hes the ringleader of the litigation by the time the trial started there were thirtyeight corporate defendants no individuals were named just corporations of the thirtyeight seven are traded publicly and he owns no more than twenty percent of any one these are just small firms traded over the counter the other thirtyone are privately held and i couldnt get much information but i did learn that many of these private companies are owned by each other and some are even owned by the public corporations its almost impenetrable but hes in control yes i suspect he owns or controls eighty percent of the project i checked out four of the private companies and three are chartered offshore two in the bahamas and one in the caymans del greco heard that mattiece operates from behind offshore banks and companies do you remember the seven public companies most of them they of course were footnoted in the brief a copy of which i do not have but ive rewritten most of it in longhand can i see it you can have it but its lethal ill read it later tell me about the photograph mattiece is from a small town near lafayette and in his younger years was a big money man for politicians in south louisiana he was a shadowy type back then always in the background giving money he spent big bucks on democrats locally and republicans nationally and over the years he was wined and dined by big shots from washington he has never sought publicity but his kind of money is hard to hide especially when its being handed out to politicians seven years ago when the president was the vice president he was in new orleans for a republican fundraiser all the heavy hitters were there including mattiece it was ten thousand dollars a plate so the press tried to get in somehow a photographer snapped a picture of mattiece shaking hands with the vp the new orleans paper ran it the next day its a wonderful picture theyre grinning at each other like best friends itll be easy to get i stuck it on the last page of the brief just for the fun of it this is fun isnt it im having a ball mattiece dropped out of sight a few years ago and is now believed to live in several places hes very eccentric del greco said most people believe hes demented the recorder beeped and gray changed tapes darby stood and stretched her long legs he watched her as he fumbled with the recorder two other tapes were already used and marked are you tired he asked i havent been sleeping well how many more questions how much more do you know weve covered the basics there are some gaps we can fill in the morning gray turned off the recorder and stood she was at the window stretching and yawning he relaxed on the sofa what happened to the hair he asked darby sat in a chair and pulled her feet under her red toenails her chin rested on her knees i left it in a hotel in new orleans how did you know about it i saw a photograph from where three photos actually two from the tulane yearbook and one from arizona state who sent them to you i have contacts they were faxed to me so they werent that good but there was this gorgeous hair i wish you hadnt done that why every phone call leaves a trail come on darby give me a little credit you were snooping around on me just a little background thats all no more okay if you want something from me just ask if i say no then leave it alone grantham shrugged and agreed forget the hair on to less sensitive matters so who selected rosenberg and jensen mattiece is not a lawyer rosenberg is easy jensen wrote little on environmental issues but he was consistent in voting against all types of development if they shared common ground with any consistency it was protecting the environment and you think mattiece figured this out by himself of course not a pretty wicked legal mind presented him with the two names he has a thousand lawyers and none in bc darby raised her chin and frowned at him what did you say none of his lawyers are in dc i didnt say that i thought you said the law firms were primarily from new orleans and houston and other cities you didnt mention dc darby shook her head youre assuming too much i can think of at least two dc firms that i ran across one is white and blazevich a very old powerful rich republican firm with four hundred lawyers gray moved to the edge of the sofa whats the matter she asked he was suddenly wired he was on his feet walking to the door then back to the sofa this may fit this may be it darby im listening are you listening i swear im listening he was at the window okay last week i got three phone calls from a lawyer in dc named garcia but thats not his name he said he knew something and saw something about rosenberg and jensen and he wanted so badly to tell me what he knew but he got scared and disappeared there are a million lawyers in bc two million but i know he works in a private firm he sort of admitted it he was sincere and very frightened thought they were following i asked who they were and he of course wouldnt say what happened to him we had a meeting planned for last saturday morning and he called early and said forget it said he was married and had a good job and why risk it he never admitted it but i think he has a copy of something that he was about to show me he could be your verification what if he works for white and blazevich weve suddenly narrowed it to four hundred lawyers the haystack is much smaller grantham darted to his bag flipped through some papers and presto pulled out a fivebyseven black and white he dropped it in her lap this is mr garcia darby studied the picture it was a man on a busy sidewalk the face was clear i take it he didnt pose for this not exactly grantham was pacing then howd you get it i cannot reveal my sources she slid it onto the coffee table and rubbed her eyes youre scaring me grantham this has a sleazy feel to it tell me its not sleazy its just a little sleazy okay the kid was using the same pay phone and thats a mistake yes i know thats a mistake and i wanted to know what he looked like did you ask if you could take his photograph no then its sleazy as hell okay its sleazy as hell but i did it and there it is and it could be our link to mattiece our link yes our link i thought you wanted to nail mattiece did i say that i want him to pay but id rather leave him alone hes made a believer out of me gray ive seen enough blood to last me a long time you take this ball and run with it he didnt hear this he walked behind her to the window then back to the bar you mentioned two firms whats the other brim stearns and somebody i didnt get a chance to check them out its sort of odd because neither firm is listed as counsel of record for any of the defendants but both firms especially white and blazevich kept popping up as i went through the file how big is brim stearns and somebody i can find out tomorrow as big as white and blazevich i doubt it just guess how big two hundred lawyers okay now were up to six hundred lawyers in two firms youre the lawyer darby how can we find garcia im not a lawyer and im not a private detective youre the investigative reporter she didnt like this we business yeah but ive never been in a law office except for the divorce then youre very fortunate how can we find him she was yawning again they had been talking for almost three hours and she was exhausted this could resume in the morning i dont know how to find him and i really havent given it much thought ill sleep on it and explain it to you in the morning grantham was suddenly calm she stood and walked to the bar for a glass of water ill get my things he said picking up the tapes would you do me a favor she asked maybe she paused and looked at the sofa would you mind sleeping on the sofa tonight i mean i havent slept well in a long time and i need the rest it would well it would be nice if i knew you were in here he swallowed hard and looked at the sofa they both looked at the sofa it was a fivefooter at most and did not appear to be the least bit comfortable sure he said smiling at her i understand im spooked okay i understand its nice to have someone like you around she smiled demurely and gray melted i dont mind he said no problem thanks lock the door get in the bed and sleep well ill be right here and everythings all right thanks she nodded and smiled again then closed the door to her bedroom he listened and she did not lock it he sat on the sofa in the darkness watching her door some time after midnight he dozed and slept with his knees not far from his chin her boss was jackson feldman and he was the executive editor and this was her turf and she didnt take any crap off anyone but mr feldman especially an insolent brat like gray grantham who was standing in front of mr feldmans door guarding it like a doberman she glared at him and he sneered at her and this had been going on for ten minutes ever since they huddled in there and closed the door why grantham was waiting outside she did not know but this was her turf her phone rang and grantham yelled at her no calls her face was instantly red and her mouth flew open she picked up the receiver listened for a second then said im sorry but mr feldman is in a meeting she glared at grantham who was shaking his head as if to dare heryes ill have him call you back as soon as possible she hung up thanks grantham said and this threw her off guard she was about to say something nasty but with the thanks her mind went blank he smiled at her and it made her even madder it was fivethirty time for her to leave but mr feldman asked her to stay he was still smirking at her over there by the door not ten feet away she had never liked gray grantham but then there werent too many people at the post she did like a news aide approached and appeared headed for the door when the doberman stepped in front of him sorry you cant go in right now grantham said and why not theyre in a meeting leave it with her he pointed at the secretary who despised being pointed at and despised being referred to simply as her she had been here for twentyone years the news aide was not easily intimidated thats fine but mr feldman instructed me to have these papers here at precisely fivethirty its precisely fivethirty here i am and here are the papers look were real proud of you but you cant go in understand now just leave the papers with that nice lady over there and the sun will come up tomorrow grantham moved squarely in front of the door and appeared ready for combat if the kid insisted ill take those the secretary said she took them and the news aide left thanks grantham said loudly again i find you to be very rude she snapped i said thanks he tried to look hurt youre a real smartass thanks the door suddenly opened and a voice called out grantham he smiled at her and stepped inside jackson feldman was standing behind his desk the tie was down to the second button and the sleeves were rolled to the elbows he was sixsix with no fat at fiftyeight he ran two marathons a year and worked fifteen hours a day smith keen was also standing and holding the fourpage outline of a story along with a copy of darbys handwritten reproduction of the pelican brief feldmans copy was lying on the desk they appeared dazed close the door feldman said to grantham gray closed the door and sat on the edge of a table no one spoke feldman rubbed his eyes roughly then looked at keen wow he finally said gray smiled you mean thats it i hand you the biggest story in twenty years and you are so moved you say wow wheres darby shaw keen asked i cant tell you its part of the deal what deal keen asked i cant tell you that either when did you talk to her last night and again this morning and this was in new york keen asked what difference does it make where we talked we talked okay she talked i listened i flew home i wrote the outline so what do you think feldman slowly folded his thin frame and sat deep in his chair how much does the white house know not sure verheek told darby that it was delivered to the white house one day last week and at the time the fbi thought it should be pursued then for some reason after the white house had it the fbi backed off thats all i know how much did mattiece give the president three years ago millions virtually all of it through a myriad of pacs that he controls this guy is very smart hes got all kinds of lawyers and they figure out ways to funnel money here and there its probably legal the editors were thinking slowly they were stunned as if theyd just survived a bomb blast grantham was quite proud and swung his feet under the table like a kid on a pier feldman slowly picked up the papers clipped together and flipped through until he found the photograph of mattiece and the president he shook his head its dynamite gray keen saidwe just cant run without a bunch of corroboration hell youre talking about the worlds greatest job of verifying this is powerful stuff son how can you do it feldman asked ive got some ideas id like to hear them you could get yourself killed with this grantham jumped to his feet and stuck his hands in his pockets first well try to find garcia we whos we keen asked me okay me ill try to find garcia is the girl in on this keen asked i cant answer that its part of the deal answer the question feldman said look at where we are if she gets killed helping you with the story its much too risky now where is she and what have you guys got planned im not telling where she is shes a source and i always protect my sources no shes not helping with the investigation shes just a source okay they stared at him in disbelief they looked at each other and finally keen shrugged do you want some help feldman asked no she insists on me doing it alone shes very scared and you cant blame her i got scared just reading the damned thing keen said feldman kicked back in his chair and crossed his feet on the desk size fourteens he smiled for the first timeyouve got to start with garcia if he cant be found then you could dig for months on mattiece and not put it together and before you start digging on mattiece lets have a long talk i sort of like you grantham and this is not worth getting killed over i see every word you write okay keen said and i want a daily report okay feldman said no problem keen walked to the glass wall and watched the madness in the newsroom in the course of each day the chaos came and went a half a dozen times things got crazy at fivethirty the news was being written and the second story conference was at sixthirty feldman watched from his desk this could be the end of the slump he said to gray without looking at him whats it been five six years try seven keen said ive written some good stories gray said defensively sure feldman said still watching the newsroom but youve been hitting doubles and triples the last grand slam was a long time ago there have been a lot of strikeouts too keen added helpfully happens to all of us gray said but this grand slam will be in the seventh game of the world series he opened the door feldman glared at him dont get hurt and dont allow her to get hurt understand gray smiled and left the office he was almost to thomas circle when he saw the blue lights behind him the cop did not pass but stayed on his bumper he was oblivious to both the speed limit and his speedometer it would be his third ticket in sixteen months he parked in a small lot next to an apartment house it was dark and the blue lights flashed in his mirrors he rubbed his temples step out the cop demanded from the bumper gray opened the door and did what he was told the cop was black and was suddenly smiling it was cleve he pointed to the patrol car get in they sat in the car under the blue lights and stared at the volvo why do you do this to me gray asked we have quotas grantham we have to stop so many white people and harass them chief wants to even things out the white cops pick on innocent poor black folks so us black cops have to pick on innocent rich white folks i suppose youre gonna handcuff me and beat the hell out of me only if you ask me to sarge cant talk anymore im listening he smells something around the place hes caught a few strange looks and hes heard a thing or two such as such as theyre talking about you and how much they need to know what you know he thinks they might be listening come on cleve is he serious hes heard them talk about you and how youre asking questions about the pelican something or other youve got em shook up what has he heard about this pelican thing just that youre hot on it and theyre serious about it these are mean and paranoid people gray sarge says to be careful where you go and who you talk to and we cant meet anymore not for a while he wants to lay low and run things through me well do that i need his help but tell him to be careful this is very touchy what is this pelican business i cant say but tell sarge it could get him killed not sarge hes smarter than all of them over there gray opened the door and got out thanks cleve he turned off the blue lights ill be around im working nights for the next six months so ill try and keep an eye on you thanks rupert paid for his cinnamon roll and sat on a bar stool overlooking the sidewalk it was midnight exactly midnight and georgetown was winding down a few cars sped along m street and the remaining pedestrians headed for home the coffee shop was busy but not crowded he sipped black coffee he recognized the face on the sidewalk and moments later the man was sitting on the next bar stool he was a flunkie of some sort they had met a few days ago in new orleans so whats the score rupert asked we cant find her and that worries us because we got some bad news today and well we heard voices unconfirmed that the bad guys have freaked out and that the number one bad guy wants to start killing everybody money is no object and these voices tell us hell spend whatever it takes to snuff this thing out hes sending in big boys with big guns of course they say hes deranged but hes mean as hell and money can kill a lot of people this killing talk did not faze rupert whos on the list the girl and i guess anyone else on the outside who happens to know about that little paper so whats my plan hang around well meet here tomorrow night same time if we find the girl itll be your show how do you plan to find her we think shes in new york we have ways rupert pulled off a piece of cinnamon roll and stuffed it in his mouth where would you be the messenger thought of a dozen places he might go but dammit they were like paris and rome and monte carlo places hed seen and places everyone went to he couldnt think of that one exotic spot where he would go and hide for the rest of his life i dont know where would you be new york city you can live there for years and never be seen you speak the language and know the rules its the perfect hiding place for an american yeah i guess youre right you think shes there i dont know at times shes clever then she has bad moments the messenger was on his feettomorrow night he said rupert waved him off what a goofy little twerp he thought running around whispering important messages in coffee shops and beer joints then running back to his boss and reliving it all in vivid detail he threw the coffee cup in the trash and was on the sidewalk brim stearns and kidlow had a hundred and ninety lawyers according to the latest edition of the martindalehubbell legal directory and white and blazevich had four hundred and twelve so hopefully garcia was only one of a possible six hundred and two but if mattiece used other dc firms the number would be higher and they didnt have a chance as expected white and blazevich had no one named garcia darby searched for another hispanic name but found none it was one of those lilywhite silkstocking outfits filled with ivy leaguers with long names that ended in numerals there were a few female names sprinkled about but only two were partners most of the women had joined after if she lived long enough to finish law school she would not consider working for a factory like white and blazevich grantham had suggested she check for hispanics because garcia was a bit unusual for an alias maybe the guy was hispanic and since garcia is common for them then maybe he just said it real quick it didnt work there were no hispanics in this firm according to the directory their clients were big and rich banks fortune and lots of oil companies they listed four of the defendants in the lawsuit as clients but not mr mattiece there were chemical companies and shipping lines and white and blazevich also represented the governments of south korea libya and syria silly she thought some of our enemies hire our lawyers to lobby our government but then you can hire lawyers to do anything brim stearns and kidlow was a smaller version of white and blazevich but gosh there were four hispanic names listed she wrote them down two men and two women she figured this firm must have been sued for race and sex discrimination in the past ten years they had hired all kinds of people the client list was predictable oil and gas insurance banks government relations pretty dull stuff she sat in a corner of the fordham law library for an hour it was friday morning ten in new york and nine in new orleans and instead of hiding in a library shed never seen before she was supposed to be sitting in federal procedure under alleck a professor she never liked but now missed sorely alice stark would be sitting next to her one of her favorite law nerds d ronald petrie would be sitting behind her asking for a date and making lewd comments she missed him too she missed the quiet mornings on thomas balcony sipping coffee and waiting for the french quarter to shake its cobwebs and come to life she missed the smell of cologne on his bathrobe she thanked the librarian and left the building on sixtysecond she headed east toward the park it was a brilliant october morning with a perfect sky and cool wind a pleasant change from new orleans but difficult to appreciate under the circumstances she wore new raybans and a muffler up to her chin the hair was still dark but she would cut no more she was determined to walk without looking over her shoulder they probably werent back there but she knew it would be years before she could stroll along a street without a doubt the trees in the park were a magnificent display of yellow and orange and red the leaves fell gently in the breeze she turned south on central park west she would leave tomorrow and spend a few days in washington if she survived she would then leave the country go maybe to the caribbean shed been there twice and there were a thousand little islands where most people spoke some form of english now was the time to leave the country theyd lost her trail and shed already checked on flights to nassau and jamaica she could be there by dark she found a pay phone in the rear of a bagel shop on sixth and punched grays number at the post its me she said well well i was afraid you had skipped the country thinking about it can you wait a week probably ill be there tomorrow what do you know im just gathering junk ive got copies of the annual statements for the seven public corporations involved in the suit its lawsuit not suit a suit is something you wear how can you ever forgive me mattiece is neither an officer nor director of any what else just the thousand phone calls routine i spent three hours yesterday hanging around courthouses looking for garcia you wont find him at a courthouse gray hes not that kind of lawyer hes in a corporate firm i take it you have a better idea ive got several ideas well then im just sitting here waiting on you ill call you when i get there dont call me at home she paused for a second may i ask why not theres a chance someone is listening and maybe following one of my best sources thinks ive ruffled enough feathers to get myself placed under surveillance fabulous and you want me to rush down there and team up with you well be safe darby we just have to be careful she gripped the phone and clenched her teeth how dare you talk to me about being careful ive been dodging bombs and bullets for ten days now and youre smug enough to tell me to be careful kiss my ass grantham maybe i should stay away from you there was a pause as she looked around the tiny cafe two men at the nearest table looked at her she was much too loud she turned away and breathed deeply grantham spoke slowly im sorry i forget it just forget it he waited a moment are you okay im terrific never felt better are you coming to dc i dont know im safe here and ill be much safer when i get on a plane and leave the country sure but i thought you had this wonderful idea about finding garcia then hopefully nailing mattiece i thought you were outraged and morally indignant and motivated by revenge whats happened to you well for one i have this burning desire to see my twentyfifth birthday im not selfish but perhaps id like to see my thirtieth too that would be nice i understand im not sure you understand i think youre more concerned with pulitzers and glory than my pretty little neck i assure you thats not true trust me darby youll be safe youve told me the story of your life you must trust me ill think about it thats not definite no its not give me some time okay she hung up and ordered a bagel a dozen languages rattled around her as the cafe was suddenly packed run baby run her good sense told her take a cab to the airport pay cash for a ticket to miami find the nearest flight south and get on the plane let grantham dig and wish him the best he was very good and hed find a way to break the story and she would read about it one day while lying on a sundrenched beach sipping a pina colada and watching the windsurfers stump limped by on the sidewalk she caught a glimpse of him through the crowd and through the window her mouth was suddenly dry and she was dizzy he didnt look inside he just ambled by looking rather lost she ran through the tables and watched him through the door he limped slightly to the corner of sixth and fiftyeighth and waited for the light he started to cross sixth then changed his mind and crossed fiftyeighth a taxi almost smeared him he was going nowhere just strolling along with a slight limp croft saw the kid as he stepped from an elevator into the atrium he was with another young lawyer and they didnt have their briefcases so it was obvious they were headed for a late lunch after five days of watching lawyers croft had learned their habits the building was on pennsylvania and brim stearns and kidlow covered floors three through eleven garcia left the building with his buddy and they laughed their way down the sidewalk something was very funny croft followed as closely as possible they walked and laughed for five blocks then just as he figured they ducked into a yuppie corporate fern bar for a quick bite croft called grantham three times before he got him it was almost two and the lunch was winding down by now and if grantham wanted to catch the guy then stay close to the damned phone gray slammed it down they would meet back at the building garcia and his friend walked a bit slower on the return it was a beautiful day and it was friday and they enjoyed this brief respite from the grind of suing people or whatever they did for two hundred bucks an hour croft hid behind his sunshades and kept his distance gray was waiting in the lobby near the elevators croft was close behind them as they spun through the revolving door he pointed quickly to their man gray caught the signal and punched the elevator button it opened and he stepped in just before garcia and his friend croft stayed behind garcia punched number six a split second before gray punched it too gray read the paper and listened as the two lawyers talked football the kid was no more than twentyseven or twentyeight the voice maybe had a vague familiarity to it but it had been on the phone and there was nothing distinctive about it the face was close but he couldnt study it the odds said go for it he looked very similar to the man in the photograph and he worked for brim stearns and kidlow and one of its countless clients was mr mattiece he would give it a shot but be cautious he was a reporter it was his job to go barging in with questions they left the elevator on six still yakking about the redskins and gray loitered behind them casually reading the paper the firms lobby was rich and opulent with chandeliers and oriental rugs and on one wall thick gold letters with the firms name the lawyers stopped at the front desk and picked up their phone messages gray strolled purposefully in front of the receptionist who eyed him carefully may i help you sir she asked in the tone that meant what the hell do you want gray did not miss a step im in a meeting with roger martin hed found the name in the phone book and hed called from the lobby a minute earlier to make sure lawyer martin was in today the building directory listed the firm on floors three through eleven but did not list all one hundred and ninety lawyers using the yellow pages listing he made a dozen quick calls to find a lawyer on each floor roger martin was the man on the sixth floor he frowned at the receptionist ive been meeting with him for two hours this puzzled her and she could think of nothing to say gray was around the corner and into a hallway he caught a glimpse of garcia entering his office four doors down the name beside the door was david m underwood gray did not knock on it he wanted to strike quickly and perhaps exit quickly mr underwood was hanging his jacket on a rack hi im gray grantham with the washington post im looking for a man named garcia underwood froze and looked puzzled howd you get in here he asked the voice was suddenly familiar i walked you are garcia arent you he pointed to a desk plate with his name in gold letters david m underwood theres no one on this floor named garcia i dont know of a garcia in this firm gray smiled as if to play along underwood was scared or irritated hows your daughter gray asked underwood was coming around the desk staring and getting very perturbed which one this didnt fit garcia had been quite concerned about his daughter a baby and if there had been more than one he would have mentioned it the youngest and your wife underwood was now within striking distance and inching closer it was obvious he was a man unafraid of physical contact i dont have a wife im divorced he held up his left fist and for a split second gray thought hed gone wild then he saw the four ringless fingers no wife no ring garcia adored his wife and there would be a ring it was now time to leave what do you want underwood demanded i thought garcia was on this floor he said easing away is your pal garcia a lawyer yes underwood relaxed a bit not in this firm we have a perez and a hernandez and maybe one other but i dont know a garcia well its a big firm gray said by the door sorry to bother underwood was following look mr grantham were not accustomed to reporters barging in around here ill call security and maybe they can help you wont be necessary thanks grantham was in the hall and gone underwood reported to security grantham cursed himself in the elevator it was empty except for him and he cursed out loud then he thought of croft and was cursing him when the elevator landed and opened and there was croft in the lobby near the pay phones cool it he told himself they left the building together didnt work gray said did you talk to him yep wrong man dammit i knew it was him it was the kid in the photos wasnt it no close but no cigar keep trying im really tired of this grantham ive youre getting paid arent you do it for one more week okay i can think of harder work croft stopped on the sidewalk and gray kept walkingone more week and im through croft yelled to him grantham waved him off he unlocked the illegally parked volvo and sped back to the post it was not a smart move it was quite stupid and he was much too experienced for such a mistake he would omit it from his daily chat with jackson feldman and smith keen feldman was looking for him another reporter said and he walked quickly to his office he smiled sweetly to the secretary who was poised to attack keen and howard krauthammer the managing editor were waiting with feldman keen closed the door and handed gray a newspaperhave you seen this it was the new orleans paper the timespicayune and the frontpage story was about the deaths of verheek and callahan along with big photos he read it quickly while they watched him it talked about their friendship and their strange deaths just six days apart and it mentioned darby shaw who had disappeared but no link to the brief i guess the cats out of the bag feldman said its nothing but the basics gray said we couldve run this three days ago why didnt we asked krauthammer theres nothing here its two dead bodies the name of the girl and a thousand questions none of which they answered theyve found a cop wholl talk but he knows nothing beyond the blood and gore but theyre digging gray keen said you want me to stop them the times has picked it up feldman saidtheyre run ning something tomorrow or sunday how much can they know why ask me look its possible they have a copy of the brief very unlikely but possible but they havent talked to the girl weve got the girl okay shes ours we hope said krauthammer feldman rubbed his eyes and stared at the ceiling lets say they have a copy of the brief and that they know she wrote it and now shes vanished they cant verify it right now but theyre not afraid to mention the brief without naming mattiece lets say they know callahan was her professor among other things and that he brought the brief here and gave it to his good friend verheek and now theyre dead and shes on the run thats a pretty damned good story wouldnt you say gray its a big story krauthammer said its peanuts compared to whats coming gray said i dont want to run it because its the tip of the iceberg and itll attract every paper in the country we dont need a thousand reporters bumping into each other i say we run it krauthammer said if not the times will beat our ass with it we cant run the story gray said why not asked krauthammer because im not going to write it and if its written by someone else here then we lose the girl its that simple shes debating right now about whether to jump on a plane and leave the country and one mistake by us and shes gone but shes already spilled her guts keen said i gave her my word okay i will not write the story until its pieced together and mattiece can be named its very simple youre using her arent you keen asked shes a source but shes not in the city if the times has the brief then they know about mattiece feldman said and if they know about mattiece you can bet theyie digging like hell to verify it what if they beat us krauthammer grunted in disgust were going to sit on our asses and lose the biggest story ive seen in twenty years i say we run what weve got its just the surface but its a helluva story right now no gray saidi wont write it until i have all of it and how long might that take feldman asked a week maybe we dont have a week krauthammer said gray was desperate i can find out how much the times knows give me fortyeight hours theyre running something tomorrow or sunday feldman said again let em run it ill bet money itll be the same story with probably the same mug shots you guys are assuming a hell of a lot youre assuming theyve got a copy of the brief but its author doesnt have a copy of it we dont have a copy of it lets wait and read their little story then go from there the editors studied each other krauthammer was frustrated keen was anxious but the boss was feldman and he said okay if they run something in the morning well meet here at noon and look at it fine gray said quickly and reached for the door youd better move fast grantham feldman said we cant sit on this much longer grantham was gone the limousine moved patiently in the beltway rush hour it was dark and matthew barr read with the aid of a reading light in the ceiling coal sipped perrier and watched the traffic he had the brief memorized and could have simply explained it to barr but he wanted to watch his reaction barr had no reaction until he got to the photograph then slowly shook his head he laid it on the seat and thought about it for a moment very nasty he said coal grunted how true is it barr asked id love to know when did you first see it tuesday of last week it came over from the fbi in one of their daily reports whatd the president say he was not that happy with it but there was no cause for alarm its just another wild shot in the dark we thought he talked to voyles about it and voyles agreed to leave it alone for a while now im not so sure did the president ask voyles to back off barr asked the question slowly yes thats awfully close to obstruction of justice assuming of course the brief turns out to be true and what if its true then the president has problems ive got one conviction for obstruction so ive been there its like mail fraud its broad and wide and fairly easy to prove were you in on it what do you think then i think youve got problems too they rode in silence and watched the traffic coal had thought through the obstruction angle but he wanted barrs opinion he wasnt worried about criminal charges the president had one brief little chat with voyles asked him to look elsewhere for the time being and that was it hardly the work of felons but coal was terribly concerned with reelection and a scandal involving a major contributor like mattiece would be devastating the thought was sickeninga man the president knew and took millions from paid money to have two supreme court justices knocked off so his pal the president could appoint more reasonable men to the bench so that the oil could be harvested the democrats would fall in the streets howling with glee every subcommittee in congress would hold hearings every newspaper would run it every day for a year the justice department would be forced to investigate coal would be forced to take the blame and resign hell everyone in the white house except the president would have to go it was a nightmare of horrific proportions weve got to find out if the brief is true coal said to the window if people are dying then its true give me a better reason for killing callahan and verheek there was no other reason and coal knew it i want you to do something find the girl no shes either dead or hiding in a cave somewhere i want you to talk to mattiece im sure hes in the yellow pages you can find him we need to establish a link that the president knows nothing about we need to first determine how much of this is true and you think victor will take me into his confidence and tell me his secrets yes eventually youre not a cop remember assume its true and he thinks hes about to be exposed hes desperate and hes killing people what if you told him the press had the story and the end was near and if he is inclined to disappear then nows the time youre coming to him from washington remember from the inside from the president or so he thinks hell listen to you okay what if he tells me its true whats in it for us ive got some ideas all in the category of damage control the first thing well do is immediately appoint two nature lovers to the court i mean wildeyed radical bird watchers it would show that down deep were good little environmentalists and it would kill mattiece and his oil field etc we could do this in a matter of hours almost simultaneously the president will call in voyles and the attorney general and justice and demand an immediate investigation into mattiece well leak copies of the brief to every reporter in town then hunker down and ride out the storm barr was smiling with admiration coal continued it wont be pretty but its far better than sitting back and hoping the brief is a work of fiction how do you explain that photograph you cant itll hurt for a while but it was seven years ago and people go crazy well portray mattiece as a good citizen back then but now hes a madman he is a madman yes he is and right now hes like a wounded dog backed in a corner you must convince him to throw in the towel and haul ass i think hell listen to you and i think well find out from him if its true so how do i find him ive got a man working on that ill pull some strings and make a contact be ready to go on sunday barr smiled to the window he would like to meet mattiece the traffic slowed coal slowly sipped his water anything on grantham not really were listening and watching but nothing exciting he talks to his mother and a couple of gals but nothing worth reporting he works a lot he left town wednesday and returned thursday where did he go new york probably working on some story cleve was supposed to be at the corner of rhode island and sixth at exactly pm but he wasnt gray was supposed to race down rhode island until cleve caught him so that if anyone was indeed following him they would think he was simply a dangerous driver he raced down rhode island through sixth at fifty miles per hour and watched for blue lights there were none he looped around and fifteen minutes later barreled down rhode island again there he saw blue lights and pulled to the curb it was not cleve it was a white cop who was very agitated he jerked grays license examined it and asked if hed been drinking no sir he said the cop wrote the ticket and proudly handed it to gray who sat behind the wheel staring at the ticket until he heard voices coming from the rear bumper another cop was on the scene and they were arguing it was cleve and he wanted the white cop to forget the ticket but the white cop explained it had already been written and besides the idiot was doing fiftysix miles an hour through the intersection hes a friend cleve said then teach him how to drive before he kills somebody the white cop said as he got in his patrol car and drove away cleve was snickering as he looked in grays window sorry about that he said with a smile its all your fault slow it down next time gray threw the ticket on the floorboard lets talk quick you said sarge said the boys in the west wing are talking about me right right okay i need to know from sarge if theyre talking about any other reporters especially from the new york times i need to know if they think anybody else is hot on the story is that all yes i need it quick slow it down cleve said loudly and walked to his car darby paid for the room for the next seven days in part because she wanted a familiar place to return to if necessary and in part because she wanted to leave some new clothes she had purchased it was sinful this running and leaving everything behind the clothes were nothing fancy sort of upscale safari law school but they cost even more in new york and it would be nice to keep them she would not take risks over clothes but she liked the room and she liked the city and she wanted the clothes it was time to run again and she would travel light she carried a small canvas bag when she darted from the st moritz into a waiting cab it was almost pm friday and central park south was busy across the street a line of horses and carriages waited for customers and brief excursions through the park the cab took ten minutes to get to seventysecond and broadway which was the wrong direction but this entire journey should be hard to follow she walked thirty feet and disappeared into the subway she had studied a map and a book of the system and she hoped it would be easy the subway was not appealing because shed never used it and shed heard the stories but this was the broadway line the most commonly used train in manhattan and it was rumored to be safe at times and things werent so swell above the ground the subway could hardly be worse she waited in the correct spot with a group of drunk but welldressed teenagers and the train arrived in a couple of minutes it wasnt crowded and she took a seat near the center doors stare at the floor and hold the bag she kept telling herself she looked at the floor but from behind the dark shades she studied the people it was her lucky night no street punks with knives no beggars no perverts at least none she could spot but for a novice it was nerveracking anyway the drunk kids exited at times square and she got off quickly at the next stop she had never seen penn station but this was not the time to sightsee maybe one day she could return and spend a month and admire the city without watching for stump and thin man and who knows who else who was out there but not now she had five minutes and found her train as it was boarding again she sat in the rear and watched every passenger there were no familiar faces surely please surely they had not stuck to her on this jagged escape once again her mistake had been credit cards she had bought four tickets at ohare with american express and somehow they knew she was in new york she was certain stump had not seen her but he was in the city and of course he had friends there could be twenty of them but then she was not certain of anything the train left six minutes late it was half empty she pulled a paperback from the bag and pretended to read it fifteen minutes later they stopped in newark and she got off she was a lucky girl there were cabs lined up outside the station and ten minutes later she was at the airport it was saturday morning and the queen was in florida taking money from the rich and it was clear and cool outside he wanted to sleep late then play golf whenever he woke up but it was seven and he was sitting at his desk wearing a tie listening to fletcher coal suggest what they ought to do about this and about that richard horton the attorney general had talked to coal and now coal was alarmed someone opened the door and horton entered alone they shook hands and horton sat across the desk coal stood nearby and this really irritated the president horton was dull but sincere he was not dumb or slow he just thought carefully about everything before he acted he thought about each word before he said it he was loyal to the president and could be trusted for sound judgment we are seriously considering a formal grand jury investigation into the deaths of rosenberg and jensen he announced gravelyin light of whats happened in new orleans we think this should be pursued immediately the fbi is investigating the president said theyve got three hundred agents on the case why should we get involved are they investigating the pelican brief horton asked he knew the answer he knew voyles was in new orleans at this moment with hundreds of agents he knew they had talked to hundreds of people collected a pile of useless evidence he knew the president had asked voyles to back off and he knew voyles was not telling the president everything horton had never mentioned the pelican brief to the president and the fact that he even knew about the damned thing was exasperating how many more knew about it probably thousands they are pursuing all leads coal said they gave us a copy of it almost two weeks ago so we assume theyre pursuing it exactly what horton expected out of coal i feel strongly that the administration should investigate this matter at once he spoke as though this was all memorized and this irritated the president why asked the president what if the brief is on target if we do nothing and the truth eventually surfaces the damage will be irreparable do you honestly believe theres any truth to it the president asked its awfully suspicious the first two men who saw it are dead and the person who wrote it has disappeared it is perfectly logical if one is so inclined to kill supreme court justices there are no other compelling suspects from what i hear the fbi is baffled yes it needs to be pursued hortons investigations leaked worse than the white house basement and coal was terrified of this clown impaneling a grand jury and calling witnesses horton was an honorable man but the justice department was filled with lawyers who talked too much dont you think its a bit premature coal asked i dont think so have you seen the papers this morning coal asked horton had glanced at the front page of the post and read the sports section it was saturday after all he had heard that coal read eight newspapers before dawn so he didnt like this question ive read a couple of them he said ive looked at several coal said modestlyand theres not a word anywhere about those two dead lawyers or the girl or mattiece or anything related to the brief if you start a formal investigation at this point itll be frontpage news for a month do you think it will simply go away horton asked coal it might for obvious reasons we hope so i think youre optimistic mr coal we dont normally sit back and wait for the press to do our investigating coal grinned and almost laughed at this one he smiled at the president who shot him a quick look and horton started a slow burn whats wrong with waiting a week asked the president nothing shot coal just that quick the decision was made to wait a week and horton knew it things could blow up in a week he said without conviction wait a week the president ordered well meet here next friday and go from there im not saying no richard just wait seven days horton shrugged this was more than he expected hed covered his rear he would go straight to his office and dictate a lengthy memo detailing everything he could remember about this meeting and his neck would be protected coal stepped forward and handed him a sheet of paper whats this more names do you know them it was the birdwatcher list four judges who were much too liberal for comfort but plan b called for radical environmentalists on the court horton blinked several times and studied it hard you must be kidding check em out said the president these guys are offthewall liberals horton mumbled yes but they worship the sun and moon and trees and birds coal explained helpfully horton caught on and suddenly smiled i see pelican lovers theyre almost extinct you know the president said coal headed for the door i wish theyd been wiped out ten years ago she hadnt called by nine when gray arrived at his desk in the newsroom hed read the times and there was nothing in it he spread the new orleans paper over the clutter and skimmed it nothing they had reported all they knew callahan verheek darby and a thousand unanswered questions he had to assume the times and maybe the timespicayune in new orleans had seen the brief or heard about it and thus knew of mattiece and he had to assume they were clawing like cats to verify it but he had darby and they would find garcia and if mattiece could be verified they would do it at the moment there was no alternative plan if garcia was gone or refused to help they would be forced to explore the dark and murky world of victor mattiece darby would not last long at that and he didnt blame her he was uncertain how long he would last smith keen appeared with a cup of coffee and sat on the desk if the times had it would they hold off until tomorrow gray shook his head no if they had more than the timespicayune it wouldve run today krauthammer wants to run what weve got he thinks we can name mattiece i dont follow hes leaning on feldman his angle is that we can run the whole story about callahan and verheek getting killed over this brief which happens to name mattiece who happens to be a friend of the presidents without directly accusing mattiece he says we can be extremely cautious and make sure the story says mattiece is named in the brief but not named by us and since the brief is causing all this death then it has been verified to some extent he wants to hide behind the brief exactly but its all speculation until its confirmed krauthammers losing it assume for a second that mr mattiece is in no way involved with this completely innocent we run the story with his name in it and then what we look like fools and we get sued for the next ten years im not writing the story he wants someone else to write it if this paper runs a pelican story not written by me the girl is gone okay i thought i explained that yesterday you did and feldman heard you hes on your side gray and i am too but if this things true itll blow up in a matter of days we all believe that you know how krauthammer hates the times and hes afraid those bastardsll run it they cant run it smith they may have a few more facts than the timespicayune but they cant name mattiece look well verify before anyone and when its nailed down ill write the story with everyones name along with that cute little picture of mattiece and his friend in the white house and the fat lady will sing we you said it again you said well verify it my source and i okay gray opened a drawer and found the photo of darby and the diet coke he handed it to keen who admired it where is she he asked im not sure i think shes on her way here from new york dont get her killed were being very cautious gray looked over both shoulders and leaned closer in fact smith i think im being followed i just wanted you to know who might they be it came from a source at the white house im not using my phones id better tell feldman okay i dont think its dangerous yet he needs to know keen jumped to his feet and disappeared she called within minutes im here she said i dont know how many ive brought with me but im here and alive for the moment where are you tabard inn on n street i saw an old friend on sixth avenue yesterday remember stump who was grievously wounded on bourbon street did i tell you that story yes well hes walking again a slight limp but he was wandering around manhattan yesterday i dont think he saw me are you serious thats scary darby its worse than scary i left six trails when i left last night and if i see him in this city limping along a sidewalk somewhere i intend to surrender ill walk up to him and turn myself in i dont know what to say say as little as possible because these people have radar ill play private eye for three days and im out of here if i live to see wednesday morning im on a plane to aruba or trinidad or some place with a beach when i die i want to be on a beach when do we meet im thinking about that i want you to do two things im listening where do you park your car close to my apartment leave it there and go rent another one nothing fancy just a generic ford or something pretend someones watching you through a rifle scope go to the marbury hotel in georgetown and get a room for three nights theyll take cashive already checked do it under another name grantham took notes and shook his head can you sneak out of your apartment after dark she asked i think so do it and take a cab to the marbury have them deliver the rental car to you there take two cabs to the tabard inn and walk into the restaurant at exactly nine tonight okay anything else bring clothes plan to be away from your apartment for at least three days and plan to stay away from the office really darby i think the office is safe im not in the mood to argue if youre going to be difficult gray ill simply disappear im convinced ill live longer the sooner i get out of the country yes maam thats a good boy i assume theres a master plan rattling around somewhere in your brain maybe well talk about it over dinner is this sort of like a date lets eat a bite and call it business yes maam im hanging up now be cautious gray theyre watching she was gone she was sitting at table thirtyseven in a dark corner of the tiny restaurant when he found her at exactly nine the first thing he noticed was the dress and as he walked to the table he knew the legs were under it but he couldnt see them maybe later when she stood he wore a coat and tie and they were an attractive couple he sat close to her in the darkness so they could both watch the small crowd the tabard inn appeared old enough to have served food to thomas jefferson a rowdy crowd of germans laughed and talked on the patio outside the restaurant the windows were open and the air was cool and for one brief moment it was easy to forget why they were hiding whered you get the dress you like it its very nice i shopped a little this afternoon like most of my recent wardrobe its disposable ill probably leave it in the room the next time i flee for my life the waiter was before them with menus they ordered drinks the restaurant was quiet and harmless howd you get here he asked around the world id like to know i took a train to newark a plane to boston a plane to detroit and a plane to dulles i was up all night and twice i forgot where i was how could they follow that they couldnt i paid with cash something im running out of how much do you need id like to wire some from my bank in new orleans well do it monday i think youre safe darby ive thought that before in fact i felt very safe when i was getting on the boat with verheek except it wasnt verheek and i felt very safe in new york then stump waddled down the sidewalk and i havent eaten since you look thin thanks i guess have you eaten here she looked at her menu he looked at his no but i hear the food is great you changed your hair again it was light brown and there was a trace of mascara and blush and lipstick its going to fall out if i keep seeing these people the drinks arrived and they ordered we expect something in the times in the morning he would not mention the new orleans paper because it had pictures of callahan and verheek he assumed shed seen it this didnt seem to interest her such as she asked looking around were not sure we hate to get beat by the times its an old rivalry im not interested in that i know nothing about journalism and dont care to learn im here because i have one and only one idea about finding garcia and if it doesnt work and quickly im out of here forgive me what would you like to talk about europe whats your favorite place in europe i hate europe and i hate europeans i go to canada and australia and new zealand occasionally why do you like europe my grandfather was a scottish immigrant and ive got a bunch of cousins over there ive visited twice gray squeezed the lime in his gin and tonic a party of six entered from the bar and she watched them carefully when she talked her eyes darted quickly around the room i think you need a couple of drinks to relax gray said she nodded but said nothing the six were seated at a nearby table and began speaking in french it was pleasant to hear have you ever heard cajun french she asked no its a dialect thats rapidly disappearing just like the wetlands they say it cannot be understood by frenchmen thats fair im sure the cajuns cant understand the french she took a long drink of white wine did i tell you about chad brunei i dont think so he was a poor cajun boy from eunice his family survived by trapping and fishing in the marshes he was a very bright kid who attended lsu on a full academic scholarship then was admitted to law school at stanford where he finished with the highest grade point average in the schools history he was twentyone when he was admitted to the california bar he could have worked for any law firm in the country but he took a job with an environmental defense outfit in san francisco he was brilliant a real legal genius who worked very hard and was soon winning huge lawsuits against oil and chemical companies at the age of twentyeight he was a highly polished courtroom lawyer he was feared by big oil and other corporate polluters she took a sip of wine he made a lot of money and established a group to preserve the louisiana wetlands he wanted to participate in the pelican case as it was known but had too many other trial commitments he gave green fund a lot of money for litigation expenses shortly before the trial started in lafayette he announced he was coming home to assist the green fund lawyers there were a couple of stories about him in the new orleans paper what happened to him he committed suicide what a week before the trial they found him in a car with the engine running a garden hose ran from the exhaust pipe into the front seat just another simple suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning where was the car in a wooded area along bayou lafourche near the town of galliano he knew the area well some camping gear and fishing equipment were in the trunk no suicide note the police investigated but found nothing suspicious the case was closed this is incredible he had had some problems with alcohol and had been treated by an analyst in san francisco but the suicide was a surprise do you think he was murdered a lot of people do his death was a big blow to green fund his passion for the wetlands wouldve been potent in the courtroom gray finished his drink and rattled the ice she inched closer to him the waiter appeared and they ordered he lobby of the marbury hotel was empty at am sunday when gray found a copy of the times it was six inches deep and weighed twelve pounds and he wondered how much thicker they planned to make it he raced back to his room on the eighth floor spread the paper on the bed and hovered over it as he skimmed intensely the front page was empty and this was crucial if they had the big story it would of course be there he feared large photographs of rosenberg jensen callahan verheek maybe darby and khamel who knows maybe they had a nice picture of mattiece and all of these would be lined up on the front page like a cast of characters and the times had beat them again he had dreamed of this while he had slept which had not been for long but there was nothing and the less he found the faster he skimmed until he was down to sports and classifieds and he stopped and sort of danced to the phone he called smith keen who was awakehave you seen it he asked aint it beautiful keen said i wonder what happened they dont have it smith theyre digging like hell but they dont have it yet who did feldman talk to he never says but it was supposed to be reliable keen was divorced and lived alone in an apartment not far from the marbury are you busy gray asked well not exactly its almost sixthirty on sunday morning we need to talk pick me up outside the marbury hotel in fifteen minutes the marbury hotel its a long story ill explain ah the girl you lucky stiff i wish shes in another hotel here in washington yes fifteen minutes ill be there gray nervously sipped coffee from a paper cup and waited in the lobby shed made him paranoid and he half expected thugs to be hiding on the sidewalk with automatic weapons this frustrated him he saw keens toyota ease by on m street and he walked quickly to it what would you like to see keen said as he drove away from the curb oh i dont know its a beautiful day how about virginia as you wish did you get kicked out of your apartment not exactly im following orders from the girl she thinks like a field marshal and im here because i was told to be here i must stay until tuesday or until she gets jumpy and moves me again im in room eightthirtythree if you need me but dont tell anyone i assume you want the post to pay for this keen said with a smile im not thinking about money right now the same people who tried to kill her in new orleans turned up in new york on friday or so she thinks they have amazing talent in pursuit and shes being painfully cautious well if youre being followed by someone and shes being followed by someone then perhaps she knows what shes doing oh listen smith she knows exactly what shes doing shes so good its scary and shes leaving here wednesday morning for good so weve got two days to find garcia what if garcias overrated what if you find him and he wont talk or what if he knows nothing have you thought about that ive had nightmares about that i think he knows something big theres a document or a piece of paper something tangible and hes got it he referred to it a time or two and when i pressed him he wouldnt admit it but the day we were supposed to meet he planned to show it to me im convinced of that hes got something smith and if he wont show it to you ill break his neck they crossed the potomac and cruised by arlington cemetery keen lit his pipe and cracked a window what if you cant find garcia plan b shes gone and the deals off once she leaves the country i have permission to do anything with the brief except use her name as a source the poor girl is convinced shes dead regardless of whether we get the story but she wants as much protection as possible i can never use her name not even as the author of the brief does she talk much about the brief not the actual writing of it it was a wild idea she pursued it and had almost dismissed it when bombs started going off shes sorry she wrote the damned thing she and callahan were really in love and shes loaded down with a lot of pain and guilt so whats plan b we attack the lawyers mattiece is too devious and slippery to penetrate without subpoenas and warrants and things we cant dispense but we know his lawyers hes represented by two big firms here in town and we go after them a lawyer or a group of them carefully analyzed the supreme court and suggested the names of rosenberg and jensen mattiece wouldnt know who to kill so his lawyers told him its a conspiracy angle but you cant make them talk not about a client but if the lawyers are guilty and we start asking questions somethingll break well need a dozen reporters making a million phone calls to lawyers paralegals law clerks secretaries copy room clerks everybody we assault these bastards keen puffed his pipe and was noncommittal who are the firms white and blazevich and brim stearns and kidlow check our library on them ive heard of white and blazevich its a big republican outfit gray nodded and sipped the last of his coffee what if its another firm keen asked what if the firm is not in washington what if the conspirators dont break what if theres only one legal mind at work here and it belongs to a parttime paralegal in shreveport what if one of mattieces inhouse lawyers devised the scheme sometimes you irritate the hell out of me do you know that these are valid questions what if then we go to plan c and whats that i dont know yet she hasnt gotten that far she had instructed him to stay off the streets and to eat in his room he had a sandwich and fries in a bag and was obediently walking to his room on the eighth floor of the marbury an asian maid was pushing her cart near his room he stopped at his door and pulled the key from his pocket you forget something sir the maid asked gray looked at her i beg your pardon you forget something well no why the maid took a step closer to him you just left sir and now you are back i left four hours ago she shook her head and took another step for a closer look no sir a man left your room ten minutes ago she hesitated and studied his face intentlybut sir now i think it was another man gray glanced at the room number on the door he stared at the woman are you certain another man was in this room yes sir just minutes ago he panicked he walked quickly to the stairs and ran down eight flights what was in the room nothing but clothes nothing about darby he stopped and reached into a pocket the note with the tabard inn address and her phone number was in the pocket he caught his breath and eased into the lobby he had to find her and quick darby found an empty table in the reading room on the second floor of the edward bennett williams law library at georgetown in her new hobby as a traveling critic of law school libraries she found georgetowns to be the nicest so far it was a separate fivestory building across a small courtyard from mcdonough hall the law school the library was new sleek and modern but still a law library and quickly filling with sunday students now thinking of final exams she opened volume five of martindalehubbell and found the section for dc firms white and blazevich ran for twentyeight pages names birth dates birthplaces schools professional organizations distinctions awards committees and publications of four hundred and twelve lawyers the partners first then the associates she took notes on a legal pad the firm had eightyone partners and the rest were associates she grouped them by alphabet and wrote every name on the legal pad she was just another law student checking out law firms in the relentless chase of employment the work was boring and her mind wandered thomas had studied here twenty years ago hed been a top student and claimed to have spent many hours in the library hed written for the law journal a chore she would be enduring under normal circumstances death was a subject shed analyzed from different angles in the past ten days except for going quietly in ones sleep she was undecided as to the best approach a slow agonizing demise from a disease was a nightmare for the victim and the loved ones but at least there was time for preparation and farewells a violent unexpected death was over in a second and probably best for the deceased but the shock was numbing for those left behind there were so many painful questions did he suffer what was his last thought why did it happen and watching the quick death of a loved one was beyond description she loved him more because she watched him die and she told herself to stop hearing the explosion and stop smelling the smoke and stop watching him die if she survived three more days she would be in a place where she could lock the door and cry and throw things until the grieving was over she was determined to make it to that place she was determined to grieve and to heal it was the least she deserved she memorized names until she knew more about white and blazevich than anyone outside the firm she eased into the darkness and caught a cab to the hotel matthew barr went to new orleans where he met with a lawyer who instructed him to fly to a certain hotel in fort lauderdale the lawyer was vague about what would happen at the hotel but barr checked in sunday night and found a room waiting for him a note at the desk said he would receive a call in the early am he called fletcher coal at home at ten and briefed him on the journey so far coal had other things on his mindgranthams gone crazy he and a guy named rifkin with the times are making calls everywhere they could be deadly have they seen the brief i dont know if theyve seen it but theyve heard of it rifkin called one of my aides at home yesterday and asked what he knew about the pelican brief the aide knew nothing and got the impression rifkin knew even less i dont think hes seen it but we cant be certain damn fletcher we cant keep up with a bunch of reporters those guys make a hundred phone calls a minute just two grantham and rifkin youve already got grantham wired do the same for rifkin granthams wired but hes using neither the phone in his apartment nor the one in his car i called bailey from the airport in new orleans grantham hasnt been home in twentyfour hours but his cars still there they called and knocked on his door hes either dead in the apartment or he sneaked out last night maybe hes dead i dont think so we were following and so were the fibbies i think he got wind of it you must find him hell turn up he cant get too far away from the newsroom on the fifth floor i want rifkin wired too call bailey tonight and get it started okay yes sir barr said what do you think mattiece would do if he thought grantham had the story and was about to spread it across the front page of the washington post coal asked barr stretched on the hotel bed and closed his eyes months ago he had made the decision never to cross fletcher coal he was an animal hes not afraid of killing people is he barr said do you think youll see mattiece tomorrow i dont know these guys are very secretive they speak in hushed tones behind closed doors theyve told me little why do they want you in fort lauderdale i do not know but its much closer to the bahamas i think im going there tomorrow or perhaps hes coming here i just dont know perhaps you should exaggerate the grantham angle mattiece will snuff out the story ill think about it call me in the morning she stepped on the note when she opened her door it said darby im on the patio its urgent gray she took a deep breath and crammed the note in her pocket she locked the door and followed the narrow winding hallways to the lobby then through the dark sitting room by the bar through the restaurant and onto the patio he was at a small table partially hidden by a brick wall why are you here she demanded in a whisper as she sat close to him he looked tired and worried where have you been he asked thats not as important as why youre here youre not supposed to come here unless i say so whats going on he gave her a quick summary of his morning from the first phone call to smith keen to the maid in the hotel hed spent the rest of the day darting all over the city in various cabs almost eighty bucks worth of cabs and he waited until dark to sneak into the tabard inn he was certain he had not been followed she listened she watched the restaurant and the entrance to the patio and heard every word i have no idea how anyone could find my room he said did you tell anyone your room number he thought for a second only smith keen but hed never repeat it she was not looking at himwhere were you when you told him your room number in his car she shook her head slowly i distinctly told you not to tell anyone didnt i he would not answer its all fun and games isnt it gray just another day at the beach youre a big stud reporter whos had death threats before but youre fearless the bullets will bounce off wont they you and i can spend a few days here frolicking around town playing detective so you can win a pulitzer and get rich and famous and the bad guys arent really so bad because hey youre gray grantham of the washington post and that makes you a mean son of a bitch come on darby ive tried to impress upon you how dangerous these people are ive seen what they can do i know what theyll do to me if they find me but no gray its all a game to you cops and robbers hideandseek im convinced okay listen hotshot youd better be convinced one more screwup and were dead im out of lucky breaks do you understand yes i swear i understand get a room here tomorrow night if were alive ill find you another small hotel what if this place is full then you can sleep in my bathroom with the door closed she was dead serious he felt like a firstgrader whod just received his first spanking they didnt speak for five minutes so howd they find me he finally asked i would assume the phones in your apartment are tapped and your car is bugged and i would assume smith keens car is also wired these people are not amateurs he spent the night in room upstairs but slept little the restaurant opened at six and he sneaked down for coffee then sneaked back to his room the inn was quaint and ancient and had somehow been formed when three old townhouses were connected small doors and narrow hallways ran in all directions the atmosphere was timeless it would be a long tiresome day but it would all be spent with her and he looked forward to it hed made a mistake a bad one but shed forgiven him at precisely eightthirty he knocked on the door to room she quickly opened it then closed it behind him she was a law student again with jeans and a flannel shirt she poured him coffee and sat at the small table where the phone was surrounded by notes from a legal pad did you sleep well she asked but only out of courtesy no he threw a copy of the times on the bed hed already scanned it and it was empty again darby took the phone and punched the number of the georgetown law school she looked at him and listened then said placement office please there was a long pauseyes this is sandra jernigan im a partner with white and blazevich here in town and were having a problem with our computers were trying to reconstruct some payroll records and the accountants have asked me to ask you for the names of your students who clerked here last summer i think there were four of them she listened for a second jernigan sandra jernigan she repeatedi see how long will it take a pause and your name is joan thank you joan darby covered the receiver and breathed deeply gray watched intently but with an admiring grin yes joan seven of them our records are a mess do you have their addresses and social security numbers we need it for tax purposes sure how long will it take fine we have an office boy in the area his name is snowden and hell be there in thirty minutes thank you joan darby hung up and closed her eyes sandra jernigan he said im not good at lying she said youre wonderful i guess im the office boy you could pass for an office boy you have an aging law school dropout look about you and youre sort of cute she thought to herself i like the flannel shirt she took a long drink of cold coffee this could be a long day so far so good i get the list and meet you in the library right yes the placement office is on the fifth floor of the law school ill be in room its a small conference room on the third floor you take a cab first ill meet you there in fifteen minutes yes maam grantham was out the door darby waited five minutes then left with her canvas bag the cab ride was short but slow in the morning traffic life on the lam was bad enough but running and playing detective at the same time was too much shed been in the cab five minutes before she thought about being followed and maybe that was good maybe a hard day as an investigative reporter would take her mind off stump and the other tormentors she would work today and tomorrow and by late wednesday she would be on a beach they would start with the law school at georgetown if it was a dead end they would try the one at george washington if there was time they would try american university three strikes and she was gone the cab stopped at mcdonough hall at the grungy base of capitol hill with her bag and flannel shirt she was just one of many law students milling about before class she took the stairs to the third level and closed the door to the conference room behind her the room was used for an occasional class and on campus job interviews she spread her notes on the table and was just another law student preparing for class within minutes gray eased through the door joans a sweet lady he said as he placed the list on the table names addresses and social security numbers aint that nice darby looked at the list and pulled a phone book from her bag they found five of the names in the book she looked at her watch its five minutes after nine ill bet no more than half of these are in class at this moment some will have later classes ill call these five and see whos at home you take the two with no phone number and get their class schedules from the registrar gray looked at his watch lets meet back here in fifteen minutes he left first then darby she went to the pay phones on the first level outside the classrooms and dialed the number of james maylor a male voice answered hello is this dennis maylor she asked no im james maylor sorry she hung up his address was ten minutes away he didnt have a nine oclock class and if he had one at ten he would be home for another forty minutes maybe she called the other four two answered and she confirmed and there was no answer at the other two gray waited impatiently in the registrars office on the third floor a parttime student clerk was trying to find the registrar who was somewhere in the back the student informed him that she wasnt sure if they could give out class schedules gray said he was certain they could if they wanted to the registrar walked suspiciously around a corner may i help you yes im gray grantham with the washington post and im trying to find two of your students laura kaas and michael akers is there a problem she asked nervously not at all just a few questions are they in class this morning he was smiling and it was a warm trusting smile that he flashed usually at older women it seldom failed him do you have an id or something certainly he opened his wallet and slowly waved it at her much like a cop who knows hes a cop and doesnt care to spell it out well i really should talk to the dean but fine wheres his office but hes not here hes out of town i just need their class schedules so i can find them im not asking for home addresses or grades or transcripts nothing confidential or personal she glanced at the parttime student clerk who sort of shrugged like whats the big deal just a minute she said and disappeared around the corner darby was waiting in the small room when he laid the computer printouts on the table according to these akers and kaas should be in class right now he said darby looked at the schedules akers has criminal procedure kaas has administrative law both from nine to ten ill try to find them she showed gray her notesmaylor reinhart and wilson were at home i couldnt get ratliff and linney maylors the closest i can be there in a few minutes what about a car darby asked i called hertz its supposed to be delivered to the post parking lot in fifteen minutes maylors apartment was on the third floor of a warehouse converted for students and others on very low budgets he answered the door shortly after the first knock he spoke through the chain looking for james maylor gray said like an old pal thats me im gray grantham with the washington post id like to ask you a couple of very quick questions the door was unchained and opened gray stepped inside the tworoom apartment a bicycle was parked in the center and took up most of the space whats up maylor asked he was intrigued by this and appeared eager to answer questions i understand you clerked for white and blazevich last summer thats correct for three months gray scribbled on his notepad what section were you in international mostly grunt work nothing glamorous a lot of research and rough drafting of agreements who was your supervisor no single person there were three associates who kept me busy the partner above them was stanley coopman gray pulled a photograph from his coat pocket it was garcia on the sidewalk do you recognize this face maylor held the picture and studied it he shook his head i dont think so who is he hes a lawyer i think with white and blazevich its a big firm i was stuck in the corner of one section its over four hundred lawyers you know yeah so ive heard youre sure you havent seen him positive they cover twelve floors most of which i never went on gray placed the photo in his pocket did you meet any other clerks oh sure a couple from georgetown that i already knew laura kaas and joanne ratliff two guys from george washington patrick franks and a guy named vanlandingham a girl from harvard named elizabeth larson a girl from michigan named amy macgregor and a guy from emory named moke but i think they fired him there are always a lot of clerks in the summer you plan to work there when you finish i dont know im not sure im cut out for the big firms gray smiled and stuck the notepad in his rear pocket look youve been in the firm how would i find this guy maylor pondered this for a second i assume you cant go there and start asking around good assumption and all youve got is the picture yep then i guess youre doing the right thing one of the clerks will recognize him thanks is the guy in trouble oh no he may have witnessed something its probably a long shot gray opened the door thanks again darby studied the fall listing of classes on the bulletin board across the lobby from the phones she wasnt exactly sure what shed do when the nine oclock classes were over but she was trying like hell to think of something the bulletin board was exactly like the one at tulane class listings tacked neatly in a row notices for assignments ads for books bikes rooms roommates and a hundred other necessities stuck haphazardly about announcements of parties intramural games and club meetings a young woman with a backpack and hiking books stopped nearby and looked at the board she was undoubtedly a student darby smiled at her excuse me would you happen to know laura kaas sure i need to give her a message could you point her out is she in class yeah shes in administrative law under ship room they walked and chatted in the direction of ships admin law the lobby was suddenly busy as four classrooms emptied the hiker pointed to a tall heavyset girl walking toward them darby thanked her and followed laura kaas until the crowd thinned and scattered excuse me laura are you laura kaas the big girl stopped and stared yes this was the part she didnt like the lying im sara jacobs and im working on a story for the washington post can i ask you a few questions she selected laura kaas first because she did not have a class at ten michael akers did she would try him at eleven what about itll just take a minute could we step in here darby was nodding and walking to an empty classroom laura followed slowly you clerked for white and blazevich last summer i did she spoke slowly suspiciously sara jacobs fought to control her nerves this was awful what section tax you like tax huh it was a weak effort at small talk i did now i hate it darby smiled like this was the funniest thing shed heard in years she pulled a photo from her pocket and handed it to laura kaas do you recognize this man no i think hes a lawyer with white and blazevich there are plenty of them are you certain she handed it back yep i never left the fifth floor it would take years to meet everyone and they come and go so fast you know how lawyers are laura glanced around and the conversation was over i really appreciate this darby said no problem laura said on her way out the door at exactly tenthirty they met again in room gray had caught ellen reinhart in the driveway as she was leaving for class she had worked in the litigation section under a partner by the name of daniel omalley and spent most of the summer in a class action trial in miami she was gone for two months and spent little time in the washington office white and blazevich had offices in four cities including tampa she did not recognize garcia and she was in a hurry judith wilson was not at her apartment but her roommate said she would return around one they scratched off maylor kaas and reinhart they whispered their plans and split again gray left to find edward linney who according to the list had clerked the past two summers at white and blazevich he was not in the phone book but his address was in wesley heights north of georgetowns main campus at ten fortyfive darby found herself loitering again in front of the bulletin board hoping for another miracle akers was a male and there were different ways to approach him she hoped he was where he was supposed to bein room studying criminal procedure she eased that way and waited a moment or two until the door opened and fifty law students emptied into the hall she could never be a reporter she could never walk up to strangers and start asking a bunch of questions it was awkward and uncomfortable but she walked up to a shylooking young man with sad eyes and thick glasses and said excuse me do you happen to know michael akers i think hes in this class the guy smiled it was nice to be noticed he pointed at a group of men walking toward the front entrance thats him in the gray sweater thanks she left him standing there the group disassembled as it left the building and akers and a friend were on the sidewalk mr akers she called after him they both stopped and turned around then smiled as she nervously approached them are you michael akers she asked thats me who are you my name is sara jacobs and im working on a story for the washington post can i speak to you alone sure the friend took the hint and left what about akers asked did you clerk for white and blazevich last summer yes akers was friendly and enjoying this what section real estate boring as hell but it was a job why do you want to know she handed him the photodo you recognize this man he works for white and blazevich akers wanted to recognize him he wanted to be helpful and have a long conversation with her but the face did not register kind of a suspicious picture isnt it he said i guess do you know him no ive never seen him its an awfully big firm the partners wear name badges to their meetings can you believe it the guys who own the firm dont know each other there must be a hundred partners eightyone to be exactdid you have a supervisor yeah a partner named walter welch a real snot i didnt like the firm really do you remember any other clerks sure the place was crawling with summer clerks if i needed their names could i get back with you anytime this guy in trouble i dont think so he may know something i hope they all get disbarred a bunch of thugs really its a rotten place to work everythings political thanks she smiled and turned away he admired the rear view and said call me anytime thanks darby the investigative reporter walked next door to the library building and climbed the stairs to the fifth floor where the georgetown law journal had a suite of crowded offices shed found the most recent edition of thejournal in the library and noticed that joanne ratliff was an assistant editor she suspected most law reviews and law journals were much the same the top students hung out there and prepared their scholarly articles and comments they were superior to the rest of the students and were a clannish bunch who appreciated their bril liant minds they hung out in the law journal suite it was their second home she stepped inside and asked the first person where she might find joanne ratliff he pointed around a corner second door on the right the second door opened into a cluttered workroom lined with rows of books two females were hard at work joanne ratliff darby said thats me an older woman of maybe forty responded hi my name is sara jacobs and im working on a story for the washington post can i ask you a few quick questions she slowly laid her pen on the table and frowned at the other woman whatever they were doing was terribly important and this interruption was a real pain in the ass they were significant law students darby wanted to smirk and say something smart she was number two in her class dammit so dont act so high and mighty whats the story about ratliff asked could we speak in private they frowned at each other again im very busy ratliff said so am i thought darby youre checking citations for some meaningless article and im trying to nail the man who killed two supreme court justices im sorry darby said i promise ill just take a minute they stepped into the hall im very sorry to disturb you but im in sort of a rush and youre a reporter with the post it was more of a challenge than a question and she was forced to lie some more she told herself she could lie and cheat and steal for two days then it was off to the caribbean and grantham could have it yes did you work for white and blazevich last summer i did why quickly the photo ratliff took it and analyzed it do you recognize him she shook her head slowly i dont think so who is he this bitchll make a fine lawyer so many questions if she knew who he was she wouldnt be standing in this tiny hallway acting like a reporter and putting up with this haughty legal eagle hes a lawyer with white and blazevich darby said as sincerely as possible i thought you might recognize him nope she handed the photo back enough of this well thanks again sorry to bother no problem ratliff said as she disappeared through the door she jumped into the new hertz pontiac as it stopped at the corner and they were off in traffic she had seen enough of the georgetown law school i struck out gray said linney wasnt home i talked to akers and ratliff and both said no thats five of seven who dont recognize garcia im hungry you want some lunch thats fine is it possible to have five clerks work three months in a law firm and not one of them recognize a young associate yeah its not only possible its very probable this is a long shot remember four hundred lawyers means a thousand people when you add secretaries paralegals law clerks office clerks copy room clerks mail room clerks all kinds of clerks and support people the lawyers tend to keep to themselves in their own little sections physically are the sections on separate territory yes its possible for a lawyer in banking on the third floor to go weeks without seeing an acquaintance in litigation on the tenth floor these are very busy people remember do you think weve got the wrong firm maybe the wrong firm maybe the wrong law school the first guy maylor gave me two names of george washington students who clerked there last summer lets get them after lunch he slowed and parked illegally behind a row of small buildings where are we she asked a block off mount vernon square downtown the post is six blocks that way my bank is four blocks that way and this little deli is just around the corner they walked to the deli which was filling fast with lunch traffic she waited at a table by the window as he stood in line and ordered club sandwiches half the day had flown by and though she didnt enjoy this line of work it was nice to stay busy and forget about the shadows she wouldnt be a reporter and at the moment a career in law looked doubtful not long ago shed thought of being a judge after a few years in practice forget it it was much too dangerous gray brought a tray of food and iced tea and they began eating is this a typical day for you she asked this is what i do for a living i snoop all day write the stories late in the afternoon then dig until late at night how many stories a week sometimes three or four sometimes none i pick and choose and theres little supervision this is a bit different i havent run one in ten days what if you cant link mattiece whatll you write about the story depends on how far i get we couldve run that story about verheek and callahan but why bother it was a big story but they had nothing to go with it it scratched the surface and stopped and youre going for the big bang hopefully if we can verify your little brief then well run one helluva story you can see the headlines cant you i can the adrenaline is pumping this will be the biggest story since watergate no watergate was a series of stories that started small and kept getting bigger those guys chased leads for months and kept pecking away until the pieces came together a lot of people knew different parts of the story this my dear is very different this is a much bigger story and the truth is known only by a very small group watergate was a stupid burglary and a bungled coverup these are masterfully planned crimes by very rich and smart people and the coverup that comes next after we link mattiece to the killings we run the big story the cats out of the bag and a half a dozen investigations will crank up overnight this place will be shellshocked especially at the news that the president and mattiece are old friends as the dust is settling we go after the administration and try to determine who knew what and when but first garcia ah yes i know hes out there hes a lawyer in this city and he knows something very important what if we stumble across him and he wont talk we have ways such as torture kidnapping extortion threats of all types a burly man with a contorted face was suddenly beside the table hurry up he yelledyoure talkin too much thanks pete gray said without looking up pete was lost in the crowd but could be heard yelling at another table darby dropped her sandwich he owns the place gray explained its part of the ambience how charming does it cost extra oh no the foods cheap so he depends on volume he refuses to serve coffee because he doesnt want socializing he expects us to eat like refugees and get out im finished gray looked at his watchits twelvefifteen we need to be at judith wilsons apartment at one do you want to wire the money now how long will it take we can start the wire now and pick the money up later lets go how much do you want to wire fifteen thousand judith wilson lived on the second floor of a decaying old house filled with tworoom student apartments she was not there at one and they drove around for an hour gray became a tour guide he drove slowly by the montrose theatre still boarded and burned out he showed her the daily circus at dupont circle they were parked on the street at twofifteen when a red mazda stopped in the narrow driveway there she is gray said and got out darby stayed in the car he caught judith near the front steps she was friendly enough they chatted he showed her the photo she looked at it for a few seconds and began shaking her head moments later he was in the car zero for six he said that leaves edward linney who probably is our best shot because he clerked there two summers they found a pay phone at a convenience store three blocks away and gray called linneys number no answer he slammed the phone down and got in the car he wasnt at home at ten this morning and hes not at home now could be in class darby saidwe need his schedule you shouldve picked it up with the others you didnt suggest it then whos the detective here whos the bigshot investigative reporter with the washington post im just a lowly exlaw student whos thrilled to be sitting here in the front seat watching you operate what about the backseat he almost said whatever where to back to the law school she said ill wait in the car while you march in there and get linneys class schedule yes maam a different student was behind the desk in the registrars office gray asked for the class schedule for edward linney and the student went to look for the registrar five minutes later the registrar walked slowly around the corner and glared at him he flashed the smile hi remember me gray grantham with the post i need another class schedule the dean says no i thought the dean was out of town he is the assistant dean says no no more class schedules youve already gotten me in a lot of trouble i dont understand im not asking for personal records the assistant dean says no where is the assistant dean hes busy ill wait wheres his office hell be busy for a long time ill wait for a long time she dug in and folded her arms he will not allow you to have any more class schedules our students are entitled to privacy sure they are what kind of trouble have i caused well ill just tell you please do the student clerk eased around the corner and disappeared one of the students you talked to this morning called white and blazevich and they called the assistant dean and the assistant dean called me and said no more class schedules will be given to reporters why should they care they care okay weve had a long relationship with white and blazevich they hire a lot of our students gray tried to look pitiful and helpless im just trying to find edward linney i swear hes not in trouble i just need to ask him a few questions she smelled victory she had backed down a reporter from the post and she was quite proud so offer him a crumbmr linney is no longer enrolled here thats all i can say he backed toward the door and mumbled thanks he was almost to the car when someone called his name it was the student from the registrars office mr grantham he said as he ran to him i know edward hes sort of dropped out of school for a while personal problems where is he his parents put him in a private hospital hes being detoxified where is it silver spring a place called parklane hospital how longs he been there about a month grantham shook his hand thanks i wont tell anyone you told me hes not in trouble is he no i promise they stopped at the bank and darby left with fifteen thousand in cash carrying the money scared her linney scared her white and blazevich suddenly scared her parklane was a detox center for the rich or for those with expensive insurance it was a small building surrounded by trees and sitting alone a half mile off the highway this might be difficult they decided gray entered the lobby first and asked the receptionist for edward linney he is a patient here she said rather officially he used his best smile yes i know he is a patient they told me at the law school that he was a patient what room is he in darby entered the lobby and strolled to the water fountain for a very long drink hes in room but you cant see him they told me at the law school i could see him and who might you be he was so friendly gray grantham with the washington post they told me at the law school i could ask him a couple of questions im sorry they told you that you see mr grantham we run this hospital and they run their law school darby picked up a magazine and sat on a sofa his smile faded considerably but was still there i understand that he said still courteous could i see the administrator why because this is a very important matter and i must see mr linney this afternoon if you wont allow it then i have to talk to your boss i will not leave here until i speak to the administrator she gave him her best gotohell look and backed away from the counter just a moment you may have a seat thank you she left and gray turned to darby he pointed to a set of double doors that appeared to lead to the only hallway she took a deep breath and walked quickly through them they opened into a large junction from which three sterile corridors branched out a brass plate pointed to rooms through it was the center wing of the hospital and the hall was dark and quiet with thick industrial carpet and floral wallpaper this would get her arrested she would be tackled by a large security guard or a heavy nurse and taken to a locked room where the cops would rough her up when they arrived and her sidekick out there would stand and watch helplessly as they led her away in shackles her name would be in the paper the post and stump if he was literate would see it and theyd get her as she crept along by these closed doors the beaches and pina coladas seemed unreachable the door to number was closed and had the names edward l linney and dr wayne mclatchee tacked on it she knocked the administrator was more of an ass than the receptionist but then he was paid well for it he explained they had strict policies about visitation these were very sick and delicate people his patients and they had to protect them and their doctors who were the finest in their field were very strict about who could see the patients visitation was allowed only on saturdays and sundays and even then only a carefully selected group of people usually just family and friends could sit with the patients and then only for thirty minutes they had to be very strict these were fragile people and they certainly could not withstand interrogation by a reporter regardless of how grave the circumstances mr grantham asked when mr linney might be discharged absolutely confidential the administrator exclaimed probably when the insurance expired suggested mr grantham who was talking and stalling and halfway expecting to hear loud and angry voices coming from behind the double doors this mention of insurance really agitated the administrator mr grantham asked if he the administrator would ask mr linney if he would answer two questions from mr grantham and the whole thing would take less than thirty seconds out of the question snapped the administrator they had strict policies a voice answered softly and she stepped into the room the carpet was thicker and the furniture was made from wood he sat on the bed in a pair of jeans no shirt reading a thick novel she was struck by his good looks excuse me she said warmly as she closed the door behind her come in he said with a soft smile it was the first nonmedical face hed seen in two days what a beautiful face he closed the book she walked to the end of the bed im sara jacobs and im working on a story for the washington post howd you get in he asked obviously glad she was in just walked did you clerk last summer for white and blazevich yes and the summer before they offered me a job when i graduate if i graduate she handed him the photo do you recognize this man he took it and smiledyeah his name is uh wait a minute he works in the oil and gas section on the ninth floor whats his name darby held her breath linney closed his eyes hard and tried to think he looked at the photo and said morgan i think his name is morgan yep his last name is morgan thats him i cant remember his first name its something like charles but thats not it i think it starts with a c and youre certain hes in oil and gas though she couldnt remember the exact number she was certain there was more than one morgan at white and blazevich yeah on the ninth floor yeah i worked in the bankruptcy section on the eighth floor and oil and gas covers half of eight and all of nine he handed the photo back when are you getting out she asked it would be rude to run from the room next week i hope whats this guy done nothing we just need to talk to him she was backing away from the bedi have to run thanks and good luck yeah no problem she quietly closed the door behind her and scooted toward the lobby the voice came from behind her hey you whatre you doing darby turned and faced a tall black security guard with a gun on his hip she looked completely guilty whatre you doing he demanded again as he backed her into the wall visiting my brother she said and dont yell at me again whos your brother she nodded at his door room you cant visit right now this is off limits it was important im leaving okay the door to opened and linney looked at them this your sister the guard demanded darby pleaded with her eyes yeah leave her alone linney said shes leaving she exhaled and smiled at linney mom will be up this weekend good linney said softly the guard backed off and darby almost ran to the double doors grantham was preaching to the administrator about the cost of health care she walked quickly through the doors into the lobby and was almost to the front door when the administrator spoke to her miss oh miss can i have your name darby was out the front door headed for the car grantham shrugged at the administrator and casually left the building they jumped in and sped away garcias last name is morgan linney recognized him immediately but he had trouble with the name first name starts with a c she was digging through her notes from martindalehubbell said he works in oil and gas on the ninth floor grantham was speeding away from parklane oil and gas thats what he said she found it curtis d morgan oil and gas section age twentynine theres another morgan in litigation but hes a partner and lets see hes fiftyone garcia is curtis morgan gray said with relief he looked at his watch its a quarter till four well have to hurry i cant wait rupert picked them up as they turned out of parklanes driveway the rented pontiac was flying all over the street he drove like an idiot just to keep up then radioed ahead matthew barr had never experienced a speedboat before and after five hours of a bonejarring voyage through the ocean he was soaked and in pain his body was numb and when he saw land he said a prayer the first in decades then he resumed his nonstop cursing of fletcher coal they docked at a small marina near a city that he believed to be freeport the captain had said something about freeport to the man known as larry when they left florida no other word was spoken during the ordeal larrys role in the journey was uncertain he was at least sixsix with a neck as thick as a utility pole and he did nothing but watch barr which was okay at first but after five hours became quite a nuisance they stood awkwardly when the boat stopped larry was the first one out and he motioned for barr to join him another large man was approaching on the pier and together they escorted barr to a waiting van the van was suspiciously short of windows at this point barr preferred to say goodbye to his new pals and simply disappear in the direction of freeport hed catch a plane to dc and slap coal the moment he saw his shining forehead but he had to be cool they wouldnt dare hurt him the van stopped moments later at a small airstrip and barr was escorted to a black lear he admired it briefly before following larry up the steps he was cool and relaxed just another job after all he was at one time one of the best cia agents in europe he was an exmarine he could take care of himself he sat by himself in the cabin the windows were covered and this annoyed him but he understood mr mattiece treasured his privacy and barr could certainly respect that larry and the other heavyweight were at the front of the cabin flipping through magazines and completely ignoring him thirty minutes after takeoff the lear began its descent and larry lumbered toward him put this on he demanded as he handed over a thick cloth blindfold at this point a rookie would panic an amateur would start asking questions but barr had been blindfolded before and while he was having serious doubts about this mission he calmly took the blindfold and covered his eyes the man who removed the blindfold introduced himself as emil an assistant to mr mattiece he was a small wiry type with dark hair and a thin mustache winding around the lip he sat in a chair four feet away and lit a cigarette our people tell us you are legitimate sort of he said with a friendly smile barr looked around the room there were no walls only windows in small panes the sun was bright and pierced his eyes a plush garden surrounded a series of fountains and pools outside the room they were in the rear of a very large house im here on behalf of the president barr said we believe you emil nodded he was undoubtedly a cajun may i ask who you are barr said im emil and thats enough mr mattiece is not feeling well perhaps you should leave your message with me i have orders to speak directly to him orders from mr coal i believe emil never stopped smiling thats correct i see mr mattiece prefers not to meet you he wants you to talk to me barr shook his head now if push came to shove if things got out of hand then he would gladly talk to emil if it was necessary but for now he would hold firm i am not authorized to talk to anyone but mr mattiece barr said properly the smile almost disappeared emil pointed beyond the pools and fountains to a large gazeboshaped building with tall windows from floor to ceiling rows of perfectly manicured shrubs and flowers surrounded itmr mattiece is in his gazebo follow me they left the sun room and walked slowly around a wading pool barr had a thick knot in his stomach but he followed his little friend as if this was simply another day at the office the sound of falling water echoed through the garden a narrow boardwalk led to the gazebo they stopped at the door im afraid you must remove your shoes emil said with a smile emil was barefoot barr untied his shoes and placed them next to the door do not step on the towels emil said gravely the towels emil opened the door for barr who stepped in alone the room was perfectly round about fifty feet in diameter there were three chairs and a sofa all covered with white sheets thick cotton towels were on the floor in perfect little trails around the room the sun shone brightly through skylights a door opened and victor mattiece emerged from a small room barr froze and gawked at the man he was thin and gaunt with long gray hair and a dirty beard he wore only a pair of white gym shorts and walked carefully on the towels without looking at barr sit over there he said pointing at a chair dont step on the towels barr avoided the towels and took his seat mattiece turned hisback and faced the windows his skin was leathery and dark bronze his bare feet were lined with ugly veins his toenails were long and yellow he was crazy as hell what do you want he asked quietly to the windows the president sent me he did not fletcher coal sent you i doubt if the president knows youre here maybe he wasnt crazy he spoke without moving a muscle in his body fletcher coal is the presidents chief of staff he sent me i know about coal and i know about you and i know about your little unit now what do you want information dont play games with me what do you want have you read the pelican brief barr asked the frail body did not flinch have you read it yes barr answered quickly do you believe it to be true perhaps thats why im here why is mr coal so concerned about the pelican brief because a couple of reporters have wind of it and if its true then we need to know immediately who are these reporters gray grantham with the washington post he picked it up first and he knows more than anyone hes digging hard coal thinks hes about to run something we can take care of him cant we mattiece said to the windows whos the other one rifkin with the times mattiece still had not moved an inch barr glanced around at the sheets and towels yes he had to be crazy the place was sanitized and smelled of rubbing alcohol maybe he was ill does mr coal believe it to be true i dont know hes very concerned about it thats why im here mr mattiece we have to know what if its true then we have problems mattiece finally moved he shifted his weight to the right leg and folded his arms across his narrow chest but his eyes never moved sand dunes and sea oats were in the distance but not the ocean do you know what i think he said quietly what i think coal is the problem he gave the brief to too many people he handed it to the cia he allowed you to see it this really disturbs me barr could think of no response it was ludicrous to imply that coal wanted to distribute the brief the problem is you mattiece you killed the justices you panicked and killed callahan youre the greedy bastard who was not content with a mere fifty million mattiece turned slowly and looked at barr the eyes were dark and red he looked nothing like the photo with the vice president but that was seven years ago hed aged twenty years in the last seven and perhaps gone off the deep end along the way you clowns in washington are to blame for this he said somewhat louder barr could not look at him is it true mr mattiece thats all i want to know behind barr a door opened without a sound larry in his socks and avoiding the towels eased forward two steps and stopped mattiece walked on the towels to a glass door and opened it he looked outside and spoke softly of course its true he walked through the door and closed it slowly behind him barr watched as the idiot shuffled along a sidewalk toward the sand dunes what now he thought perhaps emil would come get him perhaps larry inched forward with a rope and barr did not hear or feel anything until it was too late mattiece did not want blood in his gazebo so larry simply broke the neck and choked him until it was over he game plan called for her to be on this elevator at this point in the search but she thought enough unexpected events had occurred to warrant a change in the game plan he thought not they had engaged in a healthy debate over this elevator ride and here she was he was right this was the quickest route to curtis morgan and she was right it was a dangerous route to curtis morgan but the other routes could be just as dangerous the entire game plan was deadly she wore her only dress and her only pair of heels gray said she looked really nice but that was to be expected the elevator stopped on the ninth floor and when she walked off it there was a pain in her stomach and she could barely breathe the receptionist was across a plush lobby the name white and blazevich covered the wall behind her in thick brass lettering her knees were weak but she made it to the receptionist who smiled properly it was ten minutes before five may i help you she asked the nameplate proclaimed her to be peggy young yes darby managed clearing her throat i have a five oclock appointment with curtis morgan my name is dorothy blythe the receptionist was stunned her mouth fell open and she stared blankly at darby now dorothy she couldnt speak darbys heart stoppedis something the matter well no im sorry just a moment peggy young stood quickly and disappeared in a rush run her heart pounded like a drum run she tried to control her breathing but she was battling hyperventilation her legs were rubbery run she looked around trying to be nonchalant as if she was just another client waiting on her lawyer surely they wouldnt gun her down here in the lobby of a law office he came first followed by the receptionist he was about fifty with bushy gray hair and a terrible scowl hi he said but only because he had to im jarreld schwabe a partner here you say you have an appointment with curtis morgan keep it up yes at five is there a problem and your name is dorothy blythe yeah but you can call me dot thats what i said yes whats the matter she sounded genuinely irritated he was inching closer when did you make the appointment i dont know about two weeks ago i met curtis at a party in georgetown he told me he was an oil and gas lawyer and i happen to need one i called the office here and made an appointment now will you please tell me whats going on she was amazed at how well these words were coming from her dry mouth why do you need an oil and gas lawyer i dont think i have to explain myself to you she said real bitchylike the elevator opened and a man in a cheap suit approached quickly to join the conversation darby scowled at him her legs would give way just any second schwabe was really bearing down we dont have any record of such an appointment then fire the appointment secretary do you welcome all new clients this way oh she was indignant but schwabe did not let up you cant see curtis morgan he said and why not she demanded hes dead the knees were jelly and about to go a sharp pain rippled through the stomach but she thought quickly it was okay to looked shocked he was after all supposed to be her new lawyer im sorry why didnt anyone call me schwabe was still suspicious as i said we have no record of a dorothy blythe what happened to him she asked stunned he was mugged a week ago shot by street punks we believe the guy in the cheap suit took a step closer do you have any identification who in the hell are you she snapped loudly hes security said schwabe security for what she demanded even louder is this a law firm or a prison the partner looked at the man in the cheap suit and it was obvious neither knew exactly what to do at this point she was very attractive and they had upset her and her story was somewhat believable they relaxed a little why dont you leave ms blythe schwabe said i cant wait the security man reached to assist her here he said she slapped his hand touch me and ill sue your ass first thing tomorrow morning get away from me this shook them a bit she was mad and lashing out perhaps they were being a bit hard ill see you down the security man said i know how to leave im amazed you clowns have any clients she was stepping backward her face was red but not from anger it was fear ive got lawyers in four states and ive never been treated like this she yelled at them she was in the center of the lobby i paid a half a million last year in legal fees and ive got a million to pay next year but you idiots wont get any of it the closer she got to the elevator the louder she yelled she was a crazy woman they watched her until the elevator door opened and she was gone gray paced along the end of the bed holding the phone and waiting for smith keen darby was stretched out on the bed with her eyes closed gray stopped hello smith i need you to check something quick where are you keen asked a hotel look back six or seven days i need the obituary for curtis d morgan whos he garcia garcia what happened to garcia he died obviously shot by muggers i remember that we ran a story last week about a young lawyer who was robbed and shot probably him can you check it for me i need his wifes name and address if we have it howd you find him its a long story well try to talk to his widow tonight garcias dead this is weird baby its more than weird the kid knew something and they knocked him off do you think youre safe who knows wheres the girl shes with me what if theyre watching his house gray hadnt thought about it well have to take that chance ill call you back in fifteen minutes he placed the phone on the floor and sat in an antique rocker there was a warm beer on the table and he took a long drink he watched her a forearm covered both eyes she was in jeans and a sweatshirt the dress was thrown in a corner the heels had been kicked across the room you okay he asked softly wonderful she was a real smartass and he liked that in a woman of course she was almost a lawyer and they must teach smartassness in law school he sipped the beer and admired the jeans he enjoyed this brief moment of uninterrupted staring without getting caught are you staring at me she asked yes sex is the last thing on my mind then whyd you mention it because i can feel you lusting after my red toenails true ive got a headache a real genuine pounding headache youve worked for it can i get you something yes a oneway ticket to jamaica you can leave tonight ill take you to the airport right now she removed the forearm from her eyes and gently massaged both temples im sorry i cried he finished the beer with a long drink you earned the right she was in tears when she stepped off the elevator he was waiting like an expectant father except he had a in his coat pocketa she knew nothing about so what do you think of investigative reporting he asked id rather butcher hogs well in all honesty not every day is this eventful some days i simply sit at my desk and make hundreds of phone calls to bureaucrats who have no comment sounds great lets do that tomorrow he kicked his shoes off and placed his feet on the bed she closed her eyes and breathed deeply minutes passed without a word do you know that louisiana is known as the pelican state she asked with her eyes closed no i didnt know that its a shame really because the brown pelicans were virtually wiped out the the early s what happened to them pesticides they eat nothing but fish and the fish live in river water filled with chlorinated hydrocarbons from pesticides the rains wash the pesticides from the soil into small streams which eventually empty into rivers which eventually empty into the mississippi by the time the pelicans in louisiana eat the fish they are loaded with ddt and other chemicals which accumulate in the fatty tissues of the birds death is seldom immediate but in times of stress such as hunger or bad weather the pelicans and eagles and cormorants are forced to draw upon their reserves and can literally be poisoned by their own fat if they dont die they are usually unable to reproduce their eggs are so thin and fragile they crack during incubation did you know that why would i know that in the late sixties louisiana began transplanting brown pelicans from southern florida and over the years the population has slowly increased but the birds are still very much in danger forty years ago there were thousands of them the cypress swamp that mattiece wants to destroy is home to only a few dozen pelicans gray pondered these things she was silent for a long time what day is it she asked without opening her eyes monday i left new orleans a week ago today thomas and verheek had dinner two weeks ago today that of course was the fateful moment when the pelican brief changed hands three weeks ago tomorrow rosenberg and jensen were murdered i was an innocent little law student minding my own business and having a wonderful love affair with my professor i guess those days are gone law school and the professor might be gone he thought whatre your plans i have none im just trying to get out of this damned mess and stay alive ill run off somewhere and hide for a few months maybe a few years ive got enough money to live for a long time if and when i reach the point when im not looking over my shoulder i might come back to law school i dont think so the law has lost its allure whyd you want to be a lawyer idealism and money i thought i could change the world and get paid for it but there are so damned many lawyers already why do all these bright students keep flocking to law school simple its greed they want bmws and gold credit cards if you go to a good law school finish in the top ten percent and get a job with a big firm youll be earning six figures in a few short years and it only goes up its guaranteed at the age of thirtyfive youll be a partner raking in at least two hundred thousand a year some earn much more what about the other ninety percent its not such a good deal for them they get the leftovers most lawyers i know hate it theyd rather be doing something else but they cant leave it because of the money even a lousy lawyer in a small office can earn a hundred thousand a year after ten years of practice and he may hate it but where can he go and match the money i detest lawyers and i guess you think reporters are adored good point gray looked at his watch then picked up the phone he dialed keens number keen read him the obit and the post story about the senseless street killing of this young lawyer gray took notes a couple of other things keen said feldman is very concerned about your safety he expected a briefing in his office today and he was pissed when he didnt get one make sure you report to him before noon tomorrow understand ill try do more than try gray were very nervous over here the times is sucking wind isnt it im not worried about the times right now im much more concerned about you and the girl were fine everythings lovely what else have you got you have three messages in the past two hours from a man named cleve says hes a cop do you know him yes well he wants to talk tonight says its urgent ill call him later okay you guys be careful well be here till late so check in gray hung up and looked at his notes it was almost seven im going to see mrs morgan i want you to stay here she sat between the pillows and crossed her arms on her knees id rather go what if theyre watching the house he asked why would they watch the house hes dead maybe theyre suspicious now because a mysterious client appeared today looking for him even though hes dead hes attracting attention she thought about this for a minute no im going its too risky darby dont talk to me about risks ive survived in the minefields for twelve days this is easy he waited on her by the door by the way where am i staying tonight jefferson hotel do you have the phone number what do you think dumb question the private jet with edwin sneller aboard landed at national in washington a few minutes after seven he was delighted to leave new york hed spent six days there bouncing off the walls in his suite at the plaza for almost a week his men had checked hotels and watched airports and walked streets and they knew damned well they were wasting their time but orders were orders they were told to stay there until something broke and they could move on it was silly trying to find the girl in manhattan but they had to stay close in case she made a mistake like a phone call or a plastic transaction that could be traced and suddenly they were needed she made no mistakes until twothirty this afternoon when she needed money and went to the account they knew this would happen especially if she planned to leave the country and was afraid to use plastic at some point she would need cash and shed have to wire it since the bank was in new orleans and she wasnt snellers client owned eight percent of the bank not a lot but a nice little twelvemilliondollar holding that could make things happen a few minutes after three hed received a call from freeport they did not suspect her to be in washington she was a smart girl who was running away from trouble not to it and they certainly didnt expect her to link up with the reporter they had no idea but now it seemed so logical and it was worse than critical fifteen thousand went from her account to his and suddenly sneller was back in business he had two men with him another private jet was en route from miami he had asked for a dozen men immediately it would be a quick job or no job at all there was not a second to spare sneller was not hopeful with khamel on the team everything seemed possible he had killed rosenberg and jensen so cleanly then disappeared without a trace now he was dead shot in the head because of one little innocent female law student the morgan house was in a neat suburb in alexandria the neighborhood was young and affluent with bikes and tricycles in every yard three cars were parked in the drive one had ohio plates gray rang the doorbell and watched the street nothing suspicious an older man opened the door slightly yes he said softly im gray grantham with the washington post and this is my assistant sara jacobs darby forced a smilewe would like to speak with mrs morgan i dont think so please its very important he looked at them carefully wait a minute he closed the door and disappeared the house had a narrow wooden porch with a small veranda over it they were in the darkness and could not be seen from the street a car passed slowly he opened the door again im tom kupcheck her father and she doesnt want to talk gray nodded as if this was understandable we wont be five minutes i promise he walked onto the porch and closed the door behind him i guess youre hard of hearing i said she doesnt want to talk i heard you mr kupcheck and i respect her privacy and i know what shes been through since when do you guys respect anyones privacy evidently mr kupcheck had a short fuse it was about to blow gray kept calm darby backed away shed been involved in enough altercations for one day her husband called me three times before he died i talked to him on the phone and i dont believe his death was a random killing by street punks hes dead my daughter is upset she doesnt want to talk now get the hell out of here mr kupcheck darby said warmly we have reason to believe your soninlaw was a witness to some highly organized criminal activity this calmed him a bit and he glared at darby is that so well you cant ask him about it can you my daughter knows nothing shes had a bad day and shes on medication now leave can we see her tomorrow darby asked i doubt it call first gray handed him a business card if she wants to talk use the number on the back im staying at a hotel ill call around noon tomorrow you do that for now just leave youve already upset her were sorry gray said as they walked off the porch mr kupcheck opened the door but watched them as they left gray stopped and turned to him has any other reporter called or stopped by a bunch of them called the day after he was killed they wanted all sorts of stuff rude people but none in the past few days no now leave any from the new york times no he stepped inside and slammed the door they hurried to the car parked four doors down there was no traffic on the street gray zigzagged through the short suburban streets and crisscrossed his way out of the neighborhood he watched the mirror until he was convinced they were not being followed end of garcia darby said as they entered and headed for the city not yet well make one final dying gasp tomorrow and maybe shell talk to us if she knew something her father would know and if her father knew why wouldnt he cooperate theres nothing there gray this made perfect sense they rode in silence for a few minutes fatigue was setting in we can be at the airport in fifteen minutes he saidill drop you off and you can be out of here in thirty minutes take a plane anywhere just vanish ill leave tomorrow i need some rest and i want to think about where to go thanks do you feel safe at this moment yes but its subject to change in seconds ill be glad to sleep in your room tonight just like in new york you didnt sleep in my room in new york you slept on a sofa in the sitting room she was smiling and this was a good sign he was smiling too okay ill sleep in the sitting room tonight i dont have a sitting room well well then where can i sleep suddenly she was not smiling she bit her lip and her eyes watered he had pushed too far it was callahan again im just not ready she said when might you be ready gray please just leave it alone she watched the traffic ahead and said nothing im sorry he said slowly she lay down in the seat and placed her head in his lap he gently rubbed her shoulder and she clutched his hand im scared to death she said quietly he had left her room around ten after a bottle of wine and egg rolls he had called mason paypur the night police reporter for the post and asked him to check with his sources about the morgan street killing it had happened downtown in an area not noted for killings just a few muggings and beatings he was tired and discouraged and he was unhappy because she would leave tomorrow the post owed him six weeks of vacation and he was tempted to leave with her mattiece could have his oil but he was afraid hed never come back which wouldnt be the end of his world except for the troublesome fact that she had money and he didnt they could skip along the beaches and frolic in the sun for about two months on his money then it would be up to her and more importantly she hadnt invited him to join in her getaway she was grieving when she mentioned thomas callahan he could feel the pain he was now at the jefferson hotel on sixteenth pursuant of course to her instructions he called cleve at home where are you cleve asked irritated a hotel its a long story whats up they put sarge on medical leave for ninety days whats wrong with him nothing he says they want him out of the place for a while its like a bunker over there everybodys been told to shut up and speak to no one theyre scared to death they made sarge leave at noon today he thinks you could be in serious danger hes heard your name a thousand times in the past week theyre obsessed with you and how much you know whos they coal of course and his aide birchfield they run the west wing like the gestapo sometimes they include whats his name the little squirrel with the bow tie domestic affairs emmitt waycross thats him its mainly coal and birchfield making the threats and plotting strategy what kind of threats no one in the white house except for the president can talk to the press on the record or off without coals approval this includes the press secretary coal clears everything thats incredible theyre terrified and sarge thinks theyre dangerous okay im hiding i stopped by your apartment late last night i wish youd tell me when you disappear ill check in tomorrow night whatre you driving a rented pontiac with four doors very sporty i checked the volvo this afternoon its fine thanks cleve you okay i think so tell sarge im fine call me tomorrow im worried he slept four hours and was awake when

very timid female yes who is this beverly morgan you stopped by last night gray was on his feet listening hard wide awake yes im sorry if we upset you no my father is very protective and angry the reporters were awful after curtis was killed they called from everywhere they wanted old pictures of him and new photos of me and the child they called at all hours it was terrible and my father got tired of it he pushed two of them off the porch i guess we were lucky i hope he didnt offend you the voice was hollow and detached yet trying to be strong not at all hes asleep now downstairs on the sofa so we can talk why arent you asleep he asked im taking some pills to make me sleep and im all out of sync ive been sleeping days and rambling nights it was obvious she was awake and wanted to talk gray sat on the bed and tried to relax i cant imagine the shock of something like this it takes several days for it to become real at first the pain is horrible just horrible i couldnt move my body without hurting i couldnt think because of the shock and disbelief i went through the motions to get through the funeral which now seems like a bad dream is this boring not at all ive got to get off these pills i sleep so much i dont get to talk to adults plus my father tends to run people off are you taping this no im just listening he was killed a week ago tonight i thought he was working very late which was not unusual they shot him and took his wallet so the cops couldnt identify him i saw on the late news where a young lawyer had been murdered downtown and i knew it was curtis dont ask me how they knew he was a lawyer without knowing his name its strange all the little weird things that go with a murder why was he working late he worked eighty hours a week sometimes more white and blazevich is a sweatshop they try to kill the associates for seven years and if they cant kill them they make them partners curtis hated the place he was tired of being a lawyer how long was he there five years he was making ninety thousand a year so he put up with the hassle did you know he called me no my father told me you said that and ive thought about it all night what did he say he never identified himself he used the code name of garcia dont ask how i learned his identityitll take hours he said he possibly knew something about the assassinations of justices rosenberg and jensen and he wanted to tell me what he knew randy garcia was his best friend in elementary school i got the impression he had seen something at the office and perhaps someone at the office knew he had seen it he was very nervous and always called from pay phones he thought he was being followed we had planned to meet early saturday before last but he called that morning and said no he was scared and said he had to protect his family did you know any of this no i knew he was under a great deal of stress but hed been that way for five years he never brought the office home with him he hated the place really whyd he hate the place he worked for a bunch of cutthroats a bunch of thugs whod watch you bleed for a buck they spend tons of money on this marvelous facade of respectability but they are scum curtis was a top student and had his pick of jobs they were such a great bunch of guys when they recruited him and complete monsters to work with very unethical why did he stay with the firm the money kept getting better he almost left a year ago but the job offer fell through he was very unhappy but he tried to keep it to himself i think he felt guilty for making such a big mistake we had a little routine around here when he came home i would ask him how his day went sometimes this was at ten at night so i knew it was a bad day but he always said the day had been profitable that was the word profitable and then we talked about our baby he didnt want to talk about the office and i didnt want to hear it well so much for garcia hes dead and he told his wife nothingwho cleaned out his desk someone at the office they brought his stuff friday all neatly packaged and taped in three cardboard boxes youre welcome to go through it no thanks im sure its been sanitized how much life insurance did he have she paused for a second youre a smart man mr grantham two weeks ago he bought a milliondollar term policy with double indemnity for accidental death thats two million dollars yes sir i guess youre right i guess he was suspicious i dont think he was killed by muggers mrs morgan i cant believe this she choked a little but fought it off have the cops asked you a lot of questions no its just another dc mugging that went one step further no big deal happens every day the insurance bit was interesting but useless gray was getting tired of mrs morgan and her unhurried monotone he was sorry for her but if she knew nothing it was time to say goodbye what do you think he knew she asked this could take hours i dont know gray answered glancing at his watch he said he knew something about the killings but thats as far as he would go i was convinced we would meet somewhere and he would spill his guts and show me something i was wrong how would he know anything about those dead judges i dont know he just called me out of the blue if he had something to show you what would it be she asked he was the reporter he was supposed to ask the questionsi have no idea he never hinted where would he hide such a thing the question was sin cere but irritating then it hit him she was going somewhere with this i dont know where did he keep his valuable papers we have a lockbox at the bank for deeds and wills and stuff ive always known about the lockbox he handled all the legal business mr grantham i looked at the lockbox last thursday with my father and there was nothing unusual in it you didnt expect anything unusual did you no then saturday morning early it was still dark i was going through his papers in his desk in the bedroom we have this antique rolltop desk that he used for his personal correspondence and papers and i found something a bit unusual gray was on his feet holding the phone and staring wildly at the floor she had called at four in the morning she had chitchatted for twenty minutes and she waited until he was ready to hang up to drop the bomb what is it he asked as coolly as possible its a key he had a lump in his throat a key to what another lockbox which bank first columbia weve never banked there i see and you knew nothing about this other lockbox oh no not until saturday morning i was puzzled by it still am but i found all of our legal papers in the old lockbox so i had no reason to check this one i figured id run by when i felt like it would you like me to check it for you i thought you would say that what if you find what youre looking for i dont know what im looking for but what if i find something he left behind and this something proves to be very lets say newsworthy use it no conditions one if it disparages my husband in any way you cant use it its a deal i swear when do you want the key do you have it in your hand yes if youll stand on the front porch ill be there in about three seconds the private jet from miami had brought only five men so edwin sneller had only seven to plan with seven men no time and precious little equipment he had not slept monday night his hotel suite was a minicommand center as they stared at maps through the night and tried to plan the next twentyfour hours a few things were certain grantham had an apartment but he was not there he had a car he was not using he worked at the post and it was on fifteenth street white and blazevich was in a building on tenth near new york but she would not return there morgans widow lived in alexandria beyond that they were searching for two people out of three million these were not the type of men you could rustle out of the bunkhouse and send in to fight they had to be found and hired and hed been promised as many as possible by the end of the day sneller was no novice at the killing game and this was hopeless this was desperation the sky was falling he would do his best under the circumstances but edwin sneller had one foot out the back door she was on his mind she had met khamel on his terms and walked away from it she had dodged bullets and bombs and evaded the best in the business he would love to see her not to kill her but to congratulate her a rookie running loose and living to tell about it they would concentrate on the post building it was the one spot he had to come back to the downtown traffic was bumper to bumper and that suited darby just fine she was in no hurry the bank lobby opened at ninethirty and some time around seven over coffee and untouched bagels in her room he had convinced her that she should be the one to visit the vault she was not really convinced but a woman should do it and there werent many available beverly morgan told gray that her bank first hamilton froze their box as soon as they learned of curtiss death and that she was allowed only to view the contents and make an inventory she was also allowed to copy the will but the original was placed back in the box and secured in the vault the box would be released only after the tax auditors finished their work so the immediate question was whether or not first columbia knew he was dead the morgans had never banked there beverly had no idea why he chose it it was a huge bank with a million customers and they decided that the odds were against it darby was tired of playing the odds shed blown a wonderful opportunity last night to get on a plane and now here she was about to be beverly morgan matching wits with first columbia so she could steal from a dead man and what was her sidekick going to do he was going to protect her he had this gun which scared her to death and had the same effect on him though he wouldnt admit it and he planned to play bodyguard by the front door while she pilfered the lockbox what if they know hes dead she asked and i tell them he isnt then slap the bitch in the face and run like hell ill catch you at the front door ive got a gun and well blast our way down the sidewalk come on gray i dont know if i can do this you can do it okay play it cool be assertive be a smartass it should come natural thanks so much what if they call security on me i have this sudden phobia of security guards ill rescue you ill come blazing through the lobby like a swat team well all be killed relax darby itll work why are you so chipper i smell it somethings in that lockbox darby and you have to bring it out kid its all riding on you thanks for easing the pressure they were on e street near ninth gray slowed the car then parked illegally in a loading zone forty feet from the front entrance of first columbia he jumped out darbys exit was slower together they walked quickly to the door it was almost ten ill wait here he said pointing to a marble column go do it go do it she mumbled as she disappeared inside the revolving door she was always the one being fed to the lions the lobby was as big as a football field with columns and chandeliers and fake persian rugs safe deposit boxes she asked a young woman behind the information desk the girl pointed to a corner in the far right thanks she said and strolled toward it the lines in front of the tellers were four deep to her left and to her right a hundred busy vice presidents talked on their phones it was the largest bank in the city and no one noticed her the vault was behind a set of massive bronze doors that were polished enough to appear almost golden no doubt to give the appearance of infinite safety and invulnerability the doors were opened slightly to allow a select few in and out to the left an importantlooking lady of sixty sat behind a desk with the words safe depost boxes across its front her name was virginia baskin virginia baskin stared at darby as she approached the desk there was no smile i need access to a box darby said without breathing she hadnt breathed in the last two and a half minutes the number please ms baskin said as she hit the keyboard and turned to the monitor f she punched the number and waited for the words to flash on the screen she frowned and moved her face to within inches of it run darby thought she frowned harder and scratched her chin run before she picks up the phone and calls the guards run before the alarms go off and my idiot cohort comes blazing through the lobby ms baskin withdrew her head from the monitor that was rented just two weeks ago she said almost to herself yes darby said as if she had rented it i assume youre mrs morgan she said pecking on the keyboard keep assuming baby yes beverly anne morgan and your address pembroke alexandria she nodded at the screen as if it could see her and give its approval she pecked again phone number ms baskin liked this too so did the computer who rented this box my husband curtis d morgan and his social security number darby casually opened her new rather large leather shoulder bag and pulled out her wallet how many wives memorized their husbands social security number she opened the wallet very well ms baskin said properly as she left the keyboard and reached into her desk how long will this take just a minute she placed a wide card on a small clipboard on the desk and pointed at it sign here mrs morgan darby nervously signed on the second slot mr morgan had made the first entry the day he rented the box ms baskin glanced at the signature while darby held her breath do you have your key she asked of course darby said with a warm smile ms baskin took a small box from the drawer and walked around the desk follow me they went through the bronze doors the vault was as big as a branch bank in the suburbs designed along the lines of a mausoleum it was a maze of hallways and small chambers two men in uniform walked by they passed four identical rooms with walls lined with rows of lockboxes the fifth room held f evidently because ms baskin stepped into it and opened her little black box darby looked nervously around and behind her virginia was all business she walked to f which was shoulderhigh and stuck in the key she rolled her eyes at darby as if to say your turn dumbass darby yanked the key from a pocket and inserted it next to the other one virginia then turned both keys and slid the box two inches from its slot she removed the banks key she pointed to a small booth with a folding wooden door take it in there when you finish lock it back in place and come to my desk she was leaving the room as she spoke thanks darby said she waited until virginia was out of sight then slid the box from the wall it was not heavy the front was six inches by twelve and it was a foot and a half long the top was open and inside were two items a thin brown legalsized envelope and an unmarked videotape she didnt need the booth she stuffed the envelope and videotape in her shoulder bag and slid the box back into its slot she left the room virginia had rounded the corner of her desk when darby walked behind her im finished she said my that was quick damned right things happen fast when your nerves are popping through your skin i found what i needed she said very well ms baskin was suddenly a warm personyou know that awful story in the paper last week about that lawyer you know the one killed by muggers not far from here wasnt his name curtis morgan seems like it was curtis morgan what a shame oh you dumb woman i didnt see that darby said ive been out of the country thanks her step was a bit quicker the second time through the lobby the bank was crowded and there were no security guards in sight piece of cake it was about time she pulled a job without being grabbed the gunman was guarding the marble column the revolving door spun her onto the sidewalk and she was almost to the car before he caught her get in the car she demanded whatd you find he demanded just get outta here she yanked the door open and jumped in he started the car and sped away talk to me he said i cleaned out the box she said is anyone behind us he glanced in the mirror how the hell do i know what is it she opened her purse and pulled out the envelope she opened it gray slammed on the brakes and almost smashed a car in front watch where youre going she yelled okay okay whats in the envelope i dont know i havent read it yet and if you get me killed ill never read it the car was moving again gray breathed deeply look lets stop yelling okay lets be cool yes you drive and ill be cool okay now are we cool yes just relax and watch where youre going where are you going i dont know whats in the envelope she pulled out a document of some sort she glanced at him and he was staring at the document watch where were going just read the damned thing it makes me carsick i cant read in the car dammit dammit dammit youre yelling again he yanked the wheel to the right and pulled into another towaway zone on e street horns honked as he slammed his brakes he glared at her thanks she said and started reading it aloud it was a fourpage affidavit typed real neat and sworn to under oath before a notary public it was dated friday the day before the last phone call to grantham under oath curtis morgan said he worked in the oil and gas section of white and blazevich and had since he joined the firm five years earlier his clients were privately owned oil exploration firms from many countries but primarily americans since he joined the firm he had worked for a client who was engaged in a huge lawsuit in south louisiana the client was a man named victor mattiece and mr mattiece whom hed never met but was well known to the senior partners of white and blazevich wanted desperately to win the lawsuit and eventually harvest millions of barrels of oil from the swamplands of terrebonne parish louisiana there were also hundreds of millions of cubic yards of natural gas the partner supervising the case for white and blazevich was f sims wakefield who was very close to victor mattiece and often visited him in the bahamas they sat in the towaway zone with the bumper of the pontiac protruding perilously into the right lane and were oblivious to the cars swerving around it she read slowly and he sat with his eyes closed continuing the lawsuit was very important to white and blazevich the firm was not directly involved in the trial and appeal but everything crossed wakefields desk he worked on nothing but the pelican case as it was known he spent most of his time on the phone with either mattiece or one of a hundred lawyers working on the case morgan averaged ten hours a week on the case but always on the periphery his billings were handed directly to wakefield and this was unusual because all other billings went to the oil and gas billing clerk who turned them in to accounting hed heard rumors over the years and firmly believed mattiece was not paying white and blazevich its standard hourly rate he believed the firm had taken the case for a percentage of the harvest hed heard the figure of ten percent of the net profits from the wells this was unheard of in the industry brakes squealed loudly and they braced for the impact it barely missed were about to be killed darby snapped gray yanked the gearshift into drive and pulled the right front wheel over the curb and onto the sidewalk now they were out of traffic the car was angled across a forbidden space with its front bumper on the sidewalk and its rear bumper barely out of traffic keep reading he snapped back continuing on or about september morgan was in wakefields office he walked in with two files and a stack of documents unrelated to the pelican case wakefield was on the phone as usual secretaries were in and out the office was always in a state of disruption he stood around for a few minutes waiting for wakefield to get off the phone but the conversation dragged on finally after waiting fifteen minutes morgan picked up his files and documents from wakefields cluttered desk and left he went to his office at the other end of the building and started working at his desk it was about two in the afternoon as he reached for a file he found a handwritten memo on the bottom of the stack of documents he had just brought to his office he had inadvertently taken it from wakefields desk he immediately stood with the intention of returning to wakefield then he read it and he read it again he glanced at the telephone wakefields line was still busy a copy of the memo was attached to the affidavit read the memo gray snapped im not through with the affidavit she snapped back it would do no good to argue with her she was the legal mind and this was a legal document and she would read it exactly as she pleased continuing he was stunned by the memo and he was immediately terrified of it he walked out of his office and down the hall to the nearest xerox and copied it he returned to his office and placed the original memo in the same position under the files on his desk he would swear hed never seen it the memo was two paragraphs handwritten on white and blazevich internal stationery it was from m velmano who is marty velmano a senior partner it was dated september directed to wakefield and read sims advise client research is completeand the bench will sit much softer if rosenberg is retired the second retirement is a bit unusual einstein found a link to jensen of all people the boy of course has those other problems advise further that the pelican should arrive here in four years assuming other factors there was no signature gray was chuckling and frowning at the same time his mouth was open she was reading faster continuing marty velmano was a ruthless shark who worked eighteen hours a day and felt useless unless someone near him was bleeding he was the heart and soul of white and blazevich to the power people of washington he was a tough operator with plenty of money he lunched with congressmen and played golf with cabinet members he did his throat cutting behind his office door einstein was the nickname for nathaniel jones a demented legal genius the firm kept locked away in his own little library on the sixth floor he read every case decided by the supreme court the eleven federal appellate courts and the supreme courts of the fifty states morgan had never met einstein sightings were rare around the firm after he copied it he folded his copy of the memo and placed it in a desk drawer ten minutes later wakefield stormed into his office very disturbed and pale they scratched around morgans desk and found the memo wakefield was angry as hell which was not unusual he asked if morgan had read this no he insisted evidently he mistakenly picked it up when he left his office he explained whats the big deal wakefield was furious he lectured morgan about the sanctity of ones desk he was a blithering idiot rebuking and expounding around morgans office he finally realized he was overreacting he tried to settle down but the impression had been made he left with the memo morgan hid the copy in a law book in the library on the ninth floor he was shocked at wakefields paranoia and hysterics before he left that afternoon he precisely arranged the articles and papers in his desk and on his shelves the next morning he checked them someone had gone through his desk during the night morgan became very careful two days later he found a tiny screwdriver behind a book on his credenza then he found a small piece of black tape wadded up and dropped in his trash can he assumed his office was wired and his phones were bugged he caught suspicious looks from wakefield he saw velmano in wakefields office more than usual then justices rosenberg and jensen were killed there was no doubt in his mind it was the work of mattiece and his associates the memo did not mention mattiece but it referred to a client wakefield had no other clients and no one client had as much to gain from a new court as mattiece the last paragraph of the affidavit was frightening on two occasions after the assassinations morgan knew he was being followed he was taken off the pelican case he was given more work more hours more demands he was afraid of being killed if they would kill two justices they would kill a lowly associate he signed it under oath before emily stanford a notary public her address was typed under her name sit tight ill be right back gray said as he opened his door and jumped out he dodged cars and dashed across e street there was a pay phone outside a bakery he punched smith keens number and looked at his rented car parked haphazardly across the street smith its gray listen carefully and do as i say ive got another source on the pelican brief its big smith and i need you and krauthammer in feldmans office in fifteen minutes what is it garcia left a farewell message we have one more stop and were coming in we the girls coming in yes get a tv with a vcr in the conference room i think garcia wants to talk to us he left a tape yes fifteen minutes are you safe i think so im just nervous as hell smith he hung up and ran back to the car ms stanford owned a court reporting service on vermont she was dusting the bookshelves when gray and darby walked in they were in a hurry are you emily stanford he asked yes why he showed her the last page of the affidavit did you notarize this who are you gray grantham with the washington post is this your signature yes i notarized it darby handed her the photograph of garcia now morgan on the sidewalk is this the man who signed the affidavit she asked this is curtis morgan yes thats him thank you gray said hes dead isnt he ms stanford asked i saw it in the paper yes hes dead gray said did you by chance read this affidavit oh no i just witnessed his signature but i knew something was wrong thank you ms stanford they left as fast as theyd come the thin man hid his shiny forehead under a ragged fedora his pants were rags and his shoes were torn and he sat in his ancient wheelchair in front of the post and held a sign proclaiming him to be hungry and homeless he rolled his head from shoulder to shoulder as if the muscles in his neck had collapsed from hunger a paper bowl with a few dollars and coins was in his lap but it was his money maybe he could do better if he was blind he looked pitiful sitting there like a vegetable rolling his head wearing green kermit the frog sunglasses he watched every move on the street he saw the car fly around the corner and park illegally the man and the woman jumped out and ran toward him he had a gun under the ragged quilt but they were moving too fast and there were too many people on the sidewalk they entered the post building he waited a minute then rolled himself away smith keen was pacing and fidgeting in front of feldmans office door as the secretary looked on he saw them weaving hurriedly down the aisle between the rows of desks gray was leading and holding her hand she was definitely attractive but he would appreciate it later they were breathless smith keen this is darby shaw gray said between breaths they shook hands hello she said looking around at the sprawling newsroom my pleasure darby from what i hear you are a remarkable woman right grantham said we can chitchat later follow me keen said and they were off again feldman wanted to use the conference room they cut across the cluttered newsroom and walked into a plush room with a long table in the center of it it was full of men who were talking but immediately shut up when she walked in feldman closed the door he reached for her handim jackson feldman executive editor you must be darby who else gray said still breathing hard feldman ignored him and looked around the table he pointedthis is howard krauthammer managing editor ernie debasio assistant managing editorforeign elliot cohen assistant managing editornational and vince litsky our attorney she nodded politely and forgot each name as she heard it they were all at least fifty all in shirtsleeves all deeply concerned she could feel the tension give me the tape gray said she took it from her bag and handed it to him the television and vcr were at the end of the room on a portable stand he pushed the tape into the vcr we got this twenty minutes ago so we havent seen it darby sat in a chair against the wall the men inched toward the screen and waited for an image on a black screen was the dateoctober then curtis morgan was sitting at a table in a kitchen he held a switch that evidently worked the camera my name is curtis morgan and since youre watching this im probably dead it was a helluva first sentence the men grimaced and inched closer today is october and im doing this at my house im alone my wife is at the doctor i should be at work but i called in sick my wife knows nothing about any of this ive told no one since youre watching this youve also seen this he holds up the affidavit this is an affidavit ive signed and i plan to leave it with this video probably in a safe deposit box in a bank downtown ill read the affidavit and discuss other things weve got the affidavit gray said quickly he was standing against the wall next to darby no one looked at him they were glued to the screen morgan slowly read the affidavit his eyes darted from the pages to the camera back and forth back and forth it took him ten minutes each time darby heard the word pelican she closed her eyes and slowly shook her head it had all come down to this it was a bad dream she tried to listen when morgan finished the affidavit he laid it on the table and looked at some notes on a legal pad he was comfortable and relaxed he was a handsome kid who looked younger than twentynine he was at home so there was no tie just a starched white buttondown white and blazevich was not an ideal place to work he said but most of the four hundred lawyers were honest and probably knew nothing about mattiece in fact he doubted if many besides wakefield velmano and einstein were involved in the conspiracy there was a partner named jarreld schwabe who was sinister enough to be involved but morgan had no proof darby remembered him well there was an exsecretary whod quit abruptly a few days after the assassinations her name was miriam larue and shed worked in the oil and gas section for eighteen years she might know something she lives in falls church another secretary whom he would not name had told him she overheard a conversation between wakefield and velmano and the topic was whether he morgan could be trusted but she just heard bits and pieces they treated him differently after the memo was found on his desk especially schwabe and wakefield it was as if they wanted to throw him up against the wall and threaten his life if he told of the memo but they couldnt do it because they werent sure hed seen it and they were afraid to make a big deal out of it but hed seen it and they were almost certain hed seen it and if they conspired to kill rosenberg and jensen well hell he was just an associate he could be replaced in seconds litsky the lawyer shook his head in disbelief the numbness was wearing off and they moved a bit in their seats morgan commuted by car and twice he was trailed once during lunch he saw a man watching him he talked about his family for a while and started to ramble it was apparent hed run out of hard news gray handed the affidavit and the memo to feldman who read it and passed it to krauthammer who passed it on morgan finished with a chilling farewell i dont know who will see this tape ill be dead so it wont really matter i guess i hope you use this to nail mattiece and his sleazy lawyers but if the sleazy lawyers are watching this tape then you can all go straight to hell gray ejected the tape he rubbed his hands together and smiled at the group well gentlemen did we bring you enough verification or do you want more i know those guys litsky said dazed wakefield and i played tennis a year ago feldman was up and walking howd you find morgan its a long story gray said give me a real short version we found a law student at georgetown who clerked for white and blazevich last summer he identified a photograph of morgan howd you get the photograph litsky asked dont ask it doesnt go with the story i say run the story krauthammer said loudly run it said elliot cohen howd you learn he was dead feldman asked darby went to white and blazevich yesterday they broke the news where was the video and affidavit in a lockbox at first columbia morgans wife gave me the key at five this morning ive done nothing wrong the pelican brief has been verified fully by an independent source run it said ernie debasio run it with the biggest headline since nixon resigns feldman stopped near smith keen the two friends eyed each other carefully run it said keen he turned to the lawyer vince theres no question legally but id like to see the story after its written how long will it take to write it the editor asked gray the brief portion is already outlined i can finish it up in an hour or so give me two hours on morgan three at the most feldman hadnt smiled since he shook hands with darby he paced to the other side of the room and stood in grays face what if this tapes a hoax hoax were talking dead bodies jackson ive seen the widow shes a real live widow this paper ran the story of his murder hes dead even his law firm says hes dead and thats him on the tape talking about dying i know thats him and we talked to the notary public who witnessed his signature on the affidavit she identified him gray was getting louder and looking around the room everything he said verifies the pelican brief everything mattiece the lawsuit the assassinations then weve got darby the author of the brief and more dead bodies and theyve chased her all over the country there are no holes jackson its a story he finally smiled its more than a story have it written by two its eleven now use this conference room and close the door feldman was pacing againwell meet here at exactly two and read the draft not a word the men stood and filed from the room but not before each shook hands with darby shaw they were uncertain whether to say congratulations or thanks or whatever so they just smiled and shook her hand she kept her seat when they were alone gray sat beside her and they held hands the clean conference table was before them the chairs were placed perfectly around it the walls were white and the room was lit by fluorescent lights and two narrow windows how do you feel he asked i dont know this is the end of the road i guess we made it you dont sound too happy ive had better months im happy for you he looked at her why are you happy for me you put the pieces together and it hits tomorrow its got pulitzer written all over it i hadnt thought about that liar okay maybe once but when you got off the elevator yesterday and told me garcia was dead i quit thinking about pulitzers its not fair i do all the work we used my brains and looks and legs and you get all the glory ill be glad to use your name ill credit you as the author of the brief well put your picture on the front page along with rosenberg jensen mattiece the president verheek and thomas will his picture run with the story its up to feldman hell edit this one she thought about this and said nothing well ms shaw ive got three hours to write the biggest story of my career a story that will shock the world a story that could bring down a presidency a story that will solve the assassinations a story that will make me rich and famous youd better let me write it would you im tired go get your notes and some coffee they closed the door and cleared the table a news aide rolled in a pc with a printer they sent him after a pot of coffee then some fruit they outlined the story in sections beginning with the assassinations then the pelican case in south louisiana then mattiece and his link to the president then the pelican brief and all the havoc it created callahan verheek then curtis morgan and his muggers then white and blazevich and wakefield velmano and einstein darby preferred to write in longhand she scaled down the litigation and the brief and what was known of mattiece gray took the rest and typed out rough notes on the machine darby was a model of organization with notes neatly arranged on the table and words carefully written on paper he was a whirlwind of chaospapers on the floor talking to the computer printing random paragraphs that were discarded by the time they were on paper she kept telling him to be quiet this is not a law school library he explained this is a newspaper you work with a phone in each ear and someone yelling at you at twelvethirty smith keen sent in food darby ate a cold sandwich and watched the traffic below gray was digging through campaign reports she saw him he was leaning on the side of a building across fifteenth street and he would not have been suspicious except he had been leaning on the side of the madison hotel an hour earlier he was sipping something from a tall styrofoam cup and watching the front entrance to the post he wore a black cap denim jacket and jeans he was under thirty and he just stood there staring across the street she nibbled on her sand wich and watched him for ten minutes he sipped from his cup and never moved gray come here please what is it he walked over she pointed to the man with the black cap watch him carefully she saidtell me what hes doing hes drinking something probably coffee hes leaning on the side of that building and hes watching this building whats he wearing denim from head to toe and a black cap looks like boots what about it i saw him an hour ago standing over there by the hotel he was sort of hidden by that telephone van but i know it was him now hes over there so so for the past hour at least hes been moving around doing nothing but watching this building gray nodded this was no time for a smart comment the guy looked suspicious and she was concerned shed been tracked for two weeks now from new orleans to new york and now maybe to washington and she knew more about being followed than he did whatre you saying darby give me one good reason why this man who obviously is not a street bum would be doing this the man looked at his watch and walked slowly along the sidewalk until he was gone darby looked at her watch its exactly one she said lets check every fifteen minutes okay okay i doubt if its anything he said trying to be comforting it didnt work she sat at the table and looked at the notes he watched her and slowly returned to the computer gray typed furiously for fifteen minutes then walked back to the window darby watched him carefully i dont see him he said he did see him at onethirty darby he said pointing to the spot where shed first seen him she looked out the window and slowly focused on the man with the black cap now he had a dark green windbreaker and he was not facing the post he watched his boots and every ten seconds or so glanced at the front entrance this made him all the more suspicious but he was partially hidden behind a delivery truck the styrofoam cup was gone he lit a cigarette he glanced at the post then watched the sidewalk in front of it why do i have this knot in my stomach darby said how could they follow you its impossible they knew i was in new york that seemed impossible at the time maybe theyre following me ive been told they were watching thats what the guys doing why should he know youre here the dudes following me maybe she said slowly have you seen him before they dont introduce themselves look weve got thirty minutes and theyre back in here with knives to carve up our story lets finish it then we can watch dude out there they returned to their work at one fortyfive she stood in the window again and the man was gone the printer was rattling the first draft and she began proofing the editors read with their pencils litsky the lawyer read for sheer pleasure he seemed to enjoy it more than the others it was a long story and feldman was busy cutting like a surgeon smith keen scribbled in the margins krauthammer liked what he saw they read slowly in silence gray proofed it again darby was at the window dude was back again now wearing a navy blazer with the jeans it was cloudy and in the sixties and he was sipping from the cup he huddled over it to stay warm he took a drink looked at the post looked at the street and back to the cup he was in front of a different building and at exactly twofifteen he began looking north along fifteenth a car stopped on his side of the street the rear door opened and there he was the car sped away and he looked around limping ever so slightly stump walked casually to the man with the black cap they spoke for seconds then stump walked south to the intersection of fifteenth and l dude stayed in place she glanced around the room they were immersed in the story stump was out of sight so she couldnt show him to gray who was reading and smiling no they were not watching the reporter they were waiting on the girl and they had to be desperate they were standing on the street hoping somehow a miracle would happen and the girl would emerge from the building and they could take her out they were scared she was inside spilling her guts and waving copies of that damned brief tomorrow morning the game would be over somehow they had to stop her they had their orders she was in a room full of men and suddenly she was not safe feldman finished last he slid his copy to gray minor stuff should take about an hour lets talk phone calls just three i think gray said the white house fbi and white and blazevich you only named sims wakefield at the firm why asked krauthammer morgan fingered him the most but the memo is from velmano i think he should be named i agree said smith keen me too said debasio i wrote his name in feldman said well get einstein later wait until fourthirty or five before you call the white house and white and blazevich if you do it sooner they may go nuts and run to court i agree said litsky the lawyer they cant stop it but they can try id wait until five before i called them okay gray said ill have it reworked by threethirty then ill call the fbi for their comment then the white house then white and blazevich feldman was almost out the doorwell meet again here at threethirty stay close to your phones when the room was empty again darby locked the door and pointed to the window youve heard me mention stump dont tell me they scanned the street below afraid so he met with our little friend then disappeared i know it was him i guess im off the hook i guess you are i really want to get out of here well think of something ill alert our security you want me to tell feldman no not yet i know some cops great and they can just walk up and beat the hell out of him these copsll do it they cant bother these people what are they doing wrong just planning murder how safe are we in this building gray thought a moment let me tell feldman well get two security guards posted by this door okay feldman approved the second draft at threethirty and gray was given the green light to call the fbi four phones were brought to the conference room and the recorder was plugged in feldman smith keen and krauthammer listened on extensions gray called phil norvell a good acquaintance and sometime source if there was such a thing within the bureau norvell answered his own line phil gray grantham with the post i think i know who youre with gray ive got the recorder on must be serious whats up were running a story in the morning detailing a conspiracy in the assassinations of rosenberg and jensen were naming victor mattiece an oil speculator and two of his lawyers here in town we also mention verheek not in the conspiracy of course we believe the fbi knew about mattiece early on but refused to investigate at the urging of the white house we wanted to give you guys a chance to comment there was no response on the other end phil are you there yes i think so any comment im sure we will have a comment but ill have to call you back were going to press soon so you need to hurry well gray this is a shot in the ass could you hold it a day no way norvell paused okay let me see mr voyles and ill call you back thanks no thank you gray this is wonderful mr voyles will be thrilled were waiting gray punched a button and cleared the line keen turned off the recorder they waited eight minutes and voyles himself was on the line he insisted on speaking to jackson feldman the recorder was back on mr voyles feldman said warmly the two had met many times so the mister was unnecessary call me denton dammit look jackson whats your boy got this is crazy you guys are jumping off a cliff weve investigated mattiece still investigating him and its too early to move on him now whats your boy got does the name darby shaw mean anything feldman grinned at her when he asked the question she was standing against the wall voyles was slow to respond yes he said simply my boy has the pelican brief denton and im sitting here looking at darby shaw i was afraid she was dead no shes very much alive she and gray grantham have confirmed from another source the facts set forth in the brief its a large story denton voyles sighed deeply and threw in the towel we are pursuing mattiece as a suspect he said the recorders on denton be careful well we need to talk i mean man to man i may have some deep background for you youre welcome to come here ill do that ill be there in twenty minutes the editors were terribly amused at the idea of the great f denton voyles hopping in his limo and rushing to the post they had watched him for years and knew he was a master at cutting his losses he hated the press and this willingness to talk on their turf and under their gun meant only one thing he would point the finger at someone else and the likely target was the white house darby had no desire to meet the man her thoughts were on escape she could point at the man in the black cap but hed been gone for thirty minutes now and what could the fbi do they had to catch him first then what charge him with loitering and planning an ambush torture him and make him tell all they probably wouldnt believe her she had no desire to deal with the fbi she didnt want their protection she was about to take a trip and no one would know where to maybe gray maybe not he punched the number for the white house and they picked up the extensions keen turned on the recorder fletcher coal please this is gray grantham with the washington post and its very urgent he waited why coal keen asked everything has to be cleared through him gray said with his hand over the receiver says who says a source the secretary returned with the message that mr coal was on his way please hold gray was smiling the adrenaline was pumping finally fletcher coal yes mr coal gray grantham at the post i am recording the conversation do you understand that yes is it true you have issued a directive to all white house personnel except the president to the effect that all communications with the press must first be cleared by you absolutely untrue the press secretary handles those matters i see were running a story in the morning which in summary verifies the facts set forth in the pelican brief are you familiar with the pelican brief slowly i am we have confirmed that mr mattiece contributed in excess of four million dollars to the presidents campaign three years ago four million two hundred thousand all through legal channels we also believe the white house intervened and attempted to obstruct the fbi investigation into mr mattiece and we wanted your comment if any is this something you believe or is it something you intend to print we are trying to confirm it now and who do you think will confirm it for you we have sources mr coal indeed you do the white house emphatically denies any involvement with this investigation the president asked to be apprised as to the status of the entire investigation after the tragic deaths of justices rosenberg and jensen but there has been no direct or indirect involvement from the white house into any aspect of the investigation you have received some bad information does the president consider victor mattiece a friend no they met on one occasion and as i stated mr mattiece was a significant contributor but he is not a friend of the president he was the largest contributor though wasnt he i cannot confirm that any other comment no im sure the press secretary will address this in the morning they hung up and keen turned off the recorder feldman was on his feet rubbing his hands together id give a years pay to be in the white house right now he said hes cool isnt he gray said with admiration yeah but his cool ass is now sitting deep in boiling water for a man accustomed to throwing his weight around and watching everyone flinch it was difficult to come humbly forward with hat in hand and ask for a break he swaggered as humbly as he could through the newsroom with k o lewis and two agents in tow he wore his customary wrinkled trench coat with the belt tied tightly around the center of his short and dumpy physique he was not striking but his manner and walk left no doubt he was a man accustomed to getting his way all dressed in dark coats they resembled a mafia don with bodyguards the busy newsroom grew silent as they walked quickly through it though not striking f denton voyles was a presence humble or not a small tense group of editors huddled in the short hallway outside feldmans office howard krauthammer knew voyles and met him as he approached they shook hands and whispered feldman was on the phone to mr ludwig the publisher who was in china smith keen joined the conversation and shook hands with voyles and lewis the two agents kept to themselves a few feet away feldman opened his door looked toward the newsroom and saw denton voyles he motioned for him to come in k o lewis followed they exchanged routine pleasantries until smith keen closed the door and they took a seat i take it you have solid confirmation of the pelican brief voyles said we do feldman answered why dont you and mr lewis read a draft of the story i think it will explain things were going to press in about an hour and the reporter mr grantham wants you to have the opportunity to comment i appreciate that feldman picked up a copy of the draft and handed it to voyles who took it gingerly lewis leaned over and they immediately started reading well step outside feldman saidtake your time he and keen left the office and closed the door the agents moved closer feldman and keen walked across the newsroom to the conference door two large security guards stood in the hall gray and darby were alone inside when they entered you need to call white and blazevich feldman said waiting on you they picked up the extensions krauthammer was gone for the moment and keen handed his phone to darby gray punched the numbers marty velmano please gray said yes this is gray grantham with the washington post and i need to speak to him its very urgent one moment please the secretary said a moment passed and another secretary was on the phone mr velmanos office gray identified himself again and asked for her boss hes in a meeting she said so am i gray said go to the meeting tell him who i am and tell him his picture will be on the front page of the post at midnight tonight well yes sir within seconds velmano said yes whats going on gray identified himself for the third time and explained about the recorder i understand velmano snapped were running a story in the morning about your client victor mattiece and his involvement in the assassinations of justices rosenberg and jensen great well sue your ass for the next twenty years youre out in left field buddy well own the post yes sir remember im recording this record all you want youll be named as a defendant this will be great victor mattiece will own the washington post this is fabulous gray shook his head in disbelief at darby the editors smiled at the floor this was about to be very funny yes sir have you heard of the pelican brief we have a copy dead silence then a distant grunt like the last gasp of a dying dog then more silence mr velmano are you there yes we also have a copy of a memo you sent to sims wakefield dated september in which you suggest your clients position will be greatly improved if rosenberg and jensen are removed from the court we have a source that tells us this idea was researched by one called einstein who sits in a library on the sixth floor i believe silence gray continued we have the story ready to run but i wanted to give you the chance to comment would you care to comment mr velmano i have a headache okay anything else will you run the memo word for word yes will you run my picture yes its an old one from a senate hearing you son of a bitch thank you anything else i notice youve waited until five oclock an hour earlier and we couldve run to court and stopped this damned thing yes sir it was planned that way you son of a bitch okay you dont mind ruining people do you his voice trailed off and he was almost pitiful what a marvelous quote gray had mentioned the recorder twice but velmano was too shocked to remember it no sir anything else tell jackson feldman the lawsuit will be filed at nine in the morning just as soon as the courthouse opens ill do that do you deny you wrote the memo of course do you deny the existence of the memo its a fabrication theres no lawsuit mr velmano and i think you know it silence then you son of a bitch the phones clicked and they were listening to the dial tone they smiled at each other in disbelief dont you want to be a journalist darby smith keen asked oh this is fun she said but i was almost mugged twice yesterday no thanks feldman stood and pointed to the recorder i wouldnt use any of that but i sort of liked the part about ruining lives and what about the lawsuit threats gray asked you dont need it gray the story takes up the entire front page now maybe later there was a knock at the door it was krauthammervoyles wants to see you he said to feldman bring him in here gray stood quickly and darby walked to the window the sun was fading and the shadows were falling traffic inched along the street there was no sign of stump and his band of confederates but they were there no doubt waiting on darkness no doubt plotting one last effort to kill her either for prevention or revenge gray said he had a plan to exit the building without gunfire after the deadline he wasnt specific voyles entered with k o lewis feldman introduced them to gray grantham and to darby shaw voyles walked to her smiling and looking up so youre the one who started all this he said in an attempt at admiration it didnt work she instantly despised himi think it was mattiece she said coolly he turned away and took off the trench coat can we sit he asked in general they sat around the tablevoyles lewis feldman keen grantham and krauthammer darby stood by the window i have some comments for the record voyles announced taking a sheet of paper from lewis gray began taking notes first we received a copy of the pelican brief two weeks ago today and submitted it to the white house on the same day it was personally delivered by the deputy director k o lewis to mr fletcher coal who received it with our daily summary to the white house special agent eric east was present during the meeting we thought it raised enough questions to be pursued but it was not pursued for six days until mr gavin verheek special counsel to the director was found murdered in new orleans at that time the fbi immediately began a fullscale investigation of victor mattiece over four hundred agents from twentyseven offices have taken part in the investigation logging over eleven thousand hours interviewing over six hundred people and going to five foreign countries the investigation is continuing in full force at this time we believe victor mattiece to be the prime suspect in the assassinations of justices rosenberg and jensen and at this time we are attempting to locate him voyles folded the paper and handed it back to lewis what will you do if you find mattiece grantham asked arrest him do you have a warrant well have one soon do you have any idea where he is frankly no weve been trying to locate him for a week with no success did the white house interfere with your investigation of mattiece ill discuss it off the record agreed gray looked at the executive editor agreed feldman said voyles stared at feldman then keen then krauthammer then grantham were off the record right you cannot use this under any circumstances do we understand this they nodded and watched him carefully darby was watching too voyles looked suspiciously at lewis twelve days ago in the oval office the president of the united states asked me to ignore victor mattiece as a suspect in his words he asked me to back off did he give a reason asked grantham the obvious he said it would be very embarrassing and seriously damage his reelection efforts he felt there was little merit to the pelican brief and if it was investigated then the press would learn of it and he would suffer politically krauthammer listened with his mouth open keen stared at the table feldman hung on every word are you certain gray asked i recorded the conversation i have a tape which i will not allow anyone to hear unless the president first denies this there was a long silence as they admired this mean little bastard and his tape recorder a tape feldman cleared his throat you just saw the story there was a delay by the fbi from the time it had the brief until it began its investigation this must be explained in the story you have my statement nothing more who killed gavin verheek gray asked i will not talk about the specifics of the investigation but do you know we have an idea but thats all ill say gray glanced around the table it was obvious voyles had nothing else to say now and everyone relaxed at the same time the editors savored the moment voyles loosened his tie and almost smiled this is off the record of course but how did you guys find out about morgan the dead lawyer i will not discuss the specifics of the investigation gray said with a wicked grin they all laughed what do you do now krauthammer asked voyles therell be a grand jury by noon tomorrow quick indictments well try to find mattiece but itll be difficult we have no idea where he is hes spent most of the past five years in the bahamas but owns homes in mexico panama and paraguay voyles glanced at darby for the second time she was leaning against the wall by the window hearing it all what time does the first edition come off the press voyles asked they roll off all night starting at tenthirty said keen which edition will this story run in late city a few minutes before midnight its the largest edition will it have coals picture on the front keen looked at krauthammer who looked at feldman i guess it should well quote you as saying the brief was personally delivered to fletcher coal who well also quote as saying mattiece gave the president four point two million yes i think mr coal should have his face on the front along with everyone else i think so too voyles saidif i have a man here at midnight can i pick up a few copies of it certainly feldman saidwhy because i want to personally deliver it to coal i want to knock on his door at midnight see him in his pajamas and flash the paper in his face then i want to tell him ill be back with a grand jury subpoena and shortly after that ill be back with an indictment and shortly after that ill be back with the handcuffs he said this with such pleasure it was frightening im glad you dont carry a grudge gray said only smith keen thought it was funny do you think hell be indicted krauthammer asked innocently voyles glanced at darby again hell take the fall for the president hed volunteer for a firing squad to save his boss feldman checked his watch and pushed away from the table could i ask a favor voyles asked certainly what id like to spend a few minutes alone with ms shaw that is if she doesnt mind everyone looked at darby who shrugged her approval the editors and k o lewis stood in unison and filed out of the room darby took grays hand and asked him to stay they sat opposite voyles at the table i wanted to talk in private voyles said looking at gray he stays she said its off the record very well she beat him to the punch if you plan to interrogate me i wont talk without an attorney present he was shaking his head nothing like that i was just wondering whats next for you why should i tell you because we can help who killed gavin voyles hesitated off the record off the record said gray ill tell you who we think killed him but first tell me how much you talked to him before he died we talked several times over the weekend we were supposed to meet last monday and leave new orleans when did you last talk to him sunday night and where was he in his room at the hilton voyles breathed deeply and looked at the ceiling and you discussed with him the meeting on monday yes had you met him before no the man who killed him was the same man you were holding hands with when he lost his brains she was afraid to ask gray did it for her who was that the great khamel she choked and covered her eyes and tried to say something but it wouldnt work this is rather confusing gray said straining to be rational rather yes the man who killed khamel is a contract operative hired independently by the cia he was on the scene when callahan was killed and i think he made contact with darby rupert she said quietly thats not his real name of course but rupertll do hes probably got twenty names if its who i think it is hes a british chap whos very reliable do you have any idea how confusing this is she asked i can imagine why was rupert in new orleans why was he following her gray asked its a very long story and i dont know all of it i try to keep my distance from the cia believe me i have enough to worry about it goes back to mattiece a few years ago he needed some money to move along his grand scheme so he sold a piece of it to the libyan government im not sure if it was legal but enter the cia evidently they watched mattiece and the libyans with a great deal of interest and when the litigation sprang up the cia monitored it i dont think they suspected mattiece in the supreme court killings but bob gminski was handed a copy of your little brief just a few hours after we delivered a copy to the white house fletcher coal gave it to him i have no idea who gminski told of the brief but the wrong words hit the wrong ears and twentyfour hours later mr callahan is dead and you my dear were very lucky then why dont i feel lucky she said that doesnt explain rupert gray said i dont know this for a fact but i suspect gminski immediately sent rupert to follow darby i think the brief initially scared gminski more than the rest of us he probably sent rupert to trail her in part to watch and in part to protect then the car exploded and suddenly mr mattiece just confirmed the brief why else would you kill callahan and darby i have reason to believe there were dozens of cia people in new orleans hours after the car exploded but why gray asked the brief had been legitimized and mattiece was killing people most of his business is in new orleans and i think the cia was very concerned about darby lucky for her they came through when it counted if the cia moved so fast why didnt you she asked fair question we didnt think that much of the brief and we didnt know half as much as the cia i swear it seemed like such a long shot and we had a dozen other suspects we underestimated it plain and simple plus the president asked us to back off and it was easy to do because id never heard of mattiece had no reason to then my friend gavin got himself killed and i sent in the troops why would coal give the brief to gminski gray asked it scared him and truthfully thats one reason we sent it over gminski is well hes gminski and he sometimes does things his way without regard for little obstacles like laws and such coal wanted the brief checked out and he figured gminski would do it quickly and quietly so gminski didnt level with coal he hates coal which is perfectly understandable gminski dealt with the president and no he didnt level with him it all happened so fast remember gminski coal the president and i first saw the brief just two weeks ago today gminski was probably waiting to tell the president some of the story but just hadnt got the chance darby pushed her chair away and walked back to the window it was dark now and the traffic was still slow and heavy it was nice to have these mysteries revealed to her but they created more mysteries she just wanted to leave she was tired of running and being chased tired of playing reporter with gray tired of wondering who did what and why tired of the guilt for writing the damned thing tired of buying a new toothbrush every three days she longed for a small house on a deserted stretch of beach with no phones and no people especially ones hiding behind vehicles and buildings she wanted to sleep for three days without nightmares and without seeing shadows it was time to go gray watched her carefully she was followed to new york then here he said to voyles who is it are you positive voyles asked they were on the street all day watching the building darby said nodding to the window weve watched them gray said theyre out there voyles seemed skeptical have you seen them before he asked darby one of them he watched thomas memorial service in new orleans he chased me through the french quarter he almost found me in manhattan and i saw him chatting with another fella about five hours ago i know its him who is it gray asked voyles again i dont think cia would chase you oh he chased me do you see them now no they disappeared two hours ago but theyre out there voyles stood and stretched his thick arms he walked slowly around the table unwrapping a cigar mind if i smoke yes i mind she said without looking at him he laid it on the table we can help he said i dont want your help she said to the window what do you want i want to leave the country but when i do i want to make damned sure no one follows not you not them not rupert nor any of his pals youll have to come back and testify before the grand jury only if they can find me im going to a place where subpoenas are frowned upon what about the trial youll be needed at trial thats at least a year from now ill think about it then voyles placed the cigar in his mouth but did not light it he paced and analyzed better with one between his teeth ill make you a deal im not in the mood for deals she was leaning against the wall now looking at him and looking at gray its a good one ive got planes and helicopters and plenty of men who carry guns and are not the least bit afraid of those boys out there playing hideandseek first well get you out of the building and no one will know it second well put you on my plane and fly you anywhere you want third you can disappear from there you have my word we will not follow but and fourth you allow me to contact you through mr grantham here if and only if it becomes urgently necessary she was looking at gray as the offer was made and it was obvious he liked the deal she kept a poker face but damn it sounded good if she had trusted gavin after the first phone call he would be alive and she would never have held hands with khamel if shed simply left new orleans with him when he suggested he would not have been murdered shed thought about this every five minutes for the past seven days this thing was bigger than she was there comes a time when you give up and start trusting people she didnt like this man but for the past ten minutes he had been remarkably honest with her is it your plane and your pilots yes where is it andrews lets do it like this i get on the plane and its headed for denver and no one is on it but me gray and the pilots and thirty minutes after we take off i instruct the pilot to go to lets say chicago can he do that he has to file a flight plan before he leaves i know but youre the director of the fbi and you can pull some strings okay what happens when you get to chicago i get off the plane alone and it returns to andrews with gray and what do you do in chicago i get lost in a busy airport and catch the first flight out thatll work but you have my word we wont follow i know forgive me for being so cautious its a deal when do you wish to leave she looked at gray when itll take me an hour to revise it again and add mr voyles comments an hour she said to voyles ill wait could we talk in private she said to voyles while nodding at gray certainly he grabbed his trench coat and stopped at the door he smiled at her youre a helluva lady ms shaw your brains and guts are bringing down one of the sickest men in this country i admire you and i promise ill always level with you he stuck the cigar in the middle of his chubby smile and left the room they watched the door close do you think ill be safe she asked yes i think hes sincere plus he has men with guns who can get you out of here its okay darby you can leave with me cant you sure she walked to him and put her arms around his waist he held her tightly and closed his eyes at seven the editors gathered around the table for the last time tuesday night they quickly read the section gray added to include voyles comments feldman walked in late with an enormous smile you will not believe this he said ive had two phone calls ludwig called from china the president found him there and begged him to hold the story for twentyfour hours ludwig said the man was near tears ludwig being the gentleman listened respectfully and politely declined the second call was from judge roland an old friend of mine seems as though the boys at white and blazevich called him away from the dinner table and requested permission to file an injunction tonight with an immediate hearing judge roland listened quite disrespectfully and impolitely declined lets run this baby krauthammer yelled the takeoff was smooth and the jet was headed due west supposedly for denver it was adequate but not luxurious but then it was owned by the taxpayers and held by a man who cared nothing for the finer things no good whiskey gray determined as he opened the cabinets voyles was an abstainer and at the moment this really irritated gray since he was a guest and dying of thirst he found two semichilled sprites in the refrigerator and handed one to darby she popped the top of the can the jet appeared to be level the copilot appeared in the door of their cabin he was polite and introduced himself we were told that we would have a new destination shortly after takeoff thats correct darby said fine uh well need to know something in about ten minutes okay is there any liquor on this thing gray asked sorry the copilot smiled and returned to the cockpit darby and her long legs consumed most of the small sofa but he was determined to join her he lifted her feet and sat at the end of it they were in his lap red toenails he rubbed her ankles and thought only of this first major eventthe holding of the feet it was terribly intimate for him but didnt seem to faze her she was smiling a little now unwinding it was over were you scared he asked yes and you yes but i felt safe i mean its hard to feel vulnerable with six armed buddies using their bodies as shields its hard to feel watched in the rear of a van with no windows voyles loved it didnt he he was like napoleon making plans and directing troops its a big moment for him hell take a shot in the morning but itll bounce off the only person who can fire him is the president and id say voyles has control of him at the moment and the murders are solved he has to feel good about that i think weve added ten years to his career what have we done i think hes cute darby said i didnt like him at first but he sort of grows on you and hes human when he mentioned verheek i saw a trace of water in his eyes a real sweetheart im sure fletcher coal will be delighted to see this cute little man in a few hours her feet were long and thin perfect really he rubbed along the top of them and felt like a sophomore moving up from the knee on the second date they were pale and needed sun and he knew that in a few short days they would be brown with sand permanently stuck between the toes he had not been invited to visit later and this was disturbing he had no idea where she was going and this was intentional he was not certain she knew her destination the foot play reminded her of thomas hed get half drunk and smear polish around the nails with the jet humming and shaking softly he was suddenly many miles removed from her hed been dead for two weeks but it seemed much longer thered been so many changes it was better this way if she was at tulane walking by his office seeing his classroom talking to the other professors staring at his apartment from the street it would be awfully painful the little reminders are nice for the long run but during the mourning they get in the way she was a different person now with a different life in a different place and a different man was rubbing her feet he was an ass at first cocky and abrasive a typical reporter but he was thawing rapidly and under the jaded layer she was finding a warm man who obviously liked her very much tomorrows a big day for you she said he took a sip of straight sprite he would pay an outrageous sum of money for a icecold imported beer in a green bottle big day he said admiring the toes it would be more than a big day but he felt the need to understate it at this moment she had his attention not the chaos of tomorrow whatll happen she asked ill probably go back to the office and wait for it to hit smith keen said he would be there all night a lot of people will be in early well gather in the conference room and theyll bring more televisions well spend the morning watching it break itll be great fun listening to the official white house response white and blazevich will say something who knows about mattiece chief runyan will have a comment voyles will be very visible the lawyers will assemble grand juries and the politicians will be delirious theyll hold press conferences all day on capitol hill it will be a rather significant news day i hate youll miss it she gave a little sarcastic snort whats your next story probably voyles and his tape you have to anticipate a white house denial of any interference and if the ink gets too hot for voyles hell attack with a vengeance id like to have the tape and after that depends on a lot of unknowns after six oclock in the morning the competition gets much stiffer therell be a million rumors and a thousand stories but every paper in the country will be wedging in but youll be the star she said with admiration not sarcasm yeah ill get my fifteen minutes the copilot knocked on the door and opened it he looked at darby atlanta she said and he closed the door why atlanta gray asked you ever changed planes at atlanta sure you ever got lost changing planes at atlanta i think so i rest my case its huge and wonderfully busy he emptied the can and set it on the floor where to from there he knew he shouldnt ask because she hadnt volunteered but he wanted to know ill catch a quick flight somewhere ill do my fourairportsinonenight routine its probably unnecessary but ill feel safer ill eventually land somewhere in the caribbean somewhere in the caribbean that narrowed it to a thousand islands why was she so vague did she not trust him he was sitting here playing with her feet and she wouldnt tell him where she was going what do i tell voyles he asked ill call you when i get there or i might drop you a line great they could be pen pals he could send her his stories and she could send postcards from the beach will you hide from me he asked looking at her i dont know where im going gray i wont know until i get there but youll call eventually yes i promise by pm only five lawyers remained in the offices of white and blazevich and they were in marty velmanos on the tenth floor velmano sims wakefield jarreld schwabe nathaniel einstein jones and a retired partner named frank cortz two bottles of scotch sat on the edge of velmanos desk one was empty the other almost there einstein sat alone in one corner mumbling to himself he had wild curly gray hair and a pointed nose and indeed looked crazy especially now sims wakefield and jarreld schwabe sat in front of the desk with ties off and sleeves rolled up cortz finished a phone chat with an aide to victor mattiece he handed the phone to velmano who placed it on the desk that was strider cortz reported theyre in cairo in the penthouse suite of some hotel mattiece will not talk to us strider says hes over the edge acting very bizarre hes locked himself in a room and needless to say he aint coming to this side of the ocean strider says theyve told the boys with the guns to get out of town immediately the chase is off the fat lady is singing so whatre we supposed to do asked wakefield were on our own said cortz mattiece has washed his hands of us they spoke quietly and deliberately the screaming ended hours ago wakefield blamed velmano for the memo velmano blamed cortz for bringing in a sleazy client like mattiece in the first place that was twelve years ago cortz screamed back and weve enjoyed his fees ever since schwabe blamed velmano and wakefield for being so careless with the memo they dragged morgan through the mud again and again it had to be him einstein sat in the corner and watched them but that was all behind them now grantham mentioned only me and sims velmano saidthe rest of you guys may be safe why dont you and sims skip the country schwabe said ill be in new york at am velmano said then to europe for a month on the trains i cant run wakefield said ive got a wife and six kids theyd heard him whine about his six kids for five hours now as if they didnt have families velmano was divorced and his two children were grown they could handle it and he could handle it it was time to retire anyway he had plenty of money stashed away and he loved europe especially spain and so it was adios for him he sort of pitied wakefield who was only fortytwo and didnt have a lot of money he earned well but his wife was a spendthrift who had a penchant for babies wakefield was unbalanced at the moment i dont know what ill do wakefield said for the thirtieth time i just dont know schwabe tried to be a bit helpful i think you should go

his eyes come on sims get a grip cortz said einstein stood and walked to the door ill be at my place in florida dont call unless its urgent he opened the door and slammed it behind him wakefield stood weakly and started for the door where are you going sims asked schwabe to my office what for i need to lie down im okay let me drive you home schwabe said they watched him carefully he was opening the door im fine he said and he sounded stronger he closed it when he left you think hes okay schwabe asked velmano he worries me i wouldnt say hes okay velmano said weve all had better days why dont you go check on him in a few minutes ill do that schwabe said wakefield walked deliberately to the stairway and down one flight to the ninth floor he picked up speed as he approached his office he was crying when he locked the door behind him do it quick forget the note if you write it youll talk yourself out of it theres a million in life insurance he opened a desk drawer dont think about the kids it would be the same if he died in a plane crash he pulled the from under a file do it quick dont look at their pictures on the wall maybe theyll understand one day he stuck it deep in his mouth and pulled the trigger the limo stopped abruptly in front of the twostory home in dumbarton oaks in upper georgetown it blocked the street and that was fine because it was twenty minutes after midnight and there was no traffic voyles and two agents jumped from the rear of the car and walked quickly to the front door voyles held a newspaper he banged the door with his fist coal was not asleep he was sitting in the dark in the den in his pajamas and bathrobe so voyles was quite pleased when he opened his door nice pajamas voyles said admiring his pants coal stepped onto the tiny concrete porch the two agents were watching from the narrow sidewalk what the hell do you want he asked slowly just brought you this voyles said sticking the paper in his face gotta a nice picture of you right next to the president hugging mattiece i know how much you like newspapers so i thought id bring you one your facell be in it tomorrow coal said as if hed already written the story voyles threw the paper at his feet and started walking off i got some tapes coal you start lying and ill jerk your pants off in public coal stared at him but said nothing voyles was near the street ill be back in two days with a grand jury subpoena he yelled ill come about two in the morning and serve it myself he was at the car next ill bring an indictment of course by then your assll be history and the presidentll have a new bunch of idiots telling him what to do he disappeared into the limo and it sped away coal picked up the paper and went inside gray and smith keen sat alone in the conference room reading the words in print he was many years beyond the excitement of seeing his stories on the front page but this one brought a rush with it there had been none bigger the faces were lined neatly across the top mattiece hugging the president coal talking importantly on the phone in an official white house photo velmano sitting before a senate subcommittee wakefield cropped from a bar convention picture verheek smiling at the camera in an fbi release callahan from the yearbook and morgan in a photo taken from the video mrs morgan had consented paypur the night police reporter had told them about wakefield an hour earlier gray was depressed about it but he wouldnt blame himself they began drifting in around am krauthammer brought a dozen doughnuts and promptly ate four of them while he admired the front page ernie debasio was next said he hadnt slept any feldman arrived fresh and hyper by fourthirty the room was full and four televisions were going cnn got it first and within minutes the networks were live from the white house which had no comment at the moment but zikman would say something at seven with the exception of wakefields death there was nothing new initially the networks bounced back and forth between the white house the supreme court and the news desks they waited at the hoover building which was very quiet at the moment they flashed the photos from the papers they couldnt find velmano they speculated about mattiece cnn showed live footage of the morgan house in alexandria but morgans fatherinlaw kept the cameras off the property nbc had a reporter standing in front of the building where white and blazevich had offices but he had nothing new and though she wasnt quoted in the story there was no secret about the identity of the author of the brief there was much speculation about darby shaw at seven the room was packed and silent the four screens were identical as zikman walked nervously to the podium in the white house press room he was tired and haggard he read a short statement in which the white house admitted receiving the campaign money from a number of channels controlled by victor mattiece but he emphatically denied any of the money was dirty the president had met mr mattiece only once and that was when he was the vice president he had not spoken to the man since being elected president and certainly did not consider him a friend in spite of the money the campaign had received over fifty million and the president handled none of it he had a committee for that no one in the white house had attempted to interfere with the investigation of victor mattiece as a suspect and any allegations to the contrary were flat wrong based on their limited knowledge mr mattiece no longer lived in this country the president welcomes a full investigation into the allegations contained in the post story and if mr mattiece was the perpetrator of these heinous crimes then he must be brought to justice this was simply a statement for the time being a full press conference would follow zikman darted from the podium it was a weak performance by a troubled press secretary and gray was relieved he suddenly found himself crowded and needed fresh air he found smith keen outside the door lets go eat breakfast he whispered sure i need to run by my apartment too if you dont mind i havent seen it in four days they flagged a cab on fifteenth and enjoyed the crisp autumn air rushing in the open windows wheres the girl keen asked i have no idea i last saw her in atlanta about nine hours ago she said she was headed for the caribbean keen was grinning i assume youll want a long vacation soon howd you guess theres a lot of work to be done gray right now were in the middle of the explosion and the pieces start falling to earth very soon youre the man of the hour but you must keep pushing you must pick up the pieces i know my job smith yeah but youve got this faraway look in your eyes it worries me youre an editor you get paid for worrying they stopped at the intersection at pennsylvania avenue the white house sat majestically before them it was almost november and the wind blew leaves across the lawn after eight days in the sun the skin was brown enough and the hair was returning to its natural color maybe she hadnt ruined it she walked miles up and down the beaches and ate nothing but broiled fish and island fruit she slept a lot the first few days then got tired of it she had spent the first night in san juan where she found a travel agent who claimed to be an expert on the virgin islands the lady found a small room in a guest house in downtown charlotte amalie on the island of st thomas darby wanted crowds and lots of traffic on narrow streets at least for a couple of days charlotte amalie was perfect the guest house was on a hillside four blocks away from the harbor and her tiny room was on the third floor there were no shutters or curtains on the cracked window and the sun woke her the first morning a sensuous wakeup call that summoned her to the window and displayed for her the majesty of the harbor it was breathtaking a dozen cruise ships of all sizes sat perfectly still in the shimmering water they stretched in a careless formation almost to the horizon in the foreground near the pier a hundred sailboats dotted the harbor and seemed to keep the bulky tourist ships at bay the water under the sailboats was a clear soft blue and as smooth as glass it gently curled around hassel island and grew darker until it was indigo and then violet as it touched the horizon a perfect row of cumulus clouds marked the line where the water met the sky her watch was in a bag and she had no plans to wear it for at least six months but she glanced at her wrist anyway the window opened with a strain and the sounds of the shopping district echoed through the streets the warmth filtered in like a sauna she stood in the small window for an hour that first morning on the island and watched the harbor come to life there was no hurry it woke gently as the big ships inched through the water and soft voices came from the decks of the sailboats the first person she saw on a boat jumped into the water for a morning swim she could grow accustomed to this her room was small but clean there was no air conditioner but the fan worked fine and it was not unpleasant the water ran most of the time she decided to stay here a couple of days maybe a week the building was one of dozens packed tightly together along streets that ran down to the harbor for the moment she liked the safety of crowds and streets she could walk and find whatever she needed st thomas was known for its shopping and she cherished the idea of buying clothes she could keep there were fancier rooms but this would do for now when she left san juan she vowed to stop looking over her shoulder shed seen the paper in miami and shed watched the frenzy on a television in the airport and she knew mattiece had disappeared if they were stalking now it was simply revenge and if they found her after the crisscrossing journey she had taken then they were not human and she would never lose them they werent back there and she believed this she stayed close to the small room for two days never venturing far the shopping district was a short walk away only four blocks long and two blocks deep it was a maze of hundreds of small and unique stores selling everything the sidewalks and alleys were crammed with americans from the big ships she was just another tourist with a wide straw hat and colorful shorts she bought her first novel in a year and a half and read it in two days while lying on the small bed under the gentle rush from the ceiling fan she vowed to read nothing about the law until she was fifty at least once an hour she walked to the open window and studied the harbor once she counted twenty cruise ships waiting to dock the room served its purpose she spent time with thomas and cried and was determined to do it for the last time she wanted to leave the guilt and pain in this tiny corner of charlotte amalie and exit with the good memories and a clean conscience it was not as difficult as she tried to make it and by the third day there were no more tears shed thrown the paperback only once on the fourth morning she packed her new bags and took a ferry to cruz bay twenty minutes away on the island of st john she took a taxi along the north shore road the windows were down and the wind blew across the backseat the music was a rhythmic mixture of blues and reggae the cabdriver tapped the wheel and sang along she tapped her foot and closed her eyes to the breeze it was intoxicating he left the road at maho bay and drove slowly toward the water shed picked this spot from a hundred islands because it was undeveloped only a handful of beach houses and cottages were permitted in this bay the driver stopped on a narrow treelined road and she paid him the house was almost at the point where the mountain met the sea the architecture was pure caribbeanwhite wood frame under a red tile roofand built barely on the incline to provide for the view she walked down a short trail from the road and up the steps to the house it was a single story with two bedrooms and a porch facing the water it cost two thousand a week and she had it for a month she placed her bags on the floor of the den and walked to her porch the beach started thirty feet below her the waves rolled silently to the shore two sailboats sat motionless in the bay which was secluded by mountains on three sides a rubber raft full of kids splashing moved aimlessly between the boats the nearest dwelling was down the beach she could barely see its roof above the trees a few bodies relaxed in the sand she quickly changed into a tiny bikini and walked to the water it was almost dark when the taxi finally stopped at the trail he got out paid the driver and looked at the lights as the cab drove in front of him and disappeared he had one bag and he eased along the trail to the house which was unlocked the lights were on he found her on the porch sipping a frozen drink and looking like a native with bronze skin she was waiting on him and this was so damned important he didnt want to be treated like a houseguest her face smiled instantly and she set her drink on the table they kissed on the porch for a long minute you re late she said as they held each other this was not the easiest place to find gray said he was rubbing her back which was bare down to the waist where a long skirt began and covered most of the legs he would see them later isnt it beautiful she said looking at the bay its magnificent he said he stood behind her as they watched a sailboat drift toward the sea he held her shoulders youre gorgeous lets go for a walk he changed quickly into a pair of shorts and found her waiting by the water they held hands and walked slowly those legs need work she said rather pale arent they he said yes she thought they were pale but they werent bad not bad at all the stomach was flat a week on the beach with her and hed look like a lifeguard they splashed water with their feet you left early she said i got tired of it ive written a story a day since the big one yet they want more keen wanted this and feldman wanted that and i was working eighteen hours a day yesterday i said goodbye i havent seen a paper in a week she said coal quit theyve set him up to take the fall but indictments look doubtful i dont think the president did much really hes just dumb and cant help it you read about wakefield yes velmano schwabe and einstein have been indicted but they cant find velmano mattiece of course has been indicted along with four of his people therell be more indictments later it dawned on me a few days ago that there was no big coverup at the white house so i lost steam i think it killed his reelection but hes not a felon the citys a circus they walked in silence as it grew darker shed heard enough of this and he was sick of it too there was half a moon and it reflected on the still water she put her arm around his waist and he pulled her closer they were in the sand away from the water the house was a half a mile behind them ive missed you she said softly he breathed deeply but said nothing how long will you stay she asked i dont know a couple of weeks maybe a year its up to you how about a month i can do a month she smiled at him and his knees were weak she looked at the bay at the moons reflection in the center of it as the sailboat crawled bylets take it a month at a time okay gray perfect
