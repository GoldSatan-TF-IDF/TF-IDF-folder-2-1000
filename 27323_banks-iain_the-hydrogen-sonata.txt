iain m banks the hydrogen sonata to the memory of paul gambol and ronnie martin with thanks to ad√®le tim les joanna and nick one s in the dying days of the gzilt civilisation before its longpreparedfor elevation to something better and the celebrations to mark this momentous but joyful occasion one of its last surviving ships encountered an alien vessel whose sole task was to deliver a very special partygoer to the festivities the two craft met within the blastshadow of the planetary fragment called ablate a narrow twisted scrue of rock three thousand kilometres long and shaped like the hole in a tornado ablate was all that was left of a planet destroyed deliberately two millennia earlier shortly before it would have been destroyed naturally by the supernova within whose outrushing sphere of debris gasses and radiation it remained like an arrowhead plunging ever downwards into the rising roiling heat and sparks of a great fire ablate itself was anything but natural roughly hewn as though sliced from some spherical cake its tip and the first few hundred kilometres of its narrow end had originally been made up of the metallic material which had formed the very centre of the nowdefunct small planet while its wider end a rough circle a couple of hundred kilometres across looked like a gently curved dome and had been part of the barren globes rocky surface kept pointed aimed into the supernovas blast front by engines keeled within hyperspace all of that original tip and most of those next few hundred kilometres of layered metallic ores had abraded away over the last nineteen hundred years boiled and scoured into oblivion by the stillexpanding fires of the exploded stars nebula the multicoloured skies around ablate filled with the vast glowing clouds of stellar debris and the gasses and dusts resulting from its own slow wearingaway were some of the most calculatedly spectacular in the civilised galaxy and that was why ablate was a place of special significance to the people who called themselves the gzilt the gzilt had rescued this portion of world from the annihilation of the supernova and they had anchored within it the star drives and field projectors which kept it respectively stable and just in the centre of that rough circle of what had been the planets dusty surface habitable the alien ship was an irregular fuzzylooking bubble of dark spheres measuring barely a hundred metres along its principal axis it was lit from around and above by the spectrum of colours radiating from the clouds of the supernova and from below by the gentle blue glow of the worldfragments only obvious nonnatural feature a scooped domed bowl a handful of kilometres across that lay on that fractured unshadowed surface like a slightly too perfect crater the bowl was an oasis of warmth moisture and atmosphere on that cold dry airless surface within its gauzy layers of containment it held the sort of parks lakes carefully proportioned buildings and lush but managed tracts of vegetation favoured by many types of humanoids the gzilt ship dwarfed the alien one it looked like a thousand dark broadswords gathered into a gods fist and brandished at the skies it crossed the boundary of glowing outflowing dusts and swirling gasses at the periphery of ablates circular outer surface allowing its own fields to create a series of brief tearing billowing folds within the curtains of light there then moved slowly towards and over the glowing bowl and the collection of dark bubbles that was the alien ship until its spiny bulk hung directly above both occluding a large part of the supernova clouds and draping its bristled shadow over the ship and the dome below the smaller ship waited for some sort of hail from the larger one as was only polite but nothing appeared to be forthcoming it decided to make the initial approach itself greetings i am the zihdrenremnanter ceremonial representative carrying ship exaltationparsimony iii you i understand are the gzilt irfws churkun i am honoured to be invited here and to make your acquaintance that is interesting came the reply a zihdrenremnanter ceremonial representative carrying ship you say well indeed i am somewhat obviously somewhat obviously indeed and if i may so claim both in outward form and unshielded emissive signature again interesting indeed may i make an observation you may we await it you seem how might one put this a little less welcoming and polite especially formally welcoming and polite as it were than i confess i was expecting and indeed had been led to expect am i mistaken or if i am not is there a specific reason for this also i cannot help but note that the crater facility here at ablate which i was led to believe would be at least staffed if not in full ceremonial welcoming mode does not in fact appear to be so indeed it appears to be effectively empty both of biological and nonbiological sentient presences there are a few subai substrates running but no more obviously one is aware that these are strange times even unprecedented times for the gzilt times of disruption and one would both surmise and expect quiet but purposeful preparation as well as anticipation some degree of formality might therefore be expected to be dispensed with in the circumstances however even so one as you say strange times times that bring uninvited guests and unwelcome attentions in the shape of those who would exploit our reduced numbers and distracted state we may have experienced a degree of signal outage there or at least signal protocol disruption unlikely though that may seem however with regard to what you say regarding the unwelcome attentions from others that is sadly to be expected the preparations for sublimation tend to bring such happily relatively minor consequences as those whose memory i am honoured to represent would be the first to agree the zihdren there was no signal outage or protocol disruption then nor is there now i interrupted you i am doing so again ah then i was not mistaken might i just check am i addressing the captain of the churkuns virtual crew you are ah well then captain we appear to have started out from positions involving inharmonious premises that is unfortunate i would hope that nevertheless you might appreciate my disquiet one might even characterise it as disappointment at the fact that we appear to have initiated our association here on such an unfortunate tack please tell me what i might do to help bring us back onto a more agreeable course the preparations for our sublimation have encouraged those of a parasitical nature alien presences wishing to profit from our abandonment of the real appropriating what treasure we might leave behind they circle i understand i am of course aware of those you talk of it was so with those whose memory i am honoured to represent your flattered mentors and barely required civilisational guides the zihdren whom you claim to represent i do indeed and indeed i do represent them i mean this is scarcely a matter for dispute my provenance and this is a warship another interruption i see a warship patently i must say that i was in no doubt regarding your ship class and martial status the eightstar indefinite range full weapon spectrum gzilt contemporary shiptype you represent is entirely familiar to us things have changed formalities slipped protocols been relaxed this vessel is four point six centuries old and yet has never fired a shot in anger now with most of our kind already gone preparing the way ahead in the sublime we find ourselves defending the disparate items of our abouttobe legacy from those who would use the fruits of our genius and labour to cheat their way further along the path to this point a point that we achieved entirely honourably and without such opportunistic larceny well im sure that does you credit too wait good grief do you mistake me for such a vessel do you suspect i represent such primitive aggressive forces surely not i am a zihdrenremnanter craft the ceremonial representative carrying ship exaltationparsimony iii this must be obvious i have nothing to hide and am transparent all but completely unshielded inspect me as you will my dear colleague if you wish for help confronting those who would steal any part of your legacy you need only ask i rather represent a link with those who only ever wished you well and who to the contrary part of the deception such entities employ is impersonating the vessels and beings of others i am deeming you to be doing so at this moment we have scanned you and determined that you are carrying something which is entirely shielded from honest view what my dear captain you cannot just deem me to be employing any deception that is absurd and as for the only fully shielded substrate within myself that is my cargo my complement of precisely one ceremonial guest our single humanoid expression of respect expected and invited by the gzilt people specifically to celebrate their upcoming sublimation of course this entity bears a message from the zihdrenremnanter to the gzilt which i am not privy to there can be nothing strange unprecedented or worrying about such a thing can there the gzilt have been party to the relevant diplomatic and ambassadorial protocols for millennia without a flutter of complaint a tiny scrap of the real bids farewell to you while at the same time representing those who would most happily welcome you to the sublime there is deceit here something hidden we can see it even if you cannot what are you talking about i am sorry i have had enough of this your behaviour and demeanour goes beyond even the most cautious and watchful warshipnormal and frankly risks slipping into outright paranoia i am withdrawing you will have to excuse me farewell release in full the information contained within the shielded substrate have you put a signal containment around me have you any idea of the consequences release in full the information contained within the shielded substrate i cannot quite apart from anything else there are diplomatic niceties release in full the information contained within the shielded substrate i heard you and i cannot and will not how dare you we are your friends neutrals would be appalled and insulted at such treatment that those who have long thought themselves your friends and allies release in full the information there you see two may interrupt i refuse to do as you ask drop the signal containment around me immediately and should you make any attempt to block or prevent my moving off under contained within the shielded substrate release in full the information contained within the shielded substrate this is outrageous do you are you mad you must know what and who you are choosing to quarrel with here i represent the zihdrenremnant you lunatic fully accepted and accredited heirs to the sublimed zihdren the species many of your people acknowledge as little less than gods those the book of truth itself proclaims to be your spiritual ancestors i must warn you that although i am to all intents and purposes unarmed still i am not without resources which release in full the information contained within the shielded substrate enough goodbye out release in full the information contained within the shielded substrate drop the signal containment around me immediately and desist from jamming my engine fields at once i am about to initiate a fullpower highacceleration pullaway manoeuvre irrespective of your current interference and any damage accrued either by myself or you will be your responsibility not mine the zihdrenremnanter and the zihdren themselves will hear of this act of barbarism do not make it worse for yourself release in full the information contained within the shielded substrate that my drive components have not just exploded thanks to your unwarranted barbarism is due more to my ability to finesse than your brutal use of overwhelming power i am as is now abundantly clear to both of us effectively helpless this is a result and a situation that does you no honour whatsoever believe me i must with utter reluctance and under extreme protest both personal and formal ask whether if i do release in full the information contained inside the shielded substrate within myself you will then drop the signal containment around me and desist from jamming my engine fields allowing me both to signal and to depart release in full the information contained within the shielded substrate and i will be allowed to signal and to depart yes very well here scanned we present the results interesting as you might put it i see that is not a message that i would have anticipated i now appreciate as i am sure you do too why there was a degree of secrecy regarding the contents while it would not normally be any part of my responsibility to make comment on such matters i would speaking personally argue that said contents themselves constitute a kind of apology this is a type of admission even a confession i understand that such accountings are often a part of the business of species and civilisations subliming matters are settled lines are drawn under certain proceedings however be that as it may it was my mission only to deliver this ceremonial guest entity while being kept entirely ignorant of the content substance and import of its message accordingly i consider that i have albeit in most unexpected and trying circumstances discharged my duty and so would ask to be allowed to communicate this bizarre turn of events to those who tasked me so and to withdraw from gzilt jurisdictional space to await further instructions i have held up my end of our bargain and duly released in full the information contained inside the shielded substrate within myself if youd be so kind i now require you to fulfil your promise by dropping the signal containment around me and ceasing to jam my engine fields no the gzilt ship churkun a battleship in all but name kept the tiny alien vessel effectively crushed underneath it as it directed fire from a pair of its closerange mediumpower plasma chambers into the vessel and beneath it beyond it into the emptily glowing blue bowl of the crater facility destroying the ship utterly and blowing the crater facility apart the weaponpulse was so strong it continued into the surface of the planetary fragment to a depth of several kilometres blasting a brief livid tunnel a hundred metres across vertically into the rock a torrent of lava splashed out around the ships outermost protective fields as the tunnel collapsed the spattering cooling rain of molten rock following the pulverised atomised debris of the zihdrenremnanter ship and the centre of the blueglowing bowl as they too flew into the colourwild skies above ablate at the boundaries of the worlds truncated horizon some larger parts of the obliterated dome still whirling away from the initial explosion burned bright as flame as they plunged into the surrounding curtains of light deep beneath its assaulted surface automatic systems sensed the blast and the resulting wobble in the tiny worlds course and corrected for it where the little blue oasis of light and life had been there was now a larger deeper crater glowing white and yellow and red from its boiling centre to its ragged edge by the time the crater surface had cooled sufficiently to show how it would look once it had solidified completely the churkun was long gone of the other ship apart from a new set of already fading folds of light in the skies above ablate there was no trace whatsoever two s at sunset above the plains of kwaalon on a dark high terrace balanced on a glittering black swirl of architecture forming a relatively microscopic part of the equatorial girdlecity of xown vyr cossont lieutenant commander reserve vyr cossont to give her her full title sat performing part of t c vilabiers th stringspecific sonata for an instrument yet to be invented catalogue number mw on one of the few surviving examples of the instrument developed specifically to play the piece the notoriously difficult temperamental and tonally challenged antagonistic undecagonstring or elevenstring as it was commonly known t c vilabiers th stringspecific sonata for an instrument yet to be invented mw was more usually known as the hydrogen sonata the elevenstring was an acoustic instrument usually bowed though occasionally plucked of considerable antiquity and even more notable size standing over two metres tall one metre across and more than one and a half deep it required its player both to straddle it and to sit within it poised on the small saddle forming part of the base of the hollow around which the rest of the instrument bulked like a giant deformed ring the player used both legs to create twothirds of a supporting tripod for the instrument the final third being formed by a single spar protruding from its base like an inelegantly substantial walking stick the first examples had been made of wood though later versions had been constructed of plastic metal grown shell and artificial bone the one vyr cossont owned and was playing was mostly carbon fibre which had long been the most common and traditional material cossont reached the end of one particularly taxing section of the piece and took a rest she stretched her back flexed her aching feet inside her slippers the elevenstring required that its player use two small pedals to tamp certain strings while their heels balanced the weight of both player and instrument and placed the instruments two bows across the front of the little saddle she sat on cossont scanned the skies above the terrace where some streaky pink and orange clouds stood out against the darkening blue of evening two kilometres beneath the kwaalon plains were already night black not a light showing between the last canted cliff of the girdlecity and the far flat horizon a cooling wind moved across the terrace moaning through banister wires whistling as it curled round cossonts flier parked twenty metres away on its own tripod of skinny legs and making the girl herself shiver once in her thin trews and jacket she shifted some windloosened hair out of her eyes and kept gazing up and around a kilometresdistant smudge might be a flock of birds her familiar pyan was probably flying with them playing her eyes strained magnifying the view as best they could she could feel rings of tiny muscles warping the lenses in each eye while other filaments altered the shape of her foveae were those birds and of the right species but the distance was too great there might be a larger dark shape mixed in with the flock but there might not even if there was it might just be a larger bird being mobbed there was probably some local system she could ask to find out and quite possibly one or more of the flock would be augmented or entirely artificial allowing her in theory to interrogate them regarding her familiars whereabouts but she had grown used lately to such systems either not working at all or not working properly like pretty much all systems everywhere throughout the gzilt civilisation from what she could gather and anyway she found it hard to be sufficiently bothered she also knew better than to try talking to the creature at such moments unless there was some genuinely dire emergency pyan in the end was its own being not her property sometimes she wondered if it was even her friend she sighed stretched her arms out and loosely shook all four hands as though trying to free them from something sticky she arched her back again it had become stiff during the last quarter of an hour or so as shed tackled the demanding middle section of the work she stood carefully holding on to the neck of the elevenstring with one hand lifting the two bows with another running a third hand through her hair and picking her nose with her fourth the elevenstring ideally required its player to have four hands it could be played by two people though this required some serious coordination and sometimes fancy footwork and almost all the pieces written for it including the hydrogen sonata could be performed adequately by a string trio plus a couple of suitably tuned basses but to be played as it was intended to be vilabier the youngers most famous composition really required the bodily acoustic antagonistic undecagonstring for four hands and a single dextrous instrumentalist the instrument like the work was near impossible to play acceptably let alone perfectly yet one demanded the other and the great antagonistic undecagonstringists only a handful in the near millieon since the piece was written had allegedly played and even more annoyingly as far as cossont was concerned left recordings of the complete work to show it could be done cossont was acknowledged as a gifted instrumentalist with a particular feeling for ancient string instruments she had been one of the top five volupt players in all gzilt and was now the single greatest though admittedly only because the other four were all stored awaiting the sublime but she was beginning to despair of accomplishing her selfassumed lifetask before her whole civilisation simply ceased to be in the real and she and everyone she knew and loved took rejoicing to the metaphorical skies of the sublime playing the hydrogen sonata once note perfect straight through without a break save for the few seconds between individual movements that was vyrs chosen lifetask it only sounded easy if you knew nothing of either the sonata or the elevenstring as far as she was concerned the subliming couldnt come fast enough twentythree days to the big moment now twentythree days to do all the other things she might want to do before the ultimate enfold or whatever people were calling it these days and still get this appallingly long complicated and playerunfriendly piece nailed to her own satisfaction never mind anybody elses she doubted shed make it she had even started thinking of giving up entirely beginning to agree with those who held that lifetasks werent really about accomplishing anything beyond the passing of time before all such tasks ambitions goals and aspirations became supposedly laughably irrelevant and petty flier she said inspecting the end of one finger flicking it to remove what was on the tip then rubbing her back with the same hand is pyan with those birds she pointed the twoseat flier a chunky little aircraft with stubby wings made a show of waking up turning lights on in the hingedopen cockpit yes it told her through her earbud do you want me to summon it not yet she said sighing again can you send up that you know your that little my minidrone thats the fella keep an eye on it in case its not listening when we her voice trailed off as she swayed from side to side stretching she shook a couple of her hands again tucked the instrument bows under one arm and started trying to push the loosened strands of her hair back into its band weather she asked as a small hatch opened along the fliers dorsal bulge and a tiny version of the machine buzzed into the air turning and zipping off towards where shed seen the distant flock of birds the minidrone was visible for just a few seconds illuminated mostly by the hazy light reflecting from the girdlecitys upper reaches the nearest few hundred horizontal kilometres of which still shone in the sunlight like some vast tracery of silver and gold wrapped across the sky cooling at a degree every fifty minutes the flier told her wind variable but increasing to an average of kmh gusting twentyfive backing westnorthwest cossont frowned gazing northwest across the plains to some far shadowdark mountains then looked back at the sloped cliff of girdlecity behind her the vast structure was a steepsided upheaval of semiexotic metal tubes and facings curved and sweeping walls of synthetic stone dresswork swirled patterns of diamondfilm windows and whole stretched filigrees of carbonblack cabling the entire confusion of pierced architectures rising almost straight up to its bright curved horizontohorizon summit nearly two hundred kilometres above and arguably if not technically in space she did something she had only taken to doing recently when she was on or in the girdlecity she just stood looking waiting to see some movement there wasnt any there rarely was these days sometimes she felt like the only person still alive and unstored in the whole world looking between the various local components of the girdlecity cossont could see sky and clouds on the far side of the colossal artefact perhaps fifty kilometres away the sky was brighter to the south the clouds wispier the degree of through here the proportion of architecture to open air was about fifty per cent meaning that winds had an unusually good chance of blowing straight through that might work she muttered cossont rubbed at her back again the gzilt conventionally possessed the humanoidnormal complement of arms two according to most authorities and the alterations required to provide vyr with twice the average while retaining the desired qualities of litheness and flexibility had meant leaving her with a spine that was prone to seizing up if left stressed too long in the one position mind if i sleep the flier asked no you sleep cossont said flapping one hand at the aircraft as she inspected the elevenstrings tuning keys and machine heads wait till i need you going comms down myself she said clicking at the earbud that controlled the relevant implants the flier switched off its lights hinged the cockpit closed and went quiet and dark alone again in a pocket of silence as the wind dropped and all went still cossont paused for a moment she looked up into the blueblack sky with its tinily pointed spray of stars and satlight and wondered what it would really be like to be sublimed to have gone through with it to be living on this reputedly fabulously and unarguably real other side the gzilt had been living with the idea of subliming for centuries generations at first only a few people had thought it would be a good idea then gradually over time more and more had eventually you had the sort of numbers that would make the whole thing work because to do it properly required serious numbers preferably a whole civilisation in theory an individual could sublime but in practice only solitary ais ever did successfully it took something as complex and selfreferentially perfect as a highlevel ai to have the cohesion to stand up to the sublime alone no normal biological individual could you just evaporated in there it was not utter annihilation all the information you brought with you remained but the persona the individual as a functioning identifiable and distinctive entity that was gone civilisations and the individuals within those civilisations survived and flourished in the sublime over galactically significant periods of time though they gradually changed beyond comprehension that though would have happened anyway had those societies stayed in the real and all the research and comparisons and experts and statistics agreed that there was ordersofmagnitude more stability in the sublime than in the realm of mere matter and energy cossont sighed she had no idea why she was staring up at the sky to think about all this the sublime like some ideas of god or whatever was all around she inspected the end of one of her upperarm fingers the tip was callused with wear from trying to control the strings of the elevenstring the sublime might as well be in the ridges of hardened skin on the end of her finger as up in the sky parcelled rolled compressed and enfolded into the dimensions beyond the dimensions beyond the ones you could see and understand that was where the sublime was and it was a mazelike series of rightangle turns away from this from normal threedimensional reality where she stood on a high platform at sunset thinking about it cossont had a hard enough time really comprehending hyperspace the fourth dimension let alone the next three or four that somehow encompassed the reality and allowed for nested universes to climb away from the universecreating singularity at the centre of things and either circle back round some immense cosmic doughnut to be recompacted and born again or radiate away into whatever it was that surrounded this mindboggling ultrauniverse and the sublimed lay in dimensions beyond even that unutterably microscopic unassailably far away but at the same time everywhere shot through the fabric of spacetime not so much like the individual fibres of this metaphorical weave or their tiniest filaments or their molecules or their atoms or their subatomic particles but pointedly like the infinitesimal strings that made up those that made up everything in dimensions seven to eleven that was where the sublimed lay and that of course was why the elevenstring had eleven strings it had first been designed all of ten thousand years ago but even then people had had an inkling about how all this farreachesofreality stuff worked and artists had thought to incorporate something of these revelations into their own fields including musical composition why the extra internal resonating strings were there as well up to thirteen of them in addition to the ones that could be accessed from the outside of the instrument she still wasnt entirely sure they were a bastard to tune but it was somehow only appropriate to the awkward obstructive character of the elevenstring that despite its name it actually had more than eleven strings the wind picked up soughing across the platform a few hairs blew across her face she tucked them back firmly eighteen kinds of weather of all the things shed heard about the sublime throughout all the attempts people had made to explain what it was like in any meaningful way that was the one detail she could remember it had eighteen different types of weather not one she wasnt even sure what this really meant let alone whether it was genuinely an improvement on reality she took a few deep breaths readying herself to sit within the instrument and start playing but still wasnt quite ready she kept thinking back to an encounter earlier that evening shortly after the flier had brought her here from her home a couple of thousand kilometres away in a part of the girdlecity still partially inhabited to this part overlooking the plains of kwaalon where as far as she knew there was nobody living at all not for tens of klicks in any direction she preferred solitude when she played the elevenstring even before shed opened the cockpit canopy pyan had noticed some birds in the distance and asked permission to go and play with them shed sighed said yes the creature had unfastened itself from round her neck and flapped off shed hoisted the elevenstrings case from the rear seats of the flier gone to open it then on a whim changed her mind told the flier to watch over the case and immediately felt stupid who did she think she was protecting it from and had gone for a stroll in the girdlecity it was dark inside and chilly in most places a few lights would come on automatically sensing her movement or the heat of her body in other stretches she had to rely on her eyes alone nanoenhancement ramping up what little light there was into a grainy ghostscape the air grew colder her jacket and trews slowly puffed up keeping her warm she walked along broad corridors and walkways overhanging deep echoing unlit spaces past arcades and giant pipes girder work and bowled auditoria listening to her footsteps echo amongst the gloom the great worldcircling girdlecity many gzilt looked upon it as something they could be proud to leave behind when they sublimed a monument to their genius vision and power conveniently forgetting that they hadnt actually built it theyd spent thousands of years building on and within the vast structure and had added significantly to it but the original structure and the concept of it had not been theirs at all the girdlecity had been built by the werpesh an ancient humanoid species themselves longsublimed the gzilt had fallen heir to it the planet it braceleted and the system itself along with several other stellar systems eleven thousand years ago but despite their long association with protection of and work on the girdlecity the original credit lay elsewhere still they had cared for it all that time made it their own in some sense and if nothing else had laid down a marker for its guardianship in the future near the centre of what had been a residential area long abandoned she came upon an old school with its cargo of the stored a stacked landscape of barely glowing white boxes registering as a little above ambient temperature were arranged within what had been the playground more gently glowing heat was visible radiating from inside the building itself and the ceiling of the great vault above glowed even more faintly with reflected or convected warmth dead trees stood skeletal a guard arbite near the locked school gates unfolded itself from its resting ball shape and drew itself up to its full threemetre height an exaggerated human shape all glittering angles and obvious weapon pods it looked intimidating like it was supposed to even from a few metres away it gave the impression of towering over her vyr was suddenly aware of how very unmilitary her jacket was it had an image emblazoned on it of a dungchompsmutter band shed played electric volupt for years ago the lords of excrement complete with their colourful if winceinducing logo had seemed a dubious goingonchildish name even twenty years ago yet the jacket had remained a favourite because it reminded her of a good time in her life it was one of the few shed had altered to accommodate her new set of arms citizen the arbite said then must have identified her from some processing she had with her probably her earbud reserve lieutenant commander it corrected itself and saluted just taking a stroll arbite she told the machine it remained motionless seemed to think about this then without another word folded itself back into its resting sphereshape with a sort of metallically oiled grace compacted it looked like a piece of sculpture she wandered on and encountered the family by the side of another great drop where a broad roadway hung over one of the hundredmetrewide openwork tunnels that threaded their way through the girdlecity the man and the woman were huddled round a little fire its light reflecting off the wall of diamondfilm wall lining the roadway good evening she said to them looking quizzically at the fire which was just a small stack of burning logs more cut lengths of tree were heaped just beyond where they sat both looked up at her unsmiling they were dressed for outdoors and looked slightly unkempt cossont couldnt see anything to identify them her implants were unable to sense anything electronic on them either which was most unusual their faces were smudged she wanted to march them both off to the nearest working shower and get them cleaned up evening the man said then looked away and poked at the fire with a stick the woman seemed to be muttering something to herself talking down into her voluminous hiking jacket perhaps she was just on the phone to somebody cossont thought though somehow it didnt feel like she was not if her own implants couldnt find anything to handshake with cossont was about to ask them whether they were wanderers locals out for a stroll or what when a little face peeked out from within the womans jacket stared up wideeyed at her and then disappeared again with a rustle of clothing the woman looked up at cossont with an expression at once wary and defiant it took cossont a moment or two to realise she was so used to thinking of herself as part of the last generation the last people to be born before people stopped having babies she wasnt sure what she was looking at initially a toy had been her first thought you have a child she said taking a step closer to the woman and going down on her haunches her face level with the other womans her hand going out towards her then withdrawing again the woman smiled seemed to talk into her jacket again chuje she said softly say hello to the lady the little face peeked out again a child a real child as far as she could tell maybe four or five years old a girl she looked very serious as she stared at cossont who said hello chuje allo the child said then bit her lip and hid away again within the folds of the womans jacket cossont stared at the woman the man was sitting closer now looking over both of them shes cossont began ours the woman said three and a half pride this time as well as suspicion and defiance the girl looked out at cossont again then still watching cossont cuddled into her mother and was cuddled back cossont sat back her mouth open she tore her gaze away from the deep dark eyes of the little girl looked at both her parents so youre not were not going the man said not going not subliming when the time came in twentythree days from now when the stored all over xown and zyse and throughout every other planet and moon and habitat and ship of the gzilt were roused for their prewaking and the last few hours before the subliming itself cossont knew there were people like these people determined for whatever reason not to sublime along with everybody else and she had even met one or two though shed always thought that they would change their minds when the time came but she had never met anyone who had had a child as well the convention it was not quite a law but it was close to one was that you did not take a child into the sublime it had to be a mature considered final action for a civilisation and the individuals within it who were ready to go who had thought about it fully and had decided they were ready to make the transition the gzilt considered children to be unable to give their informed consent on something so important which meant they regarded taking a child with you as something close to abuse so generally people had stopped having children a few a very few were born nevertheless to parents who still intended to sublime but those making that choice especially with young children were widely treated as pariahs most had retreated to communities of the similarly inclined in distant habs cossont found herself staring at the young couple they were very young she thought maybe ten years younger than her they must have been barely more than children themselves when the child had been born itll be lonely she told them its already lonely the man said the woman said we know at the same time yes cossont said feeling foolish i suppose you know that she smiled apologetically at them shes our future the man said nodding down towards the child cossont nodded wondering what sort of future it would be no other speciesciv would accept that the few per cent of the gzilt who remained after the sublimation would constitute a continuance of that civilisation all the gzilts deserted living places from the home planet of zyse itself to the smallest hab and ship would be regarded as fair game for takeover absorption appropriation xown itself due to the fact it was home to the girdlecity was earmarked for pancultural monument status under the care of one of the galactic councils neutral foundations nobody would get expelled or thrown out of any habitat airlocks but their worlds would fill up sooner or later with others some humanoid some not but all aliens all outsiders you couldnt even delay very long if you did change your mind and decide to go after everybody else the rate of subjectiveabsolute change within the first few hours that people spent inside the sublime was such that leaving it much more than an hour or so was risky youd get there and be isolated those who had made the transition just hours before whether theyd been close friends lovers family identical twins clones whatever would already have become so changed so ascended in complexity that you would have virtually nothing in common youd be on your own or part of a hopelessly small group effectively contextless unanchored to anything greater than yourself and so likely just to evaporate dissolving into the generality of the fabric of the sublime meaningless it was unknown whether this phenomenon was something intrinsic to the exotic physics and other fundamental natural laws of the sublime itself or a rule imposed by those who inhabited the realm and helped enable the transition of people and civilisations various civs had conducted research into the subject and confirmed the effect without pinning down the cause perhaps a little of each seemed to be the tentative consensus which was not entirely helpful were not resist or anything the woman said suddenly she was staring at the flashes on cossonts jacket collar resist were the people who were militant staybehinders holding demonstrations instigating civil disobedience and even now arguing before the galactic council that the sublime was illegal improperly mandated a few groups on the fringe of the resist movement had used violence to try to make their point just civilians the man said cossont nodded again the couple had resigned their ranks whatever they had been it happened it made you poor it was tantamount to taking a religious vow of poverty though being poor in a postscarcity society that only retained money as a sort of ceremonial formality was not so terrible it took only one person of nominally average means to support any number of those requiring alms it also tended to make you an object of either grumbling suspicion or grudging admiration depending the little girl had come further out from her mothers jacket and was staring at cossont now her wide eyes reflecting the flickering orange firelight her hands playing with a small toy turning it over and over in her chubby grubby hands can i hold her cossont said suddenly looking first at the woman then the man no the man said quickly as the mother put an arm round the child as though protecting her from cossont we dont allow that the man continued too many people want to touch her hold her he shrugged she stopped liking it he glanced around the cavernous space they were in part of the reason were out here im sorry the woman said to cossont but kept her arm where it was understand cossont said she smiled as best she could she looked at all three of them smiled broadly at the child then stood slowly i have to go she said best of luck thank you the man said you going that way she asked pointing the way she had come the man looked wary again just shrugged if you are she said theres a store site in an old school combat arbite guarding it shouldnt cause you any trouble but just so youre not alarmed she smiled once more the woman nodded the child disappeared into the folds of her mothers jacket again nice to meet you cossont said you too the man said goodbye take care she told them the woman just nodded cossont turned and walked away into the deepening shadows of the vast construction the pale meagre light of the fire enhanced by her augmented eyes lit the way for a while it might not even be a real child she told herself it might be a sophisticated toy or one of the new artificial children theyd brought out for those who felt the need for a childs company little robots basically a screen programme shed watched had shown one youd have sworn was a real child but wasnt apparently they even smelled right maybe such robots didnt feel right too heavy or too hard to the touch perhaps that was why they hadnt let her hold it the combat arbite came alive again as she passed by it stood again but this time kept silent and just saluted cossont shook her head flexed her shoulders and back one more time then rotated the instrument so that it faced across the freshening wind she took up the two bows and with a single swift graceful movement sat within the instrument again settling her backside and both feet into place taking a deep breath and slowly letting it out as she started playing a few practice scales almost immediately a small gust of wind spilled across the terrace and made the external resonating backstrings stretched down the rear of the instrument thrum quietly the sound not discordant which with an elevenstring was always a bonus some would say a surprise was muffled and quickly died away again with the departing breeze but nevertheless drew an ahha from her as she flexed her double set of shoulders adjusted her grip on the two threesided bows and prepared to play shed try the secondlast section of the hydrogen sonata she had yet to get this right in a single pass it was a tough part and not what she wanted to do but shed never get anywhere if she only did the easy stuff the secondlast section was fast and furious even angry shed think of her mother that might help i mean look at you she looked at herself first just down then at her reflection in the black mirror formed by the blankedout glass wall of the main bedroom unit she shrugged this was a particularly graceful movement when you had four arms she thought what she asked her mother frowning warib just looked at her daughter vyr checked her own reflection again what she could see was a tallish gzilt girl dressed in neat fatigues dark grey skin with shoulderlength pale hair above broader than normal but hardly grotesque shoulders top set of arms a little longer and better defined than the additional set a healthily substantial chest a fashionably defined waist and the broad hips of a nonmammalian humanoid her legs were a little shorter and her back a little longer than the conventional image of gzilt perfection but who cared arguably the fourarm look was all the better for that it sort of balanced her mother made an exasperated noise vyr squinted was there some detail she was missing she was in her mums apartment and so in relatively unfamiliar territory but she knew there would be a proper mirrorreverser unit around somewhere probably in the blackedout bedroom unit where waribs latest lover was apparently still asleep vyr looked at her mother what she said again mystified warib spoke through clenched teeth you know perfectly well she said warib was dressed in a long and elegantly gauzy morning gown that looked impractical enough to be genuinely expensive she was a more willowy version of her daughter with longer and thicker hair physically she was effectively ageing backwards and would do so until they all sublimed her daughter had already passed the age when people usually started to control their appearance but only by a few years and vyr had anyway decided some time ago that she would just get older naturally for the time that she had left given that the big kablooey of transcendent smashingness that was the subliming would be along soon to make this life and everything in it seem irrelevant and feeble and so on and such like shed been mildly astonished that her mother seemed to take her daughter looking older than she did as some sort of rebuke it had been the same when shed become a lieutenant commander shed thought warib would be proud of her instead she was upset that however technically and regardless of the fact it didnt really mean anything her own daughter now outranked her is it the arms she said waving all four beyond warib the view through the windows of the apartment showed sea sliding slowly past her mother lived on a klickslong superliner endlessly circling the enclosed coast of the pinicoln sea within land the single vast continent that made up most of zyse of course its the arms warib told her she grimaced as though shed just tasted something bitter and shook her head and dont try to be funny vyr its not within your reach vyr smiled well i wasnt though that is almost youve always got to try to be different havent you vyr her mother said though it wasnt really pitched as a question look at me look at me look at me she sang with what was probably meant to be sarcasm wobbling her head and doing a little dance well youve taken great delight in trying to embarrass me ever since you were little vyr frowned im not sure i ever formulated that as a specific ambi you started trying to make my life hell when you were still wetting your pants probably more of a happy acci thats what you used to do in fact take your knickers down and pee in front of my guests how do you think that made me look at parties in front of some very important people so youve said more than once but remember i checked the house records and your father and i deleted those they were so embarrassing hmm but the amendments files how can you disbelieve your own mother warib wailed putting her elegantly manicured hands up to her glossily perfect face and letting her head drop forward the tone of voice and gesture were both cues that she would shortly start to screech and sob were the point not conceded anyway vyr said patiently the point now is that how can i invite you to my party when you look like that warib said flinging one arm out towards her daughter and almost shrieking the last word a freak the arms vyr said just to be sure of course the fucking arms her mother roared vyr scratched her head well so dont invite me she said trying to sound reasonable warib took a deep measured breath how she said her voice lowered to the sort of whispered husky tone that indicated vyrs last question had been so idiotic it had scarcely been worth wasting breath on at all can i not invite you when youre my daughter and im supposed to be proud of you her voice started to rise again what will people think then what so i have four arms vyr said gesturing with all of them people used to have two heads or look like octolegs or tumblebush or that was in the past warib told her acidly ancient days no one cares i dont know vyr told her shaking her head i saw a screen thing about that travelling ultimate last party outfit on xown and there were people there that vyr her mother wailed will you listen big airship thing inside vyr found herself silenced by a flash of her mothers eyes nobody warib told her who is anybody does that sort of thing any more she drew in a breath and said carefully its infantile vyr dont you pay any attention to mum im just trying to oh dear god dont call me mum warib said eyelids fluttering closed say goodbye and seeyousoon to everybody and play this piece everybody her mother shouted at her is reverting to classic dont you even know that amendments warib hesitated obvious amendments are out nobodys doing it any more everyones going for human basic as a mark of respect for all the millions of generations that helped get us to this point warib stared at the floor and slapped herself gently on the forehead a gesture that as far as vyr knew was a genuine innovation within the repertoire and so might actually be unchoreographed perhaps even spontaneous this was so surprising vyr came extremely close to feeling concern dear suffering scribe vyr her mother whispered some people are even going back to their natural hair colour she looked up eyes moist nodding vyr stared at her mother outside sea slid past still eventually she raised all four of her arms so am i invited to the fucking party or not warib rolled her eyes glanced behind then fell backwards dramatically onto a plush white couch positioned in front of the staterooms main picture window she lay there and kept her eyes closed while one hand went to her throat and the tiny copy of the book of truth encased in a locket on a thin chain there her fingers patted the flat little piece of jewellery as though taking comfort from it cossont taking a couple of quiet steps backwards while her mothers eyes were closed had noticed warib had grown noticeably more religious as the subliming had approached the best you could say of this was that she was not alone warib shook her head and said quietly resignedly oh do as you please vyr you always do always have come as you wish embarrass me all you like why break the habit of a cossont didnt catch the last word she was already out the door miraculously thinking back to all this domestic nonsense of just a few days earlier with her eyes closed and her mind half wandering vyr got right through the central especially demanding section of the secondlast movement without for the first time making any mistakes shed done it the tangling blizzard of notes had been successfully tackled she was on what always felt like the easy downhill gliding bit now where the notes were fewer and further apart and easier to bridge another minute or so of nothingtoodemanding and shed have the damn thing licked she felt a smile on her lips and a breeze on her face there was even a pleasant thrumming noise coming from behind her courtesy of the elevenstrings external resonating strings and the breeze shed been hoping for she could feel it through her spine and the seat of her pants my for once even the elements seemed to want to wish her well in this ridiculous enterprise she was thinking about opening her eyes when a sudden gust of wind from the other side briefly silenced the resonating strings rocked her in the seat and nearly toppled the instrument and her together she was forced to abandon the stoppedals and plant both feet firmly flat on the ground to steady both herself and it her trews flapped against her calves and she felt her hair come loose again as she was forced to stop playing unbalanced and unsettled the external resonating strings made a noise partway between a fart and a groan the notes faded away and the gust of wind died too but a new noise of what sounded like an engine winding down replaced the elevenstrings music and she felt a sort of multiplethud from the terrace come up through her feet and the supporting spar under her backside she still didnt open her eyes she withdrew both bows in good order from the strings and sat up straight within the o of the hollow instrument then with a single accusatory stare at her flier which was only now switching its lights on again she turned to where all this new commotion seemed to be coming from an eightseat military flier still the colour of the nearblack sky above was settling onto its quartet of squat legs fifteen metres away its bulbous bulk unlit until a waist door flicked down and somebody emerged so senior that even as a nominal civilian in the regimental reserve vyr had no real choice about standing and saluting she sighed and stepped out of the elevenstring clicking down the sidestand at the same time so it could support itself the elevenstring made a very faint creaking noise vyr hooked her slippers off pulled her boots on then stood at attention managing to earwaggle her comms unit awake etalde yueweag commissarcolonel regimental intelligence precise current attachment unknown the earbud whispered curtly as the officer advanced at a trot he took his cap off and stuck it under his arm then smiled and waggled one hand as he approached vyr stood at ease she glanced at her own flier narrowing her eyes a fraction contacted pyan the aircraft told her through her earbud it whines but is on its way fifteen minutes mmhmm cossont said quietly a pair of fully armed and armoured troopers swung out from the regimental flier and stood weapons ready one on either side of the door which flicked closed again vyr allowed her face to register some surprise at this development stay informal shall we commissarcolonel etalde was saying nodding as he arrived in front of her he was short plump and appeared to be perspiring slightly like a lot of people these days he wore a timeto a watch dedicated to displaying how long was left to instigation the very moment assuming that everything went according to plan of the subliming event his was a dainty digital thing which sat on the chest of his uniform jacket and contrived to look a lot like a medal ribbon vyr had one too but shed left it somewhere even as she noticed the commissarcolonels example the timetos display clicked over to count one day less it must be midnight on home planet zyse commissarcolonel etalde looked at vyr taking in her extra arms he nodded yes i was he looked past her at the elevenstring his eyes bulged what the hell is that a bodily acoustic antagonistic undecagonstring sir she told him she was staring over his head as etiquette demanded happily this took no great effort dont say etalde said he looked back to her it yours yes sir he made a clicking noise with his mouth suppose wed better take it with us sir vyr said frowning does it have a case or something he asked yes sir its over there she swivelled indicated the dark case lying on the black tiles of the terrace a few metres away almost invisible the commissarcolonel glanced back towards the two troopers the nearest was already moving in the direction of the case carbine shouldering itself as he or she jogged across the black tiles of the terrace that us etalde asked we fit sir cossont repeated still frowning etalde appeared briefly confused then snapped his fingers oh yes better he cleared his throat then said lieutenant commander cossont you are hereby recommissioned with immediate effect for the duration of the current emergency vyrs frown deepened theres an emergency sort of a secret one but yes cossont felt her expression contort despite herself as she looked down at the commissarcolonel now she said then adjusted her expression and gaze and said i mean now sir so soon before the yes now lieutenant commander etalde told her sharply she heard him sigh and saw him put his cap back on thing about emergencies he said sounding weary rarely occur when theyd be convenient may i ask what what the hells going on etalde suggested suddenly breezy again ask away wont do you any good no idea myself the trooper appeared with the elevenstrings case opened it took all three of them to wrestle it in etalde breathless nodded towards the military flier commsint ais saying youve got a pet or something coming in that right yes sir she told him few minutes out still she went to lift the elevenstrings case but the trooper did it for her hefting it onto one shoulder carbine swinging round from the other were tracking it etalde said as the trooper stepped towards their aircraft cossont stood where she was the commissarcolonel stopped and looked back at her well come on he told her well rendezvous with the creature in the air he smiled faster and my flier sir she asked etalde shrugged tell it to go home or wherever it has to go to lieutenant commander youre coming with us he shrugged orders never heard of it more commonly known as the hydrogen sonata still never heard of it no great surprise sir its a bit obscure renowned the piece yes only as being almost impossible to play not like pleasant to listen to no sir really vyr frowned thinking an eminent and respected academic provided perhaps the definitive critical comment many thousands of years ago sir his opinion was as a challenge without peer as music without merit the commissarcolonel whistled briefly harsh vyr shrugged fair lifetask eh it seemed like a good idea at the time sir in the inkblack skies above the kwaalon plains the military craft decelerated quickly and swung almost to a stop the rear ramp swung down and wind came buffeting and roaring in before a shushfield calmed everything down vyr was strapped into a wall seat between etalde and a third trooper the first two troopers were on the other side of the small cabin with the elevenstring in its case secured between them like some bizarre carbonblack coffin its nearest extremity close enough to cossont to touch an ai was flying the aircraft pyan cossonts familiar which had the form of a square black cape flapped its way in from the turbulent darkness outside bumping into the spongy shushfield and fluttering theatrically to the floor in apparent surprise as the crafts rear door slammed closed and the flier accelerated again oh gracious pyan said on the local open channel as it struggled against the rearward pull it used its corners to heave itself along the floor towards cossont who tapped into their private link and growled stop dramatising and get over here the cape flowed along the floor and climbed up to her shoulders with a little help from etalde and cossont herself it draped itself there as best it could given the straps fastening itself round her neck youre touchy it told her whats all the fuss about anyway with any luck nothing three s the mistake not a culture vessel of indefinite age hazy provenance and indeterminate class but generally reckoned to be some sort of modestly tooledup civilian craft rather than a part of the cultures allegedly still slowly shrinking military resources had been detailed to rendezvous with the liseiden fleet by the clinker sun of ry the result of an experiment carried out by the general systems vehicle that had constructed it decades earlier and not even officially classed as an eccentric the crafts real status had always been moot regardless currently it was seconded to the contact section for the occasion of the gzilt subliming seemingly eager to make a good impression the ship made sure to be at the rendezvous point especially early it had a few dozen hours to wait it circled the husk that was the longdead sun for a while inspecting the tiny barely radiating stellar remnant then darted about the rest of the system in a series of high accelerationdeceleration dashes just for the fun of it really surveying the handful of cold gas giant planets orbiting the cinder slightly too big to be a true brown dwarf the sun had never been quite substantial enough to maintain nuclear fusion for any meaningful amount of time effectively passing straight through the main sequence that defined normal stellar evolution as though it was a barrier to be slipped past rather than a path to be travelled along it had never blazed brightly and after what truncated life it might have had as a true star had subsequently spent billions of years just radiating away what little internal heat it had ever possessed it lay burned out now as cold as its accompanying planets and darker than the galactic skies around it the mistake not could see everything around it perfectly well of course and in exquisite detail able to ramp up any remnant radiations from the failed star itself or the background wash of galactic space or illuminate anything it felt the need to inspect using a variety of its own active sensor arrays and in case all that standard d stuff wasnt enough it was capable of deploying the ultimate vantage point of standing outside the skein of real space altogether looking down on this local patch of the normal universe from either direction of hyperspace but still it missed the starlight there was something comforting about having a vast hydrogen furnace burning millions of tons of material a second at the centre of a solar system it was cheery this was just dull especially in d via hyperspace the ship could see a delightfully attractive supernova filling nearly a thirtysecondth of the sky off to one side but the wavefront of real light had yet to crawl across the intervening gulf of space to get here and illuminate this fateforsaken cinder dull beyond dull and lifeless the whole system even the few deadlyslow species the glacially paced plodders of the galactic community whose constitution and chemistries might have suited the cold and quiet of the local environment appeared to have given both the star and its planets a miss no baskers no sign of seedsail or darclouds or any of the other relevant species that were the cosmic equivalent of subsilt feeders a lonely misfit sun then never quite one thing or the other and remote from its peers the mistake not registered a twinge of affinity with the dead star and investigated that response as well turning over in its mind the bizarre concept of a conscious entity such as itself feeling some sort of metaphorical connection with something as classically boring as easily described and as billionyear venerable as a failed sun the ship was aware that however splendid intellectually refined and marvellous it might be and it was very much of the opinion that it was all of those things and more it would likely still only ever measure its age in thousands of years and for all the stars monotonous lifelessness and sterility it would still be here when it the ship mistake not had gone still life was life consciousness was consciousness and mere classical matter inanimate no matter how longlasting was just ineffably boring and in a sense pointless compared to almost any sort of life let along something that was fully aware of its own existence never mind something as gloriously hypersentient and thoroughly vitally connected to the universe as a ship mind and besides when it had ceased to be as a culture vessel the ship was confident that its being would continue to exist in some form somewhere either at the very least as part of some longslumbering transcorporated groupmind or ultimate of ultimates as far as was known within the sublime which kind of brought it back to where it had come in here the approaching liseiden fleet manifested as a collection of forty slightly embarrassingly untidy warpwakes some distance off the liseiden were fluidics metrescale eellike creatures originally evolved beneath the ice of a wandering extrastellar planet they were at the five goingon six stage of development according to the pretty much universally accepted table of recognised civilisationary levels this meant they were low level involved and like many at that level strivationist energetically seeking to better themselves and shift their civilisation further along its own main sequence of technological and societal development they were a lively creative and uninhibited species according to most analyses and just the tolerable side of the assertiveaggressive line though not above bending the odd rule or stepping over the occasional decency boundary if they thought they could profit civilisationally so not in that regard at least that different from almost every other involved species they were here now to negotiate trade acquire or just plain steal whatever they could of whatever assets plant kit tech or general gizmology the gzilt left behind when they epiphanised in twentythree days time and they had form in this regard theyd done this before with other subliming species which meant they went by another name according to most peoples reckoning scavengers scavenger species it was fair to say were not universally liked or respected by all their galactic cohabitees and that could lead to trouble especially within the heightened emotional atmosphere surrounding a subliming and all the more so when there were other competing scavenger species in the vicinity sharing the same predatory intentions which here there were the mistake not was part of a distributed metafleet of culture and other craft invited into their untilnow jealously guarded space by the gzilt to help keep matters as friendly and civilised as possible while they got ready to do the big disappear normally the martially inclined though generally peaceful gzilt would have had plenty of their own ships to enforce any degree of compliance they wanted within their own sphere of influence especially against people toting the sort of bowandarrow tech a level fivesix civ like the liseiden could muster but these were not normal times the gzilt had chosen to send many of their best ships into the sublime first as though to reconnoitre it wasnt unknown for abouttosublime species to do this but it was unusual possibly a little paranoid and arguably dangerous a little like you had already taken your eye off the target happily according to the galaxywide gossip web that passed as an intelligence network between culture ships there had lately been local rumours of a lastminute deal between the gzilt and at least one of the circling scavenger species probably the liseiden to legitimise and formalise the scavenging process the liseiden were definitely learning these days they went actively looking for this sort of mutually agreed understanding with species about to sublime rather than just piling in like piratical scrappers every time on this occasion theyd even thought to get representation theyd hired a people called the iwenick to be their humanoid face at negotiations with the gzilt this was by general assent a smart move so the liseiden would get the contract as it were and be expected to conduct themselves with the decorum befitting their presence anywhere near such a momentous event as well as behaving with the sort of studied calmness that only came from knowing that what you were engaged in was a dignified and conscientious clearingup and recycling process and not some childishly desperate rulefree scramble for whatever loot could be scooped before the adults stepped in to reimpose order sadly an equally plausible rumour held that perhaps thanks to the pride of the gzilt for too long reluctant even to think of lesser civs pawing over their remains following their departure for better things this had all been left far too late and the other scavenger species already in place within or around gzilt space would refuse to honour any such agreement there was as a result a distinct chance that things might get interesting the ship watched the liseiden fleet crawl closer much further off than theyd ever have imagined possible it had already begun to monitor some of their comms traffic deal with the culture ship well i got a name for this thing yet um the mistake not apparently the mistake not affirmative mistake not what thats all weve got sir thats not really good enough is it not really sir i nyomulde youre supposed to be the culture fanchild of the fleet what have you do you have ah sir the form um the ellipses after the words mistake not imply theres more but its redacted hidden ive had the ai scan the relevant databases and theres there is no more i mean there is sort of generally understood to be more but its like ah its not for public its sort of a private joke between the culture ships the minds a joke its what theyre like sir ridiculous howd this bunch of effete spawnsuckers ever get to where they are well class how about what class is it what are we dealing with here have they deigned to tell us that or is that redacted too ive got it down as a nondefined u open brackets e close brackets sir keep going officer well nondefined sort of speaks for itself u just means unit and e hmm i thought that meant eccentric to be honest sir but some sources hold that it stands for erratic strictly speaking the e should be upper case if it stands for size what size is it in the order of a couple of kilometres though thats just the outer field envelope in the order of best weve got sir i see do we have any idea what it looks like um not really sir no record of its appearance within the field complex boundary there are various guesses but theyre all very speculative one or two spare me officer its a culture ship but we dont know what sort in a pebbleshell yes sir there was a lot more like this all in the liseiden tongue which was made up of a not inharmonious series of bubbly waterbelches the ship added the name nyomulde to the cultures intelligence archive of known liseiden officers immediately transmitting this to a variety of its comrade craft both near and far the liseiden hadnt been forthcoming regarding the identity of the approaching fleets commanding officer or even which ships would make up the fleet in the first place but from the largest ships warp signature hideously obvious from light years away the mistake not had determined hours earlier that it was the gellemtyanasoolanafawaya a collective purposes vessel first class and fleet flagship representing the last word in what the liseiden were capable of building much more satisfyingly from the tone and word choice of one of the individuals talking referencing earlier notes compiled by other culture ships the mistake not was becoming increasingly certain that one of the voices it was listening to was a senior liseiden officer called nyxandabo tyun a male who held the rank of salvage and reprocessing team principal admiral in other words but what babble what toing and froing over such simple operational matters a bunch of dimwitted slowthinking bios swimming in a tub clouded with their own effluent trying to work out what was going on around them by staring through portholes probably it was hard for a ship a mind not to feel at least a degree of contempt and they were still talking out there between the stars as the little flock of ships scraped slowly slowly closer the fleet was already having to decelerate the mistake not noted with some exasperation this would draw the whole process out even further it was only a meetandgreet anyway almost as soon as it got here the liseiden fleet would be breaking up again most of the ships heading off singly or in small groups to individual places of interest within the gzilt sphere only the flagship and a few smaller vessels would remain as any sort of substantive unit this was something admiral tyun himself didnt know yet there were sealed orders in the flagships ai detailing all this dispositional stuff which were only to be accessed on the fleets arrival at the clinker star but which the culture already knew about through a piece of deft signal interception by some other ship or ships tens of days earlier the mistake not found knowing this while admiral tyun did not quite agreeable it would probably tag along with the flagship and its escorts plus it had prepared an eellike avatoid to represent it in person aboard the flagship from what it had been told the liseiden were almost suspiciously keen to welcome this creature aboard it listened in to the animal chatter again good grief they were still discussing its own name the mistake not selfsaddled with a full name so long and unmanageable that even other culture ships rarely took the trouble to use all of it was just vain enough to feel slightly flattered at all this attention but still found the incessant chitchat unbearably slow and fundamentally pointless all these people seemed to do was talk it supposed it was just what biologicals did if you wanted to feel you were still somehow in control of a ship or a fleet or even your civilisation talking amongst yourselves seemed to be the way you convinced yourself of it finally one of them said sir we may be approaching the sort of distance the culture ship can start to read our comms this far out encrypted arent isnt it precautionary principle applies team officer the obvious intership comms traffic ceased the mistake not considered dedicating an effector to the lead vessel to monitor it internally but there was a tiny chance they might spot it doing so a tiny chance increased by the possibility the fleet carried tech filched on earlier scavenging sorties so it didnt hours of patient waiting later the liseiden fleet of large boxylooking ships finally dragged itself into the ry system hauled up into a rather quaint orbit around the clinker sun with the warpengine equivalent of loud clanks and clouds of black smoke and finally rendezvoused officially with the culture ship mistake not effusive greetings of great solemnity and seemingly genuine friendliness flowed in both directions it was while all this was going on and the avatoid eel was being puttered across to the fleet flagship in an antique shuttle brought along specially for the purpose that one of the mistake nots multitudinous subroutines this one charged with deep analysis of recent hs sensor data by opportunistic triangulation following significant movement within any given real space reference frame flagged the tiniest of oddities it was timed originally just over twentytwo hours earlier and it was located some centuries away about a quarter of the distance round the boundary of the rough sphere of stars and space that held the gzilt volume of influence specifically it had taken place within the colossal slowtumbling clouds and wastes and veils of light marking the yamptsferde supernova the pretty one it had noticed earlier whose real light had yet to get here somewhere inside the vast escaping fires of the nebula there had been a microscopic flare of radiation displaying an unusual even anomalous signature spectrum suddenly in proper nononsense combatgrade mindthinking time while the transfer shuttle moved a few nanometres towards its destination the ai cores on the liseiden flagship slept deeply between cycles and the liseiden themselves would have appeared frozen and silent even observing them on a scale of subjective years the mistake not watched the subroutines resulting attentioncascade briefly suck in and focus other computational assetry on the data rapidly producing all the available analysis it was presently possible to compile on the subject the anomaly so faint far away and overwhelmed by the seething turmoil of energies all around it as to be only very ambiguously weaponblink looked like it was centred quite precisely on the artificially maintained planetary fragment called ablate where the gzilt had some sort of ceremonial facility ohoh thought the culture ship four s septame banstegeyn went from group to group taking part in multiple handshakings everybody standing sideon and putting a single hand into a big confused but wellmeaning tangle in the centre sometimes the resulting shake was a trembling muddle sometimes the ball of grasping hands would end up going up and down quite violently as though they were all making it happen deliberately everybody always looked slightly surprised when that happened doubtless this was an example of or metaphor for something or other anyway banstegeyn didnt enjoy the process in fact he hated it he took particular care therefore to look entirely as though nothing he could possibly be doing right now could conceivably give him greater pleasure he was hearty amiable roaring with laughter when he needed to but he had a continuing need to wash his hand or at least wipe it on his robes as though to decontaminate it after all this sweaty touching well this was just one of the many objectionable things that a man in his position had to do in the end it was worth it it would all be worth it well ban its all yours now folrison banstegeyn said forcing a smile as the other junior parliamentarian shook him by the shoulders overfamiliarly banstegeyn thought folrison looked drunk probably was a lot of them were though not him never him and he didnt like being called ban either its all all of ours now i think youll find he told the other man then gestured modestly at his own chest merely a caretaker na you finally got your way youre in charge folrison smiled of not very much for not very long but if it makes you happy he looked away as though distracted seemed to catch somebody elses gaze excuse me he said and wandered off banstegeyn smiled at folrisons retreating back in case anybody was looking though what he was thinking was yes just fuck off sir septame his chief secretary and aidedecamp both appeared out of the m√™l√©e where were you two when i needed you he demanded jevan his chief secretary looked dismayed but sir he said you said would you like a wipe septame solbli said quietly smiling as she pulled a moist square from her satchel and offering it to him discreetly banstegeyn nodded quickly wiped his hands and gave the towel back to solbli lets go he said eventually shaking off the last overly effusive wellwisher from the lower ranks they were able to make it to the doors leading from the stillcrowded main assembly chamber to the senior levels and the terrace overlooking the darkened gardens and the neardeserted city banstegeyn nodded to the parliamentary constable whod opened the door then at the top of the steps leading down to the terrace while jevan and solbli stood respectfully a couple of steps behind had a brief moment to himself before anybody else rushed up to tell him what a historic day it had been his earbud released from the ruleimposed nopersonalcomms restriction of the parliament interior started to wake up but he clicked it off again jevan and solbli would be catching up and would let him know about anything urgent the gardens roundels of paving and splashing pools surrounded by mazelike blocks of black hedges within which it had always been easy to find nooks where quiet words might be had were just starting to look neglected even under the soft subdued lights shining from antique lampposts the city a quaint jumble of low domes and soaring spires gently floodlit but looking empty as a stage set lay quiet and still under a dark clouded sky so late the session really had gone on far too long a handful of aircraft drifted above myon lights winking not long ago there would have been hundreds banstegeyn had long thought of the old ceremonial capital as an openair museum with the parliament its dustiest exhibit it was just that now it truly looked like it anyway myon was not where the real power lay at all that was in the teeming habs the great ships the orbiting manufacturies and the regimental hqs but rather where it had to look like it lay on the terrace the principal knot of people surrounded the president the usefully useless president her cohort of effete trimes a few of his fellow septames and a smattering of junior degans who must have ridden in on somebody more seniors coattails secretaries adcs advisors a few military outright bigwigs and a smattering of accredited aliens made up the rest some of the aliens were humanoid some disconcertingly not the ambassadorial party from the ronte the insectiles who were one of the two scavenger civs the gzilt were actually talking to existed inside heavylooking exosuits like tiny complicated spaceships all alarmingly sharp joints and angles and the occasional hiss and stink of some escaping gas their translators didnt work as well as they seemed to think and it could be confusing to talk to them they tended to huddle on the outskirts of gatherings like this lucky to have a gzilt military attach√© to talk to and even then only because the unfortunate officer had been ordered to do so four of the six suited ronte were resting on their spindlylooking suit legs the other two were floating over a pond humming oh and a few journalists and media people he noted with some distaste even the body politic had parasites it was the last day of the gzilt parliament the very last day it would never meet again anything relevant that needed dealing with from now on would be handled by transitional committees or temporary cabinets the various representatives having made their final farewells would shortly be departing a handful of those local to zyse itself would head off in fliers but all the rest would take ship to be with their families andor loved ones the great majority of them in conveniently distant systems where banstegeyn devoutly hoped theyd be unable to cause any trouble if any difficult decisions had to be made over the next twentyodd days banstegeyn had made sure that he was chair of several of the most important committees and that his people chaired or controlled almost all the rest plus it was tacitly accepted that he would be in charge if there was need of an emergency temporary cabinet which there might be now of course only a very few people knew this at the moment very few but patently at least one fucker too many though it was looking increasingly likely it gave him stomach contractions just thinking about it go he wanted to scream at all of the other parliamentarians hurry up just go be gone leave him and the people he trusted to make the decisions that had to be made it had all got far too close for comfort timewise over the last day or two the remnanter ship had appeared earlier than theyd been expecting and then what had happened out at ablate had already leaked it seemed how the fuck had that happened so quickly if he ever found out whod been responsible bad news upon bad news things crowding in happening much faster than hed anticipated it could all be handled things could always be handled but the handling might get rough well that couldnt be helped the goal was what it had always been a successful sublime his reputation and place in history assured he turned and looked up at the parliament building where the presence hung he could hardly see it in the darkness the presence was dark grey shaped like some highaltitude balloon before it ascended a slightly flattened semisphere curving down via a long pendulous narrowing tail to a point that looked to be aimed straight at the pinnacle of the parliament buildings central cupola it was about sixty metres across near the top and nearly three hundred metres in height that spikelike tip hovered silently just a few metres above the cupolas spire it looked as though somebody tall balanced on the very top of the spire could have reached up and touched it a few of the parliaments floodlights reflected dully off the bulbous nearblack curve beneath its summit it had appeared twelve years earlier on the day the parliament had passed the act that confirmed the results of the final subliming plebiscite setting in train all the preparations for the event a manifestation from the sublimed realm a symbol from those who had already gone before no more than a signpost really not animate or intelligent as far as was known just a reminder that the decision had been made and the course of the gzilt was set it was unmoved and unaffected by wind rain whatever and barely there at all according to the militarys technical people only just more than a projection real but unreal like a shadow falling from another world theyd been expecting it the presence hadnt come as a surprise these things always appeared when a people a civilisation was preparing for and committed to subliming but somehow actually seeing it there had still come as a shock banstegeyn remembered watching the poll figures wobble parliament the media and his own people were canvassing the general population all the time back then and the commitment levels had dipped significantly when the presence had appeared hed worried this was so much what he wanted what he believed in and knew was right what he himself had spent his life working towards and staked his reputation on this would be his legacy and his name would live for evermore in the real no matter what lay ahead in the sublime it was utterly the right thing to do he had known this and still knew this with absolute certainty and yet still hed worried had he been too bold had he tried to make everybody go too soon a decade early a generation even but then the figures had rallied and only grown since the commitment was still there it would all happen he looked away past jevans handsome but slightly vacant face and solblis pleasantly matronlike look of admiration and pride sparing them both a quick smile then turned as he heard footsteps hurrying up towards him septame banstegeyn a historic day another step closer president geljemyn said as the group around her parted to admit him banstegeyn glanced at various faces distributing quick smiles and curt nods of his own there were three trimes yegres quvarond and intyom the full extant set basically given that the rest were stored awaiting the prewaking before the sublime quvarond counted as an opponent intyom was a geriatric nonentity but he was his geriatric nonentity and yegres did as intyom told him six of his fellow septames were also present five his one neutral an only slightly better than average foragainst ratio amongst those left two generals an admiral no press quite a lot of puffiness and glistening skin all round he noticed signs of drunkenness the president still wore her vulgarly cheap little timeto on a band round her wrist he observed it was the sort of thing retailers had given away back in the day shed been gifted many far more elegant tasteful and expensive timetos since but had made a point of sticking with this one it cycled between showing the number of hours left and the days currently it was on days reading s his own example displayed on his chest like a small but important honour was delicately beautiful purely mechanical exquisite in its workmanship and eyepoppingly expensive the almost normallooking ambassador mierbeunes was there from the iwenick representing the liseiden as was the cultures current most senior representative to gzilt ziborlun this silverskinned creature was an avatar of the ancient systems vehicle that was currently gracing the skies of somewhere not too far away no doubt there was a bigger grander much more flattering gsv on its way for the formal ceremonies in the days immediately preceding the subliming allegedly but theyd yet to see any sign of it banstegeyn was also aware of orpe the presidents beautiful adc looking at him as he joined the huddle round geljemyn the girl was trying not to smile too much looking away from him now and again he didnt return the look doubtless many already guessed but there was no need to make things easy for people another step closer madame president he agreed accepting a soft drink from a steward and holding it aloft eternity here we come trime yegres said raising his glass we go to our reward drunk banstegeyn decided the president looked amused much seemed to amuse her it was one of her faults the subliming makes all of us sound like religious zealots she said yegres swallowed looked at the silverskinned being across from him and said im sure our culture friends think weve always sounded like religious zealots ziborlun made a small bow its silver skin looked less unnatural in lamp light not at all it said yegres frowned at it youre very diplomatic he told the creature slurring his words are you sure youre culture in all seriousness ambassador mierbeunes said meaning he was about to say something fatuous flattering or both i have never entirely understood why the book of truth is regarded as a religious work at all he looked round blandly suave as ever smiling it would seem more like that would be because it is the basis of our religion trime quvarond informed him curtly banstegeyn didnt bother repressing his smile hed found the iwenick male annoying while theyd been conducting negotiations now theyd concluded them he was insufferable well in that sense mierbeunes said smoothly still smiling obviously and completely a religious work of course without question he continued to witter banstegeyn had just become aware of a uniform at his side marshal chekwri solbli whispered softly in his ear overriding the earbud cancel she rarely got this wrong marshal chekwri banstegeyn said loudly mostly to shut the iwenick up and turned to greet the commander in chief of the home system regiment the marshal of the first bowed to all clapped her hands gently in front of her may i drag you away she asked him she looked at geljemyn madame president geljemyn nodded if you must she said all yours yegres said merrily dont hurry bringing him back ha ha excuse me banstegeyn said he beamed a smile round all of them though it soured a little when it got to yegres he suspected only orpe would be truly sad to see him go he followed the marshal back up the steps trailed by jevan and solbli when they got inside the marshal turned to his adc and secretary and smiled as she said thank you jevan and solbli looked at banstegeyn who gave the tiniest of nods they looked forlorn as he and the marshal stepped into an elevator when the lift started to drop he looked at the marshal and said what the marshal just looked at him with her tired old eyes in her tired old face and smiled thinly he hoisted one eyebrow then nodded hmm he said more to himself than her there were places under the parliament building few people ever got to see or even knew were there this was one the room was round with concave black walls but was otherwise unremarkable holding a round table and some seats banstegeyns office was bigger and had a better view obviously more of note had been the three metrethick doors they had had to negotiate to get here each of which had swung closed behind them now banstegeyn asked the marshal after the rooms own massive door had thudded shut now the marshal confirmed how bad is it chekwri nodded it is within what was expected we just have more detail choices for action she glanced towards the centre of the room shall we they sat scavengers the other thing what the other thing marshal chekwri confirmed banstegeyn sighed chekwri was one of only a handful of people who knew not counting whoever knew who wasnt supposed to he shivered to think how many of them there might be what detail what choices he asked her the leak was only to the fourteenth the marshal told him he nodded one regiment that wasnt so bad still bad enough would be wouldnt it he said the fourteenth the socialistrepublican peoples liberation regiment to give it its full title had been the most sceptical regarding sublimation from the start even if it too had finally at least apparently come onside who was responsible nobody the marshal told him he looked at her somebody is always responsible he told her she shook her head this was something generated within the mindset or the subsidiary substrate mechanisms of the churkun itself the ship had a oneoff spy youd have to call it a program it was so old and tiny a virus sitting in its computational matrix whatever it was it deleted itself immediately it had been in there since before the ship itself was constructed while the mindset was still in virtual form being testrun by the shipyards technology and processing department four hundred and seventy years ago even then it might not have required anybody within the tech department to plant it could be done from outside and it was doing nothing all that time just waiting for something to come along sufficiently gamechanging to be worth betraying its presence for and nobody found it obviously or nobody who wasnt also a traitor at least banstegeyn said glancing away the marshal frowned i think if we start assuming there might be traitors within the fleets virtual crews we make traitors of ourselves saboteurs at the very least this was something so small in a set of substrates so vast it was possible for it to hide once it was in there no further banstegeyns eyes went wide what about the other ships he blurted the marshal sat back fractionally at being interrupted but said calmly all those still with us are checking now they have a rough idea what theyre looking for its hoped they can either find anything similar or give themselves a clean bill of health within days banstegeyn was appalled days impossible to do any quicker the fleet such as it is these days remains fully operational in every other respect the techs the ships too maintain there is absolutely zero possibility of anything similar taking over any part of the running of the vessels stuff like this can watch and wait and signal if it finds a way but it cant affect and the churkun banstegeyn asked whats it is it returning to the churkun announced its determination to sublime as soon as possible the marshal said nothing more has been heard of it since so either it has already gone or it is still preparing to chekwri smiled humourlessly i understand that the aftermath of battle even a onesided one is not generally considered to constitute the most favourable condition for the instigation of sublimation the pretendedat smile disappeared and kindly keep that secret too septame the ship didnt announce this publicly and wed rather people think its still with us the fleets reduced enough as it is banstegeyn opened his mouth seemed to catch himself then said all right never mind what about the fourteenth we are almost certain the septame held up one hand we an absolute minimum of my best most trusted people know were looking for something not what it is the marshal said its all in hand all working the good the very good news is that we are almost certain the information is held by probably only one substrate in the fourteenths hq and known to a handful of their top brass at most nobody else not yet not yet for how long cant say all we know is they havent tried to share this so far to the best of our knowledge banstegeyn looked to one side and rubbed his fingers as though testing the feel of an invisible piece of cloth of course they might not do anything with it they might just sit on it that is a possibility the marshal said sounding doubtful we could just ask them i suppose he said looking at the marshal and smiling they might even listen to reason we could she said they might she held his gaze kept her expression neutral lets do that then the septame said sitting back the marshals face betrayed the tiniest flicker of surprise though banstegeyn said sitting forward again take me through what else you were thinking of chekwri frowned one approach might preclude the other to ask would be to warn and then any other choice would be closed off what if the septame said one waited to make this appeal to reason until the other choice was available at a moments notice the marshal seemed to think for a moment given the capabilities of the technologies involved especially the potential rapidity of response they possess even a moment might be warning enough to turn a potentially successful action into one that was sure to fail hmm banstegeyn said sitting back again then it would certainly be foolish to give any greater degree of warning wouldnt it the marshals eyes narrowed a little as she said quite what did you have in mind he asked her what does it involve it involves a fast powerful ship a single surgical strike with full endoperator tacticalchoice freedom and in case any further action is required a microforce of just two a highly augmented special forces fieldcolonel and a nonhumanoid combat arbite and this would be in on eshri izenion system banstegeyn bit his lower lip he looked away against our own people who put a piece of spyware into another regiments capital ship nearly five hundred years ago who might have done the same thing to other elements of the fleet and who could if they wanted the marshal let her voice trail off potentially jeopardise the whole subliming the septame said still looking to one side rubbing his lip now he looked at her how soon can we put all this together it already is together septame the assets are presently in transit for izenion banstegeyn widened his eyes are they now i instructed the battlecruiser uagren to depart zyse system for izenion twenty minutes ago it is recallable at any point it seemed rash to hesitate once the materiel and personnel were collated and nothing irresilable happens without your express permission how long until i would have to make a decision the uagrens travel time to izenion is between fortysix and fiftyfour hours depending on whether it flies through or comes to a local stop say fortyfive hours to go yesno on any preagreed action re the former though if theres no further sign of development from the fourteenth hq id advise the local stop that way we have a chance of dealing with any loose ends or unanticipated poststrike outcomes immediately rather than half a day later theres nothing else we can get to izenion sufficiently quickly to provide immediate backup if the uagren commits to a flythrough mission in that case say fiftythree hours to leave time to switch from one mission profile to another flythrough to local stop a decision would be required thirtyeight hours from now that would be your first decisionpoint in thirtyeight hours and if i decide nothing if no decision is made the ship flies straight through izenion system and loops back to return here without taking any action at all good lets leave that as the default for now he took a deep breath so thirtyeight hours fortyfive and fiftythree ill try to remember the marshal smiled thinly obviously we must accept that the usual restrictions apply to committing any part of this to any form of memory other than that we were born with banstegeyn lifted his timeto from his chest and twirled a platinum knob on it i take it it wont represent too great a security threat if i set an alarm he aligned the alarm hand then looked up at the marshals expressionless face she remained silent he sighed let the timeto fall back against his chest really it would be circumstantial but in the event of something going wrong and a subsequent investigation a subsequent investigation banstegeyn said incredulous were supposed to be subliming in he glanced at the timeto twentytwo days one hour nevertheless foolish to risk what need not be risked ill be in touch shortly before a decision is needed banstegeyn sighed and unset the alarm he looked at chekwri this does have to happen you know he said the subliming it has to happen now and completely or not another sigh he felt suddenly tired ive looked at the statistics the sims for a species like ours if theres a stall its likely to take another three to five generations before it actually happens thats he shook his head thats why this has to happen madame marshal marshal chekwri commander in chief of the home system regiment was silent a little while longer then said that is why we will make sure that it does septame five s the caconym a culture limited offensive unit of the troublemaker class spun slowly above the forest of writhing wildly shining loops that was the surface of the orangered star sapanatcheon the ship rotated gently in the midst of the blasts of radiation charged particles and magnetic force coming swirling in from almost every direction though mostly from below where a sunspot the size of a gas giant planet was passing slowly beneath the lou was taking readings and collecting data for what it was worth but really it was just watching admiring the lou was a modern ship with an old mind part of an experiment of sorts to see how that would work the theory was that pairing a capable new vessel with a wise old mind would somehow present the best of both worlds especially for one of the cultures relatively few warships which would be fully expected to sitdriftrace around all its anticipated life doing nothing whatsoever or at least nothing whatsoever to do with what it had been designed for the trouble with this idea as the caconym had been amongst the first to point out was that simulations aside you would never really know how your theory was standing up to reality until the shit hit the intractor when it tended to be a bit too late for rethinks and refits still as one of the ship minds that had been involved at the sharp end of the idiran war a thousand years earlier and not gone into a profound retreat a groupmind or the wilder shores of eccentricity the mind within the caconym understood that it constituted a kind of resource for the culture and grudgingly accepted that it had some sort of responsibility to play along taking its mildly eccentric habits and interests with it into its new home the caconyms mind the caconym basically pursued its strange little hobbies and kept itself pretty much to itself even while remaining on the sort of everlasting standby that culture ships of its kind were expected to maintain just in case it wasnt a hermit culture warships were strongly counselled not even to think of becoming true hermits it kept up in a general sort of way with what was happening in the galaxy and there were always a few respected and responsible ships who knew how to contact it if they really needed to but it had few acquaintances and fewer friends none of whom expected any real degree of chattiness from it and who were quite used to hearing nothing from it for hundreds of days at a time so it was surprised when a message pinged in from apparently somebody being so informal that even many of the usual signal protocols could be cheerfully dispensed with cac chumlet how are you the sender was according to a minimal ration of the usual embedded personal codings and eccentricities of glyphexpression its old friend the msv pressure drop though of course that sort of signal addenda could be copied it sent back along the same signal route pd the same even without the normal protocols it was possible to work out the other crafts rough position through the beam direction and reply delay even after only a couple of signals it looked like the pressure drop was relatively close by only five or six years off practically next door and only a couple of systems away in this sparsely starred part of the galaxy unless the other ship was introducing a deliberate delay into its replies of course in which case it could be almost on top of it the caconym immediately clicked on its track scanner and looked down the signal beam nothing there a few of its internal systems kicking in like an animal flightorfight response flicked off again winding back down i am in every respect excellent as you might expect it replied shall i assume the same of you do still obsessed with them sparkly bits then the caconym relaxed a little more the other party certainly expressed itself as though it was the pressure drop still to get so close before announcing oneself was unusual a more paranoid ship the caconym thought would almost feel like it had been getting snuck up on the signals it was responding to had originally arrived via a beam spread wide enough to encompass the whole of the solar system it was within with the implication that the pressure drop hadnt known where within the system its friend was though it might have guessed near the sun that was where the beam was focused now but to be so discoverable even by another culture ship was if not alarming for a wandering warcraft at least worthy of note my interest in stars their formation development and death ability to harbour and promote life affect empower and destroy all around them and so on remains though obviously i struggle to couch it as poetically as you are you with our friends the fieldliners the caconym had a longstanding interest in and relationship with various of the galaxywide outposts of the creatures who inhabited the magnetic field lines of certain stars no holidaying as of recently magnetospheresurfing for the most part i intend to resume my studies of the inhabitants at a later date not talking to you then of course theyre talking to me we have a highly complex and mutually beneficial dialogue when necessary the question i might ask is why are you talking to me your oldest friend cant say hello without occasioning such suspicion whos suspicious its been so long and youve been so quiet i thought perhaps youd expired without telling me if ive been quiet its because i take my cue from you but yes its been a while ive been busy well indolent the effect is the same ive managed to whittle my population down to a framework crew of the likeminded so all is harmonious so what brings you to this neck of the scrub technically the serendipity of a tour for pleasure like yourself i have discovered a rich seam of autoindulgence in myself during which i had made swinging by your own current location however out of the way something of a priority for reasons which are beginning to escape me i shall endeavour to be more scintillating however there is something which has come to my attention which might interest you and what would that be a matter of potential thorniness it involves the tinywee tuckedaway the vastness beyond vast oh fuck now before you i may have to overwrite those bits of myself i tell you i wish to have no more to do with the promise process or result of outloading instigating subliming enfolding or any other synonym relating to the activity or state of basically buggering off up ones own or indeed anybody elses fundament the sublime the almost tangible entirely believable mathematically verifiable nirvana just a few rightangle turns away from dear boring old reality a vast infinite betterthanvirtual ultraexistence with no off switch to which species and civilisations had been hauling their sorry tiredwithitall behinds off to since the story went the galaxy had still been in metaphorical knee socks the sublime was where you went when you felt you had no more to contribute to the life of the great galactic metacivilisation and sometimes more importantly depending on the species when in turn you felt that it had no more to offer you it took a whole civilisation to do it properly and it took a long long time for most civilisations to come round to the idea but there was never any hurry the sublime would always be there well provided only that blind chance your own stupidity or somebody elses malevolence didnt lead to your outright obliteration in the real in the meantime exactly what it was like in there was debatable very very few came back and none came back less than profoundly altered these few returnees were also seemingly incapable of describing the realm they had left however recently in any detail at all it was wonderful that was the general tone of the vague dreamy reports that did come back and almost beyond comparison literally indescribable the absolutely most splendid wonders experiences and achievements of the real and all those within it were as nothing to the meanest offhand meanderings of the sublime the most soaring magnificent ethereal cathedrals to reason faith or anything else were as mere unkempt and dilapidated hovels compared to the constructions if they could even be described as such within the sublime that was about all anybody had to go on but at least the reports never varied in one respect no one ever came back saying shit its horrible dont go also it wasnt the only choice for a species approaching the end of its active life other speciescivilisations retreated into elderhood becoming almost as dissociated from the normal daytoday life of the galaxy and its vast rolling boil of peoples and societies as the sublimed yet staying in the real but that very continuance within the real galaxy despite the powers and capabilities which everybody associated with elderhood and which the elder races rarely showed any desire to downplay still left you at least theoretically vulnerable to whatever exciting new mix of power and aggression the matterbased galaxy was able to throw up plus opting for elderhood just looked like a sort of failure of nerve given what the sublime realm offered a space of infinite flourishing without threat or danger as far as was known nothing had ever evolved directly within the sublime everything there had started in the real and again as far as anyone could tell nothing that had ever entered the sublime from the real in any viable state had ever entirely disappeared from it to enter the sublime was to become nearasdammit immortal and while there was still talk of difference and dispute and even some form of contention within the sublime there appeared to be no annihilation no utter destruction no genocide or speciescide or their equivalents to the deep and abiding frustration of those in the real who would know more of its past the peoples who seemed to have been in there the longest from the first two billion years or so of the galaxys lifetime say were the least likely ever to reappear in the real and spill any beans about what life had actually been like back then and what had really happened those who had entered the great enfold subsequently had scarcely been any more forthcoming and the few nottotallyvague replies they had given to specific questions had often proved contradictory one way or another so as a research trove the sublime was almost completely useless nevertheless whole civilisations had been making the oneway trip there for all that time there was good proof that even the first to do so were still in some meaningful sense there however much they might have changed and compared to the relative chaos uncertainty and existential shorttermism of the real that represented a fairly good option by most peoples reckoning so a beguiling proposition and a field ripe for studying too if one was so inclined the mind in the caconym which had taken the ships name had been so inclined once no longer the whole enterprise had been exquisitely frustrating and its friend the pressure drop knew this i understand i could of course just shut up withdraw and say no more about it no my interest is piqued as im sure you anticipated what is it annoyingly amazingly the caconym knew that as far as authorities on the sublime went it was one of the few assets the culture or anybody else possessed it kept hoping that some other brave ambitious or just plain selfdeluded souls would take up the sublimeexploring baton and enquire further look closer delve deeper and make some breakthrough it had been unable to make so taking the responsibility away from it and it had tried to encourage informal associations of other minds with similar interests to pursue such behaviour but all such hopes had been dashed almost nobody else was interested it had even dared anticipate that the contact section would form a specialist department to handle such matters and tackle the problem properly but despite having dropped a few heavy hints on the subject over the years this too seemed as far away as ever the gzilt the pressure drop sent mmhmm been talking about the big cheerieo for some theyre actually off too set a date and everything see i do listen to some news hmm thats quite close now not having second thoughts are they not yet but theres been a development the gzilt were a sort of cousin speciescivilisation to the culture nearly founders though not quite they had been influential in the setting up and design of the culture almost ten thousand years earlier when a disparate group of humanoid species at roughly the same stage of technological and societal development had been thinking about banding together amiable enough if somewhat martially uptight due to an unusual social setup that basically meant everybody was presumed to be in a single societywide militia hence everybody had a military rank from birth they had made significant contributions to the establishment and ethos of the culture while it was all still at the beingtalkedabout phase but then almost at the last moment and to pretty much everyones surprise in a way including their own they had decided not to join the new confederation theyd go their own way theyd decided wishing the culture well and taking an interest in it but keeping determinedly apart from it relations had remained friendly throughout and rumours persisted that the gzilt had been helpful to the culture in the idiran war despite a supposedly meticulous neutrality but in essence they had stayed quietly studiously apart from the culture for all that time observing the more rowdy boisterous and interferenceminded behaviour of their onetime associates with a mixture of emotions that might on occasion have included mild horror gasping incredulity and simple shock but also and more consistently a kind of envy and a slowly increasing feeling that a great opportunity had been lost a development odd that word rarely dampens the spirits quite so comprehensively as your deployment of it just there has so thoroughly doused mine what development hurry me onwards if i start to tell you too much of what you already know but there is this tradition that other civs settleup as it were with any wouldbe sublimers shortly before the big event messages of admiration respect and sorrytoseeyougo mixed in with the odd admission that actually were responsible for rubbleising your moon while you guys were inventing the wheel but we were having big exciting space battles with the neighbours or it was us what nicked your first space probe consider yourself hurried the caconym sent sorry also a pity my third example was particularly witty and amusing but no matter anyway the gzilt have this relationship one might as well call it with the also departed zihdren this relationship capacitated as it were through the gzilt book of truth yes the holy book that only gained in credence as science developed indeed unique so contributing to the cult of pernicious exceptionalism as exhibited by the gzilt so caustic some truths hurt more than others frankly i thought i was being kind the word exemplified might have replaced exhibited in the above without too great a stretch i think i already dislike where were headed with this by the way but go on one of the things that has always made the gzilt feel so special so marked out has been the fact that their holy book pretty much alone amongst holy books turned out to be verifiable at every stage of their development it predicted the future the caconym interrupted watching carefully for how much overlap there was between the two signals only of technology but even so that was interesting the signals from the pressure drop implied the ship was curving away as though it had been heading almost straight towards the caconym until not long before it sent its first message but was now beginning what looked like a tightaspossible highspeed turn after a period of significant acceleration are you gauging my speed and direction of course i am you could just have asked im running a maxmin turn for gzilt space thats sixty days away wont it all be over by then fiftyfive days away ive upratioed my engines over the years but the point is you never know were you listening to all that stuff about the gzilt holy book of course the book of truth the gzilt holy book had been delivered by meteorite during their dark ages following the collapse of a great empire which had been laid low by a combination of barbarians disease and economic and environmental collapse a subsequent meteorite bombardment had made things worse and convinced many gzilt that their gods if they even existed had turned against them it was during this time of tribulation that the scribe briper drodj a disgraced ruined trader from a fallen aristocratic family with classical military connections allegedly found a set of inscribed slates inside a meteorite and published them adding to them later as he had dreams that seemed to follow on from the texts these slates were kept secret and either disappeared or were destroyed in a temple fire started by unbelievers this particular incident led to the militarisation and evangelicalisation of the book of truth religion briper drodj and his generals then masterminded a series of spectacular conquests across the single great continent that made up almost all of the land area of zyse eventually subduing and converting all the other tribes nations peoples kingdoms and empires until they had effectively taken over the world the scribe briper drodj later disappeared in mysterious circumstances allegedly when he was on the brink of announcing a whole new set of dreamrevelations there had been tensions within the hierarchy of the church by this time and cynics would later maintain that the newly proliferating upper echelons of his supporters disappeared the scribe to prevent these mooted neverbroughttolight additions to the word reducing their own power though nothing was ever proved and by general consent there was a feeling that briper had quite entirely done his bit his place in history as the greatest ever gziltian was absolutely assured and in a sense it was time for him to enter legend rather than say stick around past his time and start making the sort of embarrassingly besidethepoint pronouncements old men were all to prone to coming out with up to this point the story of the gzilt and their holy book was to students of this sort of thing quite familiar an upstart part of a parvenu speciesciv gets lucky proclaims itself special and waves around its own conveniently vague and multiply interpretable holy book to prove it what set the book of truth apart from all the other holy books was that it made predictions that almost without exception came true and anticipated phenomena that nobody of the time of briper drodj could possibly have guessed at at almost every scientifictechnological stage over the following two millennia the book of truth called it right whether it was on electromagnetism radioactivity atomic theory the cosmic microwave background hyperspaciality the existence of aliens or the patternings of the energy grid that lay between the nested universes the language was even quite clear too somewhat opaque at the time before you had the technological knowledge to properly understand what it was it was talking about and you were reading but relatively unambiguous once the accompanying technical breakthrough had been made there was in addition the usual mostly sensible advice on living properly and morally along with various parables and examples to help keep the gzilt on the right track but nothing exceptional compared to other holy books either those from the gzilts own past or that of others the predictions were what made it special and had the effect of causing the book to become more convincing and remarkable as technological progress continued there was space stuff in there too those behind all these imparted revelations were named the zildren and described as wraiths of light the zihdren were a vacuum basker species and this was actually a fairly accurate portrayal of what they looked like to the humanoid eye they were also described working through their material mechanicals again close enough to describing the reality of the robotic selfextensions the zihdren used when they wanted to work within the material aspect of the real more challengingly and perhaps more the prophets doing than anything he might have found on the original slates had they ever really existed the book further insisted that the gzilt were a people favoured by fate by the universe itself as part of an ongoing thrust towards a glorious transcendent providence they represented the very tip of a mystical spear thrown by the past at the future the shaft of that spear being formed by a multitude of earlier species which existed before them and kept on serially handing on the baton of destiny to the next slightly more exceptional people ahead of them the zildren the book declared were the last handerson of the baton the final stage of this rocket ship to the sky that would put the actual payload the gzilt into the glory of eternal orbit even after the gzilt achieved genuine space travel artificial intelligence insight into hyperspace and contact with the rest of the galactic community and discovered that there had indeed been a species called the zihdren around at the time the book of truth had come to light though they had since sublimed that belief in their own predestined purpose and assured distinctiveness had persisted and it was arguably that imperturbable sense of their own uniqueness that had prevented them from joining the culture all those thousands of years ago so the pressure drop sent the bot provably gets so much right insists that the gzilt are special destined for something singular fabulous and epochshaping yet once the gzilt get to a certain stage of development the book effectively falls silent with nothing further to predict and becomes just another dusty text to be filed with the rest while the suspicion grows amongst those not utterly credulous that while the zihdren may indeed have had a part in the book and were certainly a reputable and constructive part of the galactic community of their time they were hardly exceptional just another banally evolved species hustling along as best they could within the convection cells of the galactic soup cauldron if exotic in their immaterial nature by humanoid standards who eventually ended up in the great retirement home of the sublimed like everybody else maybe the gzilt should have swallowed their pride and joined the culture when they had the chance or perhaps they seek their own subliming as a consolation i hadnt finished you interrupted again you were wittering again anyway there is indeed evidence that the gzilt believe their own presence amongst the sublime will somehow change things dramatically for the better there ha i thought that might precipitate a response however to continue also that they wilfully against all evidence regard subliming not as retirement but as promotion ha again so matters are set up as they are and the gzilt are on the very brink of the big outloading when along comes a zihdrenremnanter ship with a guest for the festivities bearing a message that is basically a confession of what exactly of exactly what i have not been told but i think we can guess mistake accident prank deliberate interference something like that only the message does not get through the humanish guestentity is never delivered the ship is intercepted the remnanter ship is destroyed destroyed profoundly so that is bold or desperate and how do you know all this theres been nothing in any report its recent few people know and none of them thought it in their interests to go public our remnanter friends asked me to contact you as somebody theyve had dealings with in the past regarding the sublimed especially the zihdren even so to what end what am i supposed to do two things one form part of an advisory group with myself to handle whatever may come of this from our point of view two use some of your contacts to help clear up whats going on here have we been asked by the gzilt to do this good grief no for now its best they know nothing given that they or some faction within them appear to have instigated hostilities then why are we even thinking of getting involved well arguably we owe the gzilt some care and attention just on general principles not to mention consideration due to their honorary fellowtraveller culture status but more to the point the zihdren message to the gzilt mentioned an individual a human from the first generation to think of themselves as culture citizens he was around ten thousand years ago at the time of the negotiations which gave rise to the culture in the first place this individual was named as perhaps being able to help provide proof that what was claimed in the message to the gzilt was actually true so not long dissolved in some groupmind then stored i take it not stored in fact never stored still with us still alive still extant and functioning twentyfive to thirty full lifetimes after youd have expected any ordinary humanoid mortal to have decently abandoned the corporeal indeed longerliving than any known still independent mind or even highlevel ai from the time like the fuckers decided to outlive everybody or set a record or something but alive somewhere probably still within the culture seriously no kidding no i refuse to accept this this is a myth one of our myths romantic nonsensical a wish desired but for ever without proof nevertheless our remnanter chums seem to think this geriatric geezer is still with us being loosely attached to a civ longsublimed does not make the zihdrenremnanter infallible or even necessarily reliable their record in such matters is good though ive spoken with a few fellow minds about all this and it is reckoned the information must be taken seriously also that you should be a member of any advisory group part of the tacticalstrategic oversight team what do you say i imagine im meant to be flattered being so invited but why dont these few fellow minds of yours perform this function they feel more comfortable in the wise village elder role advising not the positions you and i are being offered suggesting actual courses of action i imagine some energetic and very intense simming is going on ive already started my own and who are they anyway not yet at liberty to say ill tell you if you sign up promise what really is at stake here and what are the chances that should this prove important or just interesting we wouldnt get bounced by some other collective the itg to name but one at stake is the smooth subliming of a cousin speciescivilisation and the potential chaos of a partsublime complicated by the presence of a variety of scavenger species not to mention the cultures good name as an honest broker as for the interesting times gang they have been silent for nearly half a millennium several are believed to be in retreat and at least one has itself joined the enfolded there is a feeling amongst the minds taking a particular interest in these matters that the itg has stepped down or at least back the whole excession thing nearly went very badly wrong and only just came out okay in the end as much through good luck as good guidance and anyway was still arguably a failure a catastrophe was averted but an opportunity was squandered and in the end we are no further forward regarding insights into travel or even communication between concentric universes they may have decided to quit while they were ahead or to bow out gracefully after an at best modest achievement that in certain lights might even be regarded as an embarrassment maybe they just felt they were getting old and out of touch in any event no new standing ensemble appears to have replaced them and only adhoc groups have handled unusual matters since its our move old chum the caconym was silent for a few moments it watched a small solar flare erupt from near one side of the sunspot over which it had stationed itself another tendril of the stars gaseous shrapnel ejected by an earlier outburst of the furious energies erupting for ever beneath it and thousands of kilometres across and tens of thousands long washed over and around it bathing its outer field structure in radiation and delivering a distinct physical blow it allowed itself to be gently buffeted by the impact using its engine fields to adjust its apparent mass and so increasing its inertia so that the effect would fall within acceptable parameters while observing the outermost elements of its field structure deform inwards by a few micrometres under the weight of the blast the effect of the colliding gust of plasma was to send it drifting very slightly across the face of the sunspot spinning slowly finally it sent why do we bother with this sort of biotangling stuff in the first place we could live lives of such uncomplicated joy if we left them to their own sordid murderous devices because it pleases us its a challenge we could sublime too but we dont do that either come on we have a reputation for enlightened interference to protect here yeah thats us first amongst the altruists the emperors of nice were not competitive about it but if we were by fuck wed be the best most amusing yes my fields expand at the mirth of it all very well i may regret this but all right ill take part and use those contacts with the sublimed if i have to even more reluctantly yes hurrah welcome aboard heres a diaglyph with the situation any thoughts the data was lush with detail a factcrammed welter of information leavened with analysis and speculation there were pointers towards standard concise histories of all speciescivs involved for those who hadnt been paying attention earlier more incisive less polite contactproduced essays on the societies and personalities involved plus a comprehensive summary of all recent developments their possible explanations a statistical breakdown of multiple alreadysimmed likely futures and an exhaustive minutely annotated multidimensional comparison of this situation with those of any pressing similarity in the past with another spread of likely outcomes relating thereto plus the positions and specifications of all known capital and other major ships in the volume or inbound this did have the look of something blowing up alarmingly quickly the caconym thought the mistake not had been the first to flag up something amiss when it had spotted the weaponblink from ablate communicating this to its home gsv the kakistocrat which had been cautious enough to pass this on to a select few of its peers including the pressure drop rather than broadcast the news the message from the zihdrenremnanters had gone straight to the pressure drop less than an hour later no hint of who or what had been responsible for the destruction of the remnanter ship two principal scavenger species present the liseiden and the ronte it would be tidiest and least alarming for all concerned if one of those had been responsible for the attack on the remnanter ship but that looked impossible even if the remnanter ship had been unarmed the tech levels were just too far apart the caconym didnt pretend to take any appreciable time to review the totality of what it had been sent the old desert class currently hanging around zyse it sent yes the venerable msv passing by and thought id drop in there to represent us guys until the cultural big guns get there in the humungous shape of the systemclass empiricist currently zysebound though delayed by a smatter outbreak en route the passing by has been informed there might be a minor situation developing though no action yet required the empiricist is still in a state of blissful ignorance the passing by has two thugs with it as escorts dmvs demilitarised vessels is such old terminology dear thing theyve been called fast pickets or very fast pickets for a long time now but yes the exthugclass rapid offensive units refreshingly unconcerned with the vulgar exigencies of veracity and value judgement if youre thinking about those as immediately available military assets though i must disappoint you they both really have been fully defanged theyre not that justpretend kind of ou described as weaponfree to keep the locals happy while actually toting gear of serious cloutage sadly still have a word those three ships have a long association a lot of the desert class were discomfited at being demoted from general to medium and like myself the mind in the passing by is old also the thug deweaponing was done aboard it keep going old equals sneaky and prideful sometimes tell the passing by what has happened suggest to it that if it did just happen to have the weapon clusters taken out of its escorting thugs to hand it should get both ships back aboard and fully retooled immediately just checked that stuffs not aboard the desert absent from both the relevant cargo manifests and registered materiel declarations ask it all the same it might be hiding the gear thatd be a bit cheeky and anyway on a desert class theyre tiny thats why they got demoted theyre over three klicks long and boxy and the principal weapon cluster on a thug is less than thirty metres in diameter also there isnt a desert class extant that hasnt altered its internal layout umpteen times over the millennia just to suit operational happenstance or to amuse itself i bet most of them could find places aboard themselves to hide sufficient ordnance to equip a fleet if they looked hard enough or could be bothered signal duly sent the beats working with the ronte genuinely civilian completely and genuinely tiny eighty metres we had missiles bigger back in ye olden days and this eccentricerratic the mistake not is there any data on its throwweight i cant find anything official seemingly not thats sort of the idea apparently estimates of its puissance by enthusiastic amateurs vary wildly but indicate something close to my own disclosed capabilities the caconym had resorted to consulting documentation drawn up by the sort of people who took an informed interest in culture ships im sure one of you ought to be flattered hmm i think even by our relaxed standards it is a little absurd that one warship needs to look up what are essentially fansites for an estimate of a comrade vessels clobbering capacity think it could be sc possibly special circumstances possibly just congenitally inscrutable scs ongoing attempts to corner the market in deviousness have yet to come to fruition lets try to find out how on board it is and ask what its toting agreed its contact is the gsv kakistocrat which certainly used to be sc though it claims it long since settled for a quieter and more contemplative life signal sent there are these delinquentclass gou twins the headcrash and the xenocrat aboard the empiricist lets give them a sniff of potential action in gzilt and suggest it might be worth a little engine degradation to get there asap theyre engaged with this smatter outbreak at loliscombana its all gone a bit targetrich could be hard dragging them away from the fun targetrich but challengelight theyll be bored by now swear them to secrecy and tell them somebodys seen fit to waste a remnanter ship that should get their attention and hint the situation is unlikely to stop there no need theyll draw their own conclusions better to let them persuade themselves than feel theyre being manipulated copy in the empiricist cant have it getting upset contacting we do ah seem to be concentrating very much on the military side of things thus far im a warship i always was why what else did you have in mind talking to somebody relevant might be a good idea this banstegeyn fellow looks to be the player with the power at the moment the regiments would appear to contain almost all the potential energy with the politicians providing the dynamic gzilt society had cohered millennia ago into a stable democratic system that formalised a purely ceremonial president at the top with no real power a few almost equally figurehead people immediately beneath him or her then successive layers of exponentially greater numbers and increasing political power until you reached the general mass of the population individual people this power structure lay alongside the gzilts universal militia arankforall military structure without apparent discord commentators and analysts especially in the culture seemed to find this mystifying but pleasing the consensus was that the ubiquitous military had no problem always conceding to civilian command because in a sense there were no civilians it seemed perverse to some but for all their apparent militarism the gzilt had remained peaceful over many millennia it was the avowedly peaceful culture that had within living memory taken part in an allout galactic war against another civilisation military aside in practice over time the balance of effective political power had settled somewhere between the one hundred and twentyeight septames the third level down and the fourthousandplus degans immediately beneath them with the balance tipping towards the septames over the last few generations as the idea of subliming had taken hold no machines involved in all this nominal rather limited democracy the ship noted minds and ais in the gzilt dominion were regarded either as mere tools without rights or as housing for the uploaded personalities of exhumans even their warships were commanded not by true individual minds but by virtual crews of deceased or copied biopersonalities running on highly sophisticated and very fast substrates it seemed to work and gzilt ships were highly regarded approximately equivtech by culture standards but it was a roundabout way to get to a desired state of ability and if there was ever a proper fight between otherwise equally matched gzilt and culture craft perish the thought culture minds were in no doubt it would be a very lucky gzilt craft that prevailed though doubtless the caconym would be prepared to concede the gzilt would have a rather different take on the subject of the regiments it sent the fifth and fourteenth seem to have been the most dissenting regarding subliming even though they are officially both fully on board now if we accept the attack on the remnanter ship was an act underwritten by those within the gzilt majority establishment wishing to ensure subliming takes place might one or both of those regiments be involved on the other side in some way this might tie in with the sighting reported by the passing by of something speeding off from zyse fifteen hours ago izenion bound where the fourteenth has its hq if its going direct even at the best of times the societys internal tensions are largely sublimated into highly complex and rulerestricted turf wars between the regiments highlevel internaldiplomatic games essentially most likely this single sighting is part of those continual manoeuvrings theres been no hint that anybody else within gzilt knows about the attack on the remnanter beyond those who might have set it in motion none that i can see you hmm no none though we might ask the passing by to be a little more nosy regarding gzilt military comms traffic and any other unusual ship movements prioritising discretion above zeal of course and as we have the desert class in gzilt with its two thugs and the delinquent twins incoming with any luck then if there is nothing else to go on it might be worth getting something to izenion before or as soon as possible after whatever left zyse for izenion arrives see if the passing by can extract more data from its readings ill have a word also that smatterage at loliscombana delaying the empiricist was there any hint or precursor of it before the gsv published the part of its course schedule letting everybody know it would be passing that way none mentioned ill investigate its a systemclass of course those behemoths usually schedule years in advance so thered be plenty of time to set something up you think the smatters not a coincidence some things just are you know i do know it depends on whether this is something being extemporised as unexpected events unfold or a longthoughtout plan being unrolled but what one might call natural smatter outbreaks almost invariably have precursor events if there are none for this one then eyebrows amongst those who possess them might need to be raised time will tell it usually does i think thats all for now though you did promise me the names of the other ships youve been talking to about all this of course the gsvs contents may differ and just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry and the gcu displacement activity thank you all sound in my estimation though whether they would return the compliment is another matter my pleasure ill let you know any more there is to know as it comes in till later yes later the caconym sent the connection clicked to silent and the ship was left alone with its own thoughts again it felt and watched the buffeting wisps of the solar flare as they washed past it staring down into the vast slow pulsing storm of the sunspot already half lost in its wild and stately beauty it thought about the framework crew of the pressure drop the caconym had no biocrew of its own culture warships rarely did these days but the mind had had once in another incarnation as another ship those on the pressure drop would be humans mostly it imagined mongrelculture the result of a hundred centuries of speciesmixing serial amendment augmentation uploading downloading simple autonomous choicedirected breeding and after all that time perhaps even some genuine evolution the usual bizarre biomix of whoknewhowmany planetaryoriginal bloodlines all tangled inextricably together with those from an equally unfathomable number of others boosted with genetech aug dashes of chimeric and a hint of some machine in there too depending and it didnt doubt that every single one of them would find it absolutely fascinating to stare into a fire even if that was one thing they were unlikely ever to encounter on a ship the urge would still be there though stored inside waiting shown the stuff theyd stare mesmerised the entirely standard humanbasic fascination with fire bogordinary flames for them just an oxygen reaction lasting minutes or hours while for it it was the multibillionyearlasting thermonuclear fury of a planetswallowing star burning off a million tons of matter a second but still shit the ship thought most ship epithets like almost all bioepithets involved bodily functions it started elongating one long loop of its external bumpfield and expanding the outer reaches of its main field enclosure at the same time so that it was both pushing against the mass of solar material beneath it and using the blast of radiation and charged particles as the wind in a sail that quickly grew to the size of a respectably proportioned moon the ship rose spinnakering away from the star already gaining speed in real space as it flexed its engine fields and reached deftly out to the energy grid in the space between this universe and the slightly smaller one only a few seconds or so younger nested within it you had to be careful engaging engines so far within a gravity well as pronounced as that around a sun but the caconym was confident that it knew what it was doing it spun slowly about while it drifted then gradually powered away from the star snapping its external fields tight and preparing for extended deepspace travel as its engines powered up further and increasingly bit harder into the grid that separated the universes i suppose i ought to follow it sent just in case like you say a tiny dark speck against the vast ocean of fire that was the star it set a course for gzilt space pitching and yawing until it was pointed more or less straight there continuing to ramp up its engines as it flew away from the light race you the pressure drop sent the caconym could already feel drag the effect of its velocity in real space observed external time was starting to drift away from what its own internal clocks were telling it and its mass was increasing both effects were minute but increasing exponentially elements of its field enclosure were already poised for the transition to hyperspace and release from such limitations ill win it replied it vanished from the skein of real space less than a second later hurtling into a quickness beyond night six s a ship dance was required ronte fleets flew in formation at all times even in time of war when such patterns through dispositional predictability might be contraindicated however much that was contraindicative might equally well be regarded as a challenge correctly formulated accordingly it was incumbent upon a fleet in the appropriate circumstances to come up with better patterns formations of such subtle elegance their mathematical and topological underpinnings would remain obscure to the enemy until it was too late accomplished correctly this could even constitute a powerful additional asset as the computational power required by the enemy vessels to perform this analysis robbed them of resources better directed towards other aspects of the engagement ronte ships closely resembled the beings which inhabited them the ronte were decimetrescale insectile creatures sleek darkly iridescent fluiddynamic compact and yet with great reach when required their ships were as beautiful as they their hulls blazed with swirling iridescent patterns of astonishing variety complexity and precision even the addition of field enclosures long resisted by traditionalists but necessary for the exploitation of the most sophisticated forms of rapid interstellar travel had only added to their great beauty the fields themselves hardly altering the overall shape of the vessels due to their intrinsic concision and in addition in some ways resembling multidimensional wings unfolded and spread ronte fleets in flight frequently changed their formations or topologically warped a single formation due not to concerns regarding surprise attack but for the joy of it there was joy in complexity movement change on entering a new environment a ship dance was required unless the circumstances were so fraught that to perform one would cause operational compromise for example in time of war when the delay or distraction involved could be counterproductive entering the volume known as gzilt space constituted formally entering a new environment even though there was no obvious wall barrier demarcation line or other signifier beyond carried navigational data to show that a frontier had been crossed this was entirely normal in such circumstances accordingly the fleet drew to a local stop halfway between the stellar systems of barlbanim and taushe and the ship dance glowing nymphs dance ascending and descending in the light of an alien sun was performed the dance had hardly been completed when the fleet was contacted by the culture ship beats working it congratulated the fleet on a beautiful dance perfectly executed some initial consternation was caused by this as the more rapidresponse elements of the fleets serially augmented ai components reacted this was because while they were familiar with the capabilities of culture and other level eight ships they did not possess running knowledge of the likely intentions of such vessels and assumed hostility hostility was assumed due to the lack of warning before the reception of the message additionally a further obvious imbalance was represented by the alien ship apparently being able to observe the fleet while the fleet had been unaware of the whereabouts of the alien ship stored knowledge components prevented any escalation of alarm turning into armed response even before executive oversight might have been required giving due weight to earlier briefings it was briefly contemplated that the culture ship might have been exhibiting sarcasm when it had congratulated the fleet on its dance and in addition certain components theorised that the ship could know nothing of what constituted a well or a badly formed dance however further analysis confirmed that statistically politeness was significantly more likely than sarcasm in the circumstances and that the culture fleets andor individual vessels seemed to possess widely distributed knowledge and appreciation of all aspects of ronte ship dances the culture ship requested permission to approach this was given the fleet took as marks of respect both the fact that the request had been made and that the vessel did not approach deadon as though in aggressive display or outright attack but arrived tangentially heaving to some tens of kilometres distant from the outer elements of the fleet the culture ship proved to be a tiny thing of just eighty metres in length it did not trouble to use its outer field enclosure to mimic a larger ship as might have been expected historicalanalytical components of the fleet confirmed that this was not unusual with culture ships and that the vessel although small and alone and so from first principles obviously potential prey could not be so regarded this was set out in standing allfleet orders the culture ship had a humanoid crew of five it was a limited contact vessel scree class its lack of substancevolume also did not constitute any sort of insult to the ronte probably its name was not to be taken literally and was more a kind of signifier of its relaxed or laid back nature a quality shared by both the culture fleet and culture civilisation in general ossebri haldesib a seventeenthgeneration swarmprince was subswarm divisional head fleet officer in charge aboard the flagship melancholia enshrines all triumph he had been in oversight command at all times since before the ship dance was performed and duly extended personal ship hive fleet swarm and civilisational greetings to the culture craft and the civilisation it represented as well as to any and all relevant substructuressystems in between the culture ship was at all points polite diplomatic and respectful and had already begun to accrue inferred alien cachet value positive honorary fleet orders indicated that due to earlier bafflement issues mostly involving parties other than the culture this information need not be shared with the alien vessel but could be at the discretion of the relevant fleet officer in charge ossebri haldesib duly determined to consider this and accordingly put some of his best peoplecomponents on it had he done the right thing it was so hard to know banstegeyn felt the drug pulse through him just as he pulsed through the girl that was what it felt like in through beyond amongst within whatever the bed beneath him was a live thing taking part caressing brushing sucking warming cooling penetrating itself pulsing this had been a present to her from him he had made sure that it was keyed to his own genetic signature so it wouldnt work for anybody else he had told her this too so that she knew from the start she claimed that such shows of determination and leadership especially in such a personal context turned her on and so it suited both of them had he done the right thing marshal chekwri had been in touch again fresh intelligence indicated that the target might be even less well defended than they had at first assumed the fourteenth had already sent most of its capital ships into the sublime apparently half expecting them to pop straight back out again full of scepticism and entirely of the opinion that this subliming nonsense might be all right for lesser civilisations but wasnt for the gzilt they had however stayed recently the disposition of the regimental fleet had changed again and the izenion system had been left only lightly defended it all meant that the balance of which actions and profiles might ensure the best outcome had shifted he had been happy not to have to make a decision at the first thirtyeighthour point they had more time now unless circumstances changed again the ship would still attack while flying past but would be able both to lay down a fuller pattern of additional munitions and return much more quickly than if it had attacked at full speed he had in turn allowed her to pursue some of her own little fantasies also involving domination but he hadnt enjoyed them and had told her so she had expressed surprise thinking that most politically powerful aggressive men secretly harboured a desire to swap roles and in a safe controlled entirely secret context be dominated he had told her this reassuring softcentre theory was nonsense some males were just strong all the way through was he doing the right thing people would die there was no getting away from this fact he was taking decisions that would lead to the deaths of those to whom he owed a mutual duty he should be able to trust them and they ought to be able to trust him but that had broken down the drug made everything slow down spread out become part of a spectrum of observed existence that the user the practitioner could dip into magnify ignore enhance and exalt within according to choice a ship a regimental capital ship no less had been corrupted its ais duped a viral presence inserted into it centuries ago that had been the first act of betrayal the first act of something as good as outright aggression he had had to respond and the fourteenth had preemptively signed away any right to be trusted respected or protected by that act of ancient treachery above him orpe raised her hands above her head then bent back and then further back and then kept on going until her head eventually disappeared from view as she arched her spine and her hands clutched at found and then gripped his ankles it was a move she knew he liked beautiful succulent orpe virisse as she wanted him to call her though on the first few occasions like this she had admitted that she had rather enjoyed being addressed as orpe or ms orpe beyond even that though was the simple fact that the only thing which really mattered well beyond who acted first or who had betrayed who was that the subliming took place on time in full using some suitably enabled augmentation hed carried since adolescence he was able to watch her bend back like that multiple times speeding up and slowing down with the drug he could synaesthesise experience too translating it into other senses while another part of him was still in real time as though watching all this he enjoyed this feeling of being his own voyeur the knowledge of what had been in the remnanter ship if the message it had carried was actually true not itself a lie had to be kept secret hidden away not just from the vast mass of people but from everybody else as well it rarely paid to frighten the masses and it never paid to confuse them sometimes you could trust people in positions of power to understand this and even help keep things confidential or at least muddied so that people could selfdeceive with whatever kept them best comforted but not always and with this the stakes were too high nothing nothing at all in practice or in theory mattered more than the subliming they were staking everything on it he was staking everything on it carrying the burden of the hopes of the whole gzilt people on his shoulders orpe virisse moaned panted not being able to see her face meant that he could let his own expression relax while he thought all this through and precisely because it was so important there was also the possibility that even somebody hed normally have trusted somebody from the rarefied upper echelons would blab just for the fame just for the downthegenerations notoriety or supposed heroic status speaking out would bring even if it was utterly and completely the wrong thing to do never underestimate the sheer selfishness and stupidity of people the girls grip on his ankles tightened she shuddered he thought of the ship slowing but still racing powering down towards the planet falling upon it orpe moaned he almost laughed supposedly right now he was with the subcommittee making the decision about which scavenger species got preferred partner status making them the people whod receive the cooperation of the gzilt when it came to parcelling out the legacy stuff but he didnt need to be there in the committee chamber the personnel concerned had been briefed knew what to do and which way to vote in the end they remained frightened of him even yet and there was he was entirely prepared to admit a certain extra frisson about wielding such power without even having to be there fuck the subcommittee that would take care of itself in the end hed rather be here with orpe whom he had to share with the president normally he wouldnt stand for this he didnt share lovers but then orpes other lover was somebody it was very useful to share her with it was indeed the precise reason that he had befriended the girl flattered her courted her finally bedded her not that it was any great sacrifice of course she was beautiful and attractive after all if a little too assertive equalityminded for his tastes but no matter he had been very careful never to ask orpe anything at all about president sefoy geljemyns thoughts or likely actions content to lull her into a state where she thought he had wanted her purely for herself not for her connection to the president not for that access that closeness for all he knew it might never come in useful but then that was not the point and of course it had been the right thing orders sadly are orders well well miss you big guy you really have to go right now immediately im afraid oh you might register a slight tremor in your warp cores as i kick off here not a passing gravity wave or anything just me no not seeing anything this no wait a second yes engineering says yes they did the mistake not felt a modicum of embarrassment it had disengaged its own warp units without a murmur theyd been idling basically and then deliberately roughened up its engine fields as it had engaged its main drive specifically to create the skeinkick there was a table you looked up basically to see which of the lessdeveloped civs had to be hoodwinked like this and to what degree it was a form of dishonesty the mistake not found slightly objectionable but it was expected technically indulging in such deceit wasnt compulsory any more than this justreceived suggestion that it might like to head at the highest possible speed to a distant star system wasnt an order but it was expected if you wanted to do more of this sort of stuff in the future then youd best take the hint otherwise youd be frozen out next time of course it also made such behaviour your own responsibility it was hard to claim you had just been obeying orders when orders had officially ceased to exist the best part of ten thousand years ago the ship was talking directly to nyxandabo tyun the admiral of the liseiden fleet it had contacted the flagships ai as soon as it got the signal the admiral had clicked in seconds later the little flotilla of three liseiden ships including the fleet flagship had been puttering along towards zyse for just a few hours now there had been a wait of nearly half a day spent still orbiting the cinder star while the fleet had shuffled personnel and equipment between its various ships quite why this had to be done at this point wasting time when it might have been accomplished while the ships had still been in transit had puzzled the mistake not for a moment until it reviewed the specifications and capabilities of the liseiden craft and realised that with their level of tech shiptoship transfers while under way were tricky and risky the ship had been suitably appalled and had felt vicariously embarrassed for the liseiden yup thats me off and running sorry for the abrupt departure yeah you even took your avatoid were devastated yup sorry about that too just joshing anyway i know no just one of those things you know so youre just looking at the orientation of the warp skein here looks like youre off to no we cant tell open space by our reckoning heck cant hide much from you guys the mistake not replied putting some heartiness into its synthesised voice it had naturally an extensive knowledge of all liseiden languages dialects accents idioms and speech patterns it was powering away as fast as it could already curving away towards this izenion place it had no idea why the rucking it had caused in the skein of real space pointing in a completely different direction represented pretty much standard procedure you didnt let people know where you were really heading unless there was a good reason i bet the admiral said soooo bad news the delay caused by increasing distance was already such that had the mistake not been talking to another mind or even ai it would have switched to standard messaging by now talking to a creature whose faculties relied on a substrate where internal signals moved at roughly the speed of sound an ordinary biobrain there was no need for this yet the ship had plenty to process and think about while it waited for the animalslow replies to trundle across the link and even during the individual transmission sections between the phonemes associated with the end of the word bad and the very start of the word news for example when it was already anticipating that the whole of the next word would indeed be news and from the inflection that it would be the end of the sentence and probably the end of the signal parcel it had had time to thoroughly research the izenion system reanalyse everything it knew about gzilt and the current situation re the countdown to subliming and everything else and still come up with precisely no idea why it had been asked to endure a degree of engine degradation however temporary to get to izenion as quickly as possible the request had come from its principal contact and old friend the kakistocrat which had wanted to know if it would do this purely out of regard for it the kakistocrat had admitted that it had been given further detail regarding whatever situation was thought so important that a ship should be asked to do such a thing but wanted to know more still before involving the mistake not fully it had also asked the mistake not if it would agree to its specs being forwarded to the group dealing with whatever might be going on the mistake not had seriously considered saying no to both but then decided this was unlikely to be a drill or some sort of bizarre test of loyalty that said the kakistocrat was eccentric even if it wasnt officially eccentric and so it still might be some sort of weird drill of the kaks own devising in the end it agreed to go but vetoed the other vessel passing on its specifications beyond being allowed to say that they would likely prove sufficient no idea if its bad news good news or even no news xan the ship sent back to the liseiden admiral just orders thats too bad it was good having you around nyxandabo said he meant to sound sincere and to some degree did you take care we hope we see you again same here mind how you go well talk again out seven s fzanjuym was a subsummitorbit satellite of the sculpt planet eshri making it one of a very small subcategory of moons only its military nature and naturalartificial status it was arguably a ship stopped it being regarded as a genuine wonder the werpesh the people who had constructed the girdlecity on xown had turned their attentions to eshri at about the same time theyd begun building on xown perhaps a hundred thousand years ago by then eshri had been dead for well over a billion years it was small dry frozen and stony with a thin atmosphere and a solidified core that registered as barely warm most of the heat from its formation had been convected and then radiated away and what little radioactivity the core had possessed had since decayed almost to nothing thanks to little tectonic activity of its own but a lot of early asteroidbattering that had produced lava outflows covering large parts of the world it had been a fairly smooth little globe to start with the werpesh had decided to improve as they saw it upon this promising start and used planiforming techniques to turn eshri into one of their sculpt worlds a flatsurfaced planet of polished rock with a network of encircling trenches steep sided kilometres deep and tens of kilometres wide incised into and right around it from space the planet looked like a colossal ballbearing etched with ballraces for thousands of smaller spheres scholars of the werpesh and their works reckoned eshri was the most extreme of all the sculpt worlds on no other had the ground been so thoroughly levelled the remaining atmosphere so assiduously removed the canyontrenches etched so deep or so wide or attained such a bewildering complexity like all the few dozen or so sculpt worlds there had been no utility to the project as far as could be discerned the werpesh had been a reticent species unable or unwilling to explain themselves to the extent that other more nosy species thought they ought the sculpt worlds were basically a series of titanic works of art that they also functioned as highly visible expressions of sheer power and a certain willingness to ignore galactic etiquette most speciescivs had long since agreed to leave wild worlds like eshri untouched well that was probably just an added bonus nevertheless although the werpesh had not been a particularly aggressive or expansive people it would be fair to say that their contemporaries had been less than heartbroken when theyd opted for subliming and stopped building such impressive vulgarities as the girdlecity of xown and the sculpt planets the gzilt by luck and the good grace of at least one elder species in nominal control of the werpesh legacy had fallen heir to most of the sublimed species abandoned systems in their immediate vicinity and had quickly and enthusiastically got on with the business of for example colonising and rebuilding on and within xowns great girdlecity they were less sure what to do with the brace of sculpt worlds they had inherited neglected if never quite abandoned these had by default become no more than occasional if rather onetrick tourist stopover sites then the socialistrepublican peoples liberation regiment which was all and none of the adjectives in its name had chosen to make eshri its home or at least the home of its home fzanjuym had been the regiments headquarters for nearly a millennium by then roughly spherical and a couple of kilometres in diameter the satellite had started out life as an asteroid of the izenion system just another tumbling rock amongst tens of millions of others initially after being hollowed out to become the regimental hq it had been left in a closetooriginal orbit within the izenion systems inner asteroid belt theoretically gaining from being just one of a bewildering array of potential targets should anyone ever be foolish enough to wish it harm later with improvements in weapon and sensor technology the natural camouflage effect of being part of a mass of other asteroids had been negated happily the likelihood of any realistic threat had receded at the same time so the placement of the regiments hq became more about statement prestige even than about operational survivability so fzanjuym had been appropriately refitted refurbished and improved towed to eshri slung into a low orbit around it and then carefully lowered still further kilometre by kilometre metre by metre eventually millimetre by millimetre speeding up all the time until its orbit now lay a kilometre beneath the planets surface darting along one of the widest and deepest canyons of all in a blur of planetgirdling movement its course held steady by a network of hermetically isolated ais and multiply redundant thruster systems dedicated to doing nothing else its own engines had done almost all the work at every stage though various other craft had helped and been there to step in had anything started to go wrong but a modest degree of seeming helplessness was deemed to be useful in providing a sort of camouflage of its own fzanjuym headquarters of the socialistrepublican peoples liberation regiment had been in subsurface equatorial orbit of eshri ever since zipping along like a superfast bullet in a slabsided groove open to the pitchblack sky orbiting the planet in less than an hour and covering over two hundred million kilometres every year nearly half a trillion altogether by now while never coming closer than fifteen hundred metres to either the flat canyon floor or its sheer polished sides you approached fzanjuym carefully from astern approaching it any other way meant its hairtrigger defensive systems would blow you out of the sky coming in from astern meant that even if you collided with it approaching too fast the extra impetus would in theory merely boost its orbit a fraction sending it higher away from danger it also meant that as well as the arrays batteries and multiple turrets of emission kinetic and missile weapon system sites pointing at you you got to contemplate the impressive collection of variegated main drive units and craterwide thruster nozzles pointing straight at you each of them guaranteed to be usefully and reliably and terminally weaponlike in their effect should they be turned on even for a microsecond while you approached the principal hangar entrance lay nestled in the centre of a quartet of main drive units the transfer pinnace slipped towards it shadows wheeling about it as it gently outpaced the asteroid approaching at about humanoid running speed a little faster than was normally allowed the little twelveseat vessel disappeared pitching nosedown for a moment and trembling as it encountered the asteroids own internal gravity field the view behind cut off as a field and then a real physical door blocked the view of the deep sunlit trench whipping past outside and lights came on in the hangar as the pinnace settled to the floor somewhere a system would be compensating for the small amount of downward impetus caused by the tiny craft transferring its weight to the hangar deck commissarcolonel etalde looked at vyr cossont and smiled home at last he said possibly a little too heartily cossont just smiled they had crossed the few decades from xown in the mureite system to eshri in izenion within the gelishoplule a regimental cruiser about as fast as anything the fleet possessed tired and with nothing seemingly expected of her after theyd transferred to the ship above xown shed slept aboard in a cabin of a size significantly above that her reactivated rank would normally have called for and wondered if she had the bulk of the elevenstring to thank for this theyd quartered it with her shed risen done a little practice it had been unsatisfactory thanks to a deep background hum the ship was making which interfered with some of the internal resonating strings and thought shed have time to breakfast with the crew and maybe try to get more out of etalde regarding what was going on even if it was just gossip when theyd arrived and etalde was there at her cabin door offering to carry the elevenstring to the cruisers hangar and the waiting pinnace no food pyan yelped shed just let it fasten itself round her neck it tended to nibble at whatever cossont ate and breakfast was its favourite meal etalde frowned at the creature that thing is securitycleared isnt it sadly cossont said were there she asked already she stared at etaldes plump gleaming face sir she added she hadnt even had time to be issued with a proper uniform all she had was her civilian trews and frankly inappropriate jacket luckily the avatar when worn as a cape usually covered the more garishly offensive parts of the logo yes the commissarcolonel said ship kind of pushed it all a bit rushed you fit to go no food pyan said again plaintively no food she confirmed turning and letting etalde pick up the elevenstrings black case while she grabbed her jacket and folded it inwards no food the familiar said quietly as though to itself cripes this is marshal boyuter commander in chief im general reikl marshal elect this is general gazantyo the two men and one woman reikl whod been speaking smiled at her she nodded please reikl said sit the room was small functional mostly filled with a square table and four seats it felt like it was deep within the hurtling asteroid there was no screen holo display or obvious processing presence at all cossont sat she wore etaldes jacket over her shoulders hed been left in an antechamber several thick closed doors back he had charge of her jacket the familiar and the elevenstring all guarded by two troopers in full armour and a pair of combat arbites like frozen explosions of mercury and knifeblades cossonts earbud receiving and transmitting only on the asteroids own channels since shed come aboard had shut itself off entirely shed been asked to hand it over all the same and so had left that behind too are you well lieutenant commander reikl asked her thank you yes maam sorry we couldnt find you a uniform jacket with the requisite number of arms reikl said smiling again i imagine one is being prepared as we speak thank you maam cossont sat with her upper hands clasped on the table the other pair hanging down it disturbed people less that way were they of a disturbable nature now reikl said to business none of this is being recorded minuted or monitored elsewhere far as we know marshal boyuter said smiling first at her then reikl who nodded impatiently as far as we know she agreed the marshal was thin greylooking his pale face partcovered with a colourful tattoo that looked both fresh and unfinished cossont had the feeling she was looking at a lifetask still incomplete shed been out of the services for nearly twenty years and even now didnt feel terribly military despite being told her commission had been reactivated but it was still slightly shocking to see somebody so senior exhibiting something so nonregulation as a facial tattoo oh well as people were continually pointing out strange times the marshal sat relaxed in his seat almost slumped playing continually with what looked like some sort of multitool and rarely looking directly at her after an initial staring inspection when shed first entered the room hed frowned at her twin sets of arms general gazantyo was rotund eversmiling and seemed to communicate solely by nods he had a variety of small timetos scattered about the chest of his uniform jacket as though he didnt entirely trust any of them and was looking for a consensus if she hadnt known well assumed better cossont might have thought both men were on drugs reikl was different thin and brighteyed she sat upright and looked sharp tense almost predatory what you are going to hear has until now been restricted to the three of us in this cabin she told cossont and whoever it was originally meant for the marshal added quietly staring at the multitool he let it go and it floated into the air a little making a low whirring noise reikl looked pained for an instant then said this was information we came by indirectly she glanced at the marshal as though expecting another interruption but he was reaching out to the little multitool clicking it off it fell into his other hand poised beneath there has been a communication from our erstwhile benefactors the zihdren general reikl said smiling thinly at cossont its in the nature of these presubliming times apparently to do this kind of thing to make ones peace where there might have been discord answer puzzling questions and generally settle accounts with those about to make the transition old scores the marshal muttered the communication was due to be delivered immediately before the instigation however it came to light before it was supposed to reikl said intercepted general gazantyo said suddenly still smiling his broad smile intercepted reikl agreed by another regiment on behalf we believe of our political betters the marshal dropped the multitool onto the desk scooped it up again reikl didnt even glance she kept cossont fixed with her gaze youre a musician ms cossont arent you yes maam she said wondering why her rank had been dispensed with tell me about your time on the general gave a small smile youll have to forgive me she took out a notebook of real paper from a uniform pocket consulted it again it was very strange to see somebody especially somebody of such seniority not having names and other information immediately to hand transmitted by earbud or implant straight into their head a notebook cossont thought could the local processing have broken down so much in the leadup to subliming that even the regimental high command refused to rely on it that seemed absurd the anything legal considered i believe is the name reikl said leaving the notebook open on the table ah that cossont said shed sort of always known there was a chance what happened during her student exchange years would come back and bite her yes that the general said everything please and not in your own time were in a hurry here she didnt look at either of the males in the room but cossont got the impression the general would have liked to i was on an exchange programme on a culture ship a gcu called the anything legal considered i have it as an lcu the general interrupted sorry yes cossont said flustered it was anyway i was playing the volupt that is id passed my doesnt matter anyway she said taking a deep breath id talked to the ship about the another instrument called the eleven the antagonistic undecagonstring and antagonistic reikl said um just means that applying manual tension to one set of strings applies it to others as well cossont said or decreases it depending reikl gave a curt nod cossont went on i told the ship how i planned to try it some day if i could get my hands on a good example and it looked it up and ah well long story short it built one for me presented it to me as a surprise on my birthday i started playing it with the ships help it had made a sort of twinarm prosthetic which anyway cossont said feeling herself shrinking under the generals gaze i became very interested in the instrument the ship knew this and this was near the end of the exchange it was a twoyear ah exchange it asked if i wanted to meet somebody who claimed to have met vilabier the younger t c vilabier he composed the piece that its the most famous piece written for the elevenstring the first the piece that caused it to be designed and made at all although there are many oth if i can just hurry you along lieutenant commander reikl said who was it you met and where a man called qiria that was his real well the name he had before he went to this place it was called perytch iv a water world this man had been swimming living with the issialiayans the inhabitants something to do with an interest in their ah sounds sonic sense theyre these huge animals semisentient or protosentient or whatever rich sonic culture anyway hed been one of them for well decades and he was coming back going through something called processal reconnecting the general glanced at her notebook turned a page nodded curtly cossont felt relief at getting something right so the alc had turned the what reikl interrupted then shook her head quickly no got it ship carry on the ship turned up at perytch iv i went down to this giant raft met with qiria he was in human form by now put back into his old body though he was still kind of strange and vague a lot of the time oh and there was another ship avatar there from a culture ship called the warm considering i think pretty sure that was it felt like it was his his mentor or protector or something it seemed to take this claim of his about being incredibly old seriously too i just thought well i just assumed this was all some sort of elaborate joke culture ships do this kind of thing but i met him and we talked just an hour at first then more the next day and the ship seemed happy to stick around and the old guy didnt seem to want me to go and he was kind of fascinating so we talked a lot over several days he claimed hed spent dozens of lifetimes as various other types of creature over the years and often with some sort of sound or musicbased thing going on and he really did claim that hed known vilabier cossont found herself laughing just once reikl didnt look amused but didnt tell her to shut up either back when hed been human the first time if t c vilabier reikl said glancing at her notes the composer who died nine thousand eight hundred and thirtyfour years ago yes cossont said waving her upper arms briefly etaldes jacket slid off her shoulders she caught it with her lower arms replaced it marshal boyuter regarded this action with what looked like consternation so i thought he was crazy cossont continued glancing at the two men but concentrating on reikl at first by the time i left five six days later i believed him he didnt seem bothered either way maintained that what he was telling me was all true but it didnt matter if i believed him or not what did he tell you mostly stuff about vilabier himself how hed hated what else reikl said aside from vilabier what else might he have been doing at that time round about then within a century or so cossont pressed her lips together ah she said after a moment well he did say that hed been she shook her head he claimed hed been involved with the negotiations the conference that set up the culture she shrugged shook her head again as though denying any responsibility for such patent nonsense he actually claimed hed been on one of the negotiating teams which one he never would say i didnt believe that bit at all frankly i thought he was just playing with me i could believe the whole thing with vilabier there were so many details so much stuff id never heard of that sounded right and also that turned out to be true though only after id done some really deep research but he was always much more vague about all the stuff concerning the conference and the negotiations like he hadnt bothered to do the research to lie properly i mean i checked obviously went through all the standard data searches but there was nobody of that name mentioned and its all pretty well documented i didnt you know press him on it after the first time or two hed just bring it up again later now and again and tease me for obviously not believing him actually i was kind of embarrassed for him the vilabier stuff was so convincing but the you know being in right at the start of the culture when we well it was just so so unbelievable she suspected she knew how reikl had got to hear about this like most people cossont kept a journal and in the public part of it the part that was shared by friends and might in theory be accessed by anybody she had mentioned meeting somebody who claimed to have known vilabier she couldnt remember if shed mentioned qiria by name but she had mentioned the meeting it had been a sort of boast shed supposed though at the same time when shed made the entry she had played the episode down maybe given the impression there had been only one meeting not a series over several days even as shed dictated the words shed treated it all as much more of a joke than it had really felt at the time as though she had stopped believing in it herself it had felt oddly like betrayal as though she was letting qiria down somehow but in the context of the sort of thing you bandied around with pals about family friends boys crushes drink drugs pranks and so on it had seemed too serious in its raw form too pretentious so shed mentioned him only in passing as an example of the kind of eccentriccrazy you met sometimes when you travelled especially if you got to go travelling on a culture ship serious kudos there few people got to do that and she knew most of her friends were jealous shed been chosen even if it had just been by lottery reikl said nothing for a moment neither did the marshal or the other general though that felt less noteworthy reikl looked down at her notebook on the table in front of her what was his first name she asked she looked at cossont you just called him qiria there must have been more no ngaroe cossont told her he was called ngaroe qiria though he was just reassuming that name for the time just before decades like i say hed been cossont looked up and away grimacing right now she was missing her earbud and access to distant data storage she spread her arms nearly dislodging the jacket again isserem she offered that was his his aquatic name reikl nodded again lifted a small pointer and made some sort of amendment to her notes it might have been a tick intercepted general gazantyo said suddenly again marshal boyuter looked at him openly sneering reikl put the notebook back in her pocket she wore a timeto on her chest a tiny mechanicallooking thing she glanced at it stood looked at the marshal and then general gazantyo gentlemen if youll excuse me and the lieutenant commander the two men exchanged looks nodded the marshal made the little tool thing hover again he seemed to be humming to himself reikl nodded to cossont who stood and followed her out of the room via the same door shed entered by though once the armthick door had rotated back into place she realised she was looking down a short stretch of gleaming circularsection corridor that hadnt been there before another door was rolling aside at the far end as they walked it closed behind them as they entered an identical length of corridor its diameter was at least three metres but there was no distinct floor and the slight curvature under her feet made walking surprisingly awkward it was like walking down a smoothbore gun barrel cossont guessed that this was a part of the asteroid interior left over from when it had been without its own gravity field when both the doors behind and ahead were closed general reikl stopped and turned to cossont making her stop too i apologise for the state of my fellow senior officers reikl told her i cossont began unsure what to say the general looked very earnest you seem quite sober um thank you maam cossont said and felt foolish reikl stared into her eyes for a few moments we need to ask you to do something for us lieutenant commander she said i need to ask you your regiment something that might have a relevance for all the gzilt reikl took a breath you are of course back under military discipline now though even that might be seen to carry less significance than it ought these days but i need to know are you willing to do what we might ask what i might ask her gaze flicked from one of cossonts eyes to the other back again what is it im being ask look for something reikl told her look for something cossont frowned maam i wasnt special forces or anything she said she felt trapped here with just the two of them in this length of gleaming tube reikl was smaller than her she realised but seemed to have a compressed power a sort of density that gave the impression of being overbearing i know reikl said waving one hand were going to give you a combat arbite well technically an android looks human for protection protection cossont found herself saying she was no warrior shed been terrible at selfdefence and weapon training shed stayed on an extra year after her draft period and risen to the dizzy height of lieutenant commander on the strength of a sincere interest in military band ceremonial music and an overenthusiastic commanding officer she hadnt even been backedup had her mindstate read or anything and that was just the first sign that you were taking the military outright seriously as a profession now they were talking of teaming her up with some combat arbite for protection protection from whom from what probably unnecessary protection the general said dismissively but this is of more than passing importance she smiled unconvincingly let me ask you ms cossont where do you feel your loyalties lie cossont felt disoriented by the sudden change in direction loyalties um well to the regiment to gzilt she said and ah family and how do you feel about subliming the general glanced at her chest i see you have no timeto though your records say you were issued with one i just left it behind one day cossont said hearing her voice falter she cleared her throat im ready to sublime with everybody else she said drawing herself up a little as though for inspection reikl looked at her said nothing theres a bit of im a little nervous cossont confessed i suppose everybody is but well its all documented its all meant to be better there in the sublime she was aware this sounded lame she shook her head and its all ive ever known maam just whats expected of course im going to go when everybody else does reikl waited cossont added because everybody else does reikl nodded kind of in the whole culture whole society preparing since before you were born she agreed now she said im going to ask you again are you willing to do what we might ask what i might ask cossont looked into the other womans eyes for a moment she thought of all the people you heard about who had resigned commissions disobeyed orders committed ludicrous crimes especially just recently all because the subliming was so close and the wheels of justice ground so slow by the time they might expect to be punished theyd have gone with everybody else every individual got their own chance apparently with no way aside from summary execution for society to pick and choose who went she suspected most people had been tempted to do something crazy in these final days maybe something theyd always thought about but never dared do until now shed gone for the other option of just keeping your head down and maybe taking on an absorbing lifetask until the big day came one way of looking at this was that it was less selfobsessed another was that it was less daring a copout almost cowardly she could say no she was aware of that reikl she trusted and had heard good things about but the uselessness of the other two senior officers had been a shock she hadnt realised how mad things had become theyd all be sublimed soon anyway what was the point of taking on some mission that might be even slightly dangerous it was all very romantic but she had no illusions regarding her own abilities she was no spy no hero no superagent still there was something about the intensity of the other womans gaze and the way she carried herself some expression of the force of her personality and maybe just some residual need in cossont to obey somebody so much more senior inculcated from childhood and throughout her life that made her want to please reikl to do as she said or even demanded it was also she admitted to herself a way of abandoning her idiotic lifetask without losing too much selfrespect all right she said ill do whatever i can maam but it would help to know yes reikl nodded as though just remembering something yes well sorry to make it sound so melodramatic lieutenant commander but let me get to the point the book of truth is a lie cossont stared at her the gzilt holy book was something you just grew up with something you took for granted and felt proud of it might in a sense have outlived its most useful period when it had demonstrably been telling the gzilt people truths facts they could never have guessed at the time but it was still revered of course there were doubts about it there always had been when you found out about all the other holy books there had ever been throughout the histories of other peoples throughout the galaxy you realised how common they were and how fallible how restricted they were by the usually tribal prejudices and traditions of the people who it took real blind faith not to accept had made them up but even then of course the book of truth stood alone as the one that had made sense throughout that the zihdren had turned out to be not quite so important and not unique as the book implied made little difference because another thing that you learned was that everybody had their own point of view all species and civilisations saw things from their own perspective and with themselves generally naturally at the centre of things the gzilt were in one sense no different and in another were rather better off more justified in their selfregard because they had had less to repudiate less baggage to renounce their holy book had little to apologise for a lie she heard herself saying not just a misinterpretation or a good deed or helping hand taken too far an outright deliberate lie coated with a selection of scientific truths to make it easier to swallow but otherwise fashioned purely to deceive reikl told her by the zihdren by the zihdren reikl confirmed in fact by a tiny faction within the zihdren a solitary university faculty a small renegade research team with a single dissident individual at its head we are and always have been since the book was put together an experiment ms cossont the scribe was just a clever man down on his luck with a gift for speculation embroidery and marketing he was selected by the zihdren profiled chosen and then given the basis of the book the rest of course he just made up we know all this because there was a zihdrenremnanter ship on its way to zyse and the parliament for the final ceremonies it was carrying a an android some sort of humanoid entity that was to represent the zihdren at the ceremonies but it was also supposed to confess all this deception to the political highups just before subliming so that technically the confession would have been made and the zihdrens revelation would have been delivered but too late youd assume they were assuming to make any difference and not for general consumption of course the political establishment is more locked into the whole subliming idea than anybody else they might be a little shocked dazed even to have confirmed what cynics and apostates have been muttering for millennia but they would never call off the whole subliming or think to put it to a vote or a plebiscite the general smiled it was not a convincing expression only the zihdren ship never arrived at zyse it was intercepted by a gzilt ship en route and destroyed on some pretext she said just before it was incinerated the zihdren ship tried to reason with the gzilt craft by explaining how important its mission was it released the sealed information it was carrying until that point we believe it hadnt known itself what the message contained it was destroyed anyway and a component of the gzilt ship loyal to something beyond the regiment it belonged to ensured the information duly made its way to us reikl stepped a little closer to cossont making vyr want to step back she resisted the urge let the other woman put her face close to hers and the thing is the general continued the message mentioned ngaroe qiria by name as somebody who might help provide proof that this was all true even if there would have been precious little time to have done the checking required by the time this information was supposed to have been passed on reikl did her faux smile thing again so ms vyr cossont lieutenant commander cossont reserve in her civilian blouse and the lords of excrement jacket shes been trying to hide reikl said reaching out with both hands and gently patting down cossonts shirt collar we are looking to you to help us here because some of us would dearly love to know if all this really is all true and what further light on matters mr qiria in any of his incarnations might be able to throw on things because we understand i understand that the gentleman concerned might exist in more than one form now is that not right ah cossont said that yes reikl said softly that the mindstate thing just as you say the mindstate thing its not something that i have any more maam cossont confessed i know reikl told her leaning back a little from her you donated it to one of the centralised dataversities on the bokri microrbital ospin cossont nodded the incast facility they specialise specialise in that sort of thing reikl said nodding yes ive read your journal cossont frowned but that was in the private dont be naive reikl said shaking her head were your regiment the point is would you be prepared to go there and get it back to ospin were practically en route the general said her gaze wandering all over cossont now as though inspecting her in some military parade taking in her overall appearance her clothes everything cossont felt oddly helpless transfixed in a parade the inspecting officer traditionally looked for the slightest thing out of place or badly done perhaps reikl was looking for anything on her that had any military merit whatsoever it would be very helpful reikl was saying still inspecting her you could even be doing something gzilt as a whole would be most grateful for obviously we all respect lifetasks but this could be rather more important than playing a piece of music all the way through however difficult it might be really promotion and medals and awards and such nonsenses mean nothing if were all about to step into the big bright and shining light vyr but there is just a chance that wed be doing so under false pretences and it would be good to know the truth dont you think just in case we wanted to rethink and stay in the real and accomplish more here first and leave subliming for another time that ought to be a choice dont you agree i shouldnt even be too dangerous and much better than us going piling in the regiment i mean mobhanded fully tooled that could be awkward there might be ructions in fact ructions would be pretty much guaranteed given that ospin and the dataversities fall under the protection of the home systems regiment and it was one of their ships we think that wasted the zihdren vessel powf like that she snapped her fingers gently in front of cossonts face you however have a plausible motive for inspecting something you donated so wed like to send you to see if the shade of mr qiria will talk to you and shed any light do you think you could do that would you be prepared im very much hoping its not too much to ask is it vyr is it too much to ask the general was suddenly quite close to her again cossont shook her head she felt shed been half hypnotised no maam ill ill go ill itll be my cossont shook her head cleared her throat pulled herself upright i will do what you ask the general leaned back again smiled sincerely this time or so it appeared thank you she said with a little sidenod of the head now lets find your android bodyguard shall we she turned and walked smartly along the awkwardly curved floor of the corridor the door ahead rolled open cossont followed the mindstate thing it had been a final present shed received from the anything legal considered a copy of qirias soul basically the ship hadnt handed it over to her until the day and the moment she was leaving a bag in her hand and the elevenstrings case sitting on a floatpallet slaved to her hovering obediently at her side like a slightly annoying pet shed been bade farewell by the ships goldenskinned avatar and had started to turn one foot still on the floor of the ships hangar her other foot on the rear ramp of the gzilt transfer shuttle when the avatar had said oh and theres this and when shed turned handed her a little darkgrey subtly glittering cube which lay heavy in her palm from our old friend on perytch iv the avatar had told her thats him in there in a sense for you alone to be ignored consulted insulted thrown aside as you wish he told me to say the creature had held up its gleaming golden hand goodbye outside the corridor end in a wider crosschamber there was sudden noise and a line of men and women in a mixture of uniform and fancy dress dancing past roaring with laughter almost all sobered instantly the moment they saw the general and stood to attention breathless grinning one or two stood at ease or even hunched over hands on knees getting their breath back or still laughing at ease all of you reikl said then put some volume and steel into her voice and repeated all of you to bring the last couple into line she looked at them as cossont stood behind her finding herself the object of some interest reikl caught the glances yes she said somebody in civilian clothes behaving with rather more decorum than any of you she nodded however as you were she glanced at cossont and they set off up the larger corridor behind them the hilarity quickly resumed a travel capsule was waiting door open for them a few metres away the doors closed reikl muttered something cossont didnt catch the general might even have been subvocalising badly the only thing indicating they were moving was a holo display showing the capsule travelling through the asteroid moon from near the centre towards the stern where the hangar complex lay cossont watched this with reikl next to her the general was gnawing at a finger pad a brooding look on her face they exited into a large room like a cross between a laboratory and a small manufacturing plant crossing to the only apparent activity where three people in tech uniforms one a commander fussed round a raised seat where a figure reclined bottom half in standard fatigues top half naked the back of his head enclosed by some sort of bulky helmet a series of giant holo screens all displaying graphics of colourfully complex incomprehensibility arced around the group the man opened his eyes as they approached looked about eyes swivelling gaze fixing briefly on each of the faces around him his expression looked uncertain fearful cossont noticed that he was restrained in the semireclined seat held at ankles and wrists a thin metallic band round his waist so gaed reikl said to the tech commander is this are we ready yet the man in the seat stared at her as she spoke as though hed never heard anybody make such a noise before he was tall muscled with a lean face if this was the android reikl had spoken about cossont thought he was quite convincingly humanlooking apart from the rather immature bewildered expression on his face another few hours i think maam the tech commander said he held a small control pad like his two assistants both of whom a young man and a young woman saluted reikl ignored cossont completely and then after a nod from the general got on with what theyd been doing which was mostly staring at the giant screens muttering into thin air and to each other and consulting their control units manipulating holo displays hovering above the screens like the ghostly projected images of wildly complicated plumbing systems the man in the chair twitched looked surprised most times they did this whats the delay reikl asked impatiently its ah software maam the tech commander said glancing at cossont for the first time he returned his attention to the general not expecting a reemplacement not of something at this level taken us a bit by surprise itll all happen maam depend on it but his voice trailed off as one of his assistants twisted something within the holo display above his handheld screen and the man in the chair relaxed suddenly slumping into what looked like unconsciousness head lolling to one side mouth slack he jerked awake a moment later stared straight up and in a deep but controlled voice said unit y parinherm eglyle systems checked all enabled sim status ready engaged chron scale subjective onetoone default status assumptions keep kicking in the tech commander said with a sigh safety thing he looked at reikl possibly for support or sympathy is it ready to roll or not she asked not as he is maam still thinks hes in simulation mode thats unhelpful commander reikl said frostily get it ready as a matter of extreme urgency maam the commander said reikl turned to cossont opened her mouth then frowned looked away she held up one hand turning to pace off a couple of steps how fast cossont heard her say unit y parinherm eglyle the deep male voice said behind cossont systems checked all enabled sim status ready engaged chrawww the voice slurred into silence as she watched reikl stiffen thing in its way the general said her voice urgent she spun on one booted heel her face raised to the lightstudded ceiling she stamped on the floor cossont stared she looked round at the tech commander and his two assistants they had their heads down exchanging worried glances no reikl said facing away from the others but making no attempt to keep her voice down no dont take too long a pause temporary command incapacity another pause my fucking authority yes all ships full autonomy fz priority up and out max immediate yes what yes full now a moment later an urgent warbling tone rang throughout the lab space and lights started flashing the floor trembled beneath cossonts feet and a bassy near subsonic rumble seemed to fill the air her bones and lungs the general wheeled stamping back towards them gaed she said to the tech commander who was looking up at the ceiling he refocused on reikl were heading down a deck she told him she nodded at the figure in the chair slumped unconscious again bring this thing the tech commander opened his mouth to speak reikl raised one finger right now fast as bring it work on it as we go no more just do she said as the tech commander opened his mouth again she spun away once more saying what you heard the tech commander said to the assistants raising his voice over the incessant urgent warbling of the alarm cossont watched him flick something in the holo display over his handheld the restraints fell away from the man in the chair just as he jerked awake again and said unit y parinherm eglyle systems checked all enabled sim status ready engaged chron scale subjective onetoone get off while the general was saying stut it few seconds gap let the shut the figure in the chair sat up suddenly hinging at the waist it blinked in the light reporting it shouted then seemed to freeze the commander and his assistants were tapping feverishly at their screens reaching into the holo displays fingers dancing muttering commands the figure in the chair jerked spasmed turned its head quickly from side to side then said calmly fleet alarm program identified its voice was almost drowned out by the racket then prep a disloc from the fucking hangar reikl was shouting to somebody unseen parametered for a class t shuttle she sucked air through her mouth as she listened well get them out and put them in one we can throw it further another pause just as far as possible commander the figure in the chair said suddenly cossont looked back to find ithim staring at the head technician then he noticed cossont commissarcolonel he said she was confused for a moment then realised she was still wearing etaldes jacket the android swung his legs round and appeared to be about to get off the seat then he spotted reikl and said general he jumped to the floor parinherm eglyle android entity in simulation reporting he saluted reikl who had her back turned and was still shouting to somebody else the helmet the commander said one of the assistants strode up to the android and went to take the helmet off his head the figure flicked out both hands and caught the assistants wrists the girl yelped hurting she shouted as the android quickly transferred both her wrists to the grip of one hand the tech commander swore and manipulated something above his screen the androids arms went slack releasing the assistant who glared at the commander but swept the bulky helmet off the androids head on our way reikl said she pushed past the assistant she was rubbing her wrists plucked etaldes jacket off cossont and threw it over the androids naked shoulders the android pulled it as tight as he could it was too small and appeared to be about to say something when reikl muttered not promotion then took the android by one elbow he seemed to resist reikl looked at gaed and said make this move now the same travel capsule flicked them down one level the doors barely closing before they seemed to bounce open again and cossont reikl the android and tech commander gaed muttering to himself staring at his handheld fingers flicking about inside the holo image were striding quickly into the crowded hangar amongst sleek missile and dronecraft bulky transports and chunkylooking weapon platforms acknowledged reikl said calmly then she started running kick to ai she yelled cossont ran too at her side the android loped barely jogging while tech commander gaed stumbled behind making an anguished wailing noise immediate reikl shouted upper deck stern hangar regimental hq fzanjuym eshri izenion the android said conversationally looking about as he loped across the deck general marshal elect reikl commanding in sim maam a male voice shouted cossont realised she recognised the voice without immediately knowing whose it was then saw etalde leaning out from the rear of a tiny fourman shuttle ten metres away reikl turned ran towards it a small squad of troopers and a pair of combat arbites stood at the open rear ramp etalde dived back into the tiny craft threw himself into a seat and held out one hand to cossont she could see the elevenstrings case strapped into the seat beyond him i cannot get rid of that damn thing she found herself thinking as she leapt into the craft almost banging her head you briefed she heard reikl demanding no maam somebody replied look after her reikl said crisply nodding at cossont then next thing she was in the shuttle with them bent over in front of etalde reikl glanced at the elevenstrings case what the she said then shook her head hit a large button above etaldes seat and grabbed the commissarcolonel by his shirt front sorry she said and hauled him unprotesting but openmouthed up and out of his seat she propelled etalde out of the rear door jumped out after him and then pushed the commanding trooper and the android inside a hand on the back of each sending both stumbling towards the two empty seats cossont reikl said fixing her with her gaze find your friend find out if its true report to me or the next most senior officer in the regiment she turned away ready go she shouted beginning to run cossont felt straps start to secure her into the seat she looked out at etaldes pale crestfallen face as the troopers and combat arbites sprinted past him he seemed to realise he was holding something in his hand an object like a thick necklace there was one round his neck too he threw it in towards her just as the rear door started to rise she caught the device an emergency helmetcollar she clamped it on the last thing cossont saw of the asteroids interior was reikl running back grabbing etalde by his collar and pulling him away from the shuttle limbs flailing as he tried to balance turn and run all at the same time the shuttle door slammed shut the android sat opposite her in his toosmall colonels jacket smiling vaguely class t shuttle fourberth he said sounding calm ai pilot unidentified captain trooper commanding in sim the clanging thud of the shuttle doors closing was still reverberating through the craft when there was the briefest of high piercing whines and then an almighty clap of sound as though an angry god had taken a good runup and kicked the vessel just as hard as he she or it could cossont blacked out on the raft the mists rose like departing dreams she had never seen skies so big pile after soft pile of pink and yellow red and pale blue cloud towering on into the lost depths of the green shadingtoviolet atmosphere producing great hazy slanted spans and troughs of shade and enormous shafts of prismed light that lay strewn across this vault seemingly balanced between the masses of cloud or resting one end on those ponderous puffed so slowly changing billows while their bases stood rooted within the utter vastness of the sea the single great everywhere ocean with its planetcrossing swells skyspanning lightdefeating storms and forever restless waves the ocean could be many colours but to her on a world that was all ocean with no beaches at all it looked the colour of beachwashed jade birds and airfish singly and in vast flocks that dimmed the sun filled the spaces between the ocean and the clouds lazily trailing one long wing across the brief smooth curvings between the waves before disappearing amongst the long rolling troughs again or weaving columnar patterns like grey fractal shadows against the soaring architecture of cloud higher glimpsed sometimes between the clouds the slow dark shapes of storeyblimps and torpedons sailed stately and serene the storeys drifting with the winds rising and lowering to find those likely to take them in whatever direction they wanted to go while the slimmer lengths of the torpedons went tacking across the currents in the air youre still young you suffer from the sweet delusion that anything really matters were you this full of stool before you were a fish isseremqiria laughed probably he seemed to think about it definitely if nothing matters she asked him why are you even bothering to talk to me well quite he said and nodded he dipped his head beneath the surface of the water in the long tank then resurfaced wiping his face he looked at her blinking how brave you are he told her for ever setting up chances for me to dismiss you dont she said im enjoying talking to you unless im tiring you wouldnt want to tire you he laughed again now you appeal to my desire not to appear frail in front of a youngster do you ever think you might overanalyse trivial things like conversations all the time he was resting in a long shallow tank open to the sea at one end on a sideraft which was joined to the main structure by an articulated gantry she lay almost naked on a lounger a glass of water to hand the main body of the giant raft apranipryla lay close enough to put them in shadow later it rose and fell in sections as it rode the permanent oceanic megaswells and slowdecaying old storm swells its white shade canopies and billowroofs like sails increasing the effect of the winds on its slowly gyring passage across the face of the vast watery globe well she said hes remembered thats something it still does not really matter she shook her head better to be remembered for the wrong thing than for nothing at all no as well not to be remembered at all as that is the state that will apply to all of us in time she wanted to say so what but didnt you dont think vilabier wanted to be remembered i dont think it matters either whether he cared or not or is remembered or not mattered to him she said probably she added reminding herself that according to the convention they were observing here he had actually known the guy and she hadnt not that she really believed him tik would have been appalled to be known for the hydrogen sonata and nothing else isseremqiria said gazing wistfully out to the ocean beyond the foot of the tank he hated it hated it isseremqiria shrugged rising and falling in the tank he wrote it as a joke he told her wiping his face again the old mans consciousness had only been removed from the leviathid the giant sea creature he had inhabited a few days earlier he had been in there been that creature lived as that creature swimming mating and fighting with others of its kind for many decades hed circled this vast globe five times he claimed he was still getting used to being a bipedal humanoid again and for now found it most comfortable and comforting to lie floating in sea water initially he added glancing at the girl initially he just hated it later it became more serious but it was always a criticism a grim joke an extended grim joke but never a labour of love more labour of hatred contempt very least words were still coming haltingly to him his mind was struggling to adapt to speaking again after decades of slow singing and the transmission of thoughts and feelings by singular though complex sonic images every now and again he would throw his head back and open his mouth as far as it would go as though yawning silently this action would continue for a few days the medics had told him the deep primitive levels of his being were distressed at what they were interpreting as a sort of blindness and were trying to send out a pulse of underwater sound to illuminate his surroundings the action was as hed pointed out itself an echo a reaction shared by most listeners qiria said i was at the first performance he closed his eyes shook his head oh dear cossont frowned i thought the first performance was a triumph audience of academics qiria said and they had each been given copies of the score the score is beautiful no denying however i was at the first public performance oh the reaction was mixed some people hated it others really hated it cossont smiled indulgently isseremqiria could have been any age just looking at his skin it was very smooth but it was still somehow oldlooking his expression was the most unreadable she had ever encountered though of course they came from different bloodlines she wouldnt have expected to be able to read an aliens expressions even if they were part of the vast metaspecies of humanoid the genetic inheritance of his body was mammalian he even had vestigial nipples on his to her shallowseeming chest they looked like a couple of rather painful insect bites this was apparently the same body he had inhabited before hed been transferred to the leviathid it had been stored on the raft apranipryla all this time now he was back he had spent all his life he claimed based his word in this single humanoid body wandering throughout the culture and beyond especially in the remnants of the civilisations that had given rise to it including that of the gzilt even though they had never quite got round to joining hed watched the gzilt stagnate while the culture had changed from a fractious ramshackle collection of wildly disparate societies some barely on talking terms to become at once more purposefully homogeneous and more wildly varied as it slowly schismed developed diffused and grew towards the prominence it now possessed throughout he had taken what he called occasional holidays in other forms again both within the culture and without he had been birds fish animals machines aliens of a dozen different types and genders in some cases for centuries at a time always though he returned to the same old everrenewing humanoid body his memories refreshed his palate and appetites rejuvenated and always wandering too never settling down never returning to wherever he had grown up wherever that was he refused to say then for the last few decades pursuing a recently discovered interest in sound above all other senses he had been a leviathid here on the water world of perytch iv his voice a clamorous oceanfilling wail a pulsed directable blast of underwater sound capable of travelling thousands of kilometres or pulverising a smaller sea animal to death with the instant crushing pressure of it cossont had no idea how any of that must have felt but the sonata isnt just vilabiers most famous work she said its his most complex especially at the time in fact for long after his death most critics thought it his best still he hated it isseremqiria insisted he wrote the central part to prove how easy it was to write such mathematical programish music but there was no love in it or melody of course melody isnt everything no single thing is we are not surprised are we he looked at her wiping his face again then he realised that even within its own dictatorial sequential logic the piece was incomplete and was only a partial criticism of the things he hated so he decided to complete it and did isseremqiria looked thoughtful staring up at the patch of sky visible beyond the flapping snapping canopy above shielding them from the blast of tropical sun that was probably tiks mistake he mused quietly he called vilabier tik which was short for tikrin the composers first name cossont had been shocked the first time hed done this now she found it an affectation he appeared to start taking his joke too seriously he looked at her i did try to warn him he said you knew him when he was writing it she asked trying to sound neutral not too sceptical she sipped from her glass we met up several times while he was writing it i was he waved one hand elegantly out of the water dispensing drips across the sloshing waters one of those cultural attach√© things you know she nodded as though she did i even helped him what she spluttered oh not with the music as such the old man smiled with the matching of each note to a highlevel glyph in marain marain was the language the cultures language they were using right now shed thought it polite to learn it for the exchange visit there were even some words it shared with the gzilt language which had made it easier recently after nearly a year speaking it she had realised that she had started to think in marain and also that gzilt was beginning to seem a little crude and clumsy in comparison this made her feel oddly disloyal marain was around then she asked oh the culture had its language before it itself really existed you were matching each note to a multidimensional glyph in marain the spoken version and the threebythree grid used to form the written displayed version is just the base level of a fractal infinitely scalable multipledimension descriptor there are more complex strata what beyond the nonary one he looked pained nonary is incorrect really its binary arranged in a threebythree grid but yes three by four four by four three cubed four cubed so on the minds alone use understand the versions in multiple extra dimensions they can hold the whole word those glyphs make in their minds he looked at her ultimately anything may be so described the entire universe down to every last particle ray and event would be compressible into a single glyph single word pretty long word hopelessly so it would take a universes lifetime to articulate it but still what was the point of that she asked matching notes to glyphs i have no idea the old man said smiling but the point is the hydrogen sonata is an elaborate contrived attack on the sort of composition it represents he tik hated clashing atonal music he was basically taking the piss showing how easy it was to write how difficult to listen to now the piece hes most remembered for he shrugged again such is fate as they say he gazed out to sea for a moment then added one should never mistake pattern for meaning she started to wake up she felt odd heavy but not heavy her blood roared in her ears there was something weighing heavily on her shoulders nothing felt quite right what was that a familiar voice asked sounding muffled barely audible over the roaring in her ears additional entity potentially aboard another voice deep male announced casually scanning identified artificial construct personal and who is that the muffled voice asked cossont knew it now pyan though pursuing this thought she was still a little hazy on who or what pyan was somebodysomething close associated with affection and annoyance that was as near as she could get for now parinherm eglyle the male voice said in sim it felt like somebody was sitting on her shoulders maybe not a fullsized person but a child at least also that people were pulling on her legs and arms all four arms was that right oh yes it was she had four arms these days had had for years she opened her eyes two images both of inside somewhere or something something quite small cramped the images swam together became one the man sitting opposite turned to look at her the android he was an android beside him was a person clad all in silver the android reached up above his head did something and fell to the ceiling twisting as he went landing on all fours on the ceiling where some other stuff seemed to have come to rest as well cossont thought about this then she realised she was upsidedown the weight on her shoulders was her own weight things were starting to come back to her now some aches and pains feeling a little nauseous probably a good idea to get the right way up soon the android was tapping on the side of the armoured helmet the trooper wore the troopers armour had turned mirror reflecting everything hello the android said tapping again hello any form of communication no he tapped once more then stood back you seem dead he announced he sounded puzzled the trooper was hanging oddly too loose his carbine also gleaming hung around his mirrorarmoured faceplate cossont felt sore all over she tipped her head as best she could neck muscles complaining trying to see the button that would release her straps she couldnt twist her head that much some sort of thick necklace thing was stopping her she felt for the button but that hurt too even though her arms and hands were hanging in that direction anyway like almost all gzilt people she had been born with a sophisticated painmanagement system genetically grafted on top of the ancient genuinely stupidsore raw animal nervebased sense and she understood enough about how the whole process worked to know that if you were doing something and it hurt you should stop doing it so she stopped could you help me she asked the android he approached her crouched even upsidedown his body looked too big bursting out of the colonels jacket he wore it had ripped in places how may i help you he asked help me down catch me please certainly he reached under her head something clicked and she fell a few centimetres before the androids arms caught her round the waist he turned her the right way up and positioned her sitting on the floor that had been the ceiling thank you she told him my pleasure he smiled like a child you have four arms he observed yes i have she agreed rubbing them gingerly and wincing she looked at the trooper hanging unmoving above and across from her seeing her own face distorted in his armour did you say hes dead i think he is the android said but how he was the only one wearing armour how i think it was his armoured suit that killed him the android said matteroffactly in the same way that the shuttle tried to destroy itself and us he paused then smiled and said in if its safe pyans faint voice said from inside the elevenstrings case could i be let out now please the android looked at her the artificial construct he said is it yours yes she answered where are we what happened she remembered being on the asteroid moon fzanjuym general reikl storming about then nothing nothing until she woke up here in what looked like a very small upsidedown military transport we are somewhere on the surface of the sculpt planet eshri in sim what happened in sim she asked yes the android said brightly in sim this is said to indicate that this is not reality but rather a simulation he frowned i am admittedly confused by aspects of the currently running simulation and have yet to work out their likely utility though this puzzle might itself be part of the utility of the sim for training purposes she stared at him can you hear me out there pyan said its voice was somewhere between petulant and plaintive this is not a sim cossont told the android mmhmm the android said nodding she felt her eyes narrow you dont believe me do you i am prepared to believe that you as presently constituted believe that this is not a sim as presently constituted what the hell does that mean you as a part of the simulated environment the android said cheerily she stared at him it listen she said i can hear you you know pyan said testily if i can hear you you can hear me cossont turned briefly towards the elevenstring case pyan shut up she looked back to the android i am not part of any simulation she told it i am a flesh and blood human being and in some pain right now she rubbed her aching arms we were flung around a lot as the craft fell the android said uhhuh and so it makes me very nervous that you think this is just a simulation and im just a part of it i need you to treat me as real and human i am the android said this matters understand there is no second try no extra life not for me anyway im not backedup or anything really the android looked sceptical really cossont told it firmly even when i was in the military i was never high risk so i was never backedup maybe you are or can be but not me its not a game not a sim i understand and i am treating the situation accordingly the android said reassuringly nodding that is why i guided this craft safely to ground after its own ai attempted to destroy it what cossont said what pyan yelped that is why i guided this craft safely to ground after its own ai attempted to destroy it the android repeated you guided it cossont said she looked towards the nose of the craft but how following the aggressive effectorising of both the crafts ai and the troopers suit an attack which i believe was directed at obvious and conventional military systems and so was not directed at myself i was able to establish communication with the crafts backup control subsystems and guide it safely to ground i was able to make use of the debris falling from the remains of the regimental hq vessel as cover causing this craft to maintain a similar trajectory to some of the portions of debris as they fell until the last moment otherwise we might have been hit again by kinetic beam or particle munitions cossont closed her eyes feeling her skin crawl she shook her head the the regimental hq vessel the fzanjuym asteroid the moon its gone destroyed the android confirmed his eyes went wide and he made a sudden flapping motion with both hands a very extreme simulation scenario destroyed cossont repeated unable to take this in completely the android shook his head not completely in the sense of annihilated as would be the case had it been attacked with a large amount of antimatter say but completely in the sense that it was pierced by one or more energy weapon beams and blown apart into many tens of thousands of significant pieces the largest perhaps forming up to five or six per cent of the mass of the craft before its destruction the smallest the roaring in her ears had come back drowning out what the android was saying cossont remembered etaldes face reikls the grinning looks on the faces of the line of dancing people she and reikl had encountered before they took the travel capsule she was suddenly glad she was sitting down she felt dizzy disoriented would anyone have survived she asked shaking her head trying to clear it this hurt the android looked at her oddly well it said slowly we survived patently apart from us hard to say with any certitude it told her possibly not while interfacing with this crafts sensors i think i saw other small craft attempting to escape but all those i was able to pay any attention to fell victim to secondary andor subsequent munitions andor attacks also i think i ought to add that i think i detected other space craft in the vicinity of the planet being attacked as well so the assault was not purely on fzanjuym what did all this cossont asked from the little i could observe the attack profile would fit that of a single large ship or a small group of subcapital craft of level seven or eight capability on a semirapid closing transit the weapon signatures would fit those of our own that is gzilt fleet though that may represent deceit by those responsible there is a certain lack of specificity inherent in weapon identifiability at this sort of implied civilisational level this is known in some circles as the purity effect cossont stared at the creature ahem the muffled voice inside the elevenstring case said cossont felt sore and tired and wanted to sleep some more she wondered if this was what it was like to be truly old what happens now she asked for us not very much the android said this craft cannot move the doors are inoperative and it may be unwise to send any distress signals the craft is incapable of transmitting any distress signals in any event as i had to permanently disable its signal processing unit to prevent it broadcasting our status and position immediately after we were first effectorised it may be best to wait for rescue by friendly forces though in a wider context our present nonparticipatory immobility may represent an endrun situation within our part of the simulation at this time and we may well experience seeming oblivion or a possibly abrupt transition to base reality at any moment i am prepared for either as you may be too even without knowing it on the other hand we are not in a completely stable or static situation given that we are gradually losing heat to the planets surface and the external nearvacuum and a small amount of this crafts atmosphere would also appear to be leaking so in that sense this part of the run is continuing cossont stared a little longer at the android ithe stood suddenly upright and executed a little bow by the way my name is eglyle parinherm yours vyr cossont she told it lieutenant commander reserve recently recommissioned delighted maam another small bow though the android said a small frown on his face for future reference and any subsequent runs id suggest that a real human being would have wished to swap identities before this point cossont felt her mouth open she was aware that she probably looked like a moron she shook her head gently will somebody pyans muted voice said tell this fucking lunatic were not in a fucking simulation and get me out of here shall i parinherm asked breezily please do she told him parinherm opened the elevenstrings case pyan yelped propelled itself out and flew across to cossont it thudded into her chest wrapped in on itself like a rolled towel two corners of its fabric extended like clumsy arms to hug her this is horrible it wailed make it stop i could disable the device parinherm told cossont nodding at pyan leave me alone it yelled thats all right cossont told parinherm reluctantly the thing had never been this clingy before she cuddled the familiar patting what passed for its back she shivered it was getting cold inside the little craft parinherm had stuck his head into the elevenstring case here is a garment he said pulling out cossonts jacket he held it up letting it fall open the lords of excrement he quoted with seeming approval he chuckled what an unexpectedly random touch id better have that cossont said holding one hand out parinherm handed it over and she slipped it on so were losing atmosphere she said the android nodded oh yes and heat assuming the simulation continues it will be interesting to see whether the last of the available air escapes first or freezes this is horrible pyan said again cossont kept on patting the creature there there she said for want of anything better eight s the ship knew it would have to do it sooner or later might as well get it over with within the computational substrates that provided the environment for the caconyms mind there were plenty of bits it had never used didnt presently use and probably never would use physically fairly compact in three dimensions fitting inside a fat ellipsoid only fifteen metres or so in length the effective capacity of the minds substrates was suitably vast the comparisons usually involved how many normal drone or human mindstates could be losslessly encoded within the same volume or how far back in time you would have to go before you got to the point where in any given society every single bit of computing power they would have possessed back then summed would be less than equal to the power contained within a single mind the caconym didnt really care all that mattered was that due to innate culture overengineering its own consecutive incarnations as earlier ships and a sort of longterm laziness about pursuing the most efficient use of its muchaugmented and addedto substrates it had significant spare carrying capacity and had agreed to house the mindstate the soul albeit reduced of another mind inside it the mind concerned was well had been that of a culture ship called the zoologist an ancient boulderclass superlifter a glorified tug basically superlifters had always tended towards eccentricity it had never been the most difficult example of ship or mindpsychology to put this down to being a result of their rather boring and repetitive job their usually uncrewed nature and the fact that as well as being tugs they had been designed as emergency stopgap warships back before the idiran war when the culture hadnt really had any proper warships or at least none that it was going to admit to having the zoologist was one of a relatively small group of superlifters to have survived the war then even before the great conflict had ended but long after the culture had produced fantastically more powerful warships by the multitude it had done something relatively unusual it had sublimed all by itself a little later it had done something for which the term unusual was woefully inadequate it had come back again it was practically the definition of a mind that the word properly capitalised meant a conscious entity able to go into the sublime not evaporate and even maybe sometimes very occasionally in fact so seldom that it would be quite close to most peoples statistical definition of never be able to return in some sense still viable and identifiably the same personality as that which had made the transition from real to sublime in the first place if the zoologists reasons for wanting to sublime had aside from the obvious of wanting to experience the sheer ineffable wonderfulness of it all been opaque its reasons for coming back to the real were simply baffling the mind itself had no explanation whatsoever and seemed bemused by the question come back it had though and seemingly having no desire to remain in its own resurfaced vessel or even substrate it had canvassed various of its earlier comrades amongst the contact fleet those that had survived the severe attrition of the early years of the idiran war came into effect here to see if any of them would house its soul for posterity or at least until it got bored and changed its mind again or whatever meanwhile contacts finest and most expert minds in all things to do with the sublime had tried debriefing the returned mind they had initially been ecstatic at having one of their own who had been there and made the return trip lots of minds had promised to do so over the millennia though none ever did the zoologist had made no such undertaking but had returned this had however proven farcical the ships memories were abstracted beyond vague effectively useless the mind itself was basically a mess selfrestructured presumably along lines it was impossible to see the logic behind identifiably the same it was expressed in the most bizarre and obfuscatory tangle of needlessly complicated and selfreferential analyticalmeditative and sagationalratiocinative processal architecture it had been the misfortune of all concerned ever to contemplate special circumstances contacts scruplefree wing and the bit that was as close to military intelligence and espionage matters as the culture even reluctantly admitted to possessing had been more than happy to take receipt of the old ships physical form desperate to see if its time in the sublime had altered it in any way or if its recreation back out of the sublime if that was the way it worked had left telltale signs giving some or indeed any clue to how the sublime worked either way the answer was it hadnt they ended up no wiser even regarding the seemingly nongetroundable requirement that you could not go disembodied into the sublime you had to make the transition substrate and all brains and whole bodies computational matrices and whole ships or the equivalent seemed to be required as well as the personalities and memories such physical ware encoded in any event finally free of all this unwelcome and troubling attention the mind that had been housed in the zoologist had taken up residence inside the substrate of the caconym and retired to a life of timepassing hobbies and quiet contemplation quiet and extremely slow contemplation the zoologist had insisted on an allocation of computational resources within the caconyms substrate so modest and restricted that its full consciousness could only be expressed with a lot of calculational fancy footwork and some very intense looping it had been offered as much power as it might have needed sufficient to let it interact with its host in full mind real time but had declined what all this meant was that for the caconym to talk to the zoologist or interact with it in any other meaningful way it had to slow itself down to the sort of speed a nonaugmented human would have been able to keep up with this apparently signified some sort of philosophical authenticity to the zoologist and sheer laziness to the caconym back in the real the principal consciousness of the caconym was watching the skies and stars around it whip past as it raced the pressure drop to gzilt space while simultaneously performing prodigious feats of potential pattern and relevancespotting as subsystems reported back after performing multidimensional searches of every database known to intelligent life all to look for any additional information that might be brought to bear on the issue under consideration at the same time it was running simulation after simulation to try to build up a reliable prediction matrix regarding how things might turn out in that context the mind was happily thinking at close to maximum speed barely below serious fullon combat velocities and cycle times thoroughly and satisfyingly involved with and wrapped up within a problem that for all its thorniness possessed the incomparable virtue of being important and real not imagined here on the other hand it was reduced to a conversation that would take subjective months between each question and response the caconym sometimes envisaged its substrate architecture as a giant castle a castle the size of an enormous city the size of a whole world of castles all aggregated together and piled one on top of another until you had a sort of fractal fortress that looked suitably and stonily castlelike from afar with walls towers and battlements and so on but which as you got closer resolved into something much bigger than it had appeared as it became clear that each for example tower was made up of a conglomeration of much smaller towers stacked and serried and piled one upon another to resemble a vastly larger one what remained of the zoologists soul had taken up residence in one of these tiny towers one that perched on top of a colossal metatower forming what from a distance looked like a thick spire in some states of mind the caconym would take the time to walk through its own substrate image coalescing its sense of self into a humanresembling avatoid and strolling through this virtualised castlescape from the vastly complicated main gate until via ramps and walkways halls and stairways it got to its destination other times it flew straight there in the form of a giant bird flapping slowly over the roofs parapets and embrasures bastions courtyards and keeps until it found the location it was looking for this time it imagined itself as a single vast storm cell of dark lightningflecked cloud poised circling ponderously over the entirety of the vast castle like some malevolent galaxy of slowrevolving mist then from the lowering funnel of a developing tornado mouth suddenly consolidated itself into a single raptor the skies clearing instantly as the bird folded in its wings and stooped cannonballquick to the spiretower spreading its wings to brake its headlong plunge an instant before it would have dashed itself against the stones of the towers parapet the ship reimagined itself as a human avatoid as it touched down onto the flagstones of the towers machicolated battlements it raised a hand to knock on a stout wooden door but it opened by itself inside where the virtual environment belonged to and was envisaged by the zoologist the tower opened out into a substantial but not preposterously big singlestorey circular space which resembled a cross between the study of a wizard specialising in highly exotic stuffed fauna and the laboratory of a mad scientist with a weakness for bubbling vials and giant items of electrical equipment with conspicuous insulation issues the whole was lit by hazy sunlight coming through tall skinny windows beyond the portion swept by the door the floor was a mess the caconym had to wade through ankle and then kneedeep litter to make any progress into the room when i was old the first time the avatoid of the zoologist announced from one of its ropes i remember thinking this whole setup looked a little tired later i came back round to the idea now i cycle through periods of embarrassment and a rather childish delight hello welcome to what etc the caconym found a ricketylooking chair resembling a modest partially deconstructed throne and after sweeping the seat clean of assorted debris some of it sufficiently animate to protest with chirps and squeaks sat it gazed up and across at the vaguely humanlooking avatoid of the zoologist which was staring at it upsidedown one leg wrapped round a rope dangling from the ceiling there were dozens of similar ropes hanging from the tall vaulted ceiling of the space many coloured quite a few with what looked like rope baskets attached to them like fruits made of netting and some connected by the suspended loops of more horizontal ropes this was where the zoologists avatoid lived worked played rested and if it indulged in such generally unnecessary throwback behaviour slept it claimed it had not set foot on the floor of its lair for subjective decades believing the floor was better used for storage than access storage of rubbish bits of dead things and broken or redundant pieces of equipment the caconym noticed but did not say the zoologists avatoid was poised upsidedown over a large stone bench with a seething complexity of chemistry equipment arrayed upon it it looked a lot more like a setdesigners idea of a chemists workplace than a real one but that sort of detail had never troubled the zoologist the avatoid was holding a testtube brimming with bubbling smoking dark yellow liquid it dropped this into a rack of similar tubes and swung over to be closer to where the caconym sat elongated arms sixfingered doublethumbed hands similarly designed legs and feet and a prehensile tail made this look casual and easy even elegant it wore only a loin cloth adorned with a little belt of dangling tools and tightly cinched pouches its pale red skin was mottled as though by the shadows of leaves it crossed its arms swinging to and fro a little as it looked down at the other avatoid the caconym briefly considered pleasantries and some talking round the point before circling in on what it had actually come to discuss decided this had been symbolically covered by the stormcell image not that there was any guarantee the zoologist had actually noticed this going on outside and decided to get straight to the point tell the truth zoo it said how much contact do you still have with the outloaded the upsidedown avatoid looked startled what makes you think i have any you drop hints also you quite obviously know more than you seemed to know when the minds in the metaphorical white coats were picking over what passes for your personality and memories shortly after your profoundly unexpected return from the land of whatthefuck plus theres stuff goes on with your allocated portion of my substrate however miniscule and however seldom that i cant quite account for not without invoking processes beyond my understanding and as far as im aware beyond the understanding of any other minds processes that therefore kind of have to involve the kind of subscale higher dimensions dimensions numbered seven or eight to pick a number and involving stuff that is presently still beyond the ken of us humble culture minds so either youre still in touch with the sublime in some way or it or somebody or something in there is trying to get in touch with you or even altering or trying to alter details of your personality or storage without your knowledge that latter possibility in particular would be a little concerning for me obviously as this is all happening within my innermost field structure in my core effectively inside my own mind in a notveryfarstretched sense a large piece of electrical equipment in a corner made a distinct sizzling sound then shorted out ah the upsidedown avatoid said you noticed that stuff the caconym nodded it had guessed something like this might happen even before it had made its offer of house room to the other ships mind it was an open secret that the sublime or at least entities within the sublime could access almost anything within the real part of the proof of this was that when people or more commonly machines tried to hedge their bets by sending a copy of themselves into the sublime so that a version of them could continue to live and develop within the real it never worked the copies sent into the sublime always went but it seemed they always came back for their originals or the originals came back for the copies it didnt really matter which way round you thought to try it and that the versions left in the real always but always were persuaded to follow their precursor versions into the sublime this seemed to happen almost no matter how hermetically you tried to isolate the version still in the real it was possible to quarantine a mind or other highlevel ai so thoroughly that no force or process ever heard of within the real could get to it or communicate with it its substrate could be physically destroyed if you threw enough weaponry at it but that didnt count but no known means of isolation could prevent something from the sublime establishing contact with a copy of itself still within the real and somehow persuading it to come away or just quietly stealing it about the only crumb of comfort when this happened was that the relevant substrate in the real stayed put rather than accompanying the newly departed whatever process in or from the sublime caused all this to happen was thorough but not greedy still all this had worrying implications for minds which were not used to being at the mercy of anything at all aside from the aforesaid vulgar amounts of weaponry but they did a pretty good job of not thinking about it even the individuals who did properly return usually decades or centuries after subliming rarely stayed very long back in the real disappearing into the sublime again within a few tens or hundreds of days the zoologist was one of a tiny number of returnees who looked like they might be back indefinitely the caconym had thought all this through however and had decided that it was prepared to take the risk of having something inside its innermost field structures that might have not just ideas of its own but communications of its own too so the fact that something might be happening deep inside what was effectively its brain that it had no control over something to do with the evermysterious sublime of all things was not as troubling to it as it might have been the zoologists avatoid looked hurt youve never said anything before it was never important before not important unexplained events in your own substrate really i gave you a home freely without conditions also i trust you plus while undeniably a little worried i felt privileged to have what i took to be vicarious and possibly unique contact with a realm that remains inscrutable to us despite all our technowizardry the caconyms avatoid shrugged and frankly ive been waiting for a situation to arise wherein i could use this knowledge to try to shame you into telling me stuff you probably wouldnt otherwise honest of you to admit disarmingly so i hope the zoologists avatoid pulled its arms in tighter to its body seemed to think for a moment i still have some contact though its all very inchoate inexplicable hard impossible to translate back into here the hereandnow try the zoologist sighed put its longfingered hands to its face and made a sort of patting motion you still dont get it do you what how intrinsically ungraspable it all is pretty much see that insect the zoologist nodded indicating to one side of where the caconym sat the caconym turned its attention to a wooden workbench whose edge was centimetres from one of its avatoid elbows a tiny sixlegged insect small enough to fit on a babys fingernail was making its erratic zigzaggy way along the very edge of the table antennae waving the caconym zoomed in on the creature evaluating it utterly down to the code it was constructed from yes it sighed coming back to the virtual macro let me guess does it understand what the equipment on the bench is for or even what a bench is i was thinking more of how would you explain a symphony to it or a before we overfocus on my own and my kinds hopeless inability to understand the unutterable fabulousness of the sublime can i run the present situation back here in the real past you the zoologists avatoid smiled if you like it took the best part of an hour subjectively in the real on the way towards gzilt space light years were traversed during the time to the rest of the hyperbusy mind of the caconym it felt like years had passed by the end just before the summingup part of this impromptu briefing the ship contacted the pressure drop to make sure it had everything up to date good timing the other ship replied you coincide with a signal from our friend the contents may differ take a look at this signal sequence excerpt gsv contents may differ zihdrenremnanter adjunct entity oceanicdissonance xgsv contents may differ ozihdrenremnanter adjunct entity oceanicdissonance so to get to the point are you saying that despite the fact you lost a ship to unprovoked enemy action and have asked myself and colleagues to investigate you dont want this made public essentially yes kindly keep all matters information and actions pertaining thereto as confidential as possible and you intend to make no attempt to resend the information carried by the entity aboard the exaltationparsimony iii that would be correct despite transmitting news of the event at ablate and what we can only presume was the unfortunate misunderstanding regarding the exaltationparsimony iii to our enfolded brethren we have received no further instructions from them thus far and therefore continue to follow the previously transmitted instructions in essence these consist of send a ceremonial entity to take part in the festivities marking the entry of the gzilt into the sublime said ceremonial entity to carry information regarding the provenance of the work known to the gzilt as the detail redacted said information to be transmitted to the gzilt at the appropriate point in said festivities in the event of any problematic phenomenon or phenomena pertaining thereto judged by us to be in excess of our resources contact should be made with sympathetic elements within the culture on conditions to be determined by ourselves as the responsible remnant representation of said enfolded brethren the zihdren of blessed memory instructions end our conditions referred to above principally concern your keeping information re said events and actions as confidential as possible in perpetuity until further notice all of which might make things a little difficult operationally understood life is limitations and glibness patently on occasion too your pardon but i sense motions being gone through on occasion a superfluity of assiduousness can be vulgar i understand what can i possibly say well see what we can do our gratitude is a given signal sequence excerpt ends pusillanimous legalistic fucks eh the pressure drop sent so we get to do their dirty work and theyll be quite happy for no more to come of this whatsoever because itd all be embarrassing to the memory of their enfolded fucking brethren i suppose legacies may be expressed in various ways the caconym replied assuming the truth of the claim that the remnanters have contacted their sublimed forebears and yet received no further instruction aforesaid forebears may be presumed to be relatively happy with the present situation which does raise the remote possibility that this could have been even more of a setup from the start you mean the remnanter boyos conspired to have their own ship blown out of the sky the thought had already occurred though it was so far down the list of possibilities i thought it not worth getting to however this reaction on the part of the remnanters shifts it up the table somewhat tagged less for paranoia and more with justifiable suspicion however cynical still a remote likelihood youd think agreed makes no difference so far and how do things fare in gzilt space the mistake not is making its dash the passing bys two thugs are being gunnedup as we speak it is proving harder than expected to prise the empiricists delinquent twins headcrash and xenocrat away from the smatter outbreak at loliscombana theyd turned it into a competition about who bagged the greatest amount of smatter but then there was a dispute over whether the criterion ought to be tonnage or processing power this has been settled by a compromise but both desire more time to stock up on the criteria they had earlier discounted the empiricist has agreed to give them another couple of hours to enjoy themselves before shouting at them however talking of talking with refugeesremaindersrejects fromofexpelled from the big s have you been in touch with your contacts doing so even as we speak taking the opportunity provided by the glacial pace involved to get an update from your good self elevate not your hopes though nothing useful so far or on the horizon well best of luck by the by have you passed me the delays on these signals hours ago and closer than you might imagine neat didnt see a damn thing exemplary encasement management awfully glad were on the same side close to overstraining our design maxima envelope are we thatd be telling anyway i must return to the land of the lichenslow yeah you have fun now unlikely i appreciate the sublime would appear to be involved the zoologist said eventually sounding like it was making an effort to be patient indeed all im asking is that you think about this and if there is anything you can do any help you can give please let me know the zoologist looked pained shook its head but none of it matters not to you perhaps just indulge me but to what end it will seem to matter to me to us the sum of fairness in our existence however mean and shoddy compared to the sublime may be increased and some suffering prevented another shrug it still wont matter doesnt matter pretend it does game it that way the caconym suggested as a favour to me in return for my forbearance regarding whatever tyingsheetsintoarope and escapingthedorm shenaniganeering it is you get up to via the frayed edges of filamentfoamed nanoreality and the divine netherworld of the blissfully enfolded still no difference still not mattering the caconym looked around the lairlaboratory does what you do here matter not really the zoologist admitted it passes the time keeps me involved it looked at the rack of multicoloured testtubes currently i am and for the next few centuries probably will be experimenting with a variety of virtual chemistries usually involving many hundreds or even thousands of elements and often branching into some requiring new varieties of fundamental particles it smiled there is much more i play many games in other virtualities all fascinating and unpredictable and i still explore the mathematical irreal as opposed to the ultimate irreal of the sublime and in all of this to what end no end save itself i pass the time to pass the time and stay involved to stay involved yes but why why not uhhuh so its still worth doing to some extent well i we all do the same in the real to rather more significant effect as we see it i know i understand did it though the caconym found itself wondering did this abstracted creature this sketch really understand how far removed from reality from the real was it even though in theory it was back within it from the little the caconym had been able to glean from its fellow mind basically rumours that it had ambiguously confirmed to exist within the sublime was to expand in perception and understanding for ever in a space that could never fill up no matter how any transitioned translated civilisation or flourishing individual entity expanded its scope and reach and expression there was always more room and more room within a whole new set of dimensions that were conversely full that were thick with possibility the real with its vast volumes of nothing between the planets stars systems and galaxies was basically mostly vacuum an averaged nearnothing incapable of true complexity due to its inescapable impoverishment of structure and the sheer overwhelming majority of nothingness over substance the sublime was utterly different packed with existence constantly immanentising context endlessly unfolding beingscape like many a culture mind the caconym had tried simulating the experience of being in the sublime there were various easily available and tweakable packages which minds passed from one to another each the result of centuries of study analysis thought imagination and effort all claimed to give a glimpse of what it must be like to exist in the sublime though of course none could prove it and all were unsatisfactory though each had its adherents and some even had what were in effect shocking this for the cultures minds their addicts the caconym had tried a few and found them all wanting frustrating inadequate even oddly demeaning well it said will you at least promise youll think about finding a way to help the zoologist smiled that i can do i duly promise the caconyms avatoid looked down plucked the tiny insect from the bench and held it trapped between two fingers it held it up antennae waving towards the upsidedown avatoid you always say that nothing matters would it matter if i crushed this now the zoologist shrugged cac its just a package of code its alive in some sense it has a set of programmed reactions responses so on a tiny fraction of this environments richness would be snuffed out if i reduced it to its virtual components all this and all you imply by it is known thought about allowed for included still the caconyms avatoid sighed it put the insect back on the bench right on the corner it appeared to have been heading for no matter thank you for agreeing to think about it least i can do the caconym stood then paused i said that i trust you it said to the upsidedown avatoid hanging a few metres away and right now i believe that you will do as you say and think about this because you have promised to it paused am i being foolish outside of an enforceable legal framework something that is manifestly not present here trust only operates where beings have the concept of honour and generally a reputation a standing they want to protect do such considerations affect you at all do even these things matter to you the zoologist looked troubled eventually it said when you come back from the sublime it is as though you leave all but one of your senses behind as though you have all the rest removed torn away and you have become used to having hundreds it paused imagine you it said nodding at the caconym being a human a basic human even without augmentation or amendment slow limited fragile with no more than a couple of handfuls of very restricted senses then imagine that you have all your senses but say touch taken away and most of your memories as well including all those to do with language save for the sort of simple stuff spoken by toddlers then you are exiled blind and deaf and with no sense of smell or taste or cold or warmth to a temperate water world inhabited only by gel fish sponges and seafeathers to swim and make your way as best you can in a world with no sharp edges and almost nothing solid at all the zoologist paused that is what it is to return from the sublime to the real the caconym nodded slowly so why did you the zoologist shrugged to experience a kind of extreme asceticism it said and to provide a greater contrast when i return well the caconym observed thats possibly the most unambiguous information on subliming youve ever imparted to me at least however you havent answered the question i actually asked the point is that even such a reduced enfeebled creature would still be in some sense its old self even if it found it hard to express such a fact and what was important to it before if it had any real value then will remain important to it now for all the intervening change elevation and reduction i shall take that as meaning i am not being too hopelessly foolish you may still be but then so may i yes well lets not make a competition out of it i will see if theres anything i can do regarding this if there is ill be in touch thank you for coming to see me always a frustration ill let myself out the caconyms avatoid vanished without any pretence of walking out or flying away the avatoid of the zoologist hung looking at the tiny insect on the bench for a while longer then shook its head and swung back to where the rack of testtubes fumed quietly away nine s she became aware of light and sound again weak light which her eyes were struggling to amplify and only the sound of her own heart beating but at least some light some sound must have drifted off to sleep it was very cold now cossont took a moment to remember where she was then she recalled the downed shuttle on the cold airless surface of eshri after the attack she shivered across from her the android eglyle parinherm was looking up very intently at the suited body of the dead trooper hanging slackly in the upended seat the suit was twitching cossont felt pyan stiffen where the creature was draped over her shoulders now that it whispered is not natural parinherm frowned glanced at cossont and the familiar and put one finger to his lips before looking at the trembling suit of the dead trooper the android reached one hand slowly out towards it the desertclass msv passing by and thought id drop in was drifting with the winds over the shallow seas wide canals and spacious linear cities of zyses tropical subcontinental belt the ship looked like a giant pale pink boxkite three kilometres long floating along with the clouds just a few kilometres up it was here to represent the culture to make a kind of show of solidarity with the cousin speciesciv the gzilt as they prepared to make the big leap into the everlasting wonderfulness of the sublime wishing the relatives bon voyage basically saying were thinking of you the passing by watched the shadows of the clouds and its own giant shadow drifting across the serried buildings and parks of the deserted cities the windruffled surfaces of the sinuous lakes and small inland seas and the geometrically contained waters of the great canals the canals were generally flat calm and dark save where a few pleasure craft and even fewer barges still slid along them clumps of blue and green and yellow weed were building up along the margins of the waterways the world the passing by thought seemed empty and neglected it felt like there was almost nobody left to look up and see it this was a little sad but rather sweetly so no matter the ship had reduced its external fields to a minimum both in number and power so it could keep them almost perfectly transparent the better to be seen it had also experimented with various colour schemes for its hull before settling on this pale pink at night it made itself shine as though caught in strong moonlight it could feel the wind as a cool mostly constant faintly gusting presence on its outermost bumpfield gently pressuring it from one side sending it drifting across the land and seascape below it had adjusted its apparent inertiamomentum so that its motion matched that of the clouds it floated amongst and only vectored its antigravity field component minutely as seldom as possible to nudge itself out of the way of any clouds that looked likely to impinge on its own patch of sky it felt very content to appear so seemingly insubstantial and to have its movements so contingent on something as weak erratic and profoundly natural as planetary breezes meanwhile its avatar ziborlun silverskinned amongst the palely interesting gzilt and the various other species in flesh avatar and suitedup guises walked and talked diplomatically with the people of the court a couple of thousand kilometres away to the north the avatar was monitoring listening and witnessing it was only rarely offering any comment beyond the most banally polite and formal and it was being kept on a tight rein back to the ship a very tight rein now as matters began to get interesting often avatars were allowed pretty much full autonomy their personalities calibrated so precisely against that of the mind they were representing that it was almost inconceivable theyd speak or act in a way the mind would later disapprove of the passing by was usually quite happy with that arrangement but not now it was with its avataratcourt in real time now constantly controlling it and also meanwhile its two escorting fast pickets the value judgement and the refreshingly unconcerned with the vulgar exigencies of veracity had just completed their bit of quiet refitting in a couple of offlimits medium bays and were now gently nudging their way out of the main hull surrounded by two small shoals of lifter tugs the field complexes of the two craft extending delicately almost hesitantly outwards to mesh with its own allowing for a dignified reassuringly exact micrometresmooth exit medium bay doors floated and slid back into place the little lifters pulled away from the pair of thugclass vessels the two ships warships again now even if in theory they were still fast pickets swung slowly out among the layered fields of the larger ship gradually creating giant bubbles of field encasement that bulged out from the main structure before separating entirely the ships dark rather uninspiringlooking pointed cylinders with flared rears were on their own now supported by their own wrapping of fields both visible and not they drifted upward into the bluegreen skies of zyse disturbing no clouds whatsoever accelerating slowly through the various layers of the atmosphere the planets own field complex in a way the passing by supposed until they reached space the medium they were in one sense designed for they raced away disappearing from the real almost simultaneously into the place they were genuinely most at home every totalling into hyperspace was a kind of tiny trivial subliming the ship thought sadly it turned its full attention back to its avatar the androids hand touched the trembling forearm of the dead troopers suit slender fingers slid up and along to the shoulder then to the rear of the neck as parinherm leaned slowly closer cossont felt pyan tremble as though whatever was making the dead troopers suit twitch was somehow transmissible it came as a shock to realise it really might be her familiar could be under whatever malevolent communicative spell was doing this to the dead troopers suit or the trooper might not really be dead she thought though she found that hard to believe there was a faint buzzing noise then the troopers suit went limp again unmoving parinherm seemed to relax his hand came away from the back of the suits neck it looked at cossont we may talk now quietly it said what was that she asked keeping her voice low i think we or this craft might be under suspicion as it were he whispered this would indicate that hostile craft are still in the vicinity probably a loitering submunition rather than a ship the attackintrusion was crudely done the suit was not fully disabled or killed off if you prefer my apologies backups obviously the scenario continues he looked pleased if you mean a scenario as in a simulation cossont said this is not for the last fucking time a simulation the android nodded looked serious i hear what you say oh good grief pyan muttered cossont found herself shuddering uncontrollably her trews and jacket had already automatically fluffed themselves up to their max but they werent designed to work in serious subzero temperatures especially with nothing covering the wearers head and why she asked is it so cold please keep your voice low parinherm told her we have to allow heat to bleed naturally from the craft otherwise it will become clear that there is warmthproducing probably biological life within it and it is likely to be attacked there wont be any more biological life within it if i freeze to ddeath cossont said another tremendous shudder running through her she could see her breath going out in front of her face and couldnt feel any of her fingers or toes the android frowned deeply i know its a tricky balance ccan we get more heat in here she asked not kkidding with the way im speaking by the way genuinely involuntary shivering ggoing on here parinherm nodded i know im monitoring you and your vital signs are showing cause for concern you will begin to exhibit the first symptoms of frostbite within the next hour unless the situation changes he shrugged we could let you lose the body he said brightly as though just coming up with a good new idea and let the emergency helmetcollar take over keeping your brain alive and your head well mostly pyan went rigid as though reacting to this but then stayed that way parinherm stared at the creature which was still draped over cossonts shoulders like a thick scarf but had now gone stiff as metal the android put a finger to his lips again and started to move slowly towards cossont his gaze fixed on pyan you keep away cossont hissed suddenly realising what parinherm was about to do she struggled to her feet and backed off as far as she could within the cramped cabin bumping into the case of the elevenstring the androids eyes went wide dont move he whispered sounding desperate itll give us away he said gaze flicking down from cossonts eyes to pyan i can disable it he told her still moving slowly closer youre going to kill it cossont replied sticking three arms out to try and fend the android off she was fully aware how useless this was going to be even if shed been some sort of fully trained and augmented special agent which she wasnt she had fantasised about four arms and four fists giving her a real edge in a fight but was under no illusion that she had any chance against the android she even knew that the machine was right and if whatever had taken over the dead troopers suit was now trying to take over pyan fat chance that promiscuous easily led creature would put up a fight anyway they might well all be about to die still she just found the idea of her familiar being turned off killed by the android simply revolting perhaps she couldnt stop it happening but she could at least put up a fight that this was probably more than pyan would have done for her in roughly similar but reversed circumstances was beside the point i could probably parinherm whispered halting just beyond the reach of her furthest outstretched hand do this just through comms straight in straight through you without touching but induction is more subtle dont do it at all cossont hissed her hands were shaking leave her alone parinherm looked at her oddly an expression that might have indicated suspicion crossed his face then he seemed to shake himself it is an it not a her he informed her sounding cross cossont realised that he it probably thought of itself in the same way even though she had quickly come to think of it as male now if you please he said reaching his hand out towards hers again cossont thought about making a grab for the dead troopers carbine but it was too far away almost behind the android shed never get there in time parinherm went to put his hand to one side curving past hers then he stopped he straightened a little ah he said in his normal conversational voice a smile on his face this probably is endrun something hit the little upended craft throwing cossont off her feet and sending the android staggering back against the dead troopers body the shuttles rear door burst open flapping outwards the chill air inside the tiny craft fogged white and rushed out disappearing over a dark and airless plain sucking cossont and the android out with it in a brief storm that seemed to start to roar but quickly died away to nothing somebody or something shrieked it might have been her with a last breath ripped out of her leaving her throat suddenly raw and burning but before she knew about it that had gone too replaced by a ringing silence and pain in her ears as though theyd been stabbed with spikes there was a noise like a very loud snap that she seemed to hear through her bones first and only then her assaulted ears and a sort of bubble sprang into existence round cossonts head while her chest spasmed her battered throat seemed to close up her clothes bloomed then tore in a hundred tiny punctures and as she tumbled across what felt like a smooth plate of supercooled iron beneath her feeling returned briefly to her extremities tingling pyan had gone limp at last fluttering inanimately over the bubble of emergency helmet and blocking her view after briefly showing her the android starting to stand up on that dark terrible surface then collapsing as though felled an enormous buzzing humming sound overtook cossont then everything went dark and silent and fuzzy and surprisingly but comfortingly warm and her last thought was shit maybe it is all a sim im told you had your two little pals back in the shop for a refit or something marshal chekwri said to the avatar ziborlun ziborlun nodded these old ships it said with what might have sounded like a suppressed chuckle constant maintenance they were in one of the parliament buildings antechambers before the daily meeting of the watch committee which was supposed to take care of any outstanding matters in the days before the instigation and subliming this was mostly deadly dull stuff but the place was busier than it had been since the breakup of the parliament a small throng of diplomats and other interested parties had got itself together on the strength of a rumour regarding the committees final decision on scavengers and then ziborlun added they want some refitting done the better to do longrange monitoring of all these scavenger fleets and ships and well of course what one wants the other has to get the silverskinned avatar smiled down at the marshal how like pets you make them sound i was thinking children but the point stands ziborlun gazed round the antechamber as the doors to the committee chamber were opened two liseiden were present in their globular floatsuits like giant fish bowls alongside ambassador mierbeunes who was smiling broadly to all and sundry as though his grin was something unpleasant attached to his face and he was trying to find a place to wipe it off all six ronte were present too their bulky insectile exosuits all huddled together in one corner bumping into each other and gently leaking fumes they looked slightly more abject than usual the avatar thought longrange monitoring equipment the marshal said as they joined everybody else filing into the committee chamber ziborlun nodded again yes the avatar said in the chamber the last three unstored trimes and a handful of septames including banstegeyn were already seated round the raised table at the far end longrange monitoring equipment technically this was true if you defined the coaxial targeting components of multisuite weapon clusters as such the two ships hadnt got the same equipment refitted either their weapon mix was different the value judgement having chosen an array designed primarily for techsuperiority situations where effectors worked best and were the most humane choice scavengercompatible in other words while the refreshingly had gone for a more equivtech ordnance mixture leading with the sort of gear that could take on ships of its own level ziborlun and chekwri sat near the back on the dais some boring people began talking boringly the silverskinned avatar frowned septame banstegeyn looks like hes eaten something that disagrees with him dont you think it observed the marshal barely glanced hmm monitoring seems to have been on your mind recently she said quietly her head angled towards the avatar our nearapproaches ais seem to think youve been showing increased interest in what little comings and goings we still have around here in these reduced times this is true the avatar conceded back aboard the passing by the mind controlling both the systems vehicle and the avatar was doing the hyperai equivalent of grimacing and mouthing the word shit we feel there is a need for a more robust system given the general attrition of informational flow recently so little coming in from so many places most people have had themselves stored the marshal said and many of the ships have already gone into the sublime so of course there is less to report yes the avatar frowned do you really think that was wise sending so many of the ships ahead i mean such behaviour was not unknown when a society was preparing to sublime but it was unusual it felt like scouting out unknown terrain like an insurance policy to make sure your own people were truly compatible with the whole process even though a copious and exhaustively annotated and referenced history had built up over the aeons indicating that there was absolutely no need to do so also the way the gzilt configured the ais in their capital ships a whole crew of oncehuman personalities uploaded vastly speeded up and sharing a multiply partitioned but at root single computational matrix meant that the vessels were already a kind of image of a population in an enfolded state so the step to true subliming would have seemed easy enough to make for them as a kind of easily digestible precursor to the main event of course we thought it was wise marshal chekwri said or we would not have permitted it hmm the avatar said but less power and more concentrated however you are quite right not for me to tell you your job however all that said and even so there are odd lacunae one might call them in the comms these days nothing at all from the izenion system for a whole day for example and so we thought to improve our own monitoring and comms network not at the expense of yours of course and we are happy to share naturally and all these new measures youre taking the marshal said as the voices on the dais droned on these are your own initiatives indeed not the avatar said smiling sometimes it was best to tell part of the truth the better to conceal the rest i was asked to do so i am not entirely sure why asked to do so by whom the marshal asked other culture ships the avatar said innocently how odd the marshal said i know the avatar nodded vigorously and extended one slender silver finger to tap chekwri on her epaulette the ship had a feeling it was already starting to overdo the guileless dingbat shtick but reckoned it ought to carry it through nevertheless besides there was a certain pleasure to be had twanging the metaphorical rod extending from the marshals behind thats what i thought chekwri looked sourly at the culture creature and opened her mouth to say something however the avatar nodded towards the dais and said ah here we go has been awarded to the ronte trime quvarond announced with a quick triumphant glance at banstegeyn who sat stony faced at the far end of the long table preferred partner status being duly accorded forthwith to the genus ronte civilisation further detail to be released this day by committal decree business session hereby closed the committee chamber was suddenly full of individually quiet but taken together surprisingly loud mutterings the two spherical liseiden floatsuits had risen an extra metre into the air ambassador mierbeunes was standing looking genuinely shocked the six ronte in their exosuits were all bobbing up and down and making clicking noises they appeared to be vibrating even marshal chekwri had looked briefly surprised the avatar nudged her and said there nobody saw that coming there was a certain very definite satisfaction in feeling so perfectly contained surrounded and protected by something so powerful obedient and determined colonel cagad agansu originally of the home system regiment the first as it was sometimes known though now under the direct command of septame banstegeyn for jurisdictional purposes marshal chekwri liaising lay deep in the heart of the gzilt ship uagren swaddled in concentric layers of protection and processing compressed cushioned shielded penetrated sealed within and grafted into the systems and beyondlightningquick operationality of the ship a person subject to the weakness of claustrophobia would be screaming in such a situation this had occurred to the colonel when he had first lain down on the couch in his armoured survival suit and the jawlike secondary personnel containment machinery had closed around him clamping him in place the thought had caused the colonel to smile a little even the minimal facial disturbance of smiling required some accommodation by the gels and foams between his skin and the interior of his armoured helmet but the colonel found this reassuring his breathing was similarly constrained accommodated and allowed for his suits armoured chest and the containment beyond flexing with him as though breathing with him as though the ship was breathing with him another independent system stood ready to flood his lungs with foam and brace them with whatever pressure it took while his blood was oxygenated by machine should the ship ever need to accelerate decelerate or manoeuvre so violently that even the current arrangements protecting him might prove insufficient alongside the colonel less than a metre away unseen while the colonel stared out through the potentially senseshattering richness of the ships sensor arrays towards the star izenion was the combat arbite uhtryn the colonels sole comrade on this mission excluding only the uagren itself the arbites parallel degree of containment was less necessary than his own as a pure machine that merely vaguely resembled the human form it required less of the cushioning and protection agansu did to keep him from excessive harm when the ship changed speed or direction the arbite could have been welded to a bulkhead inside the ship and survived just as well still the space had been there and the arbite had to be contained somewhere within the vessel so there it had been placed so far it had had nothing to do its part might come later the colonel was aware of it at his side silent absorbing storing calculating the uagrens crew existed as uploaded entities within a multiply partitioned ai substrate no longer in any meaningful sense human they nevertheless retained a degree of individuality and represented that which made gzilt warships so exceptional superior indeed at least to gzilt reckoning to those relying on wholly artificial ais or even minds as they rather grandly called themselves certainly the crew resembled something like their original human forms in their interactions with agansu representing themselves as appropriately uniformed figures inside a virtual space modelled on the last physically real bridge on a gzilt warship dating from some thousands of years ago this virtual space presented itself to the colonel now overlaid transparently across the viewfilling expanse of the star izenion which seemed to hang in space directly in front of him vast astounding like a furiously boiling cauldron of yellowwhite flames he was staring straight down into seemingly suspended so close that instinct insisted it must be impossible not to be burned alive by the sheer pulverising force of its fires it was almost a relief to tear his attention from the unforgiving ferocity of the sun and redirect it to the image of the ships captain we have our quarry colonel a readout indicated how much the captains virtual being was having to slow down to talk with agansu the colonel had combatgrade augmentation to allow him to think and react far faster than any basic human and was using it wrung to its maximum now but he still thought and for example conversed at speeds that could be tens of thousands of times slower than did the virtual personalities of the crew housed and running within the computational matrix of the ship being so slow in comparison to others might have embarrassed or troubled certain people but the colonel simply accepted that different martial requirements led to individual elements of the military occupying a variety of martial niches thank you captain he said beyond the ghostly image of the ships virtual master a green circle blinked against the face of the star some subsystem monitoring agansus senses registered him glancing at the highlighted circle and zoomed in for him showing once the circle had bloomed almost to the same size as the image of the whole sun moments earlier a tiny dark fleck right in the centre of the rapidly pulsing green halo whatever it was it looked microscopic against the magnified flamescape beyond though agansu knew this meant little an entire naturally habitable planet would appear as no more than a dot against the vastness of the sun do we have comms he asked we do sir the comms officer replied theyve just started signalling us as ordered weve not yet replied your call sir and they cant signal elsewhere indeed the captain said we have them contained unless they have signalling equipment of a type we would not expect relevant either to the small craft we tracked from eshri or the old solar research and monitoring station where they have taken refuge you are content that i may make contact privately of course the captain replied those are our orders shall i open the link sir the comms officer asked agansu please do the background image of the enormous circular lake of boiling stellar fire and the foreground transparency of the command space of an antique capital ship complete with human crew at their various stations disappeared to be replaced initially by a sort of fuzzy darkness then a lofi image of a smaller control room or command space became visible agansu was looking down as though from high on one wall of the place there were screens and holo displays most were blank though a few showed schematics of what he assumed must be the star izenion a few exhaustedlooking people some suited or partially so some injured being tended to by others sat or lay on sculpted couches not dissimilar to the one he lay upon though without all the additional layers of protection he was benefiting from there was one figure standing facing looking up at him her face set in an expression the colonel suspected might indicate loathing he would have settled for fear general reikl he said and who the fuck are you there appeared to be no delay which was good he supposed the uagren and the ancient research station were within a few hundred thousand kilometres of each other there is no need for such language general marshal elect i should say you just killed two thousand of my people the general said coldly then hunted down all the survivors you could find injured or not and murdered them too general reikl paused and seemed to have to take a breath here so perhaps she was not quite as in control of her emotions as she might be trying to appear the colonel gauged and she continued from the little weve managed to piece together while we were running away you might even be one of our own another fucking regiment and in the face of that you choose to take offence at my fucking language fuck you you splitprick cunt you are stressed general agansu said i understand i regret what has happened the general started shouting at him as he said this but he persevered talking over her and that which shortly must occur i merely wished to salute your bravery and inform you that while sadly no official record of your exemplary behaviour until this point at any rate will be possible a fellow officer will not forget how well you discharged your duties i understand how little consolation this might be but it is all i have to offer you selfrighteous worminfested turd the general said nearly spitting swallow a gutfull of acid stick your head up your own rectum and vomit she looked away as somebody spoke to her then back to him oh slowing the whole station she said sneering going to let us drop into the photosphere and roast to death quick splash of plasma or a particle jet too quick a death for us wheres your fucking honour now unfortunately we are no longer alone at least one other vessel of significant capabilities is now present in the system and to do as you suggest while of course representing my first choice for the sake of due respect might attract unwanted attention slowing your current location so that it descends into the sun accomplishes the same end while being much less likely to be noticed i apologise i suggest that those of your comrades unable to autoeuthenise before conditions become especially uncomfortable accomplish the required deed through the use of side arms i assume you have those the general said nothing for a few moments behind and around her her crew seemed to be doing all they could to prevent the old research and monitoring station from falling into the sun and to send any sort of signal of distress either directed or broadcast punching buttons shouting commands manipulating holo displays all of course to absolutely no avail agansu knew though he appreciated the merit of always trying to do whatever one could in all circumstances no matter how inevitable the outcome then general reikl said quite calmly to somebody offscreen cut this in three seconds she turned back faced the screen and seemed to sob a single great heaving motion shook her entire upper body agansu was for an instant most surprised then slightly disappointed and lastly oddly touched then reikl put her head back a little jerked it forward again hard and spat a surprisingly large amount of spittle phlegm or a mixture thereof straight at the camera the view was obscured for about half a second before the comms link was cut off entirely from her end agansu had felt himself start spasming backwards instinctively into his suit and the unseen surface of the couch beneath as the spittle had hit the camera even though he was so many tens or hundreds of thousands of kilometres distant and so utterly perfectly contained and protected within so many concentric layers of armour insulation and material he tried to reestablish contact he felt he had to but no reply was forthcoming he realised hed have been disappointed if there had been any beyond that he was momentarily not sure quite how to feel he thought about it and settled for a hope that he would meet his own end with such blazing contempt and fortitude after that he thought his way back to the magnified view of the old solar research and monitoring station it was silhouetted insect small against the heaving livid face of the star he lay in silence and watched over the few minutes it took for the dark speck to fall into the arching trajectories of plasma forming the upper reaches of the inferno eventually the tiny dot winked out in a brief microscopically irrelevant extra pulse of flame quite lost within the encompassing storm of nuclear fires below the colonel closed his eyes in a kind of silent salute to the departed warriors there would be no subliming for them now but then there would be none for him either the colonel had volunteered to stay behind after the subliming as part of the gzilt remnanter in theory this was because it meant sacrifice and was therefore a noble thing to do the truth of which he was suitably ashamed was that he was terrified of oblivion and that was what subliming seemed to him to be he could not tell anybody this somebody was a masochist one of the crew remarked when he rejoined them on the virtual bridge of the uagren how so agansu asked they kept on distresssignalling all the way down the comms officer said but their vital signs telemetry was still included probably just forgot to turn it off thing is all the life signs flicked off one by one over less than a minute after they broke contact all except one the one that stayed on rode that baby all the way down to the fires alive showing distress agansu asked not especially nothing to indicate severe pain but still ten s mine doesnt play strange tricks never id feel more normal if it did i was kind of only kidding anyway id guessed it is mr qiria who plays strange tricks said the excessively hairy avatar to cossonts right and chuckled cossont lay lounging under a taut white breezevibrated awning on the great raft apranipryla on the water world called perytch iv to her left on another lounger was qiria the man who claimed to be absurdly old splayed on a couch on her other side was the avatar of the warm considering culture ship avatars were usually human or at least humanoid especially when they were mixing mostly with humans but not that of the ancient deltaclass gcu warm considering its avatar sklom was in the form of a sylocule a spikily bluehaired sixlimbed sixeyed creature with a bulky central body sklom lifted a murkylooking drink glass with a fat straw in it from a tray raised its body from the couch a little and appeared to squat over the glass there was a slurping noise and the level in the glass went down cossont had yet to find this less than fascinating also slightly disgusting the warm considering was supposed to be horrendously ancient itself thousands of years old though still not the avatar and ship seemed happy to concede nearly as venerable as qiria the man however old he really was seemed to be at least partially under the protection of the antique ship it took him wherever he might want to go provided or confirmed covering identities hed be besieged by media people or those just fascinated by extreme age otherwise he claimed and perhaps she thought from hints dropped over the last few days helped maintain whatever aspects of his physiology and memory he could not take care of himself she supposed if you were going to hide for ten thousand years inside the culture or anywhere else it would help to have a ship on your side id have thought your memory would play more tricks than anybody elses she said to qiria this was the fourth day the man had spent out of the water and the first without wet towels spread over him what with you having so much of it memory i mean the man rubbed his face with both hands well youd be wrong he told her one of the things you have to do if youre going to live a long time and not go mad is make sure your memories are properly looked after managed how do you even fit them in cossont asked are you basically all computer inside your head not at all qiria said his expression indicating he found the idea distasteful in some ways my brain is as its always been just stabilised been like that for millennia though it does have a modified neural lace within it heavily modified no comms what i do have is extra storage not processing storage the two are sometimes confused what cossont asked is it remote or no its in me qiria told her throughout me vast amount of storage room in the human body once you can encode in the appropriate bases and emplace a nanowire readout system through the helices started with connective tissue then bones now even my most vital organs have storage built in doesnt detract from their utility in the least improves it in some ways in terms of bone strength and so on though i have noticed this body doesnt float very well you are weighed down by your memories literally sklom said chortling qiria looked unimpressed at this as he held up one hand extended a digit and inspected it well yes however it also allows me to have more knowledge in my little finger than some people do in their whole body literally what of your masculine organ of generation sklom asked the avatar was modelled on a male sylocule what is stored there qiria frowned and looked away as though distracted gauging currently empty sklom hooted with laughter cossont reflected that males seemed to find the same things funny even across utterly different species room for expansion sklom wheezed though qiria looked unimpressed at this and shared a rollingeyes look with cossont he pinched the top of his nose at first my memories were placed randomly throughout my body with many copies he said now as the available space has been taken up there is generally only one copy of each memory and i have over the centuries as part of one of my longterm internal projects sorted and moved and restored all my memories so that they reside in what seem to me apposite locations he looked at cossont i lied my genitals contain all my memories of previous sexual encounters it seemed only appropriate ha sklom said sounding happy like you say cossont agreed appropriate whats left in your actual brain recent memories recently recalled old memories a highly intricate map of where all my memories are stored throughout my body and a sort of random sifted debris of all the thoughts and memories that have ever passed through my head that i cant darent interfere with too much aside from one or two very specific episodes to do so further would risk becoming not myself we are largely the sum of all weve done and to dispose of that knowledge would be to stop being ones self what are the one or two specific episodes cossont began none of your business qiria said smoothly cossont lowered her voice a little has anyone ever broken your heart she asked quietly phht sklom spluttered in the sense im sure you mean not for over nine and a half thousand years qiria told her briskly taking another more pertinent definition my heart is broken with each new exposure to the idiocies and cruelties of every manner of being that dares to call or think of itself as intelligent in other words sklom chipped in about every century halfcentury or so qiria glared at the creature but let the point stand so cossont said sexual memories in your genitals yes qiria said where do you keep your memories of love past lovers qiria looked at her in my head of course he looked away there are not so many of those anyway he said voice a little quieter loving becomes harder the longer you live and i have lived a very long time indeed he fixed his gaze on her again im sure it varies across species some seem to do quite well with no idea of love at all but you soon enough come to realise that love generally comes from a need within ourselves and that the behaviour the expression of love is what is most important to us not the identity not the personality of the one who is loved he smiled bleakly at cossont you are young of course and so none of this will make any sense whatsoever his smile melted away cossont thought like late spring snow over a morning i envy you your illusions he said though i could not wish their return the long piers and bulbous pontoons of the giant articulated raft flexed and creaked around them like a giant arthritic hand laid across the surface of the ocean forever trying to pat it calm ahha sklom said here it is the avatar jumped off the couch and rollwalked across the raft in a blue blur of limbs as a small shuttle craft appeared in the skies to one side coming curving in across the restless bluegreen waves it held the elevenstring which the anything legal considered had recently made for cossont having heard that ideally the instrument required four arms and hands to play properly sklom wanted a go qiria sighed this is going to sound awful isnt it cossont nodded yup she came to again there was an instant of sheer panic as she remembered the decompressing blast and the misty explosion of released air that had rolled her and the android out into the vacuum and the ironcold surface of the planet then she realised she felt all right and not in any pain and that she was warm and even comfortable she opened her eyes half expecting the roll of an oceanic swell beneath her and the white sky of a stretched awning above in a medically enabled shuttle aboard the culture ship mistake not a person standing next to her announced whoever they were they had skin the colour of brushed bronze ship avatar cossont found herself thinking the figure shrugged that was me assuming your first question would have been on the lines of where am i it told her cossont swallowed found her throat was a little sore and just nodded she managed a low grunt the bald androgynous avatar had green eyes an open honestlooking face and was dressed conventionally enough by gzilt standards cossont turned her head from side to side she was lying on a partially reclined bed still dressed in her muchpunctured trews and lords of excrement jacket the dead trooper lay still in his suit but with the helmetfront hinged back to her left inside the helmet his face didnt look right the avatar saw her looking it reached over to close the faceplate the android eglyle parinherm lay still in his technically incorrect and overstretched colonels jacket to her right he seemed no more alive than the dead trooper pyan was flapping round the roughly circular space then came fluttering closer squeaking something about her being ah alive after all hurrah at least this time cossont started to think shed managed to leave behind the then she noticed that against one bulkhead lay the dark coffinlike case of the elevenstring she closed her eyes for a moment oh for she muttered then looked at the avatar and did her best to smile youre alive youre alive pyan yelped excitedly landing on her chest and jumping around flapping at cossonts face with its corners astute as ever cossont said patting the creature with one set of arms while she looked around and took in more of her surroundings there was a sort of casual understatement common to what you might call official culture craft when it came to interior design an artful simplicity concealing gigglingly hitech shed become familiar with it during her exchange student years what she could see here appeared to display it so she was going to accept what she was being told though given the pace and severity of recent events she wasnt taking anything for granted however even if this wasnt what it looked like it was definitely better than being frozen to death in the cramped upsidedown transport or outside on the bleak hard surface of the sculpt planet she cleared her throat continued to pat the overexcited and now purring pyan and nodded towards the android lying still and unbreathing a metre away from her is he it dead she asked no the avatar said however your android companion does represent military tech in a situation of some opacity regarding factionality and in addition seems confused so i thought it best to keep it temporarily inanimate cossont looked at the avatar factionality yes im not currently sure which side it or anybody else is on or what the sides actually are the avatar smiled at her you come tagged as reserve lieutenant commander vyr cossont correct cossont nodded correct ive already introduced myself pyan announced pointing one corner at cossonts face then at the avatars the creature sighed settling flat onto cossonts chest were old friends the avatar looked askance at this but smiled briefly at the familiar pleased to meet you the avatar said to cossont and welcome aboard my names berdle im the avatar of the mistake not culture ship cossont asked just to be sure culture ship the avatar nodded slightly confused culture ship at the moment wondering why elements of the gzilt military appear to be attacking each other would you have any idea cossont had raised her head from the semireclined couch now she blew out her cheeks and let her head go back again gratitude at rescue was all very well but trust and blabbing were different she had no idea how much to reveal always assuming the ship hadnt read her mind or something already stall she thought she said mind if i ask what sort of culture ship first erratic the avatar said emphatically erratic warship not officially berdle said looking pained but also not without resources in that regard you rescued us cossont said im sorry i should have said thank you by now thank you youre welcome the avatar nodded then glanced at the dead trooper im afraid rescue came too late for your armoured friend here yes that was very cossont said trying to recall the exact sequence of events as well as she was able ah nickoftime there she hadnt forgotten all her military training one point she certainly recalled being taught was that anything that looked like an outrageous coincidence was probably enemy action the avatar nodded i only spotted you because the loitering munition subpackage saw you first and gave itself away by firing i was able to deal with it and pick you and your fellows up without too much trouble though i had to discard the craft you were in now however were hiding frankly retreated from the aftermath of the fray while i sort out whats going on the avatar glanced at the case of the elevenstring i brought that assuming it must be yours it said gesturing towards her lower set of arms hmm cossont said while its avatar talked to the human the mind was signalling xue mistake not ogsv kakistocrat got here a tad too late post systemoutskirts arrival event list attached looks like a themonthem to me but feel free to pick over snapped up a dead guy a human with a synpet and a weird musical instrument plus a fairly sharp combat android which im keeping deactivated for now specs attached for all concerned androids current instructions also attached ignore bit about it all being a sim my current status hiding while a swarm of wee angry ships boils about the place big scary ship which was most likely responsible for the attack meanwhile still in volume possibly would deeply appreciate knowing what the fuck is going on prompt answers the in thing this season apparently trust youve heard bad luck being kept in dark too reluctantly passing you over to somebody closer to the decisionmaking appreciate not being outcluded subsequently if poss take great care but smite promptly and thoroughly ifwhen situation calls so what light can you shed on whats been going on the avatar asked not much cossont said pretty confused myself i was on fzanjuym to be briefed but it all went a bit crazy before we could you know complete everything barely arrived when they were throwing us off again did you know many people on fzanjuym no im afraid its destroyed i know she thought of reikl hoped shed survived there might have been a few other survivors but im not sure few appear to have survived the initial attack and almost all of those seem to have been hunted down and killed you may be the only survivors cossont closed her eyes pyan held still the avatar was silent for a while xmsv pressure drop oue mistake not greetings good work getting to izenion so quickly you deserved to get there in time to do more if there was anything that could have been done but what youve been able to do is much appreciated uhhuh im looking for answers not a pat on the metaphorical why was i sent here whats going on this anything to do with the ablate anomaly of course i was aiming for politeness but may have achieved obsequiousness please accept my apologies youre there because the passing by spotted something heading fast for izenion from zyse and we had nothing else to go on seemed something might be going to happen and you were nearest we werent expecting a shooting war quite so quick and severe or a civil war at all high probability first attacking fourteenth with at least political backing if not instigation not yet sure why but see below ablate possibly first symptom of whatevers wrong still working on how deep the problem goes but see following were a little constrained for now by confidentiality issues but bilgebottom this is probably a zremnanter responsibility and the big s itself may be or be seen to be at risk so all a bit delicate our main interests would appear to imply cautious support for legitimate authorities which might get tricky depending on who sanctioned the ablate and fzanjuym attacks not getting too involved and certainly not revenging i see and we would be myself the lou caconym the gsvs contents may differ and just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry plus the gcu displacement activity i am and will be copying to them ill be asking the passing by and thought id drop in to join in too other c craft in gzilt space are probably going to be involved on a needtoknow basis as and when meanwhile any and all subsequently discovered info appreciated okay till ill be honest with you ms cossont berdle said at last cossont opened her eyes again the avatar was looking at her with an expression of regret given the warlike and lethal turn of events hereabouts and not being sure whose side it might be on i gave myself leave to interrogate the systems of your android companion here it told her aside from a baffling but apparently sincere belief that its been in a simulation for several hours android parinherm is that its name cossont nodded so im told yes well ad parinherm here does seem a very capable and advanced device of a type that would normally only be employed in matters of some importance to the gzilt military or gzilt in general my initial speculation was that it you and the unfortunate trooper captain here were a group assembled effectively by chance as people scrambled to get off fzanjuym as best they could during the brief period when it became clear that an attack on it was immanent however the androids most recent and still current orders are that it protect you as a matter of utmost importance and provide full and unstinting support and assistance in your mission whatever that may be its orders were frustratingly unclear on that point so given that another way of looking at your early and possibly uniquely successful escape from the destruction of the regimental hq of fzanjuym might imply that you were prioritised above even the regimental high command youll understand that this mission of yours has become a subject of some interest of to me cossont nodded no kidding she said the avatar nodded let me expand upon my honesty it continued by admitting that my presence here was not coincidental i was elsewhere in gzilt space on a relatively routine task involving helping to monitor the actions of one of the socalled scavenger groups currently present due to the upcoming subliming when i was asked to get here to the izenion system as quickly as possible though with no indication regarding exactly why the avatar looked thoughtful its a ship cossont told herself watching this little display a mind it thinks a gazillion times faster than you do it never needs to stop and think not when talking to a human this is all just for show though i was informed the avatar said that arriving with all my weapon systems fully primed and readied might be advisable uhhuh cossont said now the avatar continued i know that you know something of the culture having been with us as a student in the past so perhaps you understand that being asked as i was by some fellow ships senior fellow ships of considerable repute and responsibility in matters of intercivilisational dealings is tantamount to an order and that being requested to make my way here as quickly as i was required to meant that my engines suffered a small temporary but still significant degree of damage an actionoutcome i take no more lightly than any culture vessel then when i get here i find im four hours or so too late to prevent a hitechlevel attack on one of our gzilt hosts most important military installations an attack that might according to certain details indicative of the weapons apparently used have been carried out by another part of the gzilt military the avatar spread its hands so now you know to all intents and purposes as much as i do ms cossont and a little more of course as you i assume know what this mission of yours is while i dont frankly im still waiting on further instructions here but knowing your part in this might id hazard be quite helpful pretty much regardless right cossont swallowed you guys she said the avatar didnt have eyebrows as such just little sloped creases above each eye it raised those she stumbled on you dont i mean youre not allowed to torture people are you the avatar closed its eyes briefly before letting them flutter open again i believe the consensus is it remains one of the few temptations we dont indulge it said it could see she was still uncertain berdle sighed you are under no obligation to tell me what you dont want to tell me ms cossont nor are you being threatened you are also free to go as soon as i can find somewhere safe for you to go to at the moment there is a state of some confusion reigning within the izenion system with a lot of triggerhappy minor ships of the fourteenth milling around looking for something to shoot at and at least the chance that the craft that destroyed fzanjuym is or are still in the volume cossont came to a decision i was told to report to general reikl or the next most senior officer in the regiment she said the high command are probably all dead the avatar told her the next most senior person could be some distance down the ranks locally for all we know you are the most senior ranking officer given the outbreak of hostilities and according to my reading of the gzilt military code your reserve status has already automatically been rescinded even if you werent before you were effectively called up again as soon as the first particle beam hit the fzanjuym regimental hq cossont swallowed once more her throat was still tingling she could remember the breath whistling through her being torn out of her lungs like throwing up air i need to get to a place she said berdle assumed a studiedly neutral expression you may need to be a trifle more specific i know i know but will you take me there if i tell you where i need to go the avatar smiled tolerantly you mean you want me to commit myself to taking you somewhere no no cossont said closing her eyes and shaking her head thats not going to i can see youre a im just im sorry im not while the human was screwing up her eyes and wittering a signal arrived xmsv pressure drop oue mistake not tripped a popflag on this one com specs on your guests included the live bios name rlc vyr cossont data from one interested party assertively idents a certain individual c cit congen qiria ngaroe no further nom detail avail if not fraud semimythic figure vyr cossont met him years ago cert link likely germane you were right contentspassengers you rescued from crafteshri surface not random ms cossont may be our best lead sound out stick with the avatar smiled wearily but warmly lets suppose for the sake of brevity if nothing else it said that our interests lie parallel why dont you tell me where you want to go cossont had a think about this and couldnt see a way round it centralised dataversities she said ospin the avatar made every show of thinking about this save actually stroking its chin hmm it said at last doable but the other ships im talking to will want to know why im going there theyll probably have their own good reasons for sending me somewhere else i need to give them something if im to go charging off on the whim of a shipwrecked human i just picked up im looking for something cossont said pyan stuck one corner up into cossonts face two circles like extemporised eyes popped into existence on its folded fabric are you what it asked cossont put one hand over the familiars impromptu face and pushed it back down something i gave to one of the orders there she told berdle for safe keeping the avatar looked interested but still sceptical something to do with one of your own people cossont told it one of our people a culture person she held all four hands up this had proved to be a useful gesture when used in front of humans stopped them in their tracks normally though she had no idea how it would work on a machine cant say more for now the avatars eyes narrowed okay it said so to be clear youre happy that we head there directly i make no mention of picking you up to anybody in your own regiment and i can leave ar parinherm deactivated until we get there cossont nodded that all sounds fine to me oue mistake not xmsv pressure drop so there we are indeed ospin home of the centralised dataversities and the conglomerate of associated hangerson something qiria gave her too precious or too dangerous or something she made perhaps or recorded which shed thought to leave to posterity if its a culture artefact it might have some processing or ident tech embedded useful to have that pinned point one way to find out try and get her to be more specific though you are already the nearest asset we know of so no way apparent of getting somebody there before you arrive the avatar bowed we are now on our way to the ospin system brilliant and may i dispose of the troopers body yes wait how i thought id just leave it floating in space with the suits comms broadcasting a weak signal that ought to attract a gzilt ship before too long then he can be disposed of as you would normally think fit cossont nodded fair enough also do you have any food i am fucking famished septame i am a mildmannered man i am known for my forbearance and general good humour my tolerance and my indefatigable desire to give the other person the benefit of the doubt in all matters and at all times but in all my wide and valuable experience in matters of interspecies diplomacy i have to say that even i sir even i am shocked to find my clients and yes my friends my valued friends for so they have become and i am absolutely not ashamed to say it no in fact i am proud to proud to say it i am the liseiden legation being so roundly deceived and so illused is as appalling as it is shocking their good nature their instinctive trust their admiration for a species they have long looked up to and desired why to to praise to honour indeed by their emulation all have been taken advantage of in a most shameful and unbefitting way my dear mierbeunes banstegeyn said putting one hand on the other mans arm i hear everything you say i do i am as appalled as you are i doubt that sir i doubt that most severely they sat in a tiny bower in the parliament buildings gardens the liseiden in their strange floating fish bowls had departed in a huff to their ship in orbit leaving the humanoid iwenick ambassador mierbeunes to speak on their behalf banstegeyn had listened as patiently as he could but he was starting to wonder if the fellow was being paid by the word may we speak in absolute confidence banstegeyn said sitting still closer to the other man mierbeunes was shaking his head what price confidentiality sir when trust when honesty itself is nowhere to be found i will have this reversed banstegeyn assured the ambassador patting him gently again you have my word on it you may rely on that absolutely now mierbeunes he continued as the ambassador took a breath opened his mouth shook himself and generally showed every sign that he was working up to some fresh or at least subsequent diatribe this was not my fault even i cannot be everywhere at all times i have as much cause to feel betrayed as you and our dear liseiden friends in some ways for i put my trust in others and was let down they said they would vote one way then turned and voted another unforgivable utterly that wretch that bastard quvarond the iwenick said sounding like he was almost in tears banstegeyn had made it very clear who was behind the horrifying vote earlier yes unforgivable i know but it has happened i assure you i have looked into ways of undoing this immediately but there are no grounds this was most cunningly cunningly done believe me no grounds at all so we must fall back for now regroup but this is not the end we will prevail here dear mierbeunes and sense will be seen but you must understand that i must risk more to accomplish this and so i need you to ask one more thing of our friends when the time comes sir the ambassador said almost despairing how can i possibly please please listen mierbeunes my hope my desire always and let us not call it a price because it is more far more noble than that but my desire has always been to have this world the world of my birth my cradle my home named after one of its most loving and honoured sons sir i no please please do listen let me say just this let me say just four words will you listen please dear mierbeunes four words just four words mierbeunes sighed heavily nodded banstegeyn moved still closer whispering into the ambassadors ear mierbeunes world banstegeyns star she should have known so should qiria sklom the syloculeresembling avatar of the warm considering played the bodily acoustic antagonistic undecagonstring superbly as though born to it the ship had programmed its avatar to do so it had reviewed all the literature looked up the specs watched and analysed every available screen and soundonly recording and then simmed the resulting models exhaustively until the virtual version of the bluefurred avatar could exactly reproduce the performances of all the great virtuosi of the past the essence of all that had then been downloaded into the avatar sklom sat naturally inside the enormous instrument as though it had been designed around him grasped both bows as if theyd been made to measure produced recently grown padded finger substitutes from his paws and extended beautiful music from the very first touch of bow on string cossont listened with an expression of growing horror on her face even as she found herself close to weeping at the beauty of the music one of those pieces she knew she knew but could not quite recall the name of out of her own head its a bit rich qiria said glancing at her what she asked the tone qiria said overly full you think air pressure were too low down here its a water world she said not looking at the man as the sixlimbed creature inhabiting the elevenstring swayed limbs sawing creating beauty theres no dry high theyre supposed to sound better the higher you go in the atmosphere of your average oxygeninert rocky world qiria shrugged up to a point i dont know cossont said there was at least one music critic who said the elevenstring might keep on sounding better the higher up it was played and it might sound best of all played above the atmosphere altogether where you couldnt hear it at all still watching sklom play perfectly brilliantly heartbreakingly cossont heard qiria chuckle she had always been bad at losing things or very good if you looked at it a different way according to her mother it was practically a talent cossont had lost count of the number of people whod suggested that or at least wondered if the reason shed taken up the elevenstring rather than say the finger flute was that the instrument would be so hard to leave behind somewhere she duly lost the desire to play the elevenstring misplaced it for about fifteen years following that performance by the carelessly perfect cobbledtogether artificial version of an absurdlooking alien what was the point of taking the time learning to play anything as well as you could when a machine could use something it would think of as little better than its hand puppet to play so achingly immaculately ravishingly well exactly as though it was the creature that had spent a lifetime studying understanding and empathising with the instrument and all that it signified and meant thats how ships settle scores lass qiria told her when she opened her heart to him during a last drunken night spent on perytch iv on the great raft apranipryla they sat on deck sunawnings rolled back above just the two of them neither avatar present she watched the stars where they showed between the dark unseen masses of the silently towering cloud masses he sat with his eyes closed listening to the slow wind and the slower waves and feeling the gentle lift and fall of the great raft even past midnight the air remained warm and sticky what she sniffed wiped her nose on the back of her hand the warm considering probably felt insulted that the anything legal considered brought you here really but the warm considering likes to think it is very protective of me qiria drank from his glass it is very protective of me but certain sorts of protection even care can shade into a sort of desire for ownership certainly into a feeling that what is being protected is an earned exclusivity of access for the protector not the privacy of the protected he looked across at her his eyes were the colour of the sea she remembered dark now do you understand i suppose but i thought they were friends the two ships well they share an interest in me perhaps but whether they are friends even if they are they might still manoeuvre round each other wrestlers bodyfighters looking for advantage even if they would never press home fully and old ships can be quite quirky shall we say he sighed i have outlived one ship who was my protector back at the start bade farewell to another whod had enough of me cant say i blame it and now perhaps the warm considering feels vulnerable so it strikes out at any perceived threat it may imagine the anything legal considered wants to replace it but its unfair on me i mean what did i do be nosy be a fleetingly alive dayfly child showing an interest seen as being undeserved insufficiently respectful and the anything legal considered might be seen as presumptuous making you the elevenstring that was taken as the attack even if it was meant innocently sklom playing so well making you look inferior squashing any interest you might have had in ever wanting to master the instrument that was the counterattack cossont took a deep swallow of her drink she coughed then sniffed again yeah but i bet the alc isnt as upset as i am well that is very ship too qiria said they are as gods of old were merely imagined to be we are mud in their hands flies to be toyed with etc blah he waved one hand looked over at her they are rarely malicious never vicious not to us mainly this is because we are so far beneath them it would be demeaning to get that worked up about us and our feelings but the thing is he said drinking again the thing is they are vastly powerful artefacts with senses and abilities and strengths that we only fool ourselves we know about or understand and the subtlest most infinitesimal of their machinations can bruise us crush us utterly if it catches us wrong he gave a small laugh that was really just an exhaled breath ive watched them become so over the millennia the minds took over long ago the culture stopped being a human civilisation almost as soon as it was formed its been basically about the minds for almost all that time is that why youve stayed alive all this time is this your revenge she had meant to challenge him properly on the whole aliveforever claim tonight especially but had decided that it no longer mattered shed keep going along with his claim if it was true well good for him if it was just a yarn well that was pretty impressive too she didnt care he didnt answer for a while she thought for a moment he might have fallen asleep like old people did sometimes she found this funny nearly laughed no he said sounding thoughtful no i have a reason but its not that so do you hate it she asked keeping her voice low for that he looked mystified hate what hate the culture for what its become he looked at her laughed what are you completely insane he laughed some more quite loudly then he drained his glass glanced at hers and said we need another drink there was not much more after this they had talked earlier about a midnight swim but theyd got too drunk the swellriding motion of the raft went from being lulling to making her a little nauseous then when that passed back to being lulling again she must have fallen asleep because she woke to the sounds of seabirds mewing overhead and the sight of the sun prising open the narrow gap between the horizon and the cloud base it was cold there was a blanket over her but qiria had gone she returned to the ship later that day still a little the worse for wear and life went on most of a year later she was leaving to go back to gzilt and home again she was a little hungover after another more crowded leaving party with some of the other humans on the ship the elevenstring was a sort of guilty presence haunting her every step the floatpallet never leaving her side that was when the goldenskinned avatar of the anything legal considered had handed her the glitteringly grey cube with qirias mindstate embedded in it then bid her farewell and turned on its heel shed only accessed the soul inside the cube twice in over three years the first time was on the gzilt liner heading home to check that the voice that came out of it was really his she didnt activate either the screen or holo function and there was no builtin visual capacity in the cube at all he was grumpy eccentric opinionated and knew of everything theyd talked about up to and including their conversation on the raft on that last night so it probably was him in there or something like him at least shed asked him what it was like to be in there doing nothing but then being woken up to speak to somebody you couldnt see hed said that it was like being woken from a deep and satisfying sleep to be asked questions while you kept your eyes closed he was quite happy sight was overrated anyway it felt creepy though talking to him and the further away in time and space she drew from the hazy heat and long slow swells of perytch iv the more her scepticism about qirias claims of extreme longevity and pretty much everything else returned the grey cube was quite small and she nearly lost it a couple of times she was aware that this might really be because secretly she wanted rid of it eventually after shed stayed with her mother for a few days one time left the cube behind realised and called warib just as she was about to throw it out shed begun to doubt it would ever be safe with her then shed moved out relocated to another part of zyse and really thought she had lost the cube this time misplaced in the move it showed up eventually at the back of a drawer shed activated it one more time after that then donatedpermanently loaned it whatever to one of the secular collectionary orders in the ospin system where most of the old stuff of gzilt ages past went to be catalogued stored and cared for and almost certainly never to be either lost or looked at ever again the same fate nearly befell the elevenstring which she kept maintained and which she played briefly about once a year but that would have felt like just too much rejection keeping the ridiculous instrument somehow kept her from feeling quite so bad about abandoning qirias soul even if by now she had convinced herself again that he was just an old fraud still it was only when she was thinking of looking for a lifetask to give her something to do while she waited for the subliming to happen that she thought again of playing the thing this was a decision she would later regret often she woke up wondered where she was dim light and her augmented eyes showed her a room or cabin she didnt recognise it looked very nice though there was almost complete silence she was in the spacious shuttle craft of the culture ship the mistake not she looked over the side of the billow bed located in a little alcove off the crafts main open area another alcove closed off held the inert body of the android parinherm the elevenstring was stashed overhead somewhere in a storage locker pyan lay on the floor a dark mat it raised the tip of one corner lazily sleepily acknowledging her then went flat again she lay thinking about the day just passed shed been unconscious at least twice shed briefly met or at least seen dozens of people who were now all dead shed been rescued once twice just escaping death both times and shed been told to look for the soul of an old fraud shed met once for a few days nearly twenty years earlier when looking back shed been little more than a kid people were dying and ships damaging themselves to get her from place to place and she wasnt at all sure she was the right person to do whatever it was they were all expecting her to do soon it wouldnt matter anyway she was still going to sublime wasnt she everybody else was she supposed shed sort of have to go if everybody else did personally she wasnt sure it really mattered whether the book of truth had been based on a lie a lot of people had long half assumed that how much did it matter to others though perhaps a lot perhaps enough would that knowledge if it was true stop people subliming maybe it would so much of the whole process of deciding to make this final civilisational transition had been about mood relying on an atmosphere that involved a kind of gradually growing shared blissful resignation a feeling of inevitability had settled over the gzilt somehow selfpropagating and selfreinforcing making subliming look like just the next natural step people had been talking seriously about subliming for centuries but it was really only in the generation or two before hers that the idea had started to traverse the spectrum of likelihood in the popular imagination beginning at unthinkable progressing to absurd then going from possible but unlikely to probable and likely before eventually arriving round about the time of her birth at seemingly inevitable and anticipated and desirable would all that change if it was discovered the book of truth had been some sort of alien trick and the hallowed semiworshipped zihdren no better than charlatans some people thought the gzilt were going rather early that most speciescivs waited a little longer entered a lengthier period of etiolation before taking the plunge but then every species was different and the gzilt believed themselves especially different exceptionally different partly because of the book and what it had told them would its message being brought into doubt kick away the foundations of that selfsatisfaction and make people question the wisdom of subliming at all maybe just embarrassed if nothing else theyd want to escape the shame and uncertainty involved by hurrying into subliming with even more determination maybe only half the gzilt would go or just a fraction enough still to be viable within the sublime but leaving larger numbers behind perhaps to make their own decision at some later date so a schism beyond healing in the sublime and chaos perhaps back in the real even if the subliming still took place as planned in full would the knowledge of that lastmoment counterrevelation about the book somehow colour the gzilt experience once they had enfolded if she recalled correctly all the books and articles shed read and the programmes and discussions shed seen it would make little or no difference but nobody not even elder species whod been studying exactly this kind of stuff for aeons could be entirely sure because so little detail ever came back out of the sublime she didnt know all she could do was what shed been askedordered what she did know was that it really shouldnt be her responsibility how this panned out she was just a musician a civilian in the reserve whod once briefly bumped into an old guy that suddenly everybody wanted to talk to she just wasnt that special she was no idiot and she would happily accept that she was a very gifted musician but it ought not to be falling to her to work out any important part of this societywide alieninvolving endofdays mess maybe she should just leave qiria in peace ask the ship to take her home or to wherever or whatever had become the new hq for the regiment make her report there and then get taken back to xown the girdlecity and her apartment or just a place anywhere where she was less likely to be inside something getting shot at with hitech weaponry but shed promised reikl she would do as shed been askedordered she had been recommissioned too so even with the subliming coming up and all the usual rules and disciplines seemingly evaporating around everybody there was still duty selfrespect honour you did what you felt you had to do so as not to feel bad about yourself when you looked back later and memories the recollection of past deeds certainly survived into the sublime you were what youd done as qiria had said all those years ago and as long as you had your context you were still yourself within the great enfolded she turned over closed her eyes and hoped you could still sleep in the sublime septame banstegeyn was able to make a great show of being utterly horrified to discover that there had been some sort of attack on the regimental hq of the socialistrepublican peoples liberation regiment news of the outrage came in shortly after the vote that handed preferred partner status to the ronte and he found it easy to channel all the rage and fury he felt at that debacle into his reaction to the later even more serious news he was still angry about it when he met up with chekwri again in the special chamber deep under the parliament two thousand people chekwri in the prophets name normally there would be between four and six thousand aboard the marshal said calmly plus there were five hundred virtual souls aboard the gelishoplule but in any event septame what were you expecting of an attack to destroy a regimental hq i thought youd destroy the the thing the place the ais but to kill so many and that ship everybody on it too i mean its just terrible the ais and the high command when theyre aboard are in the best protected bits of the hq septame located right in the heart of the moon or ship whatever you want to call it chekwri sounded as unbothered as she looked she might even it occurred to banstegeyn be enjoying this he was aware that he was laying on a bit of an act himself even though there was some truth in there too hed been genuinely horrified when hed heard that as far as was known nobody had survived the attack another part of him had felt triumphant that the attack had gone so well and the information so treacherously relayed to the fourteenth had been so surgically excised but that part had to stay as secret as possible he kept that suppressed as best he could worried that if he thought about it too much it would somehow show in his face or be readable in his body language to get to them you pretty much have to destroy the hq completely chekwri concluded anyway banstegeyn said theyre military theyll have been backedup wont they they can be reactivated cant they some of them most will have been backedup within the hq itself the marshal said maybe some elsewhere not that any military or civilian court would let that influence their view regarding the culpability of the action or the severity of any punishment there should be no trial no court though should there banstegeyn said we you got away with it didnt we i mean theres not enough time and im sure i could get i could pull a string or two according to the marshal the most recent signal from the uagren had indicated that it had managed to slip away from the izenion system without being detected after dealing with the last known survivors of the hqs destruction it had pursued them to the star izenion itself contained their attempts to signal and ensured their swift termination yes we got away with it marshal chekwri said with a small humourless smile and in theory without leaving behind too obvious an attack profile a disinterested observer would probably still conclude it had been fratricidal but it could be argued otherwise and there are only eighteen days remaining to do the arguing and the stringpulling yes banstegeyn said biting his lip a little and they definitely couldnt have already the people the ais even on the hq they couldnt have sublimed by themselves early thats really not possible the people definitely not you need a presence the marshal said with the air of one addressing somebody who really ought to have been watching their own infomercials over the last umpteen years the ais almost certainly not it takes time preparation even for an ai theres some sort of blissedout trancelike state that has to be achieved first before they can haul themselves in by their own bootstraps unlikely in the circumstances mmm mmm the septame said rubbing his face good good he had been looking away so the attack it could be blamed on somebody else the marshal took a moment before answering yes it could she said slowly though the plausibility spectrum might be a little she looked up to the domed ceiling of the room restricted shall we say she looked back at the septame why did you have anybody particular in mind the ronte the ronte the marshal said she frowned i thought we just made them our official bestest friends scavenger class i think youll find that is still conditional in a way that they dont know about banstegeyn waved one hand not your concern marshal is it plausible chekwri sat back looked thoughtful not really their main force is far too far away unlikely even to get here before the subliming their tech is inadequate and their motive i cant even think what their motive might have been the ronte with culture help banstegeyn suggested the marshal actually laughed forgive me septame she said one hand held out to banstegeyn though nothing else about her demeanour seemed apologetic well that would fill the tech gap if we can put it that way but i suspect the plausibility spectrum window just closed to zero no story we come up with needs to last very long though banstegeyn said his face set in an expression of some displeasure just until the subliming septame one like that is going to struggle to last to the end of the sentence that first articulates it but there might have been a culture ship there at the sculpt planet the septame said the uagren was aware of something performing a manoeuvre called a crashstop into izenion system about four hours after the attack just from the implied initial velocity involved it reckoned if it wasnt one of ours it must be a culture ship even then hard to find a plausible contender most likely it was something called the mistake not but if it was the fuckers even faster than we thought so we could maybe claim it had a part in the attack couldnt we not really unless the culture has finally invented a time machine the septames face suddenly assumed a hard unforgiving expression i dont think he said icily this is an issue to be made light of marshal chekwri septame the marshal said levelly i am not the one coming up with laughable expostfacto combat scenarios banstegeyn glared at her for a little longer seemed to realise he was wasting his time waved one arm dismissively and said well leave that with me but lets not close anything off he took a deep breath the main thing is that the initial mission was successful the leak has been mopped up there is the possible loose end of the gelishoplule chekwri said with a tiny frown but it was destroyed too wasnt it just that was too close the uagren wasnt expecting it but yes one less asset for the fourteenth well then why is there a problem because the ship wasnt supposed to be there and the fact that it was means it was keeping quiet about its movements and it must have moved to get there at the sort of speeds ships only undertake when theyve got an urgent mission transexcercisal speeds you sim them but you dont attempt them even during fullon war games it might have been coincidence banstegeyn said or it was there for the high command if they needed transport thats kind of what were assuming for now chekwri said she shrugged anyway its vapour and the culture ships moved off seemingly without actually doing anything and now the uagrens slipped away too unnoticed as far as we know yes where did it slip away to wheres it going now didnt i mention the marshal looked surprised its following the culture ship eleven s xgsv contents may differ olou caconym ogcu displacement activity ogsv just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry oue mistake not omsv passing by and thought id drop in omsv pressure drop hello all i think weve all been brought up to speed with individual briefings where needed welcome to the new members of the group we understand the mistake not makes full speed to ospin perhaps to discover something relevant to mr qiria and hence the claimed provenance of the zr information re the bot meanwhile the passing by and thought id drop in has kindly agreed to continue to create what diplomatic pressure it can with the rump of the gzilt political power structure for myself after extensive investigations some calling in of favours and the reluctant acceptance of future obligations re the same on my part to those so confiding i have discovered there may be another way to pursue the link with the legendary gentleman xlou caconym we really are taking this persons existence as being a fact not a myth xgsv contents may differ we are it turns out that the myth which has been so carefully fostered is that his existence is mythical it would certainly appear that various ships have known of his existence over the millennia and even aided him in his efforts to stay outside the public eye and evade the kind of official annoyances such as censuses and inventories which might prove problematic to somebody of preposterous age who wished to keep quiet about it until now his mythical status has seemed charming romantic even and happily for all concerned irrelevant to matters either tactical or strategic now it has suddenly assumed a certain importance we must of course diligently and timeously pursue every avenue of investigation occurring in gzilt space however there may well be a way to reinforce and back up our inquiries working at least partly within the culture i have been in contact with a vessel which wishes to remain anonymous for now but which holds a human who may be able and persuaded to help the price would be something close to full disclosure of what we all know regarding the matter at hand both to the ship and probably it speculates the person concerned as well xgsv just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry and the contents may differ vouches for the ship and it for the human xgsv contents may differ within the usual limits yes xgsv just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry then i say go ahead xgsv contents may differ any objections no very well signal sent ill keep you all informed meanwhile after some pressure the empiricists delinquent pair the headcrash and the xenocrat have finally been persuaded to give up their smatterbagging competition at loliscombana and make haste for gzilt heading straight to zyse at the request of something called the gzilt combined regimental fleet command this would appear to be some new overview structure recently set up by this banstegeyn fellow under marshal chekwri the two ships are due there in seven days due to an agreement required to bring about the aforesaid pressure the empiricist will now become part of the group at the next signal though it has expressed a preference for haunting rather than manifesting as it were the empiricist itself now expects to be arriving at zyse in eleven or twelve days thats all for now xgsv just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry ogsv contents may differ oh hurrah now the empiricist gets to hover glowering over everything and step in when it thinks weve done enough of the hard work to make the outcome sufficiently positive to enhance its gloriousness size has its privileges more to the point we need to start thinking now about what were going to do if we do find out the truth via mr q or any other route do we tell the gzilt and if we tell do we tell only those at the top who might already knowhave guessed or do we take it upon ourselves to broadcast the embarrassing news assuming it is to all good question i suspect a vote might be called for right now personally id probably plump for shutting the hell up and letting the gzilt get on with it which begs the question why then are we bothering to hunt down this truth at all the zr asked us to help also its just interesting heres something we dont know but we can maybe find out and its something that other people dont want us to know how much more seductive can you get maybe there are some truths not worth chasing down maybe there are times when its best to remain ignorant very funny im being serious sure you are anyway how goes your batch of the simming mine is gnarlsome raspulescent grislesque never mind hitting both problems since you ask trying to work around but its getting all moral in one direction and chaotic in the other suspect its basically intrinsically unamenable on both counts but will keep on trying have a lie down as one of ones humans might say to another shut up and get back to your work as they also might say ha good simming over and outload a ship dance of celebration was required the fleet had already split into separate squadrons of eight ships apiece save for the flagship squadron of twelve ships plus the accompanying culture craft beats working and these squadrons had flown in different directions towards their appointed places of interest where they might hope to accrue technology which would prove advantageous to the ronte therefore a full fleet dance could not be performed instead a coordinated splitfleet dance would be performed each squadron and ship and crew being made conscious of the movements of all the others so that the distributed dance would be accomplished as a joyous whole virtually accordingly the dance multiple new swarmqueens brought together by advantageous zephyrs display together in the light of the two home suns at double zenith was performed to glorious effect at the respectful request of the culture ship a place was found for it to become part of the dance as well a task of honour it executed with diligence understanding and precision to the greater glory of the ronte people who had against all expectation been granted the preferred status that they had known they deserved but had doubted would be conferred the culture ship beats working accordingly accrued additional inferred alien cachet value positive honorary with madeawareness of award status deferred the fleet squadrons reconfigured to reflect their new status all but a few adjusted their courses for more important sources of technology infrastructure and territory given that these were likely now to fall to them without dispute the flagship squadron turned to set a course for zyse the gzilt capital and home system people were targeted i tell you banstegeyn yegres told him as they walked in the grounds of the trimes villa in the hills overlooking the city the parliament building shimmered whitely in the distance blurred with warm air rising the presence a dark inverted dripshape above it made tiny by the distance a pair of light cruisers their smooth kilometrelong hulls silvered hung in the air ten thousand metres above the city this was supposed to be reassuring for the remaining populace after the shock of the attack on the regimental hq of the fourteenth at eshri targeted yegres repeated glancing at banstegeyn the two crunched along a gravel path followed at a discreet distance by solbli and jevan banstegeyns chief secretary and aidedecamp were seemingly muttering to themselves partially subvocalising as they communicated elsewhere hed given them the job of continuing to try and find a way to nullify the scavenger vote earlier there had been over ten millennia of inherently convoluted and frequently murky parliamentary business all of it faithfully recorded there had to be a precedent in there somewhere it would be a start if nothing else yegres was accompanied by a floattray it held a glass and decanter he helped himself frix was offered an introduction to some girl hed had his eye on or quvaronds wife or something i dont know yenivle took a case of kolymkin something some priceless vintage yegres frowned wish the bugger had offered me that so thoughtless he shrugged shook his head not sure what jurutre was offered but seemingly something furtive regarding a child not filthy or even illegal just sad anyway it was all terribly well organised done with military precision he barked a laugh better than that actually didnt miss and hit their own people and you banstegeyn asked what did trime quvarond offer you he found it hard to keep the sneer out of his voice nothing at all dear boy yegres said amiably waving one hand around i voted against you because i just dont like you banstegeyn was stopped in his tracks he heard jevan and solbli stop at the same time gravel rasping under their feet theyd gone silent poised yegres wandered on oblivious for another couple of steps before stopping too he looked back at banstegeyn oh just kidding you on he said smiling the vote was already lost so i joined in to look less perennially obedient he frowned but you should realise septame everything is breaking down a little now including your grip what worked until now obligations understandings favours owed the promise of future advancement and the threat of secrets becoming public and so on they dont have quite the force they did before he shrugged then smiled broadly this is what you wanted ban what you worked for all this time what youve engineered end of an era ha end of the end of all eras he waved both hands this time spilling a little wine schools breaking up people are out to play scoaliera tefwe who had been a friend and a lover of ngaroe qiria long ago when he was already a very old man and she had been of conventional middle age a little under two hundred woke slowly as she had woken slowly a few dozen times over the intervening centuries only it wasnt really waking slowly she was being woken all dark at first stillness and silence too and yet the sensation that things were happening nearby and inside her head and body organs and systems and faculties being woken revived checked primed readied it was at once reassuring and somehow disappointing here we go again she thought she opened her eyes simulation said the glowing red letters along the bottom of her field of vision ah she thought whereupon the word faded away so she was still sort of asleep after all but her consciousness and sense of embodiment were being woken up she was apparently already sitting fully dressed in a chair facing a table in a large pleasantlooking room of some antiquity with a view to one side through opened floorlength windows over mountains lined with trees and a lake whose shore was lined with villages the wakes of a few boats left long white vs on the windruffled waters at the other end of the table from the windows there was a time display in an ornate wooden case she looked at the date my that had been a long sleep across the table from her there was a chair when she looked away from the time display a figure hazed from nothing through transparency into seeming solidity over the course of a couple of seconds the small pale androgynous figure now sitting opposite her appeared to be the avatar of the lsv you call this clean this was reassuring she was still where she might have expected to be the calm conventionality of the whole beingwoken process had been a fairly infallible sign that nothing was likely to be too wrong but this helped confirm it on the other hand she was usually woken lying down with time to take stock if she wanted and swing herself off the couch perhaps take the air and take in the view from the balcony and only go to sit at the table when she felt she wanted to not this time though getting the basic minimum here scoaliera the virtual avatar said smiling yc she replied the you call this clean didnt name its avatars or avatoids separately people usually just called them yc are we both well we are always good to know that your stored self and the ship carrying ityou were judged to be well according to the punctilious standards of a culture mind so she said what is it hoping youll agree to take a trip fully uploadedstyle then to be downloaded into an avatoid where why not sure where yet you might be able to help answer that yourself the why is that we need you to look for ngaroe qiria she raised one eyebrow do you now the we the ship was referring to would be either contact section or special circumstances exactly who would become clear shortly she didnt doubt the avatar nodded if youd be so kind why he might have some information it would be useful to know hes been alive for nearly ten millennia im sure he has a lot of information it would be useful to know no doubt but this is probably something quite specific what not sure but somehow relating to the shortly forthcoming sublimation of the gzilt this was news to her shed been stored this time over four hundred years earlier when as far as she could recall the gzilt had seemed no more likely to go for subliming than the culture itself that the best youve got more detail yc asked more detail you insist i do the ship told her about the intercepted message from the zihdrenremnanter and subsequent developments tefwe thought do we have a view on or interest in whether the gzilt sublime or not no take me through the levels culture as a whole no their business contact not really opinions differ mildly some temporary local upset to be expected in the short term especially relating to scavengers but all part of the process sc no stated interest probably some difference of opinion but nobody expressing not even a grumble of discussion let alone action and things are otherwise quiet so lack of interest not a result of distraction temporary or otherwise so this isnt an sc thing not directly though elements usually associated are cooperating specifically a fast ship will be made available whatevers closest to wherever you say you need to go other ships at your disposal if necessary should serial uploading and embodiment be required simming as unlikely to become an sc focus probably so why are we bothering just in case just in case what just in case it turns out to be something we should have bothered about always try to avoid setting up future opportunities for kicking yourself the yc smiled apologetically very small thing attached to very momentous thing one point three trillion people heading into the big enfold in less than twenty days from now but if the zihdrenremnanter news about the book of truth gets out that might change things and maybe it should change things but either way it would be good to know the truth even if we discover the truth we dont have to volunteer it and even if we discover the truth dont volunteer it but are asked to provide it we still dont have to though thatd be harder to justify the point is if we are asked and we havent even bothered to look we look bad and if we are asked and decide to tell what we know we want to be confident what were able to offer really is the truth or as close as we could reasonably get to it how many new faces know the old guys not a figment just one beyond reasonable doubt the gsv contents may differ there was no leak as such the ship just did some inspired digging and was owed favours by the right mix of craft though the others in the handling group will have been briefed theres a possibility the itg no fresh group nobodys heard from the interesting times gang all the while youve been stored how remiss as well as waking you with the suggestion you might care to return to the fray ive been asked to enquire if you know of any other ships that might have helped mr qiria over the years aside from the warm considering which we know about the only other one i remember was called the smile tolerantly an ancient gcu but the last i heard it was about to become eccentric or sublime or do something equally unhelpful thank you so you will recall i said i wouldnt go looking for qiria unless it was something really important are you they deeming this to be lets say suggesting rather than deeming but tell me what are your feelings mixed i dare say ill do it but im not terribly happy about it tefwe had never liked the idea of being fully downloaded into something remote who got to play at being you who thought they were you you stayed who you were but then the remote you became somebody different over time the two of you or more could be reintegrated but it was she thought an intrinsically messy process of frankly dubious morality thank you the yc said exhibiting relief may i transmit your mindstate now there are various craft dotted throughout the galaxy charged up ready to roll rude to keep them waiting i want to be kept informed about what the remotes get up to she told it tefwe had been around contacts less salubrious outskirts in one form or another for so long she could remember when there hadnt been anything called special circumstances just a bunch of ships and others that acted like it so she knew how to negotiate an agreement with a mind acting as control such that she wouldnt end up kicking herself agreed in full agreed and a noconstraints chance to negotiate over subsequent reintegration just me and it or them also agreed youll let me know which ship of course hmm tefwe sat back thought all right she said i agree done once again thank you where do you want to head for dibaldipen orbital angemars prime system the yc looked blank for a moment then said ah one of ours we might be able to work through the o hub thatd be even quicker well see hub minds can be reluctant to indulge this sort of thing without demanding to know everything there is to know do we have a full name for the guy first thing a hub minds going to ask for tefwe smiled hes so old full names hadnt been invented when he was born but if they had been hed have been tursensa ngaroe hgan qiria dam yutton and he has used that name in the past the far past thank you in any event the nearest ship is an expsychopath vfp the outstanding contribution to the historical process just a few days away yc looked puzzled dibaldipen thats where qiria is i have no idea but theres a drone there that ought to know you think itll still be there yc asked sounding a little sceptical it has been four hundred years it is retired and set in its ways gone native and to seed i suspect itll be there so if youre really so old tell me what youve learned over the years over the millennia what are the fruits of your wisdom they are remarkably few i have managed to avoid learning too many lessons that may be what keeps me alive cossont lay on her bed the grey cube with qirias mindstate inside it sat on a bedside shelf it was only the second time shed turned the cube on since returning home she the volupt and the elevenstring had just moved out of her mothers house in myon into a place of her own half the world away she was starting to make new friends but struggling to get worthwhile gigs and maybe she was feeling lonely so she said living all this time has been to no purpose basically true but that hardly distinguishes me from anybody else does it but shouldnt it or theres no point no living either never has any point or is always its own point being a naturally cheery soul i lean towards the latter however just having done more of it than another person doesnt really make much difference the voice from the grey cube paused then said although i think living so long might have persuaded me that i am not quite as pleasant a person as i once thought i was cossont presented with two opportunities to be scathing just in these last few sentences was aware she was choosing to take neither she confined herself to really said in a slightly sarcastic tone well the voice said seemingly oblivious one thing that does happen when you live a long time is that you start to realise the essential futility of so much that we do especially when you see the same patterns of behaviour repeated by succeeding generations and across different species you see the same dreams the same hopes the same ambitions and aspirations reiterated and the same actions the same courses and tactics and strategies regurgitated to the same predictable and often lamentable effects and you start to think so does it really matter why really are you bothering with all this are these not just further doomed asinine ways of attempting to fill your vacuous pointless existence wedged slivered as it is between the boundless infinitudes of dark oblivion bookending its utter triviality uhhuh she said is this a rhetorical question it is a mistaken question meaning is everywhere there is always meaning or at least all things show a disturbing tendency to have meaning ascribed to them when intelligent creatures are present its just that theres no final meaning with a capital m though the illusion that there might be is comforting for a certain class of mind the poor deluded fools i suspect from your phrasing and your tone of voice that as a little earlier you think you are being sarcastic well no matter however there is another reaction to the neverending plethora of unoriginal idiocies that life throws up with such erratic reliability besides horror and despair whats that a kind of glee once one survives the trough that comes with the understanding that people are going to go on being stupid and cruel to each other no matter what probably for ever if one survives many people choose suicide at this point instead then one starts to take the attitude oh well never mind it would be far preferable if things were better but theyre not so lets make the most of it lets see what fresh fuckwittery the dolts can contrive to torment themselves with this time not necessarily the most compassionate response indeed not but my point is that it might be the only one that lets you cope with great age without becoming a devout hermit and therefore represents a kind of filter favouring misanthropy nice people who are beginning to live to a great age as it were react with such revulsion to the burgeoning horrors that confront them they generally prefer suicide its only us slightly malevolent types who are able to survive that realisation and find a kind of pleasure or at least satisfaction in watching how the latest generation or most recently evolved species can rediscover and beat out afresh the paths to disaster ignominy and shame we had naively assumed might have become hopelessly overgrown so basically youre sticking around to watch us all fuck up yes its one of lifes few guaranteed constants cossont thought about this if thats true its a bit sad tough life is sometimes and youre right it doesnt exactly show you in the best light youre supposed to admire me for my honesty am i she said and reached over and turned the grey cube off that was when she decided shed give the cube to somebody else who might want it or at least agree to care for it twelve s this isnt ospin these arent the dataversities what the fucks going on cossont had woken from a very deep and pleasant sleep ordered breakfast and then asked the ship to show her where they were ahead view or whatever it was called the mistake not had obliged presenting the semblance of a deep screen across the bottom of her billow bed just above her toes the image it displayed was of a yelloworange sun apparently setting behind a large rocky planet with dark striated clouds half obscuring a surface of mottled darktan land and deepblue seas given that ospin was a red giant system devoid of any rocky planets this was all wrong eh what pyan yelped fluttering untidily up from where it had settled on the floor during the night not another emergency my processing isnt built to take this the ship appeared to be sinking quickly through a multiply banded set of assorted manufacturies small habs and other planetary satellites dipping rapidly into the shadow of the planet so that the sun winked out a bright spread of the satellites continued to shine against the dark surface beneath then the ship was beneath them too change of plan berdle told her the mistake nots avatar appearing in one corner of the holo face absurdly big against the landscape below youd better get dressed the image continued to show the planet getting nearer they were almost in the atmosphere the place looked familiar somehow also there was something wrong about something here but she hadnt worked out what yet where the hell are we she wailed xown in the mureite system what oh for goodness sake pyan said dramatically and flopped over backwards spread out over the bed lying limp i just fucking left xown cossont yelled watching the landscape whip past underneath thats where i started out welcome back berdle said deadpan are you getting dressed yet wait a moment cossont was staring at a black line filling the horizon ahead entirely filling the horizon ahead from one extent to the other like a vast dam across the sky is that the fucking girdlecity were just a few minutes away better get dressed fast she jumped out of bed started pulling on clothes muttering and cursing she stopped frowned sniffed looked carefully at the lords of excrement jacket everything had been cleaned and repaired not so much as a byyourfuckingleave she muttered pulling on freshly polished boots she glanced at the screen again thin wispy cloud not far below sea beneath darkblue sky above still sea beneath a few filmy wisps of cloud shot past level wait a fucking she said just as shed started pushing her fingers through her unkempt hair were not even on the fucking ship are we itd never come this far down no were not berdle said we left about five minutes ago were still on the shuttle yes she looked round the cabin so where are you a double door parted in one wall and berdle sat in some sort of complicated seat with a giant screen in front turned and looked back at her hello the avatar waved why the fuck are we why am i back on xown she strode through to what proved to be a flight deck or something and threw herself down in the seat beside berdles she glared at him as hard as she could but the avatar appeared impervious the wrapscreen showed the girdlecity as a black mass filling most of the view spread across the huge nearvertical cliff confronting them there were hints and slivers of something lighter than its pitchblack surface where patches of darkblue sky were visible through its filigree of openwork sections we are here berdle told her because while you were asleep more information came in as information is prone to do and one particular detail passed on by another ship involved happened to be the culture full name of your friend mr qiria which would be tursensa ngaroe hgan qiria dam yutton but i didnt cossont started to say then stopped herself berdle nodded no you didnt say who the culture person was you were talking about earlier but wed already kind of worked that out oh had you now cossont said trying to sound defiant but feeling herself sink a little further into the seat first thing i did with the full name was plug it into all the data ive been soaking up since ive been here gzilt stuff berdle said all the gzilt stuff everything not officially private anyway and in amongst the passenger manifests for people making a trip to xown five years ago a name popped out yutten turse claimed to be peace faction culture and to have come all the way from somewhere called neressi which on closer inspection is somewhere that doesnt exist or is perhaps a colloquial name for a place nobodys catalogued properly berdle glanced at her grinning tut tut the girdlecity really did fill the screen now cossont had to crane her neck to see anything that wasnt the vast dark mass of it right at the top she could see the sky speckled with stars and orbiting sats but it was just a thin band above the striated black curtain of the structure below there were waves the girdlecity was crossing sea she knew it did in two places here its colossal architecture was even more mindboggling than anywhere else on its circuit of the planet it extended undersea still growing in girth descending an extra kilometre beneath the waves if this was the hzu sea an extra two and half thousand metres if this was ocean doesnt that count as an amateur mistake if hes trying to keep off everybodys sensors cossont asked berdle shrugged i suppose but in the end hes just an old guy trying to stay out of the limelight not some sc superagent on a mission not the end of the world for him if he is discovered anyway not like hes going to get slung into prison or have his memories wiped hed become the object of some unwanted media attention for a while and thered be a bunch of minds whod love to talk to him but hed be able to disappear again fairly quickly with the cooperation of a mind and ship or two berdle paused looked quizzically at her youve met him maybe hed like to get caught briefly just to get to feel important like hes not been forgotten maybe cossont crossed all four of her arms forming a cage across her chest are you saying he really is the age he says he is berdle nodded looks like it and you think this is going to be him have been him this yutten turse guy ran all this past a few stats packages berdle said and even allowing for appropriate fuzzinesses of intraspecies spelling phonetics and pronunciation the match chances are better than seventy per cent the avatar nodded at a subscreen set into the haptic band set across the centre of the encompassing main screen got some screen of him a holo leapt out miniaturised the first item was a still image of a man in late middle age wearing a big silly grin a loud shirt and a grass hat is that supposed to be him cossont asked she was still feeling cross berdle nodded that is mr yutten turse of whoknowswhereville looks nothing like him she snorted though zooming in on the face there might have been something familiar about his eyes hmm berdle said obviously unconcerned still he was coming here to the girdlecity cossont snorted again you might be surprised how little that narrows things down spaceship berdle smiled but didnt look at her i am aware of the structures dimensions on the subscreen some moving footage followed the man seemed to get slightly lost in the transit lounge apparently unsure which way to go until he left led by a modest amount of luggage on a helpful floattrolley maybe he did walk a little like qiria maybe he disappeared a still of his face came back then was replaced by another set of screen images which seemed to show him leaving again dressed similarly but wearing big dark glasses if anything he looked even less sure where he was going on the way back the images faded away and the subscreen went dark ahead the view was all girdlecity even sitting forwards craning her neck there was no sign of sky or sea a few tiny dim lights were only now starting to prick the obsidian surface of the structure berdle must have thought an instruction to the shuttle because the screen extended smoothly silently backwards so that the view now took in directly overhead and a little further back looking straight up she could see the sky again she nearly said thank you but didnt hello that looks familiar pyan said flapping and hopping through to sit on her lap girdlecity huh cossont said oh pyan said hzu coast thatll be pretty how fucking dare qiria come back to where she lived not just the civilisation but the system the planet where she lived and not look her up what sort of friend was that so do we think he was looking for somebody she asked according to his subsequent movements happily documented by your fearsomely watchful aliens bureau it seems he was looking for a particular person or for a particular artefactlocation berdle said which he seems to have found where in the girdlecity cossont asked this wasnt the bit she knew this was about a third of the way round the planet from kwaalon and the great plains he was going to launch falls berdle said thats nowhere near here she told him i know the artefactlocation concerned has moved oh yeah yes its an airship one of the internals only one still moving apparently ive heard of it she told the avatar apparently its famous berdle confirmed well notorious hope youre ready for a party she told the avatar one eyebrow hoisted even though it wasnt looking at her the avatars head tipped briefly ready for anything cossont was silent for a moment as the girdlecity drifted closer and more detail began to show on the dark textures of its surface it really didnt look all that much like him she said what has that got to do with anything the avatar glanced at her seventy per cent represents a good chance cossont frowned suddenly where did you say he claimed to have come from neressi spell that the avatar spelled it for her in marain she asked frown deepening she listened again nodded ahead whole constellations of lights were brightening into existence against the surface of the girdlecity as they continued to draw closer they were still fifteen or twenty kilometres out she sighed its probably better than seventy per cent she told the avatar when he was on perytch iv he was you know transplanted had his consciousness transferred into this gigantic sea creature he took the name isseren berdle nodded ahha the avatar said softly oh pyan said after a moment backwards yes cossont said sourly fucking backwards jelwilin keril the iwenick cultural mission director left the strategic outreach element chohchohcho in his private yacht at least he was able to call his yacht something sensible hed named it iberre in honour of his fathermother and he was allowed to refer to it as a yacht not a spacecapable interelement transportation component or something of similar overliteral awkwardness he looked back at the strategic outreach element chohchohcho it hung against the starflecked blackness a svelte grey flattened ellipsoid strategic outreach element everybody else would just call it a ship still this was modernday thinking ship just sounded a bit crude apparently redolent of bulbous wooden things rolling around on the high seas infested with parasites and stinking with drunken seasick sailors even the cultures partiality to the term unit used by the iwenick until recently in a slightly cringing attempt at flattery was seen as not fully expressing the powers and capabilities of the vessels it was attached to apparently according to the advisors who made their living thinking about this sort of thing unit was for ever associated with the words light industrial he turned back never mind but he knew exactly why he was thinking about names the liseiden flagship the collective purposes vessel gellemtyanasoolanafawaya the name of some ancient liseiden hero so acceptable if unpronounceable swelled in the screen a welllit hangar already open for the yacht the ship was a jumbled mass of planes and edges barely even symmetrical from certain angles it was supposed to appear complicated and impressive but to jelwilin it just looked like a confused slump of differentsized boxes like the result of an accident in a warehouse jelwilin inspected his image in a screen full uniform perfectly groomed manicured and madeup he looked great not that an alien would notice or care this could all have been done in a few minutes of course by him simply holoing in to the liseiden ships command deck and talking to them that way but there were times when a personal appearance even a personal appearance inside a glorified fish bowl was the only way to show the desired portion of respect and the liseiden were certainly expecting the full serving to compensate for the wound to their pride and expectations theyd just experienced at the hands of the perfidious gzilt hence the ship rendezvous and the facetoface cultural mission director jelwilin patted down his uniform jacket adjusted a cuff he felt the need to urinate but he had already done so before leaving the ship and knew this was simply the result of nerves he wants more team principal tyun roared the sonofarunt sitting comfortably enough but very conscious that he was contained within a perfectly transparent sphere exposed to inspection from every side in front of the array of sinuously floating liseiden their bodies waving to and fro like fat scarves in a slowmotion breeze cultural mission director jelwilin set his face as well as he could in an expression of understanding and shared pain the liseiden might not have any officers capable of interpreting his species facial expressions but they would probably have ais which could might as well make the effort anyway it was all integral to the part he was playing here method diplomacy the septame tells us that he is confident that he can overturn the decision jelwilin said calmly and ambassador mierbeunes is very and very encouragingly insistent that the septame will be able to make this happen ambassador mierbeunes is one of our most senior and most experienced diplomats as well as one of the most successful i have known him for many years and i dont think i have ever seen him more confident in the abilities of another person the thing is that to achieve what he believes he can septame banstegeyn assures us that he needs to take greater risks than those he has taken until now accordingly he asks for a greater reward and frankly team principal what he asks for is something it costs you next to nothing to agree to and i emphasise agree to rather than say grant or even fully commit to in your soul tyuns voice seemed to come from somewhere underneath the little stalkseat jelwilin was sitting on it was disconcerting as was being able to hear the liseidens actual words booming liquidly if muffled against the surface of the transparent sphere a sort of continuous guttural bubbling that barely preceded the translated version im taking the point that it might seem to cost us next to nothing to agree to renaming a local star the team principal said but what i want to ask is is that actually relevant i think we risk being seen to reward failure if we concede this cultural mission director we are not here to indulge that sort of shit if i might liken this to a military campaign team principal jelwilin said what we have suffered here is a reverse and a battle lost certainly but it is not final defeat and the war remains winnable of course i appreciate that one might in theory be seen to be rewarding failure but a side that shoots its generals after every lost battle would quickly run out of good generals as well as bad or end up with a population of generals who did everything they could to avoid all battles even the most winnable just in case but that is not the alternative jelwilin tyun said the alternative is to take a more robust attitude to securing the acquisition of the technology and infrastructure weve been seeking and thought wed been promised let me be clear we have the firepower to enforce the bargain that was already arrived at we cannot and we will not be seen to be weak in this jelwilin looked pained obviously we all hope that using force of arms would be regarded as very much the last resort i need hardly tell you sir that hostilities are always expensive of reputation as well as materiel and it would i am sure you would agree be better to settle this without recourse to the uncertainties and chaos of war particularly given the already engaged interest of another leveleight civ in the shape of the culture and especially following the still unexplained attack on the regimental hq of the fourteenth on eshri things are very delicately poised after that and even without the involvement of the culture i need hardly point out that although much depleted the gzilt fleet remains an extremely powerful force please team principal let me report back to ambassador mierbeunes that i have your permission to continue to pursue a more peaceful solution yes well the culture appears to have lost interest in us tyun said the ship they sent as escort apparently found more pressing matters to attend to i understood that a thugclass fast picket was on its way to join you jelwilin said hmm not if i can help it were going to try throwing them off with some judicious redispositioning a moment tyun said the transparent sphere surrounding jelwilin suddenly became opaque leaving the cultural mission director staring at a fuzzy representation of the liseiden ships command centre he could make out some deep distantsounding bubbling noises that were doubtless the liseiden discussing the matter amongst themselves the firepower to enforce the bargain indeed that was overly aggressive what were they playing at hadnt the liseiden simmed this if there was a proper shooting war between the liseiden and the ronte even the victor would probably come out of it worse off in the long term never mind any formal censure from the galactic council highlevel players like the culture would take a dim view of a situation that looked entirely soluble by peaceful means suddenly tipping into the mayhem of a war no matter how small whoever instigated that would find themselves on the wrong end of not just one short leash but several as a bunch of their betters suddenly decided they ought to keep a closer eye on these semibarbarians whod had the temerity to threaten the galactic peace and all for some territory and leftbehind tech or at least a cut of it in the iwenicks case jelwilin had always respected those civilisations that left their achievements behind intact when they sublimed so that the results of their labour and intellects could be put to use by others but he could appreciate that there were reasons beyond a childish desire to take your toys with you for razing your structures flattening your cities collapsing your habitats deleting all the hitechenabling information you possessed and destroying anything else that people might fight over well save for planets he supposed some species did it that way and apparently a proportion always had ever since subliming began so there was no particular disgrace in it the gzilt though had never been big on razing or burning certainly not just for the sake of it they were and had always been pragmatic rather than revengeful supposedly this was one of the behaviours theyd contributed to the demeanour of the culture right at the beginning even though they hadnt actually joined it the sphere went transparent again discussions had obviously been concluded jelwilin sat up straight and assumed an expression of cautious optimism mission director tyun said we have come to a decision the liseiden sounded curt severe jelwilin felt relief tyun would be compensating for a decision to keep talking rather than to get threatening a conciliatory regretful or solemn tone would have augured very badly you may authorise ambassador mierbeunes to continue negotiations and continue our earlier course regarding the septame jelwilin bowed thank you team principal furthermore to reinforce the perception of our commitment to a successful outcome regarding the totality of this matter we shall redisposition the main portion of our fleet to zyse jelwilin assumed his pained expression again team principal if i might make a suggestion no thank you mission director the liseiden said politely but firmly you may not kindly dont make the mistake of imagining youre entering this discussion anywhere else than following its conclusion the actions ive outlined are settled they will not be subject to further negotiation we thank you for your assistance and valued advice jelwilin knew when to give way with grace i understand team principal he said i wish us both the best fortune in these endeavours thank you tyun said his body making slow s shapes in some unseen current you may return to your element as far as anybody could tell the girdlecity of xown had been built by the longsublimed werpesh simply because they could nearly thirty thousand kilometres long the structure formed a single vast bracelet round the equator of the world ashaped in crosssection over a hundred kilometres across at the base dozens at the top and just under two hundred klicks high so tall that it protruded above almost all the atmosphere providing xown with a spaceport sufficiently prodigious to have served a thousand such worlds the girdlecity was a single colossal barricade an everywherepierced wall halving the planet even building on this extraordinary scale there were touches of elegance to its design because xown was a planet with little wobble and the girdlecity straddled the equator it effectively sat between the narrow tropic lines only ever casting a shadow on lower parts of itself never on the planets surface and it could easily have been bigger as a nongravitationally constrained selfsupporting artefact or colloquially just an ng which sort of stood for neutralgravity structure it was formed from a mix of ordinary and exotic materials that meant only a tiny fraction of its mass actually imposed itself as weight upon either its own lower reaches or on the crust of the planet beneath had they wanted the werpesh could have arranged it so that where the mighty structures foundations met xowns bedrock they exerted a gentle upward pull rather than a modest load artefacts constructed using this sort of technology could be extended indefinitely with no annoying tendency to collapse in on themselves most such structures were in space and some were much bigger the girdlecity had the additional problem of needing to keep its structural elements tuned for their precise place within the slope of the planets gravity well but this had proved trivial even so while nearly weightless the artefact still had colossal mass and its effect on xowns total angular momentum had been to slow down the planets rotation by nearly a second a year as was the case with each of their impressive if arguably rather pointless sculpt worlds the main point of the girdlecity as far as its builders had been concerned appeared to have been the building of it rather than any subsequent use it might have been put to the werpesh famously secretive and opaquely motivated had never chosen to elaborate on their reasons for constructing it some of them had lived in portions of it and it did function as a kind of grossly overengineered spaceport but the main use it might have had attracting alien tourists wasnt one the werpesh had ever chosen to promote most of the time before the werpesh finally did the decent thing and sublimed the sparsely populated barely used girdlecity had just sort of sat there the gzilt had made better use of it but even then in nearly eleven thousand years of custodianship they had never even come close to filling it entirely and rarely ventured into the sections above the level where there was natural atmosphere to breathe leaving over ninety per cent of it empty of life space habitats for all their even greater intrinsic artificiality were capable of providing far more agreeable pleasantly rural less brutally industrialfeeling places in which to live still the girdlecity had contained many billions and even now contained hundreds of millions of gzilt and in a sense of course it still contained those billions except the vast majority of them were stored existing in a state of suspended animation awaiting the prewaking just before the instigation that would itself lead to their new life in the sublime there had always been open tunnels within the girdlecity routes some never less than half a kilometre in diameter within the length of it that stretched throughout its fretwork of vast tubes girders walls and components both structural and habitative to provide a kind of largescale transport network for airships the great dirigibles had plied the vast tunnels for millennia carrying people and occasionally goods even though there were many faster more efficient systems built into the girdlecity airship travel was seen as romantic now as far as was known there was only one airship still making its way through the structure and it was home to the last party the last party was a fiveyearlong debaucheriad aboard the airship equatorial it circled the girdlecity once a year the last revolution being timed to coincide with the instigation when a day or two earlier the equatorial would arrive back at launch falls the section of the girdlecity where it had begun its voyage the equatorial was a fairly conventional vacuum dirigible two kilometres long and four hundred metres across it had always been a kind of contained cruise ship slipping through the structure of the girdlecity taking one or other of the various routes made available through the structure by the network of tunnels throughways and assorted larger spaces dispersed within it nominally owned by one of the many collectives which had been set up within the girdlecity it had been due to cease flying with all the other ships as the waking population of the structure dwindled to less than five per cent of what it had once been then a small group within the collective one based on the pursuit of art and experimental living so it had been pretty eccentric even at the best of times had suggested keeping the thing flying right to the end and making a proper goingaway party of its last flight the original idea had been to have a yearlong party one that would have started over four years after the suggestion was first put forward but such was the excitement the idea produced nobody could stand to wait that long so the plan was altered it would be a fiveyearlong party and fate help all who dared to sail on it the small group within the collective had been led or at least fronted by a man called ximenyr whod been into a variety of radical body arts and amendment he was one of the founding members of the last party and one of a few dozen out of the original few hundred who had started out who was still determinedly partying most of the rest had given up burned out been hospitalised or died a few had even got religion the party hadnt fizzled out though quite the opposite it had grown in size over the years as more and more people heard about it and arrived to sample its delights until it entirely filled the two thousand accommodation and social units aboard the ship and there was supposedly a waiting list if you wanted to stay overnight though given that one of the few guiding principles of the last party was that all things ought to be as shambolic as possible at all times and it had entirely lived up to this rule nobody really took this restriction especially seriously unless of course the sheer weight of bodies aboard led to the airship starting to bump along the bottom of its openwork tunnel in which case it was time to restore buoyancy by disposing of any blatantly unnecessary items such as articles of furniture are we clear consider me briefed how close do you have to get just inside might make all the difference though the closer to the man himself the better roat preferably roat reach out and touch this sort of distance okay hear me via the earbud yes she said shed never been great at subvocalising do you want me to wake the android eglyle parinherm not especially and how necessary is it that your familiar accompanies us very i wasnt really talking to you ms cossont lets compromise on moderately it can be useful useful pyan screeched is that all can you ask it to be discreet certainly pyan until further notice shut the fuck up well really cossont took a step back is your face she said your heads changing berdle shrugged in the last few moments the avatar had gone from its earlier appearance to looking like a tall handsome gzilt male with a dramatically sculpted facial bone structure just fitting in the avatar said reasonably berdle definitely looked masculine now cossont thought its whole body had altered ithe looked like a strikingly attractive and leanly fit gzilt male how are you doing this she asked skilfully berdle replied expressionless what want said the face in front of them you can hear cant you cossont said speaking loudly and clearly and even bending forward a little the person in front of them appeared to have a round flat face exactly like a large plate of alphabet soup a yellowbrown liquid holding lots of little white letters somehow held at ninety degrees to vertical when it looked convincingly as though the whole lot should be spilling to the floor of the balcony hangar it could cossont supposed be a screen or more likely a holo but when shed first bent forward to look at it shed have sworn it was real there was vapour coming off it and she could smell the soup otherwise the person looked physically relatively normal either a thin female or a rather hippy male of average height dressed in a motley of violently spraypainted military gear the top sides and chin of hisher head flowed seemingly naturally into the bowl making up their face the letters in the soup bowl rearranged themselves course hear berdle standing alongside cossont crossed one leg over the other put his arm over her shoulders and drew deeply on a fat drug stick he held the breath grinned at the person with the soupbowl face berdle was dressed like a badly lagged pipe a thick red pillowy material wrapping his limbs and torso was held in place by looselooking black straps wed like to talk to the master of the revels cossont said a little more quietly this was the title ximenyr had taken nearly a year earlier for the last circuit of the girdlecity and the planet before the big enfold who cossont sighed ximenyr berdle brushed some ash off cossonts jacket she hadnt even seen berdle change in some moment between the module touching down on a deserted piazza about a kilometre above the waves and them walking off the deck into the structure hed gone from whatever hed been wearing earlier she couldnt remember to what he was wearing now shed looked back frowned and started wondering if this was some projection shed stepped towards him as theyd walked rubbed his sleeve fabric between thumb and finger nope real sorry shed said none taken hed replied shed looked askance maybe shed thought it was some ultraclever and adaptable piece or pieces of clothing or along with his whole faceandbodyaltering thing earlier maybe it meant the entire avatar was some sort of swarmbeing made up of tiny machines shed looked him hard in the eye from very close up but hed still contrived to look like flesh and blood shed pulled away sorry again still none taken she was dressed as she had been freshly repaired lords of excrement jacket included with pyan rolled into a scarf shape and draped over her shoulders theyd walked through the empty tubularity of the local architecture their way lit by a few small and distant lights theyd come to a long gallery where the nose of the airship was just starting to slide past like a colossal walkingspeed tube train it was moving so slowly shed thought it had stopped but it was still going if only at a slow stroll thirty thousand klicks in a year she supposed that did equate to strolling speed the tunnel the ship moved in looked like a gigantic woven basket of dark filaments stretching to a hazed curve within the greater structural and architectural elements of the girdlecity a few random lights shone so few the average unaided eye would have interpreted the gloom as something close to utter darkness good to have augmentation shed thought shed glanced at the avatar berdle probably had eyes that could see through planets a thin metal net strung on stanchions protected them from the drop into the curve of tunnel the moleculethin hull of the ship was probably red underneath though it was hard to tell in the paltry light because the surface was so thoroughly splattered with a berserk variety of patterns diagrams logos and drawings some illuminated some moving some looping some not and covered with flowing bedraggled banners gently waving pennants and ragged flags the nose pushed slowly out past them right to left the ship seeming to broaden out to meet them metre by metre until it looked like the airship was going to collide with the gallery she and berdle stood on there was what looked like a trench gouged in the side of the ship level with the gallery they stood on lateral hangarbalcony the avatar had sent then he looked down and she had the very strong impression berdle was looking somehow through the airship hmm taking on a lot of water interesting the hangarbalcony was closed off with what were probably lengths of diamond film one of these had slid aside just as that part of the trench had started to pass them berdle had reached down lifted the metal net away the floor of the hangarbalcony was so close they could just step onto it across a halfmetre gap that had been when the soupfaced person had come almost tumbling out of a nearby door and asked them what want combat arbite just behind the door berdle had told cossont onelegged combat arbite with no ammunition and the mechanical equivalent of arthritis but just sos you know the letters forming the word who had taken their time drifting apart now they slipped beneath the yellowbrown surface while others surfaced and rearranged themselves asleep said the word now seemingly floating on the soupface the avatar was exhaling blowing the smoke out his ears no hes not he said quietly via cossonts earbud berdle claimed to have something called a scout missile within metres of ximenyr inserted into his cabin without him noticing while the module had still been approaching the girdlecity shall i call him now we could just call him cossont said to the soupface glancing at berdle or we could wait that would only be polite tell him an old friend of mr qiria is here to see him we ought to call him times awasting appointment thats very kind cossont said but we wont need one im sure hell see us as soon as he can the soupface jerked back a little as though surprised new letters arranged themselves quickly struggling to find enough room in the space available nodoyo uhav eapp some letters disappeared the rest rearranged themselves again no you have app no we dont cossont said patiently this is in its own small way urgent you dont have appointments for urgent things as a rule do you no appoint wed be terribly obliged if youd just let him know were here right now dont forget to mention mr qirias name sorry sorry cossont said she tapped one booted foot while the letters swam about still asleep call berdle sent well call him ourselves cossont said thank you calling ybl cheers im sure we will be lucky cossont said ringing somewhere beyond the openwork wall behind them the grey light of dawn was introducing a wash of colour into the detail of the giant multiply pierced tunnel about to get bright berdle sent via the earbud little danger still ringing an instant later light burst and flooded all around them and a cacophony assailed cossonts ears she looked round and saw the basketwork of the great open tunnel and the parts of the structure immediately beyond all lit up with stuttering pulses of multicoloured light deep thuds were followed by the crackling boom and partial echo of air explosions dawn firewks how quaint cossont said hes picked up over to you mr ximenyr cossont said turning slightly away from the soupface who is this a deep male voice drawled he sounded sleepy or just stoned my name is vyr cossont im wait wait girl how did you get through to nobodys supposed to be privacied berdle sent to her voice quick and clipped continues able to get through on this without cossont heard ximenyrs voice continue even though the connection was quiet you any the human voice said yeah check the bases pull it off replay veer kossin or something yeah the man said via the earbud again howd you get through to me here not supposed to accept his voice trailed off it sounded like hed been distracted an acolyte is performing a sexual act on mr ximenyr berdle reported cossont listened to some heavy breathing for a moment or two then said quite loudly im an old friend of mr qiria he visited you five years ago at the start of the party do you remember him the heavy breathing stopped mr ximenyr has pushed the acolyte away berdle reported the sexual act has ceased well if i dont something or somebody will remember for me im sure ximenyr said assuming this actually happened who did you say again my name is vyr cossont friend of ngaroe qiria id like to meet with you yeah how did you get through mr ximenyr is gesturing to call up a video feed from here the avatar sent berdle sucked on the drug stick bent close to cossonts ear and said with great difficulty cossont coughed waved the resulting smoke away the avatar smiled up at the corner of the hangarbalcony cossont looked too but couldnt see anything hi the avatar said and waved the rest of the smoke came out of his ears again uhhuh the deep voice said and you would be dying to meet you master of the revels sir berdle said cheerily my names berdle cossont heard silence on the connection for a moment hes saying berdle nothing vyr cossont mil reserve just civilian muso yeah wearing an excrements top thats cool enough and look at her id wait a fucking minute i remember that name no qiria fucking qiria fella fuck him fuck yeah okay yeah yeah okay yeah fucking welcome aboard classical girl yeah right hello mr ximenyr come on in welcome hope youre broadminded please come in the wide door behind the soupfaced person was swung open by a onelegged combat arbite which made a slight creaking noise as it gestured for them to enter berdle handed the machine the stub of his blunt and it stood there looking at the drug stick as they followed the soupfaced person into the body of the airship the last party had grown to become several parties there were at least four party cycles happening at any one point roughly aligned with the times of the daynight cycle so that no matter when you felt like partying even if it was immediately after your own randomly houred breakfast there would be a party just started or just about to start led by the soupfaced person they walked through broad open spaces redlit where it looked like the party had been over for some time small floating machines were picking up litter the air was full of strange scents and the space partfull of ceilingsuspended pods and shallow platforms and things like giant hammocks many of them transparent or translucent there was quite a lot of sex happening cossont noticed in and on the hammocks and the air was also full of soft cries the occasional piercing scream and all the other sounds associated with physical passion unreservedly expressed cossont felt herself becoming surprisingly hot and bothered by it all usually she had pretty good control of herself the atmosphere is saturated with compounds sexually stimulating to your species berdle sent as they ducked underneath an especially large hammock where several frolicking bedfellows were contorting themselves in particularly inventive combinations sexscent city pyan agreed through the earbud a male face and torso swung down from a nearby platform sweating breathing hard the man smiled at vyr like the arms he said breathlessly youd be so very welcome then with a look of slight surprise he was pulled back up onto the platform by a couple of grinning naked women who blew kisses at an uncomprehending berdle a short dark corridor led to another wide room where extravagantly costumed masked people danced some to a spacefilling song of powerful beats and trembling ululations some to rhythms they were hearing through earbuds their wildly eccentric motions at odds with everybody else around them dark sound space ahead the soupfaced person told them walking backwards down another intervening corridor face turned towards them about to get really loud cossont told berdle i can feel it through my feet he told her cossont closed her ears double doors led to the darksound dance floor where the whole point was to hear with every part of your body except your ears it was nightdark strobelit with each staccato pulse of light the nearnaked dancers looked like marionettes frozen in poses of either ecstasy or torment cossont heard the wild thudding music through the jelly in her eyes via her lungs resonating in the long bones of her arms and legs fuck me thats loud pyan said in her ear voice made high and tinny to get through cossont opened her mouth a little to say shh to the creature as she did so it was as though her mouth filled with noise she felt her teeth vibrate berdle looked unaffected away from the darksound room they passed a large circular oil swimming pool with a screen ceiling where people seemed to be practising synchronised floating in giant flowerlike patterns they climbed through a couple of levels where tiredbuthappylooking people were eating at tables though one section seemed to be set aside for foodfights with one just starting then ascended via an adventurously steep and long escalator to a tall broad corridor with what appeared to be a transparent ceiling showing the fretwork of tunnel moving slowly past above ximenyrs quarters lay through a sequence of intestinally curved squishily floored roundsection corridors hung with what looked like folds and strands of gaudy hallucinatory vivid seaweeds all moving and waving on invisible currents thats interesting berdle sent just lost feed from my scout missile that is a little worrying finally at a doorway bearing an unmistakable resemblance to a vulva the soupfaced person bowed and left them the vulva irised opening this is a bit gross isnt it pyan whispered its not just me thinking this no cossont followed berdle down a short narrow corridor cossonts earbud beeped to signal it was losing all external reception something it had never done anywhere else in or on the girdlecity in all the years shed lived within it they arrived into a chamber where a large barrelchested handsomelooking man with vivid red skin and an unfeasible number of phalluses reclined on a giant tipped bed he was smiling at them he wore a roomylooking pair of shorts so the penis hed likely been born with was perhaps the only one not visible but he had plenty of others sprouting short stubby flaccid from at least forty points on his body including four on his calves six on each thigh similar numbers on his upper and lower arms and one each where the nipples would have been on a mammal his head feet and hands looked normal around his thick neck lay something like a giant charm bracelet weighed down with chunky trinkets mostly jewel encrusted he was attended by naked people mostly females all of whom had the heads of animals and mythical creatures again berdle sent the atmosphere is full of sexually stimulating compounds and ive found my scout missile ohoh as we say im going to stop communicating like this for now unless theres an emergency may no longer be secure ohoh cossont was thinking again pyan whispered overdosing on sheer vulgarity the roof above was not transparent but fashioned from some luxuriantly thick crimson ruched material centrally gathered so that it looked like a sphincter and glistening as though dripping wet ms berdle ms cossont the man said in his deep thick voice pleased to meet you then he opened his mouth a little wider and let a very long tongue snake out and delicately lick at first one eyebrow then the other shaping them both neatly into place the tongue disappeared again he opened his eyes wide he had fabulously pale blue irises almost shining his eyeballs rolled back into their sockets the blue irises disappearing they were replaced from below by dark red irises which rose into place and steadied excuse me he said these pupils work better in daylight he smiled widely showing very white teeth and to your familiar ms cossont pyan isnt it welcome to you too permission to speak pyan said sounding excited no cossont said quietly then to ximenyr said hello thank you for seeing us and thank you for watching me ximenyr said and unhooked something from his collar of trinkets holding it up in front of his face and inspecting it it looked like a short thin pen or stylus of some sort barely bigger than a childs finger ximenyr looked at berdle your life signs are weirder than the ladys familiar so im guessing this belongs to you it does berdle said my apologies i was concerned you might refuse to see us initially and we might need some help in securing an audience also i am impressed you were able to sense its presence and capture it congratulations thank you flattery is always so satisfying ximenyr said with what certainly appeared to be a sort of beatific sincerity especially from he waved one long elegant hand exquisitely manicured an avatar avatoid something of that nature indeed of the culture vessel mistake not there was just a hint of a pause cossont was fairly sure their host was listening on his own earbud voyeured upon by a culture mind ximenyr said sounding impressed i really am flattered though there is an allhours feed from about eight different cameras all centred on this bed right here so im not entirely sure why you bothered video only at points so maybe you wanted the audio yeah anyway he nodded behind them please take a seat two of the animalheaded people the heads looked as real alive and functional as every other part of their human bodies set two tall chairs behind them cossont and berdle both sat the dozen or so unusually headed people stood arms folded round the curved wall of the cabin ximenyr held the tiny scout missile out im going to keep this okay the little machine was secured to his charm necklace by an extendible chain i would prefer to have it returned berdle said dont doubt ximenyr said but you did invade my privacy there was some muffled spluttering and laughing at this from the people looking on and ximenyrs face split into a smile again he glanced round some of the animalheaded people hey you know what i mean he looked back at berdle grinning anyway might let you have this back but you need something from me im sort of supposing otherwise why in an entirely cogent sense would you be here in the first place hmm he set the tiny missile back where it had been resting on his chest between what looked like an androids thumb and a thick crystal cylinder striped with encrusted jewels its about ngaroe qiria cossont said glancing at berdle gathered ximenyr nodded at her like the arms incidentally who did that for you frex gerunke know him helped teach him nice work all working fine perfectly and a lords jacket you really into them i played with them she confessed briefly she really might have to change out of the lords of excrement jacket at some point she realised really youre not mentioned in the playgraphy he seemed to think unless youre sister euphoria cossont sighed guilty ximenyr smiled broadly estimable ms cossont ive played tenser a little sling never the volupt hear its harder a little four arms make it easier no thats for the elevenstring ha the undecagonstring ive heard theyre fucking insane no thats just those who play them ximenyr laughed nobodys played an elevenstring for the party you could audition while youre here that would help round things off thank you but we have more urgent business she told him yes my friend mr qiria my friend too cossont said really ximenyr looked sceptical cant recall him mentioning you cossont sighed again that does not surprise me ximenyr grinned stroked his chin well his memories are a little compartmentalised how do you know him i met him twenty years ago just after hed been a leviathid a sea monster for decades on a place called perytch iv we only met up for a few days but we talked a lot how about you oh i knew him before then back when i was horribly young and doing he held up one arm and stroked a couple of the penises on it this kind of thing for what passes for a living amongst us he shrugged rather than a profound artistic statement both exploring and interrogating the prospect of a willed selfextinctive event being sold as a civilisational phasechange cum level upgrade when he was here five years ago berdle said was mr qiria having some sculption carried out the man in the bed frowned sculption now theres a word i havent heard for a while technically correct i guess used to be called plastic surgery or bodily amendment or well lots of things he waved one arm again anyway im afraid thats a private matter mr berdle i can neither confirm nor deny and all that shit may we simply ask why was he here then berdle asked still not going to tell you fella ximenyr said shaking his head qiria and i are old pals thats all i can say met him a few times last time just as the party was starting but he was friends with my mother and with her father before her so i guess hes pretty ancient even by culture standards and i wont be giving away too much if i say hes sort of a profound throwback physiologically anyway by true culture genetech criteria i dont know what sort of weird congenital mixture of geriatric bloodlines he draws his particular bucketful of the vital fluids from but its pretty endspectrum whatever it is i can tell you that did he leave anything with you cossont asked the master of the revels shrugged nothing important maybe a present or two he was sort of intermittently generous anyway why is he in some sort of trouble ximenyr looked from cossont to berdle how official is this visit cossont leaned forward he didnt leave you a mindstate device or anything ximenyr laughed why on zyse xown or anywhere would he do that he cossont began about to say that qiria had given her such a device then remembering that she hadnt told berdle this was what she was looking for at the ospin dataversities shed nearly given that away she wondered how much she already had berdle had already cut in he might have wanted to back himself up ximenyr shook his head doubt that he was always kind of resistant regarding that sort of duplicated soul stuff do you know where else he might have gone when he was in gzilt cossont asked no ximenyr said secretive old boy how about you vyr did he come to visit you no she admitted oh feeling jilted ximenyr said softly with a look of exaggerated sympathy we were never friends like that you dont have to be you just have to care what people think of you he brought his blue irises rolling down for a moment looked at her then let them roll back up again to be replaced by the red ones if its any consolation i know he visited gzilt at least once without bothering to come see me didnt even call he looked at berdle we never did settle how official this visit is berdle nodded officiality is a slippery concept in the culture ximenyr laughed well he said arching his back and stretching all the penises gave a little jerk as though they were separate tiny animals just waking this has all been very interesting however things have recharged and there is frankly pleasure to be secured you may have to excuse me shortly he looked at cossont and berdle as all the animal and beastheaded people joined him on the bed kneeling by him and reaching out to stroke and caress him all the phalluses dotted over ximenyrs body started very slowly to fatten and lever themselves upright wavy lines like veins that probably did not all carry blood were beginning to show all over his body bulging and rippling beneath his rubyred skin unless youd like to join in of course he said brightly both either of you youd be very welcome plenty of time plenty of places well turn the ag on shortly ill start my last heart and we can get things going on my back i would pyan said in cossonts earbud cossont looked down at the creature okay i could just leave you here she told it never mind thank you she said to ximenyr but wed best be on our way mr berdle ximenyr said taking one hand from between the legs of one of the girls stroking him he detached the little scout missile from his neckchain you may have this back excuse the ah berdle had to kneel onelegged on the bed between ximenyrs legs and two naked bodies to retrieve the scout missile thank you he said always keep on the right side of the culture ximenyr murmured dreamily his face just becoming obscured by a young man straddling him very little of his body was visible now though what was was clearly quite excited you really are no fun pyan said petulant as they descended the alarmingly long and steep escalator with the soupfaced person leading the way in the cavernous space above and in front of them an energetic game of sorball had begun with people in transparent spherical suitspheres leaping about in a zerog volume pinging off the inside walls of a giant diamond glass sphere forty metres across tough cossont said then turned to berdle but could only get to the point where she opened her mouth to speak before he turned to her and said later so she said they were back aboard the module it had met them on a landing platform which cantilevered out from the mass of the girdlecity like a round tray on an outstretched arm the craft started to pull away going astern to avoid some overhanging architecture a few kilometres above mr ximenyr has access to some surprisingly sophisticated tech berdle said lowering himself onto a lounge couch and examining the scout missile and some d shielding of course which is why we had to get in there not just prurience then pyan said aloud but was ignored they found and disabled this with embarrassing ease berdle said rolling the scout missile around on his palm ah the little machine suddenly came alive and leapt into the air above his hand it twisted quickly this way and that as though confused at having just woken up most of the walls of the modules living area had seemingly turned transparent allowing a vertiginous view of the hzu coast beneath as the module tipped twisted and then reared suddenly upwards ribbons of ochre and jade stitched by slowspreading breakers of alabaster white the land and the shallow margins of the sea seemed to sink away beneath them like something dropped the girdlecity was a dark wall they climbed magically without touching hurtling silently back to the stars cossont tore her gaze from the view and said but did you find anything berdle frowned no i was rather hoping for some sort of data store with information on mr q something that would be kept close to ximenyr but there was nothing relevant anywhere on the airship ive copied everything i found to the ship mind to see if theres some really clever cryptography in the storage but it doesnt look promising nothing in all that stuff round his neck there was a minimal amount of processing left in the android digit which was anyway unpowered there was a dedicated digital timeto device functioning and correctly synchronised to the millisecond but with zero spare capacity a defunct model of an ancient waverian zoehn dynasty spaceship itself based on a primitively early form of processor technology called a vacuum tube again with minimal and extremely crude processing long burned out a crystal container holding some animal or vegetable matter two or three berries or small fruits i believe the baculum from a vimownian woller with an embedded particlechip probably from a hunters homing round and a lastditch corp minicollar subsaver hairtriggered to intervene should any of the gentlemans hearts give out yeah he said something about starting his last heart he has four the avatar looked thoughtful that is a lot of vasocongestive tissue to support i suppose again minimal processing involved just enough to do its job and no more everything else was just dumb matter processfree so nothing nothing relevant as far as i can tell the avatar smiled at cossont so onwards and outwards to ospin and the dataversities she found herself smiling back one request she said what could you keep that look if you like berdle looked puzzled why it suits well it just looks good the avatar shrugged okay are you still being affected by those sexually stimulating compounds pyan asked through her earbud cossont used a finger to flick one corner of the creature it yelped and unwound itself from round her neck flapping away from her in a flurry of melodramatic movement the culture craft continues to adhere to local legal velocity limitations but is about to leave the atmosphere the combat arbite uhtryn said if it is to be engaged this would be the last chance colonel agansu felt like he was suspended in space just above the planet of xown staring down at its browngreen land the whitelined coast of hzu and the greenblue waters of the sea the girdlecity was a thick dark rim round the world hazing and disappearing to the horizon in each direction he watched the dot that was the culture module rising quickly upwards through the atmosphere count down that time would you uhtryn he asked the arbite what do we have from the girdlecity eight seconds screen just coming in as the combat arbite spoke the words a virtual screen appeared in front of agansu showing from above an elegant piazza with a small culture craft sitting on it and two people walking away from it two people male unidentified female cossont vyr lieutenant commander reserve the fourteenth seven additional mattiform familiar or pet present wrapped round the females neck where did they go as projected the airship equatorial it has shielding making it impossible to surveille from outside they spent twentytwo minutes inside six additional male figure negative bio likely avatar type unclear probing resistant without sensorial aggression colonel agansu watched the tiny culture ship rise towards space seemingly almost straight at him of course he was not really exposed to the void he was floating instead within his virtual environment deep inside the uagren he spent most of his time here now revved up to maximum speed absorbed by the utterly fascinating view of space ahead and around as enhanced by the ships sensor arrays the full radiation spectrum was signified by textures implicit in the spread of colours information in every form leapt out when you inspected something and vectors and relative speeds were displayed around every object when not gazing out fascinated at this the colonel dived deeper into the data reservoirs trying to find and match up any details of relevance to the mission this contributed relatively little in absolute terms to the efforts the ships own subsidiary ais and virtualcrew datamining specialists and their subroutines were making but it was still worthwhile additional work and had the effect of continually reinforcing his own understanding he spent little time genuinely in his own body now conscious of lying on the couch beside the combat arbite buried deep in the ship he was still aware that his physical body resided there and was being looked after fed evacuated made to twitch so that his muscles did not start to atrophy but he really lived in this virtual environment now he felt cleaner and more pure in here somehow and quicker though still so much slower than the ship crew the combat arbite uhtryn had begun to help him colonel the captain of the uagren communicated that culture ships getting ready to head off we need to decide whether were going to keep on following or not who might be five uhtryn said on the airship it is the location for a longterm celebration the arbite told him no known participants known to be known to the female spool up captain agansu said make us ready to go spooling up everything on the female musician uhtryn said classed resident of girdlecity xown section kwaalon greater without absent from residence for the past six nights four girdlecity systems unable to provide more data on recent whereabouts females mother is warib any sign they picked anything up from the airship no additional data from girdlecity interior accessed screen audio the same couple were visible from some distance away standing on a long balcony set into the side of a messily accoutred and barely moving red airship they were talking to somebody with an oddlooking face and wearing a strange combination of semimilitary clothing a hissy slightly phased version of a womans voice said wed to talk to the master of revels there was another word a little later but it was too faint to catch three improve on that final word she says already fully processed unable to improve data ais indicate hypothesised title the master of the revels probably refers to one ximenyr artist nominal spokesperson for the last party as longterm celebration known agansu had to decide what to do follow the culture ship or investigate where the avatar and the female had gone and who they might have seen in theory both could be accomplished but only if he entrusted one of the tasks to somebody else and he was loath to do this he might go down to the planet himself and investigate this master of the revels fellow while the combat arbite stayed with the uagren or he might stay with the ship as it continued to follow the culture vessel and delegate the onplanet job to some other entity from the ship as well as the various different types of combat and other arbites it held androids capable of passing for bio all fully programmable he wanted to do both at once he wanted to be in two places at once in theory this was possible in a way using mindstate recording and transcription technology and one of the more specialised androids at the ships disposal he could replicate himself putting his consciousness into the machine but he didnt like the idea never had and felt that it constituted a security risk as well with every copying event more than one person one entity at least suddenly knew what only he was supposed to know or he could leave a copy of himself on board the ship perhaps even one living and thinking at the same speed as the virtual crew while he this physical body removed itself from its haven its little kernelspace in the heart of the ship and took a small craft down to the surface of the world below two said the combat arbite the culture ship had appeared to be heading somewhere quite different when it had suddenly veered offcourse and crashstopped here at xown it had been impossible to tell exactly where it had been heading ships rarely just flew straight for their destination choosing to introduce long random curves into their courses just to frustrate anybody trying to work out where they were going it meant they travelled a few per cent further than they would have done taking a perfectly direct route but it was usually judged to be worth the time penalty the uagren too had had to make an unexpected crashstop the very violence of which might have betrayed its presence to the culture ship the crew thought they had got away with it but there was no way to be sure yet one captain you have my mindstate mapped yes implant it into one of the bioplausible androids forthwith and send it down to the planet have it walk a little way ahead of the airship ready to board it on our future signal leave a liaise instruction with the local authorities and keep the android updated with ze stand down there will be no need to attack or disable the culture craft it has left the the arbite started to say then paused it is gone it has been displaced woh the disloc officer said look at those distances heavy duty ship moving off fast the navigation officer said as i was saying leave a liaise instruction with the local authorities and keep the android updated with all relevant information faster than it was the captain sounded worried can we stay with that marginal the drives officer said random spiralling the targeting officer said maybe it did see us the android mindstate imprinting is not instant the externaltech officer told agansu eighty seconds required from now to disloc for imprint and readybody captain agansu said is there time have we eighty seconds to spare before having to move off including move then disloc under acceleration increasing distance the captain said nav disloc talked said the navigation officer no not even twenty disloc agrees already starting to lose the quarrys track the targeting officer said ninety per cent we can take same general heading and still find but no guarantees track still fading the navigation officer said its building in more random eightynine per cent colonel the captain said we cant program the android and be sure we can still follow the ship eightyseven per cent agansu thought percentage likelihood of reacquiring the culture ship if we stay to the eightysecond mark less than one program android agansu said despatch back to xown in small craft that works back here in a few hours lets do that please move off immediately captain moving could still plonk the oid now zap the cols ms to it after the special tactics officer said he was agansu had noticed prone to such compressive communication i realise agansu said i am unwilling to do that your choice captain agansu said do you think the culture vessel has seen us too early to tell it moved off in a hurry and it did displace disloc the module rather than wait for it so either it did or thinks it might have or its suddenly in a real hurry itd have dislocd the craft inatmosphere if it had been in a real hurry sir the disloc officer said or moff remotedeed the individs left the mod the special tactics officer contributed opaquely all true the captain said or fresh news just came in or it half suspected it had a tail and wanted to catch us off guard drives how smooth was our moveoff pretty good in our top centile good as theirs not quite that was tight as efficient a kickaway as ive seen think we have to assume it might have seen us the captain announced suggest we follow anyway act as though not colonel i agree agansu said then shifted to a onetoone private channel but captain if it is the case that we have been discovered was it anyone aboards fault no not in my opinion colonel really really we are carving right up hard against the operational envelope of this ship colonel fractions away from our neverexceeds and even a little over the factory settings in some cases where we know she can take it and the crew are better than the ship they always are if our crashstop alerted the culture ship this time then you could replay it a million times over with other crews or fresher crews or more experienced crews and it always would thats just how the physics works i take comfort in the loyalty and faith you display towards your crew captain my crew are loyal to me colonel i am only loyal to the regiment and gzilt also faith is belief without reason we operate on reason and nothing but i have zero faith in my crew just absolute confidence hmm that is well said i happily withdraw any suggestion that part of your crew might have been at fault and i am happy to match and share that confidence glad to hear it shall we rejoin the congregation amusing lets thirteen s xgsv contents may differ olsv you call this clean hello ms tefwe is en route yes transmitted received and being reembodied and are we any further forward regarding whatever ship or ships might have been helping mr qiria in the past barely i have contacted the anything legal considered and tried again to contact the warm considering the former appears willing to help but says that it has had no contact with or knowledge of mr qiria since visiting perytch iv twenty years ago with ms cossont the latter seems to be on a retreat or is unavailable for some other reason i have contacted its original home gsv the a fine disregard for awkward facts and its most recent homecontact the gsv teething problems requesting both to ask the warm considering to get in touch i suggest that all interested parties do all they can through any contacts they may have to find andor contact the warm considering andor any other ship or entity that might have been helping mr qiria recently the warm considering is the last ship known to have facilitated mr qiria in his travels and efforts to stay out of the public gaze but it might have been superseded it might also be worth attempting to contact any extant ships or entities known to have helped him before the warm considering i believe a ship called the smile tolerantly fulfilled this role though i am having difficulty contacting it again any help would be appreciated i have instigated a search for data on any other such vessels but it has so far met only with subtle obstruction whether this may count as some sort of success is moot ill pass the word along may i allow your identity to be known by the others i suppose so sooner or later somebody would have collated my search requests with those doubtless soon to be forthcoming from others and made the connection welcome to the club he was always surprised how hard it was to see cities from space you worked out where they must be from knowing how they looked on maps but they never leapt out at you in reality the way they did in diagrammatic form even when you could make out the city and it was one that you knew well you sometimes needed help to find where important buildings and landmarks were even though they ought to be obvious septame banstegeyn gazed down at what his implants assured him was the location of the parliament complex in myon but without the overlay hed have struggled to identify it how important it had always seemed how important it genuinely was to the lives of so many and yet how tiny how insignificant he sighed looked away took in the whole sweep of the planet of zyse well as much as he could see from the orbital base which was only a few hundred kilometres up so incapable of providing a view of the entire globe ah the fabulous solidity of a planet banstegeyns world it had always sounded so good to him so fitting so lasting now perhaps banstegeyns star instead it was no sacrifice stars could last longer than planets and once you had secured the agreement the commitment of those who would inherit responsibility for them it cost them nothing really to grant such a wish of course it would never stick unless there was a good reason for such an honour any idiot could secure some upandcoming primitives agreement that oh yes theyd rename a planet or a star after them and if they had any sense at all know in their heart that it was an agreement so easily made because it could be so easily broken but there was weight to his claim for such an accolade he had shepherded a whole people to their destiny brought them on shown them what they knew they wanted anyway or what they would want in time even if there had been nobody with the vision and the foresight to show them was that not worth a world or a star even having a star named after oneself didnt really mean that much there were hundreds of millions of them in the galaxy and many had stupid meaningless or hopelessly obscure names in some ways it seemed so little to ask septame a voice said thank you so much for seeing me the avatar ziborlun bowed from the doorway of the spherical observation pod it smiled its silverskinned face lit by the soft glow of the light reflecting from the planet beneath ziborlun banstegeyn said there was a particular way of saying somebodys name you pronounced it as you gave a small sigh that informed them assuming they had the wit to recognise the sign that they were being seen as an indulgence as a duty even when really you had so many more important matters to attend to it was in that manner that the septame had said the avatars name the avatar being an avatar picked up the signal immediately the smile turned selfdeprecatory almost apologetic and the creature said i wont keep you long septame it is a busy time banstegeyn agreed the avatar floated into the pod as the door shushed closed behind it ziborlun immediately assumed a very natural and relaxedlooking position ankles together knees splayed it hovered in midair a couple of metres away from banstegeyn as steady as if it had a metal rod protruding from its back anchoring it to the wall a metre behind banstegeyn had never seen anybody maintain such a static position in a weightless environment well it was a ship avatar he supposed it ought to be good at this sort of thing he on the other hand was burred onto a drysticky patch near the viewing port by part of his zerog suit and yet he was still sort of moving around a bit yes the avatar said sadly busy given the shocking event at eshri what ought to be a time of contemplation and quiet preparation becomes a time of mourning bitterness and even recrimination i just wanted to reiterate the cultures condolences and to reinforce our offer of help both much appreciated i hope you will take it as a sign of our confident closeness not our arrogance that we had assumed no less sometimes what goes without saying is best said anyway the avatar said smiling banstegeyn smiled too politely but kept quiet it was slightly less rude than saying well if thats all or glancing at his timeto you will of course also have our help in the search for the culprits thank you indeed and we may shortly be able to make good on that offer oh how so this hed be prepared to admit had his attention luckily we had a ship in the volume quite shortly after the attack on the hq of the fourteenth it thought it best to leave almost immediately in case in the ensuing confusion it was mistaken for a hostile however it was able to take certain readings that might help in any investigation into the attack really and what would those readings indicate it is too early to say the avatar said apologetically besides it might be best for us preferentially and initially at least to present the data raw rather than interpreted lest we be seen to be trying to influence the investigation so youre willing to submit this data to the relevant authorities banstegeyn asked indeed i take it youre aware that ive appointed the first the home regiment to look into the matter hmm the avatar said with an odd tight expression on its face banstegeyn reckoned hed learned to read avatar expressions pretty well over the years if the creature had held up a sign saying yeah are you sure about that the signal would hardly have been any clearer that is not what one would normally expect is it normally a combined regimental committee would perform such a task banstegeyn agreed however given the time constraints imposed by the upcoming instigation the depletion of the relevant ranks due to storage and the disarray within so much of the fleet due to the number of ships that have already sublimed it was decided that as the single most cohesive element of the defence forces still functioning the first ought to shoulder the load so that is not just an interim measure the avatar asked there seemed to be some confusion i thought you might know better than anybody what was planned banstegeyn smiled i am a mere septame not the president or a trime or a general but to the best of my knowledge first will be allowed to continue to pursue the investigation until a satisfactory conclusion is reached that would be my suggestion at least i see ill let the relevant ships know we have yet to decide whether the information we hold would help or hinder the investigation that would be your choice if i may touch on another matter i think we were all surprised at the result of the decision regarding the scavenging situation and would hope that this will not lead to any unpleasantness we would accordingly like to offer the cooperation of the ships which are accompanying elements of the liseiden and ronte fleets your fleet people are already aware of their names locations and so on but please allow us to work with you to prevent any conflicts of any nature between the parties involved that is kind and thoughtful banstegeyn said he gave a tight little smile of his own glanced at the viewing port towards the planet thank you for your time septame my pleasure my only regret is that there is so little of it to go around at the moment the avatar unfolded itself as the door behind it opened it flowed gracefully through the doorway banstegeyn heard it exchange a few words with his adc and secretary waiting outside he turned his attention back to the port and the view of zyse listening to jevan and solbli enter with a rustling of clothes he heard the door close theyd already called with the gist of it bad news nothing at all he said turning back to them jevan and solbli both looked solemn and tired jevan looked as unkempt as he ever did and solbli very nearly looked her age he supposed he ought to feel flattered they had spent so much of their own real time searching for a solution rather than just leaving agents and datatrawls to do all the work for them nothing septame jevan said with a sigh they did in the end care about him banstegeyn realised a lot more than he really cared about them which was the right way round and made their devotion all the sweeter in a way trime quvarond was very careful to follow all procedures correctly solbli added the same was true of orpe the presidents adc was here on the orbital base too for the same regimentsponsored security conference there ought to be time for some zerog sex later he thought the experience was a little overrated personally though the girl seemed to like it the real pleasure he felt lay more in being able to watch the planet turn beneath you as you fucked there was something very satisfying about that he hoped it would still feel as satisfying even though this time he would not be looking down on it knowing that one day it would carry his name we are here because somebody destroyed an entire regimental hq and fate alone knows what else we are not far off being at war arguably if we were technically at war would that jevan was already shaking his head im afraid not septame you might persuade the president not to sign the order solbli suggested with a thin smile banstegeyn didnt even pretend to smile the president was dutybound to sign everything put in front of him or her up to and including an order for his or her own execution in theory not that that principle had been tested for eleven millennia even then even at death a politician could just come back being backedup at the start of your term was part of the deal and if you were killed during your time in office you got reembodied wonderful disincentive for assassination banstegeyn had always appreciated it there was some delay in between forty days was it or thirty to allow time for a clone of the deceased to be grown and implanted with their most recent backup and people got shuffled around to take your place in the meantime but then you just resumed your post or you could take part in a subsequent election if youd been in the last year of your term now he thought about it there was some sort of then he had to look away from jevan and solbli because hed just had an idea and the audacity of it the sheer daggerlike simplicity and directness of it had all but taken his breath away he yawned spreading his arms giving himself a chance to shiver to tremble without it looking suspicious and said smiling well there we are some you lose he looked at his timeto shrugged in fifteen days it wont matter a damn anyway jevan and solbli looked relieved and a little surprised the representative of the culture ship of the scree class the beats working was warmly welcomed into the principal shared gallery space of the squadron and fleet flagship interstitialexploratory vessel melancholia enshrines all triumph by ossebri haldesib swarmprince and subswarm divisional head gifts were exchanged and although the culture representative one jonsker apcandrechenat was unable to ingest a welcoming libation in the fullest sense it nevertheless absorbed a portion into its chemical analysis unit and graciously accepted the remainder on board itself to be returned to the ship the beats working later where it would be treated with all due respect great respect had already been shown it had been decided after consultation with the appropriate experts expert systems and reference library resources aboard the melancholia enshrines all triumph in the act of sending a mechanical but fully sentient device to represent the culture ship beats working as the machine was able to exist within the melancholia enshrines all triumph nakedly without any sort of exosuit this would not have been possible had one of the tiny number of humans aboard the culture vessel been allocated to represent it drones were known in theory to be of at least equal intelligence to culture humans and were generally adjudged in practice to be of somewhat greater intelligence by both ronte fleet intelligence and by most leading academics in respectable universities and other respected institutions of higher learning within the ronte transcooperative domain using models of intelligence that more fully expressed the true essence of what intelligence actually was objectively that the drone jonsker apcandrechenat had been sent to talk with ossebri haldesib was therefore no insult and indeed to the contrary was a mark of great respect conferring as it did a greater implicit closeness to the culture ships motherqueen mind which itself represented a tiny but true sliver of the great hivemind that was the entire culture the swarmprince and subswarm divisional head accordingly met the drone personally and had ordered his principal nextthreeinline officers of seniority to accompany him in his progress through the ship to the meeting and to be present at the meeting itself as well as making sure that his intelligence and translational officers and their respective deputies were present and fully briefed of course as protocol demanded initial formalities safely completed continuing formalities satisfactorily under way in the shape of correct poses gestures scents and manners of speaking the business of the meeting might be allowed to begin the ship beats working would beg to be permitted to assist the glorious squadron of the ronte which it is its privilege to escort to be so empowered would allow the beats working to begin to repay and reflect some of the great esteem which it has earned in being permitted to escort the exalted squadron this is indeed an honourable conception the swarmprince replied after the briefest of consultations with his servant officers what form would this assistance take the swarmprince was known for his almost shocking incisiveness and the brevity of his locution this assistance would take the form of a series of longrange ship dances performed serially between the culture ship beats working and each of the squadron ships in turn involving them together travelling at enhanced rates of velocity in the direction already so wisely chosen by the squadron namely towards the planet of zyse in the system of gzilt the culture ship beats working would dance if such a thing might be contemplated and then allowed with each of the squadron ships in turn to the outskirts of the system or to near to that limit and then return to the remainder of the fleet to shipdance with the next ship and so on until all twelve vessels have been danced with there was consultation this dance or series of dances the swarmprince said it would honour the ronte and the culture equally it would and be performed for its own sake indeed and it might also result in the squadron arriving at the gzilt system some appreciable amount of time earlier of course that has been considered that has though of course this would be of subsidiary importance how much earlier might our arrival be has this been computed it has the reformed squadron would arrive at the gzilt system outskirts in nine days time rather than at our current rate of progress nearly twenty this would cause our esteemed escort the culture ship beats working no risk of damage it would not swarmprince the field structure of the culture ship beats working would be swelled to accommodate each ronte ship in turn and the resulting squadronoftwo would make its way as an entity to the designated volume on the system approaches there was consultation i must insist the swarmprince said that you accept i am most serious and settled in my view that this is a most generous and thoughtful offer but one that we could not possibly accept out of our respect for the good culture ship beats working we could not possibly ask such an onerous and mighty task of it and therefore with all gratitude we must decline said kind and generous and thoughtful offer the culture ship beats working had done its homework on the ronte and their customs and mores and the results of that study had been presented to the drone jonsker apcandrechenat which did not as a result just accept this apparently fairly finalsounding no instead it kept on arguing knowing that for a matter of such importance involving the prickly issue of ronte pride anywhere between four and six cycles of offer consultation and regretful rejection might have to be endured before the offer was finally accepted the offer was duly accepted on the sixth iteration counting the initial one later that day the beats working started ferrying the ronte squadron one by one to the outskirts of the gzilt system quite far out for the first one the rest gradually closer and closer so that by the time it had delivered the last one they would all be chugging along under their own power in pretty much their standard formation this was a much less boring task than strolling along at a few per cent of its own highest velocity while the ronte squadron made full speed for them to gzilt scoaliera tefwe woke slowly as she had woken slowly a few dozen times over the intervening centuries only it wasnt really waking slowly she was being woken all dark at first stillness and silence too and yet the sensation that things were happening nearby and inside her head and body organs and systems and faculties being woken revived checked primed readied it was at once reassuring and somehow disappointing here we go again she thought she opened her eyes the word simulation which was what she expected to see first albeit briefly wasnt there she blinked looked around she was floating in some sort of suspensor field in air in a human or humanoid body dressed in some clingy but lightly puffed coverall which left only her feet hands and head exposed she was at fortyfive degrees to the floor looking down a tiny sleek ship drone so tiny and sleek it might have passed for a knife missile was at eyelevel looking at her the room around her appeared to be medical unit standard ms tefwe the drone said she was being tipped slowly backwards to an upright position and lowered towards the deck she cleared her throat reporting she said remembering the earlier simulated conversation with the you call this clean where she was now would be under the control of either a cooperative hub mind or a special circumstances expsychopathclass very fast picket from the look of the drone she was guessing the latter welcome aboard the vfp outstanding contribution to the historical process the drone said confirming her guess just as her feet met the deck she felt her weight transfer to the soles of her feet through the gently squashed flesh to her bones her body whatever field had been supporting her ebbed away and she felt planted properly reembodied reverser field please she said one sprang up in front of her between her and the drone she looked like her old self precisely so thank you the field vanished the little drone said we are entering the outskirts of the angemars prime system en route for dibaldipen orbital would you care to specify a particular plate on the orbital honn plate she told it honn course adjusted is there anything else you require breakfast being prepared your specified waking default thank you please call ahead to xunpum livery chyantya honn and reserve a mount an aphore for an openended minimum fourday hire assure them i am suitably experienced with such animals but kindly do not reveal my identity the little drone suddenly developed an aura field turning a crisp bluegrey a mount an animal it said four days i had rather envisaged displacing you at submillimetre accuracy precisely where you want to go tefwe rose and fell on the balls of her feet flexed her hands into fists and relaxed again im sure she said however the person im going to see is something of a stickler in such matters certain standards have to be maintained designated procedures adhered to i am far from being guaranteed an audience at all if i dont turn up looking like ive been travelling for a while i am almost certain to be ignored the little drone was silent for a moment then said couldnt you just pretend no and ill be honest could be five days maybe more four days is just the travelling time i was under the impression that the whole point of this exercise was to expedite matters as swiftly as possible it is what would be the journey time from the present location of the blueclass lsv you call this clean to dibaldipen orbital by the fastest very fast picket approximately one hundred and thirtytwo days well there you are then but once youve seen the person you could come straight back with the information you require or simply transmit it to be passed on to any subsequent reembodiment in any event there would be no need to return slowly in theory in practice the person concerned might check up on the manner of my return become upset and refuse to see me on any subsequent occasion would any subsequent occasion on which you might wish to visit this person plausibly carry the same moral weight or general significance as the present one in which it has been judged worth effectively putting the entire fast picket fleet at your disposal other commitments allowing probably not though who can say please consider carefully the wisdom of transmitting to me any novelgermane information immediately upon receipt and returning as rapidly as possible i will i take the point that my future relations with the person concerned are of relatively little consequence the person concerned sounds to be polite eccentric that would be polite to the point of overgenerosity tefwe said awkward tetchy and unreasonable might be closer to the truth would the person concerned be an exceptionally old human no tefwe said the person concerned is an exceptionally old drone the ship drones aura flashed amused red then disappeared ill see how that breakfasts coming along followed maybe how maybe about fourteen per cent maybe averaged averaged from what what does that even mean averaged from different scenarios in ambient peacetime the likelihood would be less than five per cent in allout wartime closer to forty per cent how does that average out at fourteen there are other scenarios to be taken into account the avatar told her then theres weighting cossont opened her mouth to query that as well then decided it wasnt worth it you generally start to react to anything over fifteen per cent berdle said apparently trying to be helpful pyan made a throatclearing noise are we in any danger it asked a little the avatar admitted then do you carry lifeboats berdle looked at cossont is it being serious about as serious as it knows how to seem i was being serious be quiet this is my life too shut up cossont looked at berdle does this change anything they were still in the module sitting on comfortable but ordinarylooking couches the avatar lounged elegantly it may be best to lose them before we visit ospin berdle said or employ some method to obscure your exact destination which of course i have yet to learn ill tell you when we get there cossont said feeling oddly guilty shit when do we get there shed just remembered alarmingly that when shed taken a clipper to get out to ospin on the occasion shed gone there to deposit the glittering grey cube holding qirias mindstate the voyage had lasted weeks if it took that long this time the subliming would already have happened by the time they got there in about eightyfive hours less if we hurry why dont we hurry because to do so will damage my engines they are still repairing themselves after my dash to izenion so how are you going to lose the ship that might be following us with difficulty possibly so what was the other alternative employ some method to obscure your exact destination that should be easier the android eglyle parinherm might be useful at that point id like to wake it fine by me see if you can convince it its not all a sim xlou caconym omsv pressure drop so our little group has grown with the inclusion of the you call this clean as well as the empiricist and something called the smile tolerantly is another accomplice of the longlived mr q only looking at my edition of the relevant ship lists the smile tolerantly disappeared up its own wazoo some years before the warm considering was even built and was itself only brought into being just under four thousand years ago so leaving open the question of who else might have been aiding and abetting the elusive geezer in the various meantimes any ideas none further research is required wait i want to write that down fourteen s does she touch you like this ah ah yes very much like that just like that and kiss you like this somewhat like that only a little like that only a little she kisses me differently oh this is not i shouldnt i really shouldnt be telling you any of this this is so you are the most terrible man i know i know i hate myself am i not just the most terrible terrible man you are i dont know oh now what let me see does she kiss you like that no again no not quite like that in some other way in some other way how many ways are there to kiss i i really have no idea i am not so well versed as you might lets see well then now she kisses let me see more lightly just as passionately but with less less less intensity less muscularity muscularity i think that is the word and with the touching is it like this oh ah yes sometimes though yes her hands her fingers like this no not something like her hands see are more slender the fingers are longer they are more delicate yours are fuller more filling yes and grasping grasping grasping im shocked virisse am i really grasping ha i mean hungry given to clutching gripping even grabbing and now grabbing good gracious you grabbed me dont you remember that first time when we were in the garden of the parliament that evening you said you wanted to talk about some longterm aspect of her schedule do you remember of course i remember here is more comfortable though dont you think i swear if we werent all departing so shortly i might have to have this bed reinforced just to cope with our exertions her birthday the following year you said you wanted to plan something special for her because it would be her sixtieth then that was when you grabbed at me almost as soon as you had me alone in that nightshady bower i grabbed you are you sure this was me oh now who else you know this you did i thought you wanted to be grabbed i might have just as well i did then wouldnt you say i think i will say anything when we are like this when you hold me like this really i must think up something extremely terrible then to exploit that admission you mustnt you cant im at your mercy it would be cruel wrong to the contrary it would only be right you offer me this i must take it you lay yourself open i must in ah ah yes oh dear scribe but not anything not anything at all i am not so totally i am not so i am not not what virisse i cant remember i have forgotten what i am not well better that than forgetting what you are you steal all i have away like this when we lie like this i feel laid bare all washed away does she do this does she have that same effect oh my love why do you always have to ask me to make these because im fascinated everything about you fascinates me how can i not be consumed by not envy but interest to know how you lie with her how much of what you do with me is what you do with her is it not enough to know that you and i do what we do do we have to compare must we always compete how can we not the urge to compare and compete is as basic as any as basic as this must it be though it is thats all that matters and does she touch you like this oh oh oh yes yes she does how id love to compare how id love to see how id love to watch see my love watch is that too much to ask prophets kiss septame you want the three of us septame is it now why oh dont stop dont stop to laugh laugh if you must but dont stop well i plough on but no i didnt think to suggest that she and i might have you both together no that would be too i couldnt anyway she would never no of course not when i have you i want you all to myself and i want you to have me all to yourself id have no dilution of this concentration this tenacity what then just to watch just to see you with her she still would not i know i wouldnt expect her to and secreting myself within some hidden space like a courtier in some ancient tragedy would be absurd put it from your mind my love concentrate on this on now on us the more i do the more i want to see you and know you in all your states in all your moods and passions and that must include with her just once just to see later not at the time and it would be so easily accomplished i can source the sort of means no civilian or journalist can find oh dear gods youve thought about this youre serious no no still dont stop serious ardent please it would mean so much it might mean my job my career all my standing shes the president she is president for thirteen more days as i am a septame for thirteen more days all that means nothing then and already starts to mean even less now what does matter is that she is a woman you are a woman and i am a man but still still nothing my love my beautiful love we strip off our importance with our clothes thats all that matters not our titles they only have meaning in public not in moments like these when we are purely perfectly ourselves only a man a weak man a hopelessly curious desperatetoknow man asks this of you my virisse not a politician just a man your man your man your man but if if if id protect you there would be no risk and so close to the end of this world the start of the next who really cares all the rules are questioned now all the laws loosened everything is licensed like this and this and this oh oh oh and id make sure nothing would happen to you i swear i swear i swear i swear even if anything was found it would never be traceable to you or i say you will say yes say it for me say you will say yes say yes say yes say it yes the simming problem in the circumstances it was usually a bad sign when something was so singular andor notorious it deserved to be capitalised was of a moral nature as the really meaty chewy most intractable problems generally were the simming problem boiled down to how true to life was it morally justified to be simulating the course of future events in a virtual environment to see what might happen back in reality and tweaking ones own actions accordingly in different runs of the simulated problem to see what difference these would make and to determine whether it was possible to refine those actions such that a desired outcome might be engineered was hardly new in a sense it long predated ais computational matrices substrates computers and even the sort of mechanical or hydrological arrangements of ballbearings weights and springs or water tubes and valves that enthusiastic optimists had once imagined might somehow model say an economy in a sense indeed such simulations first took place in the minds of only protosentient creatures in the deep prehistoric age of any given species if you werent being too strict about your definitions you could claim that the first simulations happened in the heads or other appropriate body or beingparts of animals or the equivalent probably shortly after they developed a theory of mind and started to think about how to manipulate their peers to ensure access to food shelter mating opportunities or greater social standing thoughts like if i do this then she does that no if i do that making him do this in creatures still mystified by fire or unable to account for the existence of air or ice above their watery environment or whatever were arguably the start of the first simulations no matter how dim limited or blinded by ignorance and prejudice the whole process might be they were also plausibly the start of a line that led directly through discussions amongst village elders through collegiate essays flow charts war games and the first computer programs to the sort of ultradetailed simulations that could be shown objectively statistically scientifically to work long before most species made it to the stars they would be entirely used to the idea that you never made any significant societal decision with largescale or longterm consequences without running simulations of the future course of events just to make sure you were doing the right thing simming problems at that stage were usually constrained by not having the calculational power to run a sufficiently detailed analysis or disagreements regarding what the initial conditions ought to be later usually round about the time when your society had developed the sort of processal tech you could call artificial intelligence without blushing the true nature of the simming problem started to appear once you could reliably model whole populations within your simulated environment at the level of detail and complexity that meant individuals within that simulation had some sort of independent existence the question became how godlike and how cruel did you want to be most problems even seemingly really tricky ones could be handled by simulations which happily modelled slippery concepts like public opinion or the likely reactions of alien societies by the appropriate use of some especially cunning and devious algorithms whole populations of slightly different simulative processes could be bred evolved and set to compete against each other to come up with the most reliable example employing the most decisive shortcuts to accurately modelling say how a group of people would behave nothing more processorhungry than the right set of equations would once youd plugged the relevant data in produce a reliable estimate of how that group of people would react to a given stimulus whether the group represented a tiny ruling clique of the most powerful or an entire civilisation but not always sometimes if you were going to have any hope of getting useful answers there really was no alternative to modelling the individuals themselves at the sort of scale and level of complexity that meant they each had to exhibit some kind of discrete personality and that was where the problem kicked in once youd created your population of realistically reacting and in a necessary sense cogitating individuals you had also in a sense created life the particular parts of whatever computational substrate youd devoted to the problem now held beings virtual beings capable of reacting so much like the backinreality beings they were modelling because how else were they to do so convincingly without also hoping suffering rejoicing caring loving and dreaming that by most peoples estimation they had just as much right to be treated as fully recognised moral agents as did the originals in the real or you yourself if the prototypes had rights so did the faithful copies and by far the most fundamental right that any creature ever possessed or cared to claim was the right to life itself on the not unreasonable grounds that without that initial right all others were meaningless by this reasoning then you couldnt just turn off your virtual environment and the living thinking creatures it contained at the completion of a run or when a simulation had reached the end of its useful life that amounted to genocide and however much it might feel like serious promotion from ones earlier primitive state to realise that you had in effect become the kind of cruel and pettily vengeful god you had once in your ignorance feared it was still hardly the sort of mature attitude or behaviour to be expected of a truly civilised society or anything to be proud of some civs admittedly simply werent having any of this and routinely bred whole worlds even whole galaxies full of living beings which they blithely consigned to oblivion the instant they were done with them sometimes it seemed just for the glorious fun of it and to annoy their more ethically angsttangled cocivilisationalists but they or at least those who admitted to the practice rather than doing it but keeping quiet about it were in a tiny minority as well as being not entirely welcome at all the highest tables of the galactic community which was usually precisely where the most ambitious and ruthless speciescivs most desired to be others reckoned that as long as the termination was instant with no warning and therefore no chance that those about to be switched off could suffer then it didnt really matter the wretches hadnt existed theyd been brought into existence for a specific contributory purpose and now they were nothing again so what most people though were uncomfortable with such moral brusqueness and took their responsibilities in the matter more seriously they either avoided creating virtual populations of genuinely living beings in the first place or only used sims at that sophistication and level of detail on a sustainable basis knowing from the start that they would be leaving them running indefinitely with no intention of turning the environment and its inhabitants off at any point whether these simulated beings were really really alive and how justified it was to create entire populations of virtual creatures just for your own convenience under any circumstances and whether or not ifonce you had done so you were sort of dutybound to be honest with your creations at some point and straight out tell them that they werent really real and existed at the whim of another order of beings altogether one with its metaphorical finger hovering over an off switch capable of utterly and instantly obliterating their entire universe well these were all matters which by general and even relieved consent were best left to philosophers as was the evervexing question how do we know were not in a simulation there were sound seemingly basereality metamathematically convincing and inescapable reasons for believing that all concerned in this ongoing debate about simulational ethics were genuinely at the most basic level of reality the one that definitely wasnt running as a virtual construct on somebody elses substrate but if these mooted superbeings had been quite extraordinarily clever and devious such seemingly reliable and reassuring signs might all just be part of the illusion there was also the argument of increasing decency which basically held that cruelty was linked to stupidity and that the link between intelligence imagination empathy and goodbehaviourasitwasgenerallyunderstood ie not being cruel to others was as profound as these matters ever got this strongly implied that beings capable of setting up a virtuality so convincing so devious so detailed that it was capable of fooling entities as smart as say culture minds must be so shatteringly intoxicatingly clever they pretty much had to be decent agreeable and highly moral types themselves so much like culture minds then except more so but that too might be part of the setup and the clear positive correlation between beings of greater intellectual capacity taking over from lesser ones while still respecting their rights of course and the gradual diminution of violence and suffering over civilisationally significant periods of time might also be the result of a trick a bit after some adjustments for scale like the trick of seeding another society with the ideas for a holy book that appeared to tell the truth on several levels but which was basically just part of an experiment the contents may differ thought as it reviewed the results of the latest sim runs the sims it was setting up and letting run were all trying to answer the relatively simple question how much difference will it make if the gzilt find out the book of truth is a fake and the answer appeared to be who the fuck knows once you started to think that the only way to model a population accurately would be to read the individual mindstates of every single person within the real thing something even more immoral than it was impractical it was probably time to try another approach entirely as a good decent caring and responsible culture mind the contents may differ would never run a sim of the gzilt people at the individual level to find out anyway even if it could have and apart from anything else had decided some time ago that even resorting to such desperate measures wouldnt solve anything in any case because there were two problems the simming problem and the chaos problem the chaos problem meant that in certain situations you could run as many simulations as you liked and each would produce a meaningful result but taken as a whole there would be no discernible pattern to them and so no lesson to be drawn or obvious course laid out to pursue it would all depend so exquisitely on exactly how you had chosen to tweak the initial conditions at the start of each run that taken together they would add up to nothing more useful than the realisation that this is a tricky one the real result the one that mattered out there in reality would almost certainly very closely resemble one of your simulated results but there would have been no way at any stage of the process to have determined exactly or even approximately which one and that rendered the whole enterprise almost entirely futile you ended up having to use other much less reliable methods to work out what was going to happen these included using ones own vast intelligence pooled with the equally vast intelligences of ones peers to access the summed total of galactic history and analyse compare and contrast the current situation relative to similar ones from the past given the sort of clear untrammelled devastatingly powerful thinking ais and particularly minds were capable of this could be a formidably accurate and compared to every other method available relatively reliable strategy its official title was constructive historical integrative analysis in the end though there was another name the minds used amongst themselves for this technique which was just guessing the mount was called yoawin it was old and in no particular hurry though still strong and tireless well as tireless as tefwe needed it to be she got weary and saddlesore before it started showing signs of complaint tefwe had chosen an oldfashioned saddle tall and unwieldy if you were planning on performing any fancy stuff but comfortable comfortable for the aphore as well as her you always had to think of your mount theyd had intelligent animals for hire at the stables in chyantya too ones you could talk to both amended bio and what were effectively walking talking slightly dumb drones made to look biological she guessed talkative people might hire those maybe people who were so talkative they couldnt persuade other humans to ride with them but a talking mount had always struck tefwe as taking things a little too far aphores were quite smart enough and sufficiently companionable to provide a sort of silent friendship theyd arrived in the middle of the night on this side of the orbital she left at first light riding out through the quiet town there was some sort of festival happening during the day and some flower garlands stretched across the street leading out of town towards the hills had sagged with the dew during the night she had to lift them out of the way to get underneath one pale blue flower loosened started to fall she caught it sniffed it stuck it in her hair rode on the town was much as shed remembered it sat like a rough brush stroke along one side of the snake river cliffed on the shifting sands of tawny and greypink that marked the desert edge a fragrant oasis of bellblossom and strandle flower evencluss and jodenberry the low flowing buildings half submerged by their own orchards and groves across the river past some stunted halfhearted dunes and the siltedup entrance to a longdry oxbow lake the brush and scrub of the low prairie began the few scattered bushes looked like an afterthought to the land quick light scribbles of brittledry vegetation prone to fires that in the right wind could move so fast you were better turning to face their heat and running straight through because youd never outrun them the river was very low just a trickle at the bottom of the crackdried muds and inflowed spills of sand like fanned ramps high season the rains would come in a third of a year from now falling in the bulkheads which were so far off that even in the clearest weather you could strain your eyes for ever and youd never see them night or day not this far down in the thick of air a few tens of days later after the rains started falling in the high lands of the honneynimorm bulkhead range the river would swell generally pushing a plugged mess of old leaves scrawny twigs gnarled branches stripped tree trunks and the bleached hides and bones of dead animals before it like a moving barricade of halfforgotten decrepitude and death she rode out across the pouch the bay of desert and patchy setsand that lay between the river and the town on one side and the hills on the other a pair of raptors wheeled high up following her for half the morning then found something else to watch kilometres off antispinwards she lost sight of them in the building heat of the cloudless day her backside got sore she glanded numb rode on at the height of the day a desiccant umbrel provided shade for her and the aphore once shed chased a snoozing misiprike away it had been fast asleep shed had to clap her hands and holler to get it to wake while she and the suddenly nervy aphore stood only ten metres away the misiprike had looked up risen tiredly to its feet and loped off it stopped once to snarl back at them as though it had only just remembered it was supposed to be a fearsome creature then padded looselimbed over the frozen waves of setsand she fed the aphore her stomach rumbling then ate drank even in the shade it was very hot she and the mount snoozed shed missed the descent usually she liked being dropped onto the inside of an orbital rather than taking the conventional approach of coming up from underneath a descent meant you got to see the overview of the place you were coming to a real view even if it was through a screen not a pretend one shed been born and raised on a planet this was a rare thing in the culture even rarer than being born on a ship and that was pretty rare in itself things had been like this for millennia anyway she ascribed whatever eccentricities she was prone to displaying to that oddity of birthright shed spent more time on os than anywhere else spent centuries living on them but still she couldnt help but think of planets as normal and orbitals as somehow aberrant for all that the artificial worlds far outnumbered the number of naturally inhabitable ones in the end it was kind of unarguable that planets were natural and orbitals were artificial though she supposed that when you thought about it it was really no more natural to live on the outside of a huge skeinwarping sphere of rock held to its surface like the atmosphere by nothing more than gravity than it was to live on the inside of an o held there by spin with the atmosphere held down by the same movement and stopped from spilling off the edges by retainment walls of diamond film and fate knew what exoticism of material and field she drifted in and out of her snooze and while still dozily waking up asked her ancient pen terminal whether anybody had ever built a planet or discovered a natural orbital yes to the former though rarely and not for aeons a straight no to the latter there you are she told yoawin as she got her to stand and busied herself resetting the animals bridle planets not guaranteed totally natural after all the aphore snorted that night at the start of the hills maybe a kilometre in and a hundred metres up by a dry water bowl tefwe slept under the stars and the bright lit band of the orbitals far side that was the really unnatural sign of an o she supposed you might not notice the insideout curvature at any time or come to an access tube that would let you drop the hundred metres or whatever to the worlds spaceexposed undersurface or see the sea or the clouds held rulerstraight against an edge wall but come the night there would be the sure and certain sign that you really were pinned by your rotating frame of reference to the inside of a bracelet ten million klicks across the far side shining in its daytime while the side you were on had its back turned to whatever sun the whole o circled well unless the clouds on your side of the orbital were really thick she supposed and fell asleep come the morning they left in the grey predawn despite yoawins protests dont you spit at me you addled stumblehoof tefwe said and spat back at it there see how you like it she wiped her face while yoawin shook hers there now sorry both of us sorry yes no more spitting here she gave it some dried berries a series of tall cliffs kept them mostly in shade until nearly noon letting them keep going longer they ate drank and dozed under an overhang the track just before the pass was very steep she got off yoawin and led the animal up the zigzagging path dry stones rattled under her boots and the aphores hooves at a corner in the trail near the top one fall of initially just a dozen or so stones set off a small landslide further down the fractious rattling rumbling sound of it echoed off the cliffs and slopes all around like dry thunder tefwe watched the dusty mass descend to see if it would sweep away any part of the track but it didnt and the tumbling mass of stones and boulders slowed and slumped to a dusty stop on the shallowing slope some way above the valley floor from the pass the plateau was only fifty metres below her ringed by sharp peaks and ragged cliffs its surface was bright with salt lakes and thin windcorralled whorls of pale sand yoawin panted tefwe patted the animals snout and looked around as the hot wind swept her hair back from her face she smiled and felt the dried skin on her lips protest at the motion a couple of kilometres away shimmering in the heated air she could see the rocky outcrop where the drone hassipura plynfrie would be working on its sandstreams tefwe reached up to where the flower shed picked the day before had been tucked into a coil of her hair at least until this morning thinking to leave it here at the pass but her fingers closed round nothing it had gone already fallen xgsv contents may differ ogcu beats working you appear to covet the behaviour of our superlifter siblings and have become a sort of serial tug were you getting bored a little i also thought that given the ronte had been due to arrive at zyse in particular significantly after the enfolding helping them to get to zyse swiftly might help preclude the liseiden faced with an empty home system devoid of both those it had belonged to and those it had been allocated to being tempted to ignore the decision in favour of the ronte by resorting to illegal pillaging i simply wanted to remove that temptation by making sure the ronte were in position at the time of the instigation thus ensuring a smooth handover thoughtful however it does rather make it look as though we favour one over the other i appreciate that however all we are doing is favouring the rightful over those who might wrongly feel aggrieved and who were this action not taken have the means and the opportunity to act upon that feeling with potentially disastrous results noble motivations im sure may i ask you to run any ideas for future innovations of a similar nature past the rest of us before carrying them out would you do that i would fifteen s this is a closed system of course the blindfolded man said feeling his way to the seat and then turning it holding it angled away from the ancientlooking console and screen so that the septame could sit in it banstegeyn held the back of the seat but did not sit the blindfolded man by his uniform a captain in the home regiment talked to him as though he could see him it is unconnected to any other and so its contents are unavailable elsewhere i understand other such hermetic arrangements hold certain records it is as well are not readily accessible however this one merely catalogues various pieces of equipment which are regarded as being best kept secret from the general mass of people and indeed even the general mass of armed forces personnel i see said banstegeyn studying the captains face the mans eyes were concealed behind a thick metal strap cushioned with dark foam according to marshal chekwri who had personally driven him here to this anonymous if wellguarded warehouse on the capitals outskirts this was perfectly normal and did not constitute some special arrangement made just for him when theyd first arrived and been introduced to the blindfolded captain the marshal had produced a viciouslooking fighting knife and flicked it fast and straight at the captains blindfolded face eliciting it seemed at first not the slightest response though then the captain had smiled and said ah i felt the wind of that were you really testing me maam chekwri had just smiled her thin humourless smile shed stayed in an outer office as banstegeyn had been led into the barely lit inner office through a double set of thick doors so banstegeyn said still not sitting do you know who i am captain no sir you must be above a certain rank to be here exactly which depends on the service and regiment but i dont know who you are your voice sounds vaguely familiar but i wouldnt be able to place it he smiled and his head tipped back a little so that now he seemed to be addressing a point somewhere above the other mans head for somebody who spends a large part of his working day as a blind man i am remarkably bad with voices sir he shrugged it is a blessing in some ways im sure please sir sit thank you banstegeyn sat down the captain went through the controls for the system they were simple enough any item below a certain size such as would fit into this drawer the fellow pulled out a very long and heavyseeming drawer in the console will be delivered into it larger items will be delivered into the pullout hopper behind you sir he nodded at a section of the wall where there was a rectangular outline nearly two metres long with a substantial double handle the screen should tell you how long itll take to physically retrieve any item sir should you find one that meets your requirements but please do be aware it could take some minutes up to ten in some instances and certain items require some assembly and well loading frankly a little patience may be required sir and possibly a little familiarity with whatever item is to be called for ill leave it to your own good judgement and that of the officer who accompanied you here whether any selected item is suitable the blindfolded captain sighed regretfully i trust youve already been so informed sir but im dutybound to inform you that any and all responsibility for the use of any items found herein rests entirely with your good self sir and once an item leaves these premises it becomes fully your property to the extent that all record of it even having been stored here will be irrevocably wiped and deleted from the database held herein i understand banstegeyn said do i have to sign anything or speak a form of words the captains smile was broad tolerant oh absolutely not sir officially you arent even here i see well thank you sorry to put you to so much trouble not at all sir theres been very little demand lately its been terribly slow nice to have somebody requiring our services again ill leave you now sir press the blue button on the left of the console if you need any help banstegeyn waited until the heavy doors had fully closed behind the captain before turning back to the screen he took in a breath to tell it to wake up then felt foolish of course entirely manual without the least semblance of voicerecognition let alone even crude ai he found the on button thumbed it a simple inholo screen with a keyboard or a stylus and writing tablet if so desired he sighed this might take some time t c vilabiers th stringspecific sonata for an instrument yet to be invented mw the hydrogen sonata started with a single sustained note right at the top of the range of the instrument which had had to be invented to play it properly the bodily acoustic antagonistic undecagonstring for four hands that single note was then joined by a faint uncertain chord of slowly shifting harmonics which was another way of saying that it started to sound out of tune after it got more than one note in fans and detractors alike agreed that this was a remarkable achievement and also that the work as a whole was something of an acquired taste the single high note at the start of the work was meant to signify a solitary proton specifically a hydrogen nucleus while the following wavering pseudochord was supposed to embody the concept of a sole electrons probability cloud so that together the first note and the first chord represented the element hydrogen vilabier was thought to have been joking when he had claimed that the work was itself merely the first note in a vast and incrementally more complicated cycle that would grow to encompass the entirety of the periodic table regardless after this simple beginning the work became furiously complicated and initially at least until playing techniques and prosthetic technology had sufficiently improved almost unplayable initially in this case meant for several centuries many held that whether it was unplayable or not didnt particularly matter what did was that it was completely unlistenable but that was arguably to take a somewhat doctrinaire attitude to what the word listenable meant i like it the ship said through berdle really cossont said standing and shaking herself loosening all the overtensed muscles that tended to result when one played the elevenstring with any gusto shed only tackled the first movement and then purely because the ship had asked her to and because she was feeling guilty about not having played the instrument for days the ship had altered the acoustics of the big central lounge area of the module to make it sound sweeter they were a day out from their destination the cloud of centralised dataversities and associated other habitats institutions and auxiliary resources in the ospin system yes pyan said really pyan had been perfectly indifferent to the hydrogen sonata as it was to all music until it had realised that most people hated the piece when it had decided to join in the chorus of disdain i can see what its trying to do and it has a mathematical elegance to it that i appreciate berdle said also ive invented a form of musical notation that i think enhances its appreciation in the abstract as a visual and intellectual internalised experience without one actually having to listen to it cossont nodded i can certainly see the point of that she stopped frowned youve invented a she shook her head no never mind i agree with mr berdle eglyle parinherm said however i do detect a degree of discordant tonality the android had been activated hours earlier waking instantaneously on the bed platform where hed been stored hed stared straight up and in a deep controlled voice said unit y parinherm eglyle systems checked all enabled sim status ready engaged chron scale subjective onetoone hmm berdle had said it had tried turning the android off and on again a few times since but to no avail cossont flexed her fingers stowed the instruments two bows in its case discordant tonality about covers it she said while you were playing berdle said i found some screen of your mother oh shit shall i yeah i suppose two days after theyd left the izenion system cossont had suddenly realised she ought to let her mother know she was okay shed asked the ship to get a message to warib telling her that she was alive and well but couldnt communicate directly but i could arrange a direct communication quite easily the ship had told her could you really shed said eyes wide anyway as i was saying alive and well but not able to communicate directly um dont tell anybody ive been in touch obviously ah hope youre well should see you before the instigation shed smiled at the very handsome gzilt male that the avatar had become and tell her ive met an extremely goodlooking and very powerful man if you like thatll keep her happy any customary signoff berdle had asked well hers to me is usually well if youre going to be like that followed by the screen going blank and mine is usually um you take care because it sounds well caring without necessitating the use of the word love hmm the avatar had said also its a little unpersonalised as it stands anybody could be sending her this and she might suspect she is being lied to by a third party cossont had sighed i suppose well tell her pyan says hi and im keeping my natural hair colour and now the ship had found some screen of warib this is from yesterday afternoon on one of the channels on the cruise sea ship your mother inhabits berdle told her as a screen appeared in midair level with where cossont stood she threw herself down into a chair the virtual screen dipped following her pyan flapped and flopped over to arrange itself on the lounger next to cossont even parinherm leaned over to get a better view cossont thought of requesting some privacy then decided she didnt care the screen came to life with a roaming shot of her mothers apartment on the sea ship and a female voiceover saying we spoke to madame warib cossont of deck twentyfive who believes her daughter may have been swept up in the current emergency and now having just heard from her fears for her wellbeing and even life oh for fucks sake vyr shouted she looked at berdle you did put in the bit about her not telling anybody id been in touch of course berdle said he frowned i thought id been entirely unambiguous even forceful cossont just shook her head looked back at the screen there was an abrupt cut to a headandshoulders shot of warib sitting in her largest white couch with the sea and clouds behind small glowing figures in the top right corner of the screen read s reminding any especially absentminded viewers how many days were left to the subliming warib was dressed in a blouse suit vyr didnt recognise it was a bit frilly and showy madame cossont the voice continued slightly altered in timbre and ambience now you recently heard from your daughter didnt you or somebody claiming to be her yes its not like her to be so poor getting back to me it really isnt weve always been very close and kept in touch all the time and then she just seemed to disappear from the face of the planet and apparently her bed hasnt been even slept in for days many i mean several days and then of course she is in the fourteenth the regiment the fourteenth and she was always very active in the reserve very respected and of course theres been this terrible terrible madame the voice of the unseen interviewer said berdle looked at vyr she had one of her upper hands cupped over her nose and eyes the other three hands all clasped tightly across her chest terrible explosion on this planet and for all i know well i thought i assumed the worst naturally as any mother would i wondered could she have been there was that where she went did she know something as soon as i heard about about the thing but then there was nothing just nothing madame cossont im sorry i am just rattling on arent i i do care i worry so much about her she looked away to one side put her hand to her mouth and balled it there her lips tightening her eyes blinking quickly her lower lip started to tremble i cant watch any more of this vyr announced turn it off please whats the upshot the screen disappeared oh pyan said i was enjoying that your mother relates berdle said that she received the text message you sent via myself and says she thinks youre mixed up in something well cossont sighed she got that right if nothing else she says that she doubts it really was from you and describes you as i quote wittering about her hair when thats never been something shes ever even cared about i mean ive done my best i always have but anyway it did strike me as highly suspicious end quote vyr put both upper hands over her face oh for fucks sake that was supposed to last time we she said oh never mind she took a deep breath looked up nothing about how my claiming to have met an extremely goodlooking and very powerful man was even less likely to be true i didnt include that berdle confessed you left it to my discretion and i thought it best to leave it out probably just as well shed have assumed it was code for ive been kidnapped parinherm looked suddenly alert and glanced around quickly you havent been kidnapped have you he said and seemed to be tensed to leap up from where he sat excuse me berdle said and the android went limp relaxing as though deflated and settling back into the lounger that is going to get tiresome cossont said frowning at the unconscious android cant you just reprogram it or something she asked berdle not so easily the avatar said it has highly recursive deeply embedded multiplelevel physical source coding checksets worked down to the atomechanical level as well as a radically tenacious prescribed assumesimulation default with closely associated deacativatory protocols its a real tangle probably meant to be a safety feature certainly not a comprehensibility feature berdle smiled i beg your pardon i mean its hard to reprogram it without disabling it potentially the avatar shrugged there will be a workaround recorded somewhere obscure probably ill keep looking plus ill just continue to think about it what about the ship thats following us i dont see any need to test its top speed by trying to outpace it better to keep that edge assuming it exists ive run a lot of sims for a flythrough of the ospin system and an insertion into various of the dataversities and im confident this can be done with minimal chance of the following ship spotting where youre inserted unless its a particularly remote unit berdle paused we can leave this another hour or two but given that you have effectively raised the subject it would be helpful to know which of the dataversities or other objects we might be targeting cossont nodded its the bokri microrbital the incast facility thank you berdle said then smiled that shouldnt be a problem its in a relatively densely packed volume of the cloud plenty of cover it looked at cossont would anybody your mother for example know that you took the mindstate device to the incast order on bokri she shook her head i didnt tell anybody she sighed i put it in my private journal and general reikl knew about that but i suppose that all got destroyed when the reg hq was blown up probably berdle agreed cossont sighed if this all goes horribly wrong youll have to contact my mother to tell her youve lost her little girl if this all goes horribly wrong the ship told her i too might be lost well youve heard what shes like death might be preferable that pyan said primly is no way to talk about your mother cossont looked at berdle and said reasonably that i think youll find is the only way to talk about my mother these things accrete most things accrete that dont gradually crumble rust or evaporate i didnt mean to suggest there was any merit in the process indeed nor in its opposite im glad we have finally found something to agree on im not i think you make a virtue of contrariness or think to you might be dismayed to know just how little what you think matters to me scoaliera i doubt it my expectations could hardly be lower also im encouraged by your relative approachability and good humour on this occasion i do believe my sarcasmmeter just twitched a false positive i fear i was being entirely sincere you say have i been imagining that i was the very exemplar of hearty helpful bonhomie on our last meeting possibly hmm the drone hassipura plynfrie was the size and shape of a large grey suitcase a rather battered and dusty large grey suitcase its scraped slightly dented casing glinted in the sunlight where it had been polished by the sand in the wind or had been scraped against stones if it was showing an aura field it was being washed out by the brilliant sunlight but probably it wasnt it never had in the past not as long as tefwe had known it anyway i am not persuaded that memories do only accrete the drone told the woman even without the intrinsic limitations of a conventional biological brain what one forgets can be as important and as formative as what one remembers hassipura had made its home in a tall jagged outcrop of dark rocks that stuck out above the white waste of the salt desert like a diseased tooth through the machines efforts over the centuries the place had become a dry little paradise of directed cause and effect an oasis of minutely ordered motion and an arid image of a water garden i thought drones like minds remembered everything tefwe said well we dont there was a pause before it said well i dont tefwe and the drone were at the foot of the outcrop just a vertical metre and a few shatteredlooking boulders away from the surface of the desert tefwe was standing and hassipura was hovering level with the womans head performing some maintenance on a fragilelooking raising screw the raising screw was powered by the fierce sunlight falling on a small semicircular array of solar panels partencasing its lower quarter i see the woman said do you choose what to forget or do you just let things disappear randomly scoaliera the drone said if i chose what to forget i would very likely have forgotten all about you the screw one of a dozen or so at this lowest level of the rocks was a couple of metres tall and thin enough for tefwes fingers to have met had she grasped it onehanded the foot of the device lay in a pool of sand about a metre across the slowly rotating screw twisted lazily in the darkgold grains raising them inside a transparent collar with a hypnotic steadiness to deposit the lifted material a minute or so later into another pool on a higher tier of the outcrop where a second level of raising screws and sandwheels like pieces of giant clockwork would transport the material further up and so on for level after level and diminishing tier after diminishing tier until a single last raising screw buried in a tunnel inside the dusty peak of the tor deposited a small trickle of sand to an overflowing pool at its very summit that is ungallant and i suspect also not true let us test that shall we should you ever come to visit me again i dont believe you delete memories at random they are chosen at random and bufferbinned whether they are finally deleted is a matter of choice ah might have thought so the drone had subtly sculpted the outcrop over the decades and centuries it had lived here cutting channels pools cisterns tunnels and reservoirs into the rock building structures that at least resembled aqueducts and creating had the whole complex been filled with water what would have been a kind of secret water garden albeit with rather steeply inclined canals and aqueducts but the outcrop held no water at all instead it was sand that moved within the tunnels and channels sand which was lifted within the raising wheels and screws and sand which fell in little whispering falls and moved liquidly down dry weirs whatever makes you think id wish to visit you again after being so roundly insulted that fact that i have insulted you just as roundly in the past to so little effect the drone said smoothly for here you are again youre right i ought to come back just to annoy you tefwe said squatting she dipped her hand into the shaded pool where the rod of the raising screw slanted into the tawny grains she let the sand fall back between her fingers it slipped away almost as quickly as water would have it moves very smoothly she said inspecting her hand a few tiny grains adhered to her skin all in the lines of her palm please dont do that the drone said using invisible maniple fields to adjust parts of the diamondsheetcovered solar panels why tefwe asked moisture hassipura said and impurities such as salts your hands will have added a little of each to the sands sorry tefwe squatted and stuck her head down into the shade created by the solar panel gazing at the pool of sand underneath inside its transparent sleeve the turning screw seemed barely to disturb the surface of the sand which appeared to flow in to fill even the slightest of hollows she glanced up to see if the drone was looking reckoned it couldnt see then stuck a finger into the surface of the sand pool and took it smartly out again the sand closed up round where her finger had been running in again like water to leave no sign that its surface had been disturbed will you stop doing that the drone said tiredly apologies tefwe said how does it move so smoothly the grains are spheres the drone said clicking something back into place on the solar array they are polished individually where necessary i call the stuff sand because it starts out as ordinary sand and still has the same chemical composition as the raw material but really the particle size is reduced almost to that of fines and the polishing process leaves each grain almost perfectly spherical see the drone shifted in the air humming very faintly tefwe stood and straightened as a bright screen suddenly filled the air in front of her seeming to dim a significant part of the sky and putting her in shadow the drone had produced a holo display like a magically produced cabinet hovering in front of the woman the holo showed two grains highly magnified one appeared to be about the size of tefwes head and was jagged crystalline all straight edges spires and juts not unlike the rocky outcrop itself it was rainbowed with diffraction colours the other was pebblesized a glasslike shiny blonde and seemingly a perfect sphere before and after the drone said shutting the screen off and letting the blast of sunlight fall upon tefwe again her eyes adjusted putting a black dot over the sun to reduce the glare the sunlight was so strong her vision would have been affected by light coming in through the surrounds of her eyes so they would be partially silvering she suspected something similar had happened to areas of her skin again to cope with the ferocity of the suns glare grief im going silver she was she realised starting to look like a ships avatar you polish them all individually she asked i have processes machinery to do the gross polishing the drone told her then they are all inspected individually by me any further polishing that is required i do myself that seems obsessive meticulous care can seem so to those unwilling to recognise it for its true worth i meant you might simply discard the rejects hassipura gave the appearance of thinking about this that i would find offensive it said eventually what a strange machine you are tefwe told it that is why i make my home here in the centre of a city in the midst of my dear fellow drones and so many many delightfully gregarious humans is this really all you do she asked gazing round the network of sandcanals sandfalls sand weirs pools lakes and whirlpools she wanted to call the dry canted bridges aqueducts but couldnt silicaducts maybe yes do you find it in some way inadequate no its beautiful in a way you really have no water at all none why should i have water i have no need for it nor does the sandstream complex water makes paste and mud water clogs and makes the complex stop working here water is a pollutant does it rain often here almost never thankfully still shouldnt you have some water for guests for visitors i try to discourage visitors what about weary travellers or what if some poor devil comes crawling across the sands croaking for water having lost their terminal so unable to call hub or anywhere else for help for the sake of argument then i would call hub or somewhere else for help scoaliera do i take it youre thirsty not really but i think the aphore is you should have brought more water i still have some ill let it drink shortly you came from chyantya yes read my terminal for the detail the drone was silent for a moment spat on you did it it said cant have been that thirsty patently im going to be visiting various parts of the complex over the next hour or so do you have anything to let you float no youd better climb on top of me if were still to converse then i take it you do still wish to converse it would be too much to hope that you just happened to be passing by sheer coincidence and are now happy to be on your way thank you i will and of course im here for a purpose id kind of guessed the drone made a slow swoop to about midthigh level on tefwe she climbed aboard sitting crosslegged on its broad back it rose into the hot dry air heading up about ten metres to a sort of little depot of machinery set on a levelled area where the rock had been melted and allowed to cool patches were like glass reflecting the sharp glare of the sun the aphore nestling in the shade of a housesized boulder raised its head when it caught sight of her on the drone it looked confused then it put its head back down to the shadowdark sand and closed its eyes again the drone lifted a small tube and appeared to inspect it turning it this way and that in front of the highmagnification band running along its blunt snout it replaced it moved to another rack of what looked like miniaturised mining equipment so come far it asked far enough who sent you bunch of ships will i have heard of any of them she reeled off the relevant names is this sc not generated some euas are helping out think theyre bored its a bit quiet right now ah elements usually associated the drone said and managed to sound almost wistful and is the smile tolerantly really involved actively no its more wanted and what do you want tefwe from you to know the location of our old chum ngaroe qiria ah i suppose i should have guessed what makes you think i know that oh come on all right what makes you think i would tell you its important why long story he might remember something that backs up a claim somebodys made claim that might make a big difference to a lot of people you are going to have to do better than that how long have we got all day okay she told him the background by the time she was finished the drone had carried her almost to the summit of the outcrop from here maybe sixty metres above the surface of the desert and the salt pans she could see pretty much the whole network of the sandstream complex all the silicaducts channels and pools lakes pools and weirs and all the raising wheels and screws that lifted the sands from the base of the outcrop from above it looked even more like it was all done with flowing dyed water foreshortened like this you couldnt see the relatively steep slopes required to make the sands move under gravity the raising wheels turned slowly scooping sand from one pool to deposit it in a higher one the wheels in particular seen en masse made the whole outcrop look like a giant clock powered by sand and sunlight she could see the aphore still trying to keep in the shade of the rocks far beneath as the sun moved across the sky the animal was making thin whinnying noises probably thirsty tefwe thought the high desert was flat and shining dotted with dark outcrops like jagged islands on that sea of salt hot sand and dust the pale writhing column of a dust devil danced in the distance like a ghostly impersonation of a waterspout the view of the encircling mountains all shimmering in the heat was bleakly impressive she did feel a little exposed though the skin on the back of her hands had gone quite silverywhite under the sunlight the sky above was a hazy shining blue a cobalt blister like a vast concentrating lens with her at the focal point this stark intense azure was the true colour of the desert she thought her stomach made a faint delicate rumbling sound she wondered when she had last eaten her body was using the ambient heat to drive many of the processes that usually would have needed the chemical fires produced by food her real body the one still stored somewhere inside the you call this clean wouldnt have been able to do this any more than it would have silvered up on prolonged exposure to harsh sunlight her own skin would have started to tan i remember that ngaroe had some affinity with the gzilt the drone said once shed told it all she knew at one time i thought he might have been one of them originally many bodies ago seems hes still on his first my that is a long long time to be in the one body the drone said sounding genuinely impressed i knew he was old but that old really apparently he could still be lying he used to lie a lot i recall he might be lying but then he might not anyway what do you think important enough to let me know where the hell the old fuck is what would be intended for him just going to be asked what he knows nothing untoward what if he is uncooperative ha when was he otherwise you know what i mean then i leave emptyhanded but at least we can say we tried nothing further nobodys going to drug him or read his mind or anything these are perfectly normal minds involved here with honour selfrespect and all that usual uptight shit i will need your word on this you have it if he wont tell me he wont tell me end my information is five years old barely yesterday by qirias geriatric standards he told me he was going to lose or donate or abandon or get rid of something he used all four terms when we talked then go to contemplate the mountains of the sound on cethyd in the heluduz system never heard of it few have just these mountains he wasnt sure where exactly hed be going but theres an outworlders quarter so probably there claimed hed already been for a look and talked to ah deleted at random nearly still have it docent luzuge somebody called docent luzuge if he she or it is still alive and active this person would know where to find him tefwes pen terminal picked up the words it was a lot smarter than the old pen terminals tefwe had been used to and the kind of smart that found it relatively easy to hide from the level of investigatory tech the drone had the terminal had been effectively awake and evaluating everything it had been sensing since shortly before tefwe and the aphore had arrived at the outcrop it was getting jostled about in the bottom of a pocket in her thin shirt and so not seeing very much but it could hear perfectly well it made a transmission a satellite the size of a pebble held stationary just above the atmosphere directly over where tefwe was which had been keeping station directly over her since shed been displaced to the surface at chyantya relayed the transmission to its home ship the vfp outstanding contribution to the historical process which on hearing the relevant words itself handed the information on to various other craft including the contents may differ and the element of the fast picket fleet known to be nearest to the planet cethyd as well as making a general call through the usual network of trusted craft just in case they knew of a still closer ship that hadnt been letting everybody else know its position i wonder what he was leaving behind and why tefwe said i wondered that too i did ask he wasnt forthcoming cethyd she said some civforsaken ball on the outskirts of nowhere jealously guarded by wellteched barbarians known for the mountains of the sound arent your implants working im leaving them off just got my terminal which has just been in touch with something overhead really thats sneaky you didnt know i should have guessed this isnt the real you is it no spare body carried by an sc ship altered to suit i imagine another you will be popping into existence very shortly somewhere near the mountains of the sound on cethyd i dare say that is where you think he is yes the drone said im too old to play those kinds of games your word stands of course of course well good hunting to your next self what happens to you to this you now supposed to head back to the vfp naturally it wants to snap me back instantly now and be on its way but i said youd appreciate me making the effort well i have but dont let me detain you really go immediately if you wish tefwe thought she could almost feel the vfp doubtless listening willing her to agree later she said and half expected to be snatched away anyway as the ships property or to see a wrathful bolt of fire falling from the heavens to strike her or at least the nearby desert around sunset perhaps first i ought to let the aphore drink but id like to see more of the sandstream if its not too much trouble ms tefwe sent the ship via some internal piece of augmentation which obviously she only thought shed turned off none at all the drone said though sandstreams in the plural you should have said theres more than one ms tefwe the ship sent again many most of the outcrops you can see from here are similarly adapted the old drone sounded proud really i must see them ms tefwe the ship sent once more we could visit two or three in the time soon i hope to start linking them underground and complete a programme of replacing all the external raising screws with internal ones not the wheels though i hope i like the wheels ms tefwe kindly reply not the wheels those i intend to keep how long will all that take ms tefwe many decades dont you think you should answer the ship na sixteen s xlou caconym omsv pressure drop cethyd barely mentioned in my data reservoirs will you down a current allcivssystems overview this is becoming ridiculous ignorance can be interesting also fatal i am not going to copy you the relevant data get it all yourself anyway cethyd is a good choice if hes trying to escape our attention home of the uwanui under something called the oglari jurisdiction themselves beholden to the dolstre who seem to have decided were no friends of theirs and the oglari are just able enough and vicariously well upteched enough to make a friendly visit tricky perhaps as well we have the sc fleet and its fellow travellers onside nearest is a brother ship to you a troublemaker defanged to vfp think itll be up to the task

accepting that that particular nugget of nonsense presents as a oneoff random irrelevance it still seems somehow pointedly symbolic of this whole enterprise turning up grisly unpleasantnesses that it

some of our colleagues worry we are starting to indulge in groupthink and to obsess we are a group of minds thinking is what we do and obsession is just what those too timorous to follow an idea through to its logical conclusion call determination however theyre still aboard even if they might be sitting fretting in the lifeboats unlike the completely overboard idiocy of this hybrid os abomination first id heard of that some sort of weird zr mutant mind thats almost baroquely horrifying ghoulish even positively gothick what could have possessed it to do it who knows but we know what possesses it now the zihdrenremnanter if this marks the start of a new fashionable trend amongst ship minds i may sublime myself shortly still might yet yield advantage never mind the denials any sort of more direct link to the zr than weve been used to until now implies better access to the z within the enfold an opportunity uhhuh well see makes the beats workings oddly enabling behaviour look positively normal for sure giving pickupbacks to the ronte i mean really mind you they were going so slowly it probably got bored what do you think i think theres a reason there are so few of the scree class despite the fact theyre the smallest energycheapest to build of all the contact units five humans is just too small a crew theyre almost guaranteed to go a bit mad its like the opposite of being outnumbered the more humans you have aboard you the better their eccentricities average out and youre left with something easy to model anticipate and influence you have safety in their numbers five bios and one mind in one teeny wee ship their basic insanity is going to manifest and its realitydistorting infectious practically always going to end badly yes but you can always kick a human crew off at the next gsv if you really dont get on not as bad as becoming a hybrid with alien operating system shit incorporated thats just perverted the culture had a problem with the rump of the zihdren civilisation that the zihdrenremnanters represented it was the same problem they had with most other lightbasking species the whole comms and data network of such beings was not something truly independent of them as creatures instead it was effectively an extension of them as a mass of interconnected individuals and so the culture with its selfimposed embargo on reading the minds of other beings regarded it as immoral to investigate even aspects of the remnanters existence as seemingly impersonal and banal as their data reservoirs without specific permission something that had to date at least rarely been forthcoming it meant that the remnanters were slightly mysterious as far as the culture was concerned they were less than perfectly known and understood they were incompletely assessed intrinsically beyond certain very useful forms of analysis proof against being properly simmed and so in theory capable of surprising the culture this was a devilishly itchy annoying thing for your average mind had there even been such a thing to have to address it was just as well that the remnanters were little more than a civilisational afterthought an onlyvisibleathighmagnification detail on the vast everchanging galactic map and that at least for now there were only a few other similar species making any ripples in the big shared paddling pond of the big g imagine so went a popular nightmare scenario for ships of a certain disposition who worried about this sort of stuff having to cope with the zihdren themselves when theyd been in their pomp on the other hand there were speciescivs with no such compunctions who regularly investigated as deeply as possible into the minds of others especially when they were as weird as the remnanters and would cheerfully share the information with anybody who asked as long as no favours were promised in return the culture would reluctantly even a little guiltily use that kind of information just to keep from being too embarrassingly ignorant scoaliera tefwe woke slowly as she had woken slowly a few dozen times over the intervening centuries only it wasnt really waking slowly she was being woken all dark at first stillness and silence too and yet the sensation that things were happening both inside her head and body organs and systems and faculties being woken revived checked primed readied it was at once reassuring and somehow disappointing here we go again she thought hmm that thought itself felt familiar she opened her eyes she was sort of expecting to see the word simulation however briefly but it wasnt there she blinked looked around she was floating in some sort of suspensor field in air in a human or humanoid body dressed in some clingy but lightly puffed coverall which left only her feet hands and head exposed she was held reclined in the air it was as though she was sitting in an invisible chair a boxy ship drone was at eyelevel looking at her the room around her appeared to be medical unit standard ms tefwe the drone said reporting she said she looked at her hand it looked like her hand though she knew enough to know that meant almost nothing a reverser field please the drone put a screen in front of her showing her her own face she touched the skin on her cheek pressed her nose one way then the other looked like her face she remembered talking with the avatoid of the you call this clean in a virtual environment she remembered waking in reality in the medical facility of the outstanding contribution to the historical process and she remembered the journey across the desert on the aphore to go and talk to the old drone hassipura plynfrie she had stayed with it for a couple of days calling in a supply drop from the orbitals hub to feed and water the animal at the end of that first day the vfp had been annoyed at her dallying but had not zapped her back to it without permission the important part of its mission had already been carried out it had transmitted the information on qirias location to the other interested ships it could afford to let her spend a while with the ancient drone and its sandstreams another ship another vfp the rapid random response unit had been timeclosest to cethyd and had started out for the planet within a second of the information being picked up it had started readying one of the handful of humanoid simulacra bodies it carried aboard instructing the creatures physiological systems to alter the blankbasic bodys appearance so that it would resemble tefwe the transfer of tefwes updated mindstate could wait until the last hour or so before deployment hence the relaxed attitude the outstanding was able to take to tefwes delaying tactics the rapid random response units flight time to cethyd had been two and a half days a lucky proximity tefwe guessed given that the place was as hassipura had suggested kind of off the beaten track in a system called heluduz in one of the faint tendrils of stars that lay on the very outskirts of the galaxy spun out from the rim like the exhaust from a spent firework the place itself was nothing special just a biggish rocky world with a thick though transparent oxygennitrogen atmosphere and a small majority of land compared to deep ocean after her surprisingly extended jaunt to see hassipuras sandstreams tefwe had ridden off again on the aphore yoawin the ship had displaced both of them as soon as they dropped more than a couple of metres beyond the pass depositing a very confused aphore straight back into its stables in the livery at chyantya tefwe went back to the ship where her mindstate was finally read and transmitted to the rapid random response unit half a day before it reached the planet of cethyd while it was still checking and rechecking its displacer components testing the system with dummy payloads and planning its brake points and loopreturn profiles tefwe shook her head is this really necessary this would represent an absolute minimum the boxy ship drone told her tefwe looked down at herself the ship had insisted she wear what appeared to her like a grossly overspecd suit she looked she thought like shed been dipped in a thick layer of sticky mercury the suit was only about five or six millimetres thick and seemed to weigh almost nothing plus it thinned so much over her hands and especially her fingers that she half expected to see her fingerprints through the silver covering but it was meant to be terribly effective well once the helmet component had rolled up it was just a roll round her neck at the moment like a thick metallic scarf obviously the tech had moved on since the last time shed needed to be protected at anything like this level what exactly is this that is a fullsurvivallightbattle suit two layer whats a light battle is that a skirmish or something it will keep you safe and well even if the displace is very slightly off and protect you against unwelcome attentions should locals take exception to you why would they do that who knows some people are just primitive this isnt really about the locals is it this is in case the other lot the oglari in case they spot me or their bosses tefwe had woken with a full briefing effectively downloaded and digested inside her head we are trying to protect you as well as we can ms tefwe the ship told her ideally i would put you down in a more aggressively profiled suit and inside a supporting capsule at least with a full drone and missile screen exactly where you need to be however our intelligence is that such a force in such a location would be very likely both to be sensed on emplacement and to give cause for severe diplomatic unpleasantness if discovered hence the suit can i put ordinary clothes over it theyll burn off if the displace is even slightly out the suit is able to mimic the appearance of clothing id prefer ordinary clothes cant i carry them inside the suit or something the drone made a sighing noise eventually she got a kind of backpack that melded itself to the suit containing some clothes and a few supplies this increases both your mass and bulk the ship told her through the drone now i have to recalibrate and skim even closer to the planet how close you going seventeenfive k velocity forty per cent crashed to fiftyseven kilolights at closest approach sub millisecond window tefwe whistled youre going to scrunch me up into a tiny little ball arent you if you were properly human it would break every major bone in your body and quite a lot of the others happily youre not you wont trauma will you i could put you under not me tough as old space boots known for it good the suit will be trying not to use any fields including ag so the landing could be a little bumpy kinetic kinetic thats how we used to express it in the old days hmm kinetic that too is appropriate the rapid random response unit performed the start of a crashstop then when it was for a vanishingly brief moment within less than a planetary radius of the world used its heavyduty displacer to loose a balledup tefwe and a scatter of miniature subsidiary support components towards the planet then it continued on its way slowing in effect more slowly and started a wide turn that would bring it back to the system some hours later for a more stealthy approach to cethyd tefwe came hurtling out of the sky at a little under the speed of sound the suit gauged where it was and what was happening to it saw that it was heading for land with no large body of water available which was suboptimal but never mind and braked hard by spreading layers of itself like ribboned parachutes scrubbing off ninetyfive per cent of its speed in about half a kilometre of fortyfivedegree flight tefwe felt herself tumbling and the deceleration as a tremendous weight oddly distributed due to the way she was packed pressed into a contorted maximally compacted ball that would have killed a basic human the tumbling decreased she felt her orientation steady and settle and then the weight eased too she felt the impact as a dull thud on her back and knees not sore at all then the suits voice said quietly landed tefwe started to unball as the suit unwrapped her letting her spread herself out to lie looking up at an ochre sky visible between softly swaying stalks of some tall bronzecoloured grass she could feel her lungs reinflating theyd been collapsed to save volume how we doing she asked when she had some breath to spare we are doing well the suit said no hostile interest detected thats nice her conventional pain receptors came back on line tingling once to confirm then quieting down she sat up dusted herself down then still sitting unhitched the backpack and put on the clothes shed had the ship make for her they were supposed to make her look a bit like a pilgrim a human pilgrim specifically because the locals here werent human though there were used enough to hosting humanoid pilgrims from nearby systems then she let the backpack collapse itself and stow into the small of the suits back finally cautiously she stood up cethyd lay heavy beneath the orangered sun called heluduz you used to look at my chest because of what was not there absence can snag the gaze more effectively than presence what oh breasts mammalian stuff of course i thought you just thought i had a particularly fine and barrel chest one way of putting it did you ever want did you ever think about us you know fucking which answer would insult you less yes or no neither either i wouldnt be insulted then the answer would be not really not really so a bit then ha she was a little drunk she was still going to leave the silvergrey cube with the incast order she was en route to the ospin system now in this fine clipper ship but shed thought she ought to at least turn the device on make sure the old guy was in some sense still in there and maybe ask his forgiveness maybe too many cocktails in the bar thought shed been doing extremely well with a handsomely chunky young fellow there a serving captain in the eighth but then the girlfriend hed neglected to mention had shown up supposed to be a surprise for him shed got on at the last port a couple of hours ago been waiting impatiently in his cabin since wondering where hed got to things had started to turn just a little ugly and so shed made her excuses and left she had decided before shed left home ten days earlier that one thing she definitely wasnt going to do during the voyage was turn on the device with qirias mindstate inside shed been adamant about that he was an old fraud and even just giving the damn thing to her had probably been some sort of attempt to manipulate her he was lucky she was paying him the compliment of physically taking the device to ospin like some sort of warped pilgrimage or homage or something rather than just posting it to the incast order shed brought her volupt with her she would use the time constructively to practise but then perhaps because of the cocktails shed changed her mind the gzilt never joined in the great genetic mashup that the rest of the culture proper thought appropriate to ensure everybody could breed with everybody else qirias voice said in theory she could have seen him too had his face look down on her from the cabins screen she hadnt chosen that option as a result the genes arent in either of us to make us appear attractive to or feel attracted towards the other beyond a very basic panhuman interest sparked at a distance or when clothes conceal the disappointing truth trust me it is rarely an encouraging sign when the more apparel is removed the less attractive a prospective sexual partner becomes i wasnt keeping a tally but if youd been watching carefully i suspect youd have noticed that i looked glanced more likely at your chest more often when you wore a top than when you were naked from the waist up the point is rather that we found each other interesting at all sexual considerations removed again youll have to trust me that the difference implicit in a tenmillennia age difference is far more important than a difference in both gender andor species so youve never had sex with a gzilt woman ah i didnt say that so you have cossont lying on the bed plumped up her pillow and made herself comfortable staring at the screen maybe she should have put his face on the screen would he be blushing now did mindstates inside devices like this blush did qiria blush had he she couldnt remember technically yes the voice from the cube said sounding unconcerned it was again technically unsatisfactory for both parties the seemingly superficial physical differences become more pronounced when one gets down to it as it were sometimes however one indulges in that sort of behaviour as a sort of extension of friendship not with everyone not all need such an expression most of the people i find interesting and in that sense attractive live more in the mind than in the body still some seem to require such confirmation my impression has always been that the commitment to the act its symbolism is more important than the act itself which in its commission or at least in the reflection upon it tends to emphasise the differences between those involved rather than their similarities i have done the same sort of thing with males of my own species type despite not having sexual feelings specifically for them sometimes it feels only polite cossont lay on her back looked up at the cabin ceiling both hands clasped behind her head anybody id know who my sexual partners amongst the gzilt yes no nor heard of and besides theyre all long dead as of now i believe all my exlovers of all species are dead one or two might be in storage that sounds so sad well it isnt feel free to feel sorry for me if you wish for your own sentimental satisfaction but not on my account i have lived ten thousand years im used to it lovers dying civilisations dying one develops a certain godlike indifference to it all intellectually happily one retains the emotions that let one draw delight from lifes enduring basics like love friendship sex sheer sensory pleasure discovery understanding and erudition even when one knows that in the end its all contingent really thought you were going to say meaningless there no all things have meaning havent we already been through this its just that meaning doesnt mean what we think it means even your attempts at triteness cannot entirely hide the grain of truth in that particular assertion we are all prone in our ways my own comforter at the moment and perhaps for the next few centuries appears to be homing in on the serenity offered by immersing oneself in an environment of allpervading sound for some reason i really only meant to spend a year or so with the leviathids on perytch iv but then felt very at home in that sonic environment very content the voice from the cube paused in the end it palled but only relatively and still it left its own echo an echo of desire of need another pause i the real me may pursue that interest for a time cossont was silent for a while you really are old arent you she said eventually what makes you think that a young younger guy would have asked whether i ever felt attracted to you no a less secure less selfsufficient less sureofhimself person might have she gave it a moment then said so what do you think about your feelings for me yes as a person im sure you found me profoundly interesting though not actually attractive as a potential sexual partner i would prefer to hope the very thought would have been at least slightly unpleasant dont feel you have to confirm or deny any of that what other questions arising might you have how have you kept going all this time fortitude seriously if im to take you seriously your claims seriously how wouldnt you want to kill yourself eventually at some point just at some really low point that youd never have got to if you only lived for a century like they did in the old days or a few centuries or whatever wouldnt that happen well not to me obviously but thats what im asking why why not how come i told you before i take a perverse delight in watching species fuck up i remember ive thought about that i dont believe that can be all there is there must be something else maybe i had something to live for okay but what or maybe i had something to not die for hmm arent they they are not quite the same thing you may have to think about it anyway my precise motivations neednt concern you that i am as old as ive claimed that you believe me that does concern me not a great deal but i would like to think you do believe me sometimes i do sometimes i dont she confessed when i talk to you i do that will suffice anything else i can help you with she smiled though he couldnt see so do we get more secure as we get older some do i have though i have also detected a sort of longterm tidal action in that and a lot of other emotional states for realtime centuries i will feel say gradually more secure in myself then for the next few centuries ill feel less certain or over time ill go from thinking i know pretty much everything to realising i know next to nothing then back again and so on and so on overall it approximates to a sort of steady state i suppose and i am by now quite entirely used to such periodicity and allow for it similarly i seem to oscillate between times of feeling that nothing matters when i tend to act riskily foolishly often on a whim and intervening periods when i feel that everything matters and i become cautious riskaverse fearful and paranoid the former attitude believes in a sort of benign fate thinking i am just somehow destined to live for ever while the latter believes in statistics and a cold uncaring cosmos and cannot quite believe that i have lived as long as i have while ever thinking that life is just a hoot and taking risks and behaving rashly is worth it just for the fun of tweaking the nose of the universe the former state has a sort of cheery contempt for its opposite while the latter is simply terrified of its obverse anyway my point is come back in a century or two and i might not seem so sure of myself in a century in a few years ill be with everybody else in the sublime best place for all of us id go myself but longevity has become such a habit you dont want to be offered the chance to go with us with the gzilt youd be my second choice after the culture itself but no not really my choice to make anyway my real self will take that decision and ill be looked out wherever i am and taken away too if and when the time comes they say its like the most brilliant lucid dream for ever so ive heard do you dream in there no being switched off is exactly like going to sleep youre not really aware of it happening only of waking up again but you wake after a dreamless sleep im sleepy now cossont said yawning involuntarily just at the thought im going to switch you off that definitely okay you sure entirely sweet dreams ms cossont sleep well mr qiria she woke up still aboard the mistake not theyd be at ospin in a couple of hours bouncing into the microrbital belonging to the incast secular collectionary order shed donated the device to she remembered that evening aboard the clipper umpteen years ago and remembered a surprising amount of that conversation with qirias stored mindstate she remembered lying with just two hands clasped behind her neck travelling with the sensibly sized volupt as elegant in form as it was in tone rather than the hulking lump of halfunplayable preposterousness that was the twentyfourstring elevenstring she remembered fretting over things like pleasing her mother without giving in to her and whether shed find somebody as cute as that serving captain in the cocktail bar though single this time she was wondering whether a pursuing ship might be just about to blow them out of the skies or whether some prealerted special forces ultracommandos would be waiting for them at the bokri microrbital to slice or blast them to pieces also whether shed live to see the subliming and whether she would in the end go along with everybody else into it vyr lay in the darkness top hands clasped behind her neck lower hands clasped over her belly thinking that sometimes not all change was for the better the image of a tearful woman sitting with her back to a view of clouds and sea was shown as though on a conventional screen hanging in front of him and then she just seemed to disappear from the face of the planet and apparently her bed hasnt been even slept in for days many i mean several days and then of course she is in the fourteenth the regiment the fourteenth and she was always very active in the reserve very respected and of course theres been this terrible terrible madame terrible explosion on this planet and for all i know well i thought i assumed the worst naturally as any mother would i wondered could she have been there was that where she went did she know something as soon as i heard about about the thing but then there was nothing the screen went blank colonel agansu nodded i see and this lady is she is warib cossont mother of vyr cossont reserve lieutenant commander in the fourteenth the female her mother is referring to the intelligence officer of the uagren said the io the colonel and the ships captain were the only presences within the virtual command space this may tie in with the unexpected presence of the gelishoplule at eshri the captain told agansu the ships last known location was near xown and the last known location of vyr cossont was in the girdlecity of xown if the ship made full speed from xown to eshri there would have been time for it to deliver vyr cossont to the fourteenths hq anything up to two or three hours before our arrival and the attack was vyr cossont listed as one of those aboard the fzanjuym satellite the colonel asked no the io said however that means nothing the captain said there was barely time for her to be registered and besides if she was being summoned for some sort of secret mission she would never have been added to the official complement anyway where did this information come from agansu asked the screen clip came mediumranks secret from regimental central intelligence flagged low probable relevance the io officer said but we then added it to a review of our own multipleremotes sensor data following the destruction of the hq which indicated theres a fifty per cent chance that one of the larger mediumsized pieces of wreckage was a mostly intact though largely disabled fourberth shuttle that being the case there is then a sixty per cent chance that one or more viable biologicals could have been displaced from the wreck to the mistake not the culture ship were following why was this information not extracted from the data at the time agansu asked the data from remotes the captain said especially in a combat volume is received erratically sporadically and late realtime data has to be prioritised colonel i see this lieutenant commander cossont i can see no mention of her in any special forces or intelligence lists we dont believe she is special forces or on a military intelligence secondment the captain said we believe her semicivilian status was not cover but the truth her value to the fourteenths high command may have been opportunistic and sudden the likelihood is it would only just have come to light before she was summoned and what might the nature of that value have been agansu asked we dont know yet the io admitted best guess is possibly related to the culture individual ngaroe qiria who is mentioned in the message from the zihdren recovered at ablate there is record of an individual or individuals of that name having visited gzilt several times in the past the captain added though not for several centuries and all this tells us what agansu asked perhaps where lieutenant commander cossont is heading the captain said until now the culture ship has pursued a course which has made its final destination difficult to predict even at a system level however within the last halfday it has become almost certain that its aiming for somewhere within the ospin system there is a record of vyr cossont travelling to the habitat of bokri within the centralised dataversities of ospin when agansu asked sixteen years ago three and a half years after she returned from a student exchange trip within the culture her most likely destination within bokri we believe would have been the incast order it is possible she deposited an article of some sort with them possibly a mindstate the cargo manifest for the vessel she travelled on is a little ambiguous on the exact nature of whatever she might have left there though some sort of article classified as a selfpowered general storage device alien vouched sophisticated capacity unknown is mentioned as forming part of her luggage on the way there but not on the way back weve started trying to get some answers out of the incast order on this the io said nothing so far there are confidentiality issues also theyre just understaffed the image of the intelligence officer looked at the captain and the colonel with cooperative assets in place we could just hack them but as were on our own with this there wont be much we can do until we physically get there this is anyway all conjecture the colonel pointed out it is the captain agreed but its the best conjecture weve got the io officer said nothing else is flagging connections the culture ship is already running us about as fast as we can go colonel the captain said if it starts bouncing around inside the ospin system theres every chance it can either lose us put somebody or something down anywhere it wants to without us being able to spot it happening or both i think the concatenation of this cossont person and the bokri habitat represents a serious lead and that its worth following i propose we try to follow the ship round ospin if it does start dodging but rather than lose it while we try to find out what its been doing where we assume its heading for ospin and act accordingly colonel agansu thought about this as ever he was painfully aware that even speeded up to the max he was thinking so terribly slowly compared to the captain the intelligence officer and the rest of the uagrens virtual crew he was also aware that he would probably have to leave the easeful security of the ship this vast potent swaddling all around him and become a walkingaround figure once more a soldier again a soldier in a battleworthy combat suit so still encased in layers of power and protection but still just a soldier toting a gun even if the combat arbite was at his side to back him up in a way the prospect filled him with longing just at the thought of fulfilling his duty but in a way it filled him with a dread he could never admit to anyone eventually he said very well i agree captain please commit to that let marshal chekwri know about lieutenant commander cossont weve already copied to her the captain said good agansu said i think it obvious that all possible avenues of research and confirmation related to this should be pursued urgently including somebody trusted if available interviewing madame warib cossont the thing looked like a very delicate golden version of a lace condom a jewellised version of something from ancient history made pointless by its openness orpe stared at it lying there in its luxuriously cushioned case nestled amongst liplike folds of purplestained goldcloth like something illicit half obscene half sumptuously beautiful she held her hands up near her face away from the opened case as though nervous even as her mouth opened and her large eyes drank in the look of it oh i dont it looks so im not sure lets just try it shall we what does it do what is it for i wear something similar very similar they both sink very slightly into our flesh half a hairs breadth and only we know that they are there when we make love when we couple and they touch they add to the pleasure its as simple as that can they are they might they cause harm no no no they are for pleasure purely they are better than surgically sterile and have no effect except when paired with their twin the other half of their matched pair when they create a more intense ecstasy banstegeyn smiled ran his fingers down amongst some of the ringlets in her hair touched her cheek there are many similar paths to the same effect my love just through drugs implants augmentations but the beauty of these is that they are made for each other and have no other effect even if he smiled regretfully one has other lovers they cant be felt they can barely be seen even if you look for them and everything else that would ever normally happen there can still happen people have happily given birth even though i understand that is not advised yet the wearer knows they are there and the wearer of the other half knows that its there it is about commitment you might say and i would say a kind of tying a bonding between us she looked at him shyly they were alone in the dark cabin of a quietly purring skiff on a perfumed lake in a private pleasure garden on the outskirts of myon at a party being thrown by a family long grown rich on government contracts they had both worn masks and plain cloaks like everybody else at the party and is there one for you then she asked he smiled opened the case further revealing another level where a slightly slimmer version of the piece lay also glittering like a narrow pocket of lace made of liquid gold salted with tiny jewels there he said as he smiled and she smiled one each she touched the one that was his stroking it with one finger they are not permanent are they they can be taken out off yes most easily by touching the cloth of the case to any part of them you may keep the case ill wear mine for ever i swear she made a delicate laughlike noise through her nose how do we put them she asked he laughed almost silently how do you think shall i put mine on first perhaps you might like to do that mmm perhaps she said smiling lifting the male piece of the two from its ruched nest it hung from her fingers golden in the subdued light perfectly draped how limp it is she said and pressed herself against him beginning to undo his clothes that will not do now will it not at all he agreed and lay back exhaling allowingly the tramway led tilted into the sky for a long long time shed been put down as close to her destination as the ship had dared but it had still meant a hike through thick fields of chintall bronzecoloured grass to a dusty dirt road and then a longer tramp to a deserted tram stop in the middle of the plain from the platform while she waited she looked in the direction of the mountains but they were too far away a smudge of orangewhite high in the sky to the east might have been clouds above the mountains but the range itself was submerged in the atmospheric haze she was on her way to ahentayawa a hearkenry on the slopes of mount jamanathrus in the querechui range cethyd another traveller came along the road from the opposite direction in a ramshackle threewheeled vehicle that bounced over the tracks in a cloud of dust the single passenger got out lifted a bag then the contraption drove itself away again heading back the way it had come the traveller stopped suddenly on seeing tefwe then bownodded chose a sitting area of the platform at the other end from where tefwe stood and folded itself compactly into a resting configuration the rhombus of its patterned headpart lowered over the complex of creased planes it used as upper limbs the uwanui were mattiform most people most of the time would have called them folds though this term could be insulting depending on the language the term was expressed in and the species it was being used to describe they looked like tall dark angular multiply poled tents complexly folded their rhomboid headparts patterned with eye bands and ear spots cut by a slit that was their mouth looked like oddly tilted flags above the tents of their bodies origami creatures beings of the crease the tram arrived rattling it was three carriages long with an open upper deck perched above the middle carriage she and the dark fold got on the tram was mostly empty it climbed steadily up a slope of tilted plain stopping to pick up or drop off a few travellers those that saw tefwe all stopped and stared at her for a few moments then ignored her nobody chose to sit close to her the sound built very slowly it would have been hard to know when it first started to become distinct from the noises of the rattling swaying tram and the wind moving over the surrounding fields of tall bronzecoloured grasses and occasional thicktrunked coppery trees she became aware of the sound when she realised that shed been assuming for a while that somebody was humming monotonously just behind her only there was nobody there is that the sound she subvocalised to the suit yes the tram clattered to a stop at another station and now she could hear the sound properly distinctly it was a low booming collection of tones like very distant and continuous thunder all the individual claps rolled together and coming and going on the wind she got up out of the uncomfortably tilted seat and went to the front of the trams middle carriage heading upstairs to get a better view there were more of the locals here they parted as though to let her through to the front but she bowed gestured hung back she could see well enough the mountains rose out of the hazy plain ahead like a dark storm of rock the higher massifs draped with cloud the highest peaks capped in orangewhite ice and snow the sound swelled and fell away with a sort of tantalising grace its strength implicitly influenced not just by the light breezes circling round the tram but by mightier winds blowing tens of kilometres away towards the far horizon and kilometres further into the sky the sound she thought was like something you might have heard from an enormous choir of basses singing a slow sonorous hymn in a language you would never understand the tram station in the foothills possessed a sort of modest ordered busyness to it full of the dark folds moving about it with their odd sidetoside flipflopping walk the station connected with a whole fan of cogged funicular lines winding up into the mountains like something being unravelled the sound here was a little louder still coming and going on the wind the line she took rose curving away along the side of one mountain traversed a tall viaduct to the flank of another went squeaking and squealing through a long tunnel then ended up at another small station where three cablecar lines terminated a signpost told her which to take the sound was a little louder here loud enough so that sometimes on the swirling winds you thought you heard a single note or collection of notes and then heard the same again echoed from some distant cliff the funicular car had had less room than the tram and the cablecar gondola had even less room than that the locals almost had to touch her part of her briefing download had been a rough understanding of their language mostly amongst themselves they expressed surprise that she didnt seem to smell the cable car rose over a dark valley of shales and scree then over a tilted plain of tumbled rocks interspersed with low scrubby bushes finally the gondola parked in a bare echoing shed and disgorged they were high now and it was cold the sound was very loud and rich she felt she was starting to feel it in her lungs she hung back to let everybody else go ahead of her then tramped up a wellworn path through a field of higherthanheadhigh boulders all smooth and round stepping stones took her across an icy patch of marsh to a sort of absurdly steep stairway built into a twentymetre cliff of naked rock it was so steep it was nearly a ladder she used the ropes on either side and climbed following a lumbering local with a giant woven basket on its back it heaved itself up corner feet fitting into the creased steps its elongated prehensile sidecorners curling round the thick ropes like hands it achieved the cliff crest with obvious effort hauling itself over a low wall tefwe followed clambering further up and then over into the wavewash of vast bonebattering sound she felt her ears closing up reducing the immediate impact of the colossal noise but she could still feel it through her head through her teeth she stood in the sideon evening light looking slightly downhill to the hearkenry the ahentayawa hearkenry on the slopes of mount jamanathrus was a collection of modest low buildings scattered across the stony ground to the rear of the openfronted cells that formed a long curve facing the mountain itself which rose steep sheetsmooth from the high plain ahead its summit obscured by broad rivers of orangewhite cloud the skyfilling soulbattering earsplitting sound came from the timbrelith caverns tens of thousands of enormous tunnels bored into and through the tops and flanks of this part of the querechui mountains millennia ago by longdeparted aliens many centuries before the uwanui had colonised this part of their world as was so often the case with enigmatic alien artefacts the general assumption was that the work must constitute art the sound was the result of cethyds prevailing belt winds coming thundering through and across those colossal pipes creating a noise like an orchestra of hundreds of gigantic organs all playing a changing selection of most of their available notes at the same time with all their stops pulled out it varied according to the strength and direction of the various winds how the gusts curled and twisted around the peaks and whether the local jetstream was scouring across the peaks of the mountains as well when that happened fortunately only every few years the sound could reach pitches and strengths that could deafen people kilometres away and bring down buildings in the surrounding hearkenries ahead of tefwe the lumbering local with the basket made its slow painfullooking way down to the only twostorey building at the centre of the complex it disappeared under an archway she followed it two folds stood in the centre of the archway blocking her way and that of the local with the heavy woven basket one wall of the archway was grubby white smudged everywhere with grey the basketcarrier was just finishing writing water grains on the wall using a thick stub of charcoal the two folds stepped aside let it pass then stood where they had before blocking the way tefwe bowed then picked up the lump of charcoal it was almost too big to hold onehanded she took a breath the thin air she breathed vibrated with the sound like something made liquid by it and wrote in the local language greetings may i see docent luzuge one of the folds nodded turned and walked away the other stood in the centre of the archway impassive as still as though it had been carved from rock tefwe got to stand there listening to the sound wondering if it was magnified in some way by the archway she thought she could feel it echoing through her feet and legs thrumming up through her like a neverending earthquake eventually two folds appeared one was smaller and paler than the other which she guessed was the guard that had gone to fetch this one who confirmed its identity by taking the charcoal gently from her hand and writing i am luzuge it handed her back the charcoal she wrote afresh greetings my name is tefwe may i see ngaroe qiria luzuge motioned one of the other folds to come forward and look at the names she had written then indicated that it should go it did and she was left looking at the two folds luzuge and one of the guards both of whom rested in front of her in their stoodsittingparked configuration until the first one came back it touched luzuge handpart to handpart with a sort of rippling motion then luzuge nodded to it and it went to the wall it rubbed out her original greeting and request to see the docent and wrote follow she followed it along a dark cold gradually curving corridor at the back of the cells almost at the end of the corridor the fold opened a heavy wooden door and gestured her to enter she was in an open cell with a perfect view of mount jamanathrus in front of her was a low wall about kneeheight on her the cell was bare apart from a small wooden set of drawers in one corner and a crude wooden seat in the middle on which a man in dark robes sat the cell was shaped so as to maximise the sound the rear wall bowed and the corners only really there at ground level above the floor the walls curved in to meet each other forming arches that met in a sort of shallow dome above the man in the dark robes half turned both body and head towards her he looked like qiria though he appeared smaller reduced like something boiled down to its essence his skin visible on his face and hands and feet had gone a dark redbrown again like something undergoing a reduction in the bottom of a pan he wore what looked like dark glasses they had no glass or anything else transparent in them that she could detect instead they were slatted like halfopen blinds tefwe wasnt sure how to greet him so was leaving the choice to him he had never been very forthcoming physically even as a lover if he approached her they might hug but it was not something she expected she saw his mouth move but she could hear nothing over the vast enveloping sound it filled the cell like a god bellowing in her ear she shook her head though he wasnt really looking at her he reached to one side picked up a cord lying on the floor and pulled it the cell started to go dark as some sort of covering began rolling down over the single open window the noise reduced a little then he got up and went to the side of the window swinging in a heavy wooden twopart shutter tefwe did the same at the other side the cell was almost completely dark now her eyes were working mostly on infrared the sound was reduced less than the light it was still there especially the deepest most resonant and longest notes but when qiria put a thick wooden bolt across between the two shutters to secure them she heard the clunk it made it was she realised the first thing shed heard that wasnt the sound in quite a long time her ears relaxed a little qiria had sat down in his crudelooking seat again she sat by the low wall in front of him under the shutters at first she thought he wasnt going to look at her seemingly gazing over her head as though still staring out towards the mountain then he lowered his head so tefwe he began speaking marain his voice little more than a croak he coughed cleared his throat started again voice louder and assured so tefwe let me guess you just happened to be in the neighbourhood hello ngaroe its good to see you again how are you im well he smiled it was hard for her to read his expression behind the slatted glasses but she reckoned it was a genuine smile you also well though its complicated she looked around the bare little cell what is it that you do here ngaroe his eyebrows went up a little at this isnt it obvious he asked mildly i listen you listen yes thats thats all i do i sit here and well he said smiling this was tefwe was already thinking the most smiley and unprickly she could remember seeing the man calling it listening doesnt really do it justice i sit here and absorb the sound it becomes part of me i become part of it it is magisterial blissmaking overwhelming i am transported by it tefwe here the locals treat it as a religious experience i dont of course but id still claim it is as important to me as it is to them as profound he gave a small laugh youre lucky you know it comes and goes right now i am like a sleeper near the shallowest part of a sleepcycle so i can come out of the trance of listening and talk to you i i almost welcome the break a week from now though and id refuse even to talk to anybody no matter who they might be how far theyd come or how urgently they needed to see me and in two weeks i would be so far under id be incapable even of acknowledging the presence of one of the helpers come to tell me i had a visitor thats when they have to feed me water with a sponge and try to get me to swallow crumbs of cake he smiled his beatific smile again but you said that it that is how you are was complicated in what way its complicated because in a sense im not really here ngaroe she told him im still stored technically basically on a ship called the you call this clean a long long way from here what you see in front of you is a copy i feel entirely like me inside here but the truth is im embodied inside a ships blankbody appropriately customised hmm so let me see i think only hassipura knew where id hidden myself this time have you been to see it yes it still builds sandstream complexes on a lifeforsaken plain in the middle of nowhere on an o called dibaldipen the kind of barren wasteland on an orbital that designers pretend they meant to happen all the time but which is really the result of overartistic weatherpattern modelling and which secretly they are thoroughly ashamed of and embarrassed by she paused though i was in yet another copied body then still it feels exactly as though that was me riding out across the desert to talk to the recalcitrant machine it ah it sends its regards by the way she shrugged it was being sincere and unironic as far as i could tell qiria smiled yes i visited it there he told her honn dibaldipen dusty anyway what has caused this proliferation of tefwes tefwe he asked oh theres a flap going on they need me to ask you something whos they a fairly standard ship collective handling the latest budding emergency sc no though some scassociated ships helped get me to hassipura and now to you should i be worried or flattered flattered hassipura told you where i was willingly yes how easy was it to convince it it took time but that was mostly just showing it the respect it believes its due that drone demands a certain ceremoniality in such matters qiria smiled again nodded and you left it well functioning entirely anyway it still has surprisingly many ambitions in regard to its desiccated hobby so what is it you want of me we need you to confirm or deny something it will take a little while to explain i have the time do you of course its about the gzilt ahha theyre about to sublime i know i trust that all goes smoothly ah well she said and told him all she had been told he sat forward listening nodding now and again so tefwe said the zr seem to think you might be able to confirm what the message from the zihdren themselves is claiming that the book of truth is a lie part of somebodys experiment in applied practical theology or something and we the culture have been asked to help the zr with this plus we have a kind of obligation to the gzilt to do the right thing but how much difference might it make qiria asked sounding sad knowing the truth of it if it is true tefwe shrugged i dont know ngaroe im not sure anybody knows but we cant just let it go i guess the truth always needs to be chased down im helping with the chasing and you have the answer or part of it if you remember do you remember he just sat there smiling at her silent the sound outside a vast shadowy symphony of meaninglessness still seemed to fill the small nightdark cell her throat was a little sore she realised from having to keep her voice raised for so long she cleared it said i remember that you told me you forgot nothing remembered everything had it all stored within you sometimes multiply in exhaustive awful boring terrible detail detail ghastly for its sheer everlasting banality she paused to give him time to speak but still he didnt it would be good to know what you know about all this ngaroe you always seemed to feel something for the gzilt it might help them to know whether this is the truth at last or another lie she paused again but still he kept silent even if we find out something that it might be best for them not to know at least well know at least well have the choice but who would we be to make that choice their friends really the culture has no selfish interests in this ngaroe she said trying not to sigh though doubting that hed hear her if she did she could sense that they were already starting to gravitate back to some of the arguments theyd had centuries ago they had ended inconclusively then unless you counted mutual annoyance as a conclusion and she thought it highly unlikely theyd end up any different this time he looked unconvinced eyebrows rising again the culture has an interest in everything it touches he said i thought wed agreed that at least maybe so but no selfish interest we just want to do the right thing by people weve historically felt close to ah that old excuse will you stop that she could feel herself starting to get angry with him again and that was not going to help its not an excuse its just the truth one persons truth he began oh fuck she said looking away and crossing her arms here we go she looked back when she realised he was laughing what she demanded i cant help you tefwe he told her he was looking down now what why not i just cant he reached down by the side of the chair felt for and found the cord there and started pulling it she could hear the matting that had rolled down over the cells open window earlier as it was pulled back up again the sound pulsed back into the room filling it like an avalanche bursting into a cabin an instant before it was swept away entirely because he said shouting i got rid of those memories some years ago he completed hauling the sounddeadening matting back up and sat back again as though exhausted like somebody long deprived of the sunlight finally being allowed to face directly into its warmth again he took a deep satisfied breath and shouted so i dont have them any more not here not on me not in me theyre gone tefwes ears had mostly closed up again assaulted by the noise she wasnt sure she could really hear what qiria was saying any more it was more that she was lipreading there was a fraction more light getting into the cell now around the stillclosed shutters but why she shouted fear tefwe he said shrugging i was frightened that what i knew would be enough to cause me trouble given what was going to happen given the subliming so i made sure that the memories became encoded in just one place two places then i saw an old friend who relieved me of them he shook his head now i have no idea what i used to know im sorry so where are where were those memories she asked yelling where were they encoded he reached up to his face with one hand took off the slatted glasses the heat coming off his skin differentiated according to the various surfaces on his face plus the small amount of evening light leaking round the edges of the shutters meant her eyes could see quite well enough in the very first instant she wasnt sure exactly what she was looking at or what was wrong with his face then she started to realise she felt herself frowning and sitting further forward to see properly and to make sense of what it was she was seeing though she thought she knew now and thought she should really have known all along at first she thought that where his eyes had been he now had a pair of bellybuttons but that was just her first instinctive reaction looking closer thinking it through she realised that what he actually had in his eye sockets in place of his eyes quite neatly integrated looking for all the world as though they belonged there was another pair of ears ngaroe smiled though it was a thin smile this time perhaps even a mocking one the sound though baffled by the heavy shutters seemed to rise suddenly then and shake her to her core making her synthetic lungs resonate and her carbon bones vibrate and her own augmented eyes quiver and water in their sockets it all but drowned out his voice through her tears she struggled to lipread what he said in reply to her question about where the missing memories had been encoded take a guess tefwe seventeen s xlsv you call this clean olou caconym ogcu displacement activity ogsv empiricist ogsv just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry oue mistake not omsv passing by and thought id drop in omsv pressure drop ogsv contents may differ hello bad news mr qiria has been tracked down but would appear no longer to have the information we seek see attached report xgsv contents may differ ms tefwe seems to have been unable to take any steps which might have confirmed whether he was telling the truth or not are we simply going to take his word for this i had gathered that the gentleman wasis notoriously unreliable xlsv you call this clean correct however determining whether he was telling the truth or not would have meant kidnapping mr qiria that would have been difficult and wrong and it is hard to see what his motivation might be in lying about this he certainly had the ability to compartmentalise his memories in the way described and his eyes were genuinely missing as the reports appendices make clear ms tefwe carried analytical capacity which independently verified both that this was the real person and that his eyes had been surgically excised short of removing him entirely from the hearkenry to carry out a full body scan it is not easy to see what more could be done i think we have to take this as it appears xgsv just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry and it appears that the problem recedes over the horizon once again its solution still out of our reach are we really determined to pursue this chimera regardless of cost xgsv contents may differ i suspect the consensus remains much as it was has anyone changed their opinion since the last vote no all right then we are as we were xgsv just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry thinking i hope of what we do if and when we discover whatever there is to discover personally i would vote for not telling the gzilt no matter what we find and i suspect i am not alone in feeling that way which is why i question the point of looking so insistently in the first place i dont want to appear presumptuous but perhaps we might all think a little along these lines xlou caconym gee thinking ahead whomd a thunk a that xgsv contents may differ mistake not it would appear to be up to you and lieutenant commander cossont xue mistake not yup little busy the elegance of conventional orbitals lay in the fact that their diameter they were usually about three to four million kilometres across meant that the speed you had to rotate them at to produce what would feel like standard gravity to your average culture person not to mention a generous statistical spread of nonculture humanoids and other species also automatically produced a daynight cycle that was right in the middle of what the culture regarded as the acceptable spectrum of values the artificial insideout worlds usually orbited their stars on roughly circular paths generally following orbits set between those of any planets present though sometimes taking up the same orbit socketed into safe noncollisionary lockstep tracks in and around the planets trojan points some orbitals flew more ellipsoidal paths swinging further out and closer in to their star to produce seasons if desired spinning them almost but not quite edgeon to their parent sun prevented the far side from eclipsing whatever part lay in sunlight at the time the culture hadnt invented orbitals like this but it had taken them up with an enthusiasm nobody else had ever displayed the minds attracted both by the grandiosity of the concept this was engineering on an epic scale and even the skinniest full o had the surface area of twenty or thirty standard oneg planets and by its sheer chronocyclic materialfrugal elegance compared to planets orbitals represented a very mattercheap way of providing generous amounts of pleasantly rural and even wildlooking living space plus you could usually build your orbitals from exactly the asteroidal debris youd want to get rid of in a solar system anyway to stop bits of it flying around and hitting your fancy new worlds microrbitals were as the name implied much smaller versions of the same basic idea they could be any diameter you wanted because the spin speed wasnt rigidly linked to both the force experienced at their surface and their daynight cycle you spun a microrbital at the appropriate rate to produce whatever apparent gravity you required set it circumferenceon to the sunlight then put a suite of angled mirrors at its centre to reflect the light rotating these independently to give you the desired lightdark periodicity the microrbital of bokri was tiny barely more than a thousand kilometres across this was so small that the retaining side walls of sheet diamond which kept the atmosphere in would have met in the middle had the world been filled with a significantly denser atmosphere or spun much slower as it was the central mirrors were so close to the top of the walls that they rested on struts running along their inside edges so that the whole assemblage looked like the axle and spokes of a giant wheel the world was almost as long down its axis as it was wide and was conventionally arranged by the relaxed abundantly provisioned standards of a postscarcity humanoid civilisation with parkland forests lakes and aesthetically pleasing builtup areas and isolated grand architectural statements spread across its nearly three million square kilometres of interior surface the gzilt had never entirely turned their backs on the ideas of both private ownership and money though the latter had been demoted to being of mostly ceremonial value and both had been detached from what most people regarded as being the most important measure of a persons worth there had been enough of everything to go around everybody in the gzilt civilisation for many millennia and while a degree of selfinterest and acquisitiveness was taken as being only natural outright selfobsession and fullon greed were regarded as signs of weakness of character if not a symptom of actual psychological damage the bokri microrbital was jointowned by a group of secular collectionary orders institutionalised obsessive only parareligious organisations each devoted to one or other aspect of preservation one order collected ancient farming implements another chemical rockets and antique space craft while another had specialised in household dust its sheds and warehouses were packed with billions and billions of vials and other containers collected from worlds and habitats throughout the gzilt realm over thousands of years and filled with nothing more than the sort of stuff that collected in the corners of rooms and cabins and which had been picked swept sucked or electrostaticked up by volunteers or enthusiasts to be sent to the little siblings of the detritus on bokri this had seemed idiotic even perverse to many people right from the start but had turned out to be surprisingly if modestly useful providing the raw material for many an undergraduate paper on for example changing patterns of casual domestic ambient surface debris through the ages the incast were a philosophical order dedicated to storing as much of the disputed superseded or just plain longprovedwrong knowledge that the gzilt civilisation and species had built up over the millennia and any artefacts associated therewith housed in multiply backedup and distributed memory storage facilities across bokri and various other microrbitals throughout the ospin system and beyond were entire libraries of ancient conspiracy theories crackpot physics hypotheses unutterably antique speculations on anatomy chemistry and astronomy and as a sort of sideline devices holding the mindstates of untold numbers of individuals and groupminds mostly gzilt but from other species as well some were static backups for the dynamic originals held and running elsewhere some were being retained under the instructions of the people whose personalities and memories they held encoded to be reenergised and their inhabitants woken at some specific date or when something especially noteworthy occurred to the gzilt the subliming naturally representing pretty much the ultimate example of that criterion and some had effectively been lost or abandoned in the culture stuff like this would be collected by minds with an interest in just such societal flotsam and jetsam and stored in the specially adapted bays and hangars of gsvs or in the subsidiary structures of orbital hubs in the gzilt the centralised dataversities of ospin were the place they acted as the sump the filtered partitioned bilges of the civilisation the main incast facility within bokri lay in the centre of a broad circular lake it was a spherical building a kilometre across looking like a sort of reversed image of an iceberg with barely a tenth of its bulk seemingly lying beneath the surface of the lake it was mostly white wore its multistorey nature on its surface with obvious horizontal divisions but possessed relatively few piercings windows or balconies it was generally reached by an evacuated traveltube system set on a long elegantly thin bridge extending from the shore of the lake a kilometre away the mistake not reckoned they didnt really have the time to indulge in such niceties so deposited cossont the android eglyle parinherm and its own avatar berdle near the centre of the building displacing them neatly into an empty elevator car and using a small collection of similarly droppedoff comms and effector gear to start interfacinginterfering with the facilitys own administrational data complexes the ship itself though much slowed for its erratic transit of the system hadnt paused as it passed bokri it had already taken a wild almost jagged route through the cloud of habitats and dataversities pinging from one to another like a ball down a nailboard just to confuse anybody following having got cossont and the others to their destination and feeling fairly sure that it had indeed shaken off any pursuing craft it raced off to continue its eccentric jointhedots loop through the system it had promised to be back within the hour that ought to be long enough still not getting anything cossont asked the avatar berdle shook his head pinging away merrily he said quietly but nothings answering the avatar and the various pieces of gear the ship had displaced into and around the facility were trying to locate the device with qirias mindstate inside it by sending out signals it might respond to assuming it possessed any normal culture processing the mistake not had tried to contact the warm considering the ship believed to have helped qiria encode his mindstate within the cube to get whatever technical details about the device it could but the other ship had yet to reply from what it could gather nobody willing to tell even knew where the warm considering was why exactly are we here the android parinherm asked looking round the pleasantly wide softly carpeted and very slightly curving corridor theyd found on exiting the lift the corridors whitewithahintofblue walls glowed very gently with the fake daylight of a lightly overcast day and were covered in thin grooves some of which indicated doorways with hermeticquality shutlines you are here to protect ms cossont the ships avatar explained also looking round she is here because she is looking for something may i help the android asked brightly like cossont and berdle it wore wellcut if nondescript civilian clothes cossont wore a thick necklace of what looked like brushed silver just be prepared to step in to protect ms cossont berdle told it patiently in case i am unable to parinherm stared at the avatar you are remarkably opaque to my senses he remarked what are you an avatar parinherm berdle said smiling surely you guessed that yes parinherm said nodding good to have it confirmed would this be a joint culturegzilt scenario berdle nodded feel free to treat it as such and i cossont said am a human with a low boredom threshold im almost starting to regret leaving pyan back on the ship she spread all four arms can we do something berdle nodded were going to have to it said theres nothing coming back he smiled at cossont this will require you to make an official request to locate and retrieve your property from the facility yippee do i have to fill out a form you have to submit a formal application five days in advance berdle told her she stared at him five days i assume you have some clever the formal application was emplaced two seconds ago the avatar told her suitably if illegally backdated berdle bowed please follow me he said turning on his heel ms cossont the executive recoupments officer said coming to stand before them he nodded at her companions bowed to her the waiting area was extensive pale lush with potted plants filled with the sound of water trilling in fountains and pools and dotted with very comfortable seating cossont lounged in what she trusted was a suitably proprietorial fashion upper arms spread her lower set concealed by her formal jacket legs crossed a small shoulder bag lying on her lap berdle and the android had chosen to remain standing looking slowly about all the time may we offer you a beverage no thank you i wasnt even aware there were any arrivals today the incast officer said glancing at a projected screen hanging in midair down and to one side of his straightahead sightline ms cossont arrived by private craft berdle said smoothly ah i see the officer said and youve come in from he continued looking at cossont who was listening on her earbud as berdle saidplease let me to her at the same time as he said to the officer ms cossonts application to retrieve her property is in order i take it the officer was dressed in vaguely ecclesiasticlooking pale robes he looked from cossonts stony expression to berdles agreeably open one he checked his screen one hand moving and his eyes flicking yes yes its all in order he smiled emptily at berdle the object has been located and is being retrieved as we speak splendid berdle said quietly the officer looked back to cossont we usually ask our clients if there is a particular reason for them wishing to recoup an object again allow me berdle said to cossont as he said how commendable to the incast officer what is the most common reason given ah the officer said distracted again sadly due to client confidentiality strictures we are unable to share that information what a terrible pity berdle said looking sympathetic he put one hand gently on the officers forearm and said i am sure then that you will fully understand that ms cossont has equally valid reasons for being unable to share with you her reasons for being unable to share with you the information that you seek and request i trust i am not mistaken in proceeding on the assumption that this request is of a noncompulsory voluntary optin nature the executive recoupments officer looked like he was processing this after a moment he said well indeed he glanced at his screen excuse me the requested object is in transit he smiled at the unresponsive cossont ill fetch it one moment he turned and walked back to the curved sweep of desks where theyd found him earlier sitting with his feet up listening to music berdle watched him go then turned back to cossont who raised her eyebrows all going smoothly berdle told her through the earbud parinherm was staring intently at a water feature ten metres away the features central fountain closed down suddenly collapsing with a sort of relaxed decorum the watery tinkling sounds filling the reception and waiting space quietened very slightly parinherm berdle sent the android turned to look at the ships avatar just testing he replied i trust the test has been completed to your satisfaction it has then if youd be so kind certainly the fountain burst into life again leaping higher into the air than it had before and causing some water to go splashing over the edge of the pool and onto the carpet oops the fountain settled back to normal the executive recoupments officer returned holding a white halfmetre cube here we are he said presenting it to cossont with a bow thank you she told him glancing at berdle who came forward and accepted the box as cossont rose to her feet ms cossont herself will need to open the the officer said as cossont opened the box looked inside and lifted out a silvergrey cube also the storage container remains our the officer said as berdle handed the white box back to the officer and cossont slipped the cube into her shoulder bag thank you for your help berdle told the officer well be on our way my pleasure the executive recoupments officer said as the three walked towards the elevators we still have twothirds of an hour before the ship returns berdle said through cossonts earbud as they stepped into the lift i thought we might leave the facility and find a hostelry of some sort on the lake shore to wait there cossont nodded as the doors closed the car started its descent then its soft lighting seemed to flicker delicately it drew smoothly to a stop settling finally with what cossont heard as a single click and the two nonhumans present both heard as three distinct snicking noises a background susurrus cossont had hardly noticed consciously ceased suddenly the android and the avatar exchanged looks ahhah parinherm said with a smile this is berdle said aloud and then seemed to think about what it was unpromising he concluded is that you he was asking the android at the same time facility mainframe material systems motile systems general elevator control suite basementtomidsection shaft complex corecentral faults fault notification fault confirmation fault override safe fault workarounds yes all that please leave that to me youre getting in the way and stop trying to remove the block on the cars external av feed i did that nearly a quarter of a second ago very well what may i do please remainbe on full alert within the immediate physical environment with particular regard to extraneous anomalous audible and general vibration signals extending your sensoreffector abilities no further than the elevator cars and the shafts own monitoring and activation circuits ill continue monitoring and trying to affect further afield my onboard expert systems precedents set indicates strongly we might be in a definitional preattack phase and so close to the point at which some sort of physical measure may become advisable agreed currently eliminating all chances this could be happenstance before taking any irretrievably physical action we should warnprepare ms cossont also agreed i am in the process of interrupting her unpromis cossont was saying as berdle talked over her saying strong likelihood this is hostile im activating your esuit and neckhelmet please do not be alarmed and remember to put all your weight first on one foot and then the other ing cossont finished as something happened all over her body her underwear consisted of a millimetrethin body suit which only left her feet hands and head uncovered the ship had insisted she wear it and that they perform a drill before she left to see what would happen if it deployed before her eyes even before shed put it on the esuit had grown an extra set of arms as easily as though it was a big complicated balloon the ship was blowing up and these had been the last bits to unstick themselves and inflate as it had during the practice on the ship the suit puffed up a little all over while the thick hems at ankles and wrists unrolled the suit quickly covering all her hands and fingers in thin gloves and slipping between her feet and shoes in turn as she did as shed been told and performed a sidetoside stepping motion to allow this to happen what felt like thin bootees now enveloped her feet the thick necklace had unrolled at the same time extending quickly downward to bond with the collar of the suit while blossoming and closing round her head before shrinking back again to rest lightly on her scalp and most of her face leaving her eyes nostrils and lips free under small bulges in the material the bulges over her eyes were transparent the first thing she did was tear off the restrictive formal jacket freeing her lower set of arms she got tangled in the strap of the shoulder bag finally setting it securely back in place over her head the problem is located in the primary shaft control node berdle told parinherm it is under continual and dynamic effector load from apparatus it is beyond the abilities of our local assets to counter i am sending a missile component to the location to attempt some sort of intervention a missile are we escalating to your pardon missile as in for example scout missile decimetrescale fieldpowered nonexpendable one hundred metres away horizontally from the arrested lift and fifty metres higher within a service space in a suspended ceiling over a dark unoccupied lecture theatre a stubby cylinder the size of a fat pen jerked into motion it lifted and stabbed forward flourishing an angstromfine cutting field that sank into and peeled back the thin metal covering of an air duct the missile was one of three displaced into the spherical incast facility by the mistake not along with various other bits and pieces of potentially useful equipment almost all of which were rapidly redeploying to suit the current situation the missile slipped into the duct and accelerated hard within metres achieving speeds which caused a wave of expansion and compression to travel down the ducting with it making the ducts metal creak and its supports groan razorsharp grilles inside the ducting stationed every few tens of metres to stop animal pests using the ducts as runs were despatched in fieldsliced showers of glittering shards barely slowing the device at all fuck cossont breathed looking from parinherm to berdle this isnt good is it no it isnt the avatar agreed then its head flicked impossibly fast for a real human towards the lifts manual control panel an instant before a gentle beeping noise came from the speaker grille parinherm seemed to be about to speak but berdle held up one finger in a neutral voice he said yes the missile came to the end of the useful part of the air duct in a last burst of grille components exiting into a parallel elevator shaft flying straight across as it twisted and slowed bouncing off the shafts ceramic surface hard enough to leave a crushindentation then pulsing up the shaft at maximum acceleration towards the undersurface of an ascending elevator car it adjusted its course jolting across the shaft aiming for near one corner of the car and bursting through it it had time to register three humans present in the lift through the shower of debris then it was bursting out through the roof it used its already deployed cutting field like an airscrew to provide a tiny amount of extra lift then as a fender to cushion the next blow on the roof of the shaft as it twisted and turned again and darted down an access tunnel to the next shaft braking hard at the last moment as it neared the offending control unit below in the shaft it had just left it could hear screams these would likely be associated with its incursion into the elevator car two seconds earlier and probably indicated extreme surprise as well as some shrapnel injuries is that ms cossont vyr lieutenant commander reserve a male voice asked from the grille in a conversational tone getting some air movement compression in the shaft out there parinherm sent thats my missile berdle sent back at the same time as he said it is not to the grille why has this lift stopped ah then i must be addressing one of the two gentlemen who accompanied the lady my name is colonel agansu of the home system regiment on special secondment unspecified id like to talk to ms cossont did you stop this lift berdle said voice clipped and severe set in motion again immediately fifty metres over berdles head the missile floated in midair in front of a control unit barely bigger than itself inspecting the quivering cage of bizarrely spectrumed energies enclosing the unit and the cables leading to and from it effectortargeted component and ancillaries highly extshielded it reported to the avatar actions to controldefeat unclear berdle briefly reviewed the poorquality video the device was sending and the missiles available weaponry it was the least well armed of the three that had been displaced reducing the options closeentrain all mm minirounds the avatar sent set for point centred kinetic assist copy the missile sent and squirted all its tiny shells at the fieldwrapped control unit at once far too close together to work properly had they been travelling further than a few tens of metres as they were travelling less than a metre before impact and detonation this didnt matter it used its maniple and cutting fields to kick them forward at the same time imparting a little extra kinetic energy and throwing itself backwards as a result light erupted around the control unit temporarily blinding the missile as it extended its forward fields to fend off the blast wave and pieces of debris and used its rear field components to help cushion it against the blow as it hit the far side of the shaft it had flown up seconds earlier first i need to talk to the voice from the grille was saying wow parinherm sent subgramme am explosion fifty up correction series of same but smaller the air in the lift seemed to pulse gently as the shock wave travelled down the shafts structure berdle put his hand out and took hold of cossonts elbow she appeared to have noticed the pulse of infra sound and was opening her mouth to speak as the thud from above came the blast wave slammed down onto the roof of the car sending the human avatar and android briefly up into the air as the whole lift was rammed down a notch on its trio of side ratchets the three dropped to the floor again steadied themselves debris approaching you the missile sent medium subsonic it sidled back through the dust and smoke choking the debrislittered access tunnel to inspect the control unit target unharmed its a ship berdle thought the units being effectorised by a ship or a unit as strong as one a warship would carry pause he told the missile prepare full personal destruct immediately under unit wh cossont had time to say before a series of titanic claps shook the elevator car from above her helmet had inflated itself and gone to triple layer above the crown of her head berdle watched the lifts ceiling dent in a couple of places fifty metres above still in a storm of smoke and dust and a faint snowfall of ceramic flakes filtering from the shafts summit the missile positioned itself carefully the voice of colonel agansu from the grille did a little better than cossont getting out the whole of what before matters proceeded thats a scout missile parinherm asked berdle really no thats a knife missile berdle replied and expendable as it turns out the roofceiling above would take more the avatar decided and the elevator car appeared structurally sound alarms were warbling in the distance and the local networks where not under attack were buzzing with sudden traffic the incast facility was not without protection or resources and was fighting back as best as its automatics knew how against the effector onslaught from outside and inside its walls that the other side had such powerful assets in place so quickly was not a good sign though the avatar knew well need to protect ms cossont physically now from above berdle told parinherm double and then treblechecking the state of the missiles antimatter battery before to the missile sending the signalat per cent am yield prepare confirm copy per cent am yield enact the knife missile blew itself up cossont felt herself go utterly limp from the outside in somehow had she had the time shed have worried about her bowels relaxing but instead she was fascinated to find that she now had no control whatsoever over any of her major muscles which having been lost to her now seemed to have developed minds of their own and taken the decision to roll her up into a foetal ball while parinherm and berdle perhaps similarly afflicted were arching over the top of her if shed seen this done on stage she thought it might have looked quite an elegant ballet move blastfromabovecomingapologies berdle said in her earbud talking very fast and clipped there was an almighty crack of sound she felt briefly weightless though still held down by the two bodies spread over her and then the floor came smacking up towards her slapping her feet creaking her bones and making her insides feel bruised her chin on her tighttogether knees tried to bury itself between her calves the shoulder bag with the cube in it pressed painfully into her back it all went very dark she expected to find her ears ringing but they werent something cracked above her making the whole lift shudder okay berdle asked her as the avatar and the android pulled up away from her and her suit started bringing her quickly to her feet standing she suddenly found she had control of her body again there was a haze of dust in the car and the centre of the roof had caved in to the extent that the three of them had to stand back near the walls yeah she said what was knife missile selfdestructing directly above us berdle said excuse me the avatar squatted his hands seemed to sink into the surface of the soft plastic floor and then he pulled back there was the sound of tearing protesting metal and berdles feet sank deep enough into the plastic tiles to cause ripples round the soles of his shoes which themselves seemed to be deforming parinherm jerked suddenly seemed to stagger cossont stared at it you okay i just tried activating some ag parinherm sent to berdle i think i got targeted nonviable fine it told cossont brightly at the same time our adversaries are able to manipulate the topography of the local gravitational environment when we give them a target berdle told the android parinherm thought about this neat he sent the other displaced components are experiencing the same problems berdle told the android only the knife missiles are unaffected ag is a little subtle for their purposes they just use naked force fields pulled by the avatar a giant flap of metal and plastic came peeling and screeching back from the floor showing the shaft underneath sinking away into darkness several hundred metres below berdle dropped headfirst into it his feet remaining hooked onto the floor parinherm the avatar sent along with a simple diagram of what it wanted the android to do if you would certainly parinherm replied and dropped through the hole too also headfirst feeling berdle catch his ankles as he fell past and then cooperating in a swinging motion that within two oscillations allowed his hands to reach the upper edge of an open doorway where a tiny missile the size of a human thumb was floating two delicatelooking outstretched field components fending off the twin doors which were sliding back and forth continually trying to close vyr berdle shouted make sure the cube is secure within your bag then climb down my body lie on my back and hold on very tightly the suit will help what cossont said kneeling by the side of the hole in the lift floor and staring down the bottomlesslooking shaft berdle was stretched across the shaft at fortyfive degrees she couldnt see parinherm at all climb down me first berdle said reasonably well tackle the rest as we go quaking cossont checked the shoulder bag was fastened then lowered herself down the body of the avatar feet first holding on to his legs then turned round on her knees on the slope of berdles back she had never been more thankful for having four arms also the suit did seem to be helping but not as much as shed have liked she lowered herself to lie on his back shaking blood pounding in her ears the bag slid round her shoulder hitting berdle on the head her hand was shaking as she went to grab it sorry she yelled no im sorry berdle said are you afraid of heights no she said through clenched teeth just of dying generally she put the bag over her shoulder again and hugged the avatar from behind so hard that had he been human shed have worried about cracking his ribs okay berdle sent to parinherm ready the little missile floating between the doors on its gyre of fields withdrew letting the doors start to close as parinherm let go of the top lip of the doorway and immediately flicked his hands around to grasp the edges of the closing doors secure hold the android sent as the doors pressed into his fingers really tight now vyr berdle said quietly then brought his feet together letting him and cossont fall from the undersurface of the elevator car they pendulumed in the air their combined mass sending them both swinging thudding into the shaft wall the avatar took most of the impact and the suits gloves protected cossonts hands but it still hurt parinherm fingers jammed now had his own weight and that of the two people clinging to him on his arms hands and fingers which were being forced to slide down the narrow gap between the almost fully closed doors even in a fairly optimistic humanflattering virtuality parinherm thought a real human would be screaming headoverheels down the shaft at this point the bloody stumps of their fingers still trapped between the doors happily i am not human parinherm thought and this is only a simulation climbing berdle sent and quickly hauled himself up the androids body hand over hand taking cossont with him he stood braced on the lower lip of the doorway and swept the doors open parinherm dropped a metre but held on to the lower lip easily enough stepped forward and turned to let cossont jump off his back and then stooped to grasp the androids hand just as with a creak and a sudden rush of air the elevator car dropped down the shaft in front of the open doors hit and severed parinherms fingers and then shuddered on downwards to sweep the rest of his body away damn the android sent i was enjoying that cossont caught her breath started forward towards the open shaft looking down at the fastretreating roof of the battered lift as air sucked out all around her berdle reached pulled her backwards away from the shaft you know the avatar said stepping round her and looking out from the alcove where the lift doors were set then taking another step out into the gently bowed corridor parinherm will probably be okay but we have to something seemed to strike the avatar full in the upper abdomen berdle was jerked backwards as a blinding light burst out all around him and something exploded further down the broad curve of corridor cossont was sent flying back towards the open doors and the shaft staggering and skidding right to the edge all four arms windmilling desperately as she stood teetering heelson to the drop her eyes were going crazy reacting mostly too late to the starburst of light that had erupted from the avatar filling her vision with black dots berdle still seemed to be there in front of her his body shuddering wrapped in flames she felt herself start to tip backwards into the void oh fuck she heard herself say and thought what pathetic words those were and not even remotely original and unique she thought as she canted backwards arms still hopelessly wheeling berdle enveloped in fire stepped forward and caught the strap of her shoulder bag onehanded he stopped her held her then grabbed her round the waist with his other hand and pulled her forward back into the alcove best get down he said kneeling within the alcove she dropped to her haunches taking cover behind the metre of wall between the jammedopened doors and the corridor berdle stripped the remains of his burning clothes off and threw them down the elevator shaft his skin had gone silvery there was no mark on his back at all shed have expected an exit wound actually shed have expected him to be blown in half what the fuck she asked she was trying hard not to shriek didnt quite see that coming in time berdle said turning and grinning at her managed to a hole appeared instantly in his back she could see straight through his body to his silvery thighs the hole was big enough for her to have put her fist in the smooth hole closed up again just as quickly but not quite fast enough caught some round the edges sorry about that he nodded at the floor lost the scout missile cossont looked at the floor where half of the little scout missile that had been holding the doors open earlier lay gently smoking the avatar put one finger to the edge of the alcove flicked it out and brought it back just as another bright beam came lancing past where his finger had been an instant earlier the edge of wall flared and a heavy detonation came from somewhere past them down the corridor a blast of light followed by a bodyshaking tremble beneath their feet and a pulse of blast forcing cossont to lower her head briefly grey smoke was drifting along the ceiling and a whole spectrum of alarms went squawking warbling and howling all around them then there was a dull seemingly very distant thud almost infrasound deep the ribbon of dark smoke in the lift shaft extending from the burning clothes berdle had discarded trembled in the column of air oof hit bottom parinherm sent per cent disabled but still alive endrun im guessing nice working with you powering dow parinherm is still alive berdle told cossont we are being fired at by some sort of military arbite stationed just at the lineofsight curvelimit of the corridor to the right to the left eighty metres away one corridor higher advancing this way at jogging speed is a gzilt person in a full battle suit armed with a laser assault rifle this may be the colonel agansu person who contacted us earlier i have two knife missiles to the left within this corridor they are holding fire while gzilt civilians on a tour are evac wait im being contacted excuse me androidavatar entity this is colonel agansu do you read come in colonel agansu wishes to talk berdle told cossont given our situation and the time we have to wait for the ship to return i believe keeping him talking is to be preferred to having him or his adjuncts shooting at us the ship cossont said her teeth wanted to chatter she tried to stop them how long it was still twothirds of an hour away it is returning a little faster now the avatar said though we still need to stall the colonel i intend therefore to engage him in conversation you engage away she told him androidavatar entity in the corridor this is colonel agansu do you read come in colonel agansu berdle sent to what do we owe such destructive attention ah and who might i have the pleasure of addressing you knowing my name is that really necessary colonel my knowing it is strictly speaking unnecessary ill grant agansu sent however purely for forms sake we might as well exchange names sobriquets at least i fail to see how this will make any material difference to our exchanges of information or fire i dont mean to imply we are at all likely to become friends sir but a degree of civilised politeness should not prevent us discharging our duties or our weapons of which you seem to possess rather few following the destruction of your knife missile not to mention the demise of your fellow at the bottom of the elevator shaft i am somewhat tempted to send the arbite up the corridor towards you just to see what you are able to put in its way to stop it however i am aware that ms cossont is relatively vulnerable compared to your good self and may come to some harm in any resulting firefight even while you might remain quite hale and hearty the arbite is already in a state of some confusion following what it thought was a centrebody per cent killshot which you seem nevertheless to have survived is ms cossont well well enough you know i think i am going to my name is berdle colonel agansu interesting to make your acquaintance likewise berdle i did ask earlier to what we might owe such destructive attention if you recall indeed you did agansu sent well then berdle the answer would be to ms cossont and possibly the device which the facilitys records show she recovered a few minutes ago as i said earlier i would like to talk to ms cossont face to face human to human also i think it might be germane if i were to be allowed to inspect the device she retrieved i strongly suspect you will have to accede to my requests in time berdle we do rather have you at a disadvantage wouldnt you say there was a pause and then the colonel sent i certainly would berdle looked at cossont glanced at the ceiling and said quietly the person in full battle gear who im assuming is colonel agansu is now almost overhead possibly ready to make ingress here either down the shaft behind you or straight through the floor the tour party near the combat arbites position is still not quite clear of the likely destruction volume were i to let the two knife missiles off the leash excuse me i must let colonel agansu talk at me some more you might benefit from being a little more cautious colonel berdle sent we are less at a loss than you appear to imagine are you really the colonel sounded amused we are we are currently mustering and preparing our forces colonel you have my word im sure i do agansu said with mock seriousness and that it is worth everything in the current situation i feel certain nevertheless the fact remains that you do not benefit from the presence of a friendly ship nearby whereas i do as well as as you may have noticed a very capable combat arbite yes i trust the combat arbite is not in any way precious to you colonel berdle heard the colonel laugh ah dear how fine the line is between acceptably defiant bravado and hopelessly delusional boasting you were doing so terribly well up until that point i am sorry to be such a disappointment to you colonel agansu berdle glanced at cossont again the tour party near the combat arbites position is now clear of the likely destruction volume and the knife missiles are cleared to fire the avatar told her due to the nature of the munitions being used the corridor is about to become extremely bright we are trying to keep damage to a minimum but ah here we go the air in the corridor seemed to fill and streak with fanned white light intensely bright it almost looked like the smokehazed air was being lit by lasers but something about the quality of the light itself and the way the smoke in the corridor was tugged after whatever it was that was making its way down the corridor argued against this cossont had never paid all the attention she might have in weaponry identification or whatever theyd called it back in military academy it really was astoundingly bright it was as though part of the surface of a bluewhite sun had suddenly appeared in the corridor searing bleaching everything the light cut off what had seemed like a brightly lit space in front of them suddenly looked dull an instant later a series of colossal still greater outbursts of light just barely distinguishable as being made up of hundreds of small searingly bright flares rather than being a single massive eruption made a white sun of the end of the corridor to their right in the instant between the light and the trailing sound of the fusillade what probably was laser light came flicking through the hazed air filling the patch of corridor cossont could see with sparkling bars of cerise light explosions shook and battered her from both sides she put her head down wondering if shed have had any hearing left without the suit something touched her on one ear and berdle said we have only one knife missile remaining to our left now the person above us is either waiting or hesitating i have instructed the remaining knife missile to mount a frontal attack it will fly past us at just under ceiling height in approximately six seconds and fire over us and through the liftshaft doorway the munitions being used though tiny are both powered by and payloaded with antimatter so some radiation exposure at such close quarters is inescapable immediately after the missile has passed you must stand and grasp me as you did before from behind arms round my body preferably legs wrapped round mine over my shins too keep the bag with the mindstate device in it at your side not over your back do you understand she nodded more bars of pink light filled the air in front of the alcove creating a screaming tearing noise as the laser light impacted the swirling smoke and dust particles her mouth had gone very dry there was a further furious burst of cerise light and then the impression of almost invisibly quick motion high up as though the corridor ceiling itself was rippling then the esuit just turned the lights off everything went completely dark while sound and blastfronts seemed to detonate everywhere pummelling her body from every side up berdle shouted through her earbud the suit helped her stand she gripped the avatar from behind with three arms brought her legs round his at the knee made sure the shoulder bag was at her hip with her remaining hand and then put that round the avatars body too she could see again the corridor was full of light both white and pink then something seemed to erupt from berdles chest and they were both flung away from the corridor and through the shallow alcove and into the lift shaft cossont experienced what felt like the start of her head getting ripped off then somebody slammed a sledgehammer the size of a ship into her back and she blacked out awake again soreheaded sorebacked aching all over she seemed to be still on berdles back looking over his shoulder through a ragged dusty gap across the elevator shaft to the doorway on the far side through the smoke and dust there a thing lumbered like a bad dream of a man massive reversekneed arms thick with weapon clusters saucerheaded it stood straightening a little seemingly looking straight at them if the little knife missiles frontal attack had caused it any damage it wasnt visible cossont didnt recognise the model frankly it looked retro something rotated on its chest then silently because her hearing didnt seem to be working properly another explosion seemed to go off just above the part of the shaft she could see and debris rained down falling past and showering into the depths a man in a bulky glittering suit and holding a large gun also seemingly made of mirror stuff came floating down as though sitting in an invisible chair he looked very relaxed cossont looked around she and berdle seemed to have been blown through a wall and into a storage area everywhere she looked in the dusty gloom she saw towering stacks of shelves full of pale boxes similar to the one that had held the glittering grey cube with qirias mindstate inside they had ended up crumpled together in the remains of a set of shelves half lying half held standing by the twisted debris around them a couple of the pale halfmetre cube boxes came tumbling from somewhere overhead bouncing and clattering down to join the jumble of debris already covering the floor the combat arbite illuminated each of the falling boxes in turn with a thin beam of laser light from its weapon clusters but let each fall and bounce without firing at them cossont looked idly groggily down at her hip the shoulder bag wasnt there it must have been ripped away shit she thought the man in the glittering suit was floating stationary in the middle of the elevator shaft looking in at them he tipped his head to one side as though wondering what to make of them the combat arbite shuffled to one side to keep a clear field of fire we really are fucked arent we cossont said her voice sounding odd inside her head and the helmet she could taste what was probably her own blood in her mouth not necessarily berdle replied through the earbud sounding as ever relatively unconcerned still one knife missile left but i thought it it left it was not destroyed berdle told her it went the long way round the building i suspect they assumed any combat missiles we had left would just burst through anything in their way certainly that would be the first thing to occur to a knife missile so although this has taken longer nevertheless the element of surprise is with the missile here we are thatll be it now the avatar announced as light erupted all around the combat arbite the man in the glittering suit started to whirl round to where the combat arbite was throwing its arms up and disappearing and disintegrating inside a consuming torrent of white fire then the view went dark more battering and pummelling it was like being slung into a big metal drum with a bunch of sharp rocks and being kicked down a steep mountainside studded with boulders the knife missiles in use here are from the miniaturised drone advanced weapon system berdle told her as floor the shelves and the air itself all seemed to shake and quiver and beat though it bears mention that it was advanced rather a long time ago still and am power is very crude really raw ragged stuff not really suitable for this kind of civilianenvironment instructure work far too battlefield but it was all i had interestingly the nanomissiles doing the damage are only a millimetre long and a tenth of that in diameter too small to see for most unaided eyes astonishing what you can do with antimatter there oh here just as the battering seemed to be tailing off there was another single thudding titanic impact then berdle said ouch bet that hurt oh well down you go the view came back the elevator shaft and the lit corridor beyond were full of dust and smoke the doorway where the combat arbite had been standing was no longer a neat rectangle it was practically circular and most of the shattered ragged edges were glowing one or two shattered bits of machinery lying smoking flaming or sputtering on the floor of the corridor might have been parts of the arbite of the man in the glittering suit there was no sign something flashed briefly in the shaft yes i wouldnt go sticking your head into the lift shaft berdle said over a distant cacophony of alarm noises and some deep booming noises coming from the shaft colonel agansu is down there largely disabled but patently still capable of firing berdle stepped out of the compacted debris of the shelves theyd smashed into taking cossont with him he peeled her arms away then turned to face her as she stood swaying slightly she suspected the suit was doing most of the work involved in keeping her upright she focused on the avatar the whole front of his chest was a shallow silver bowl it swam back into shape only slowly hmm the avatar said looking down at this as another bright flash lit up the elevator shaft behind him powerful laser your man had he stooped came back up holding the shoulder bag with the cube in it here he tied a knot in the burst strap almost too quickly for her to see you okay he asked cossont cleared her throat nodded fucking peachy berdle looked innocently pleased good well there dont appear to be any other forces wishing to engage with us so we may be through the worst of it there was another flash of light in the shaft behind shouldnt you be finishing off this colonel guy cossont asked berdle shook his head no need i have a scout missile down there with him monitoring he shouldnt cause us any more trouble what about parinherm ive tried contacting hes powered down well try and displace him too when the ship gets back walk this way cossont following the avatar stepped shakily into a debrisstrewn corridor between towering shelves it seemed to stretch for ever into the distance something zipped past her from behind coming through the smoke at head height and making her flinch the thing stopped right alongside berdle it was a thin cylinder about as thick as a thumb and as long as a hand its front end shaped like an angular blunted arrowhead and its dull silver surface marked with hairfine dark lines and tiny dots berdle cocked one silvery eyebrow at it and said yes well done so that ms cossont might be included in the conversation oh both our lives inelegant use of rather too many nanos though well so you say but it could have been accomplished more economically even so had there been a whole section of those things could you successfully have taken on all of them too well there you are then the missile moved off so fast it was as though it was a shell in a perfectly transparent gun barrel it just disappeared leaving behind only an afterimage and the vaguest of impressions it had headed away in the direction its sharp end had been pointing berdles head jerked back in the blast of air and cossont was only saved from being blown off her feet by the avatar reaching back with one silvery hand and grabbing her by the bags strap again the thunderclap echoed off the surrounding shelves and the ceiling berdle shook his head as he resumed walking knife missiles he said over his shoulder with what sounded like affection yeah knife missiles cossont agreed like she knew what she was talking about she glanced back but could see little through the smoke you sure theres nobody else coming after us not completely no berdle admitted but there doesnt seem to be he sounded thoughtful the gzilt ship present here is at least a sixthlevel heavy cruiser possibly a seventhlevel battlecruiser thatd mean between one and three platoons of marines available at least but they arent being used so that might say something about the secrecy and well authorisation of the mission involved he shrugged anyway onwards i should warn you there will be some tramping and we may have to hide the ship was led a merry dance trying to get sufficiently close to the microrbital for long enough to get its avatar and the human off quickly getting the measure of each other and each correctly guessing that its opposite number had no intention of being the first to open fire neither ship resorted to serious targeting behaviour or the sort of hairtrigger weaponreadiness status that might have led to a misunderstanding the whole tussle was conducted without signalling as though neither vessel wanted to admit it was actually happening eventually the mistake not outwittedoutfieldmanaged the gzilt ship and snapped the two humanoid figures off the habitat and back inside itself it saw the gzilt ship displacedisloc one humansize entity off the little world a moment later having successfully retrieved its two primary displace targets the mistake not tried to get a lock on the remains of the android eglyle parinherm but found it had been beaten to it a disloc field from the gzilt ship was already starting to envelop the creatures crushed and broken body at the bottom of the elevator shaft before the gzilt vessel could complete the operation the mistake not applied a spatter of plasma fire to various parts of the androids body cauterising all processing and memorydata storage nodes within the machine xue mistake not ogsv contents may differ right what oh the stuff from the you call this clean okay the memories were in his eyes and theyve been removed how severe with himself just as well we successfully retrieved mr qs mindstate then at no small risk to life and limb i might add congratulations with what result just about to find out cossont felt sleepy sore elated all at once her painmanagement systems were telling her to move gently slowly with no sudden movements she would be bathing rather than showering she had already decided but first the ship had insisted they needed to talk to the stored mindstate inside the silvery grey cube the mistake not was powering away from the ospin system on a wildly erratic course having decided after its jinking ducking and diving fieldtofield tussle with the gzilt ship that it was the faster so far at least the gzilt vessel had shown no sign of following cossont sat down in the lounge area of the shuttle that had become her home over the last few days clad only in the esuit with its hands and feet components retracted to cuffs again and the helmet collapsed back into its necklace form pyan had gone ooh and ah over her and wrapped itself round her neck rubbing gently at her bruised skin berdle back to looking like a handsome gzilt male again entirely gave the impression hed just strolled out of a grooming parlour not a hint of tiredness or a hair out of place you have been in the wars you poor thing pyan told cossont wrapping itself tighter yes no need to throttle me apologies there and where is that silly android we had to leave him behind cossont said glancing at berdle as she extracted the silvergrey cube from the battered shoulder bag under a wrecked elevator car at the bottom of a lift shaft the gzilt ship dislocd him aboard itself berdle said it took colonel agansu too were they both still alive cossont asked i think agansu was the avatar said not parinherm no berdle shook his head held cossonts gaze until she looked away she put the silvery cube on the low table in front of her then reached out touched it on ngaroe she asked ms cossont qirias voice said immediately cossont realised she had been tense hunched over the table she relaxed a little good to speak to you again she said smiling how long has it been oh quite a few years i see and are we on a culture ship cossont wasnt sure what to say she glanced at berdle who shrugged unhelpfully yes she said umm i didnt realise you could im not completely without senses in here qirias voice said i may only be switched on for fractions of an hour at a time but i can tell roughly what my circumstances are how much time has elapsed since i was last activated and i have sufficient appreciation of the radiative and general sensory ambience of my surroundings to tell when i am for example on a ship we were on a ship the last time we spoke cossont said i know so what hardly remarkable but this is a culture ship a gcu or a warship or something similar that is remarkable so i remarked upon it that it we done you going to shut me off for another sixteen years no no cossont said quickly sorry very sorry but look we need to ask you something whos we hello mr qiria berdle said pleasantly my name is berdle im the avatar of the ship youre on the mistake not pleased to meet you yes delighted you sound stressed by the way cossont do i well its been yes thats why i said it the voice said with only a touch of acid berdle id like to interface may i see through your eyes or some other visual sensor immediately hereabouts be my guest berdle said and looked first at cossont then in a steady sweep round the rest of the lounge cossont you have four arms qirias voice said to play the elevenstring she said ah you werent put off playing it by the warm considering after all good for you so what is it you want to know she took a deep breath ngaroe we need to ask you something about long ago going right back it is its very important it might affect how the subliming goes our subliming the gzilt subliming she took another deep breath there was a message a signal from the zihdren saying that the book of truth might all be a lie and you were mentioned as wait wait wait qirias voice said cossont fell silent how far back are you asking me to remember things from the time of the conference that set up the culture sir berdle said ah qirias voice said that far back cant help you what cossont said she and the avatar exchanged looks i said the voice from the cube told them slowly that i cannot help you my memories only go back to about seventy years standard after that time the memories in here begin at midnight on the th of pereid koweyn calendar before that ive nothing seriously cossont said she could hear her own voice start to rise in tone and volume youre missing must ask you to check sir berdle said in a pained voice check for yourself youre a ship youll have the ability im giving you permission im not a biological not in here so take a look for yourself scan all the data in this cube go on feel free youre sure the avatar said he looked at cossont who found it was her turn to shrug yes qirias voice said sharply berdle sighed he smiled at cossont this might take a moment the avatar told her she sat back slumped in the seat rubbed her face with two of her hands she sighed heavily take all the ah berdle said sounding resigned he looked at cossont im afraid its just as mr qirias mindstate has claimed told you the voice from the cube said the memories arent there cossont felt suddenly tired full of aches and depressed im afraid not berdle told her and even the memories of the times when mr qiria thought back to those times before the source memories were edited out have been expunged too berdle looked at the cube thats quite a thorough job mr qiria sounds like it the voice agreed berdle smiled faintly shook his head as he said would you have any idea why you no none at all guess i must have thought i had something to hide if so glad ive done a good job of it or made sure somebody else did cossont was sitting looking deflated eyes closed shaking her head gently they cant just have gone she said as though to herself they cant just have gone she looked at berdle what now can we look for the real qiria for the old guy himself he might he should still know she shook her head again shouldnt he weve already tried that the avatar told her they found him but hed had the memories encoded sitespecific in his body and then had those sites removed what cossont said frowning mr qiria looks like this now berdle said and a screen appeared in midair of a man in a dark room wearing a pair of dark slatted glasses the person who tracked him down berdle said their suit took this the screen image moved and the man took off the glasses revealing that it was qiria but also that where his eyes should have been there were the inner parts of ears the clip looped and the screen split to show different versions of the same sequence in infrared slow motion with the eye sockets zoomed in on and combinations thereof cossont just stared how gross pyan said what are you looking at qirias voice asked cossont reached out and turned the cube off then slumped back in her seat eyes closed again she had a feeling she might be about to cry do you remember this berdle said softly and when cossont opened her eyes again the screen was showing a view that looked familiar though at first she couldnt quite place it it was of a man looking slightly lost in what might have been a transit lounge then he left following a modest amount of luggage on a floattrolley of course qiria arriving on xown five years ago then a similar set of images which seemed to show him in the same place dressed similarly but wearing big dark glasses if anything he looked even less sure about where he was going this time the images faded away and the screen went dark and this the screen shone out again to show ximenyr the man with the many penises on the airship equatorial in the girdlecity it was almost exactly the view she recalled having at the time though then the view flicked round and showed cossonts own face before flicking back to the man in the bed again so this had been berdles point of view this was the sight through his eyes recorded mr berdle ms cossont ximenyr said in his deep thick voice pleased to meet you he opened his mouth and a long tongue snaked out and delicately licked at first one eyebrow then the other shaping them both neatly into place the tongue disappeared again he opened his eyes wide he had bright pale blue irises his eyeballs went back into their sockets the blue irises disappearing they were replaced from below by dark red irises which rolled into place and steadied excuse me he said these pupils work better in daylight he smiled widely showing very white teeth cossont was nodding now mr ximenyr the bodyamendment specialist she said this would be why qiria had looked like he had the second time in the transit lounge wearing big dark glasses seemingly perversely less sure of his surroundings than before hed been blind the screen view now was doing something she hadnt done at the time zooming in to a closeup of ximenyrs face the teeth and the eyes at first then down to the necklace of trinkets adorning his neck the view came to rest and freeze on the tiny at the time deactivated scout missile that the ship had sent into the mans bedchamber it was resting on ximenyrs chest between what looked like an androids thumb and a thick crystal cylinder striped with encrusted jewels the frozen image jerked to one side zoomed in further on the cylinder showing a hazy view of what looked like semitransparent crystal with what might have been a pair of berries inside they were pale green and looked like they were floating in some sort of offwhite surround what colour were mr qirias eyes berdle asked cossont still had to think just to be sure then she remembered when he was there they were the colour of the ocean on perytch iv she said the ocean could be lots of colours she told the avatar but mostly in daylight it was the colour of beach jade pale green she nodded at the extreme closeup of the jewelencrusted cylinder with its imperfectly transparent little windows and the two softlooking things inside that might have been berries that colour eighteen s she should never have trusted herself she ought to have known what she was like well she did know what she was like but she should have paid more attention or taken the issue more seriously or something scoaliera tefwe still within the virtual environment of a substrate housed within the lsv you call this clean looked at the two holo images of herself facing her and scowled so neither of you certainly not me certainly not me they didnt say it at quite the same time but then the ships they were housed within were at quite different distances the original scoaliera tefwe who thought of herself as the real one but then both the others would as well sighed in exasperation and flicked the images off huh she said i have their experiences all the sensory data they collected the you call this clean told her they cant stop you reviewing those that tefwe said will have to do theres a surprise at the end the ship told her shall i warn you what and spoil the fun why no so she watched herself take the aphore from the stables at chyantya by the snake river with its smells of bellblossom and strandle flower evencluss and jodenberry then head out across the pouch to the hills she saw the pair of raptors wheel across the blaze of blue sky could taste the heat in her mouth at the days peak and lay panting with the mount in the shade of the desiccant umbrel she went up into and then through the mountains she skipped her other selfs memory of sleep it saved time but also it felt like an intrusion too far even though this person was still and really herself she met with the drone hassipura surveyed its intriguing but somehow pathetic little empire of tunnels channels and pools of scalddry sands she heard where she yet another sequential version of her might find qiria and left she watched herself there was always that distance at first like watching a play or a film before you lost yourself in it as she stood up within the tall sways of bronze and coppercoloured grasses then walked to the deserted station and waited for the rattling traintram thing she could smell the air and sense the locals the folds trying not to stare at her she was carried on up into the mountains into the vast echoing kingdom of the sound and waited to be allowed in to the hearkenry then followed the docent luzuge and was finally granted her audience with the elusive mr qiria the eyes the sockets that now housed ears came as a shock that certainly counted as a surprise she her other self didnt get long to gawk at the mans mutilated face there was some commotion outside audible over or at least through the crushing weight of the sound the door at the rear of the cell was thrown splintering open and some sort of shining multilimbed drone all angles and barbs came tearing in and halted by qirias seat it drew itself up as though to strike qiria had jumped when the door had been thrown open and was turning towards the machine which screeched arrest surrender self in a metallic scream pitched so high it cut right through the sound tefwes suit had gone to full deployment the instant the door had started moving covering her head in a closefitting semitransparent helmet she jumped up and threw open the shutters letting the sound roll in there was a white flash and she felt something hit her hard in the back though without causing pain she threw herself through the matting curtains and out of the window landing on the cold slope of scree outside and hurtling in a zigzag down towards the nearest cover a dark mass of metrehigh boulders ship she yelled you getting all this get me off here suit lower dorsal area seventy per cent compromised the suit told her solemnly she could feel heat bleeding through where the blow from behind had hit making her back warm shit she said as she dived for a gap between two of the boulders she never got there a second much more powerful shot from above from a weapon platform she hadnt even known was there hit her between the shoulders and blew her neck and head off most of her landed in a bloody fiery smoking heap just before the collection of boulders her head flew further and thudded off the top of one of the boulders bouncing to the ground just beyond then the view from the scout missile or whatever had been accompanying her flashed once and disappeared too the rapid random response unit suddenly subject to the aggressive attentions of a small flotilla of oglari vessels executed a very risky manoeuvre succeeded in snapping tefwes stilljustaboutalive head back to itself and then flared wildly off at its highest possible enginefieldaddling acceleration the whole incident caused some highly vocal distress and outrage for the oglari allegedly entirely on behalf of their valued allies and grateful charges the uwanui apologies for the misunderstanding were dutifully expressed by the rapid random response unit its home gsv and other respected culture worthies but further favours and indulgences were now owed or at least expected by both the oglari and the uwanui apparently neither contact nor special circumstances was particularly impressed with these developments these things accrue tefwe muttered to herself all onboarded the you call this clean asked i experienced everything the other two experienced so i suppose so she said but i got killed for fucks sake that was the surprise thanks think ill go back to storage now full asleep no dreams certainly and next time you want to wake me up but the ship had already started putting her under it strongly suspected that there had been only one more word to come in that sentence of tefwes and that it would have been the word dont yes but plausibly deniable the ship decided of course were close weve always been close were mother and daughter you might not understand youre a man men rarely do its a different thing you really have to be a mother to understand frankly even some daughters dont understand to tell the prophets truth not that im saying vyr doesnt that would be going too far but she is independent very independent but im not complaining im not the complaining sort not at all thats how i raised her you see thats what i wanted for her i always meant her to be her own person not tied to my purse strings and she hasnt wanted to become a mother herself what with the subliming obviously or really had time for that matter very busy shes always been very busy and not always with things that she can tell me about either if im telling the truth and you know what i mean you know well im sure you do in your type of work im not saying she was some sort of secret agent or anything but you could tell well i could tell being her mother as i say and i do have a gift for these things even if i say so myself though its not just me not really its all my friends im very modest theyre the ones wholl tell you i have a gift almost a sight for these things but there were things she obviously couldnt tell me things that were secret that it was best for me not to know i suppose im not surprised im really not shes very bright very capable girl very able to take care of herself and trustworthy and loyal loyal too very loyal she takes after me in that way its part of the bond we share its just that according to the logs of the ship here she doesnt seem to visit very oft the first young man started to say before his companion held up one hand to stop him shed already forgotten their names but the one whod just been talking was the nicer of the two because he smiled more and looked at her properly and just had a nicer manner the other one was even younger barely more than a boy and harderlooking somehow and didnt even seem to have noticed let alone appreciated the very flattering and daringly clingy lounge dress shed worn especially interregimental intelligence on trimestal secondment how grand did that sound and they were interested in her little girl in a good way obviously they had been very polite and deferential ever since theyd called the apartment from their aircraft on their way to see her and even the small hardfaced one who was probably only interested in boys anyway had been scrupulously courteous and mannerly from the instant he and the nice jolly fullerfaced one had crossed the threshold of the apartment apparently though they couldnt confirm or deny anything naturally vyr was still alive and not just alive but involved the implication seemed to be in something important her little girl well it was no surprise really shed always known at the back of her mind despite all the silly niggling things that the girl had done and said over the years that vyr would live up to the promise shed shown when she was younger and make her mother proud of her it had only been a matter of time in fact all the times she hadnt bothered to visit or get in touch and had seemed indifferent or intolerant or just seemingly wanting to be hurtful on the rare occasions when she did deign to show up suddenly made complete sense now shed just been trying to protect her mother she should have known thats what it had been of course shed loved and respected her old mum how could she not she just hadnt been able to bring her into her secret life in case it jeopardised her safety logical loving and sensible at the same time well frankly about time warib could feel herself getting quite excited with all these thoughts her breath was coming rather quickly and she wouldnt be at all surprised if she looked flushed and even more youthful to these two very welldressed and immaculately groomed young men the younger harderfaced one was saying something she really ought to concentrate her attention had drifted there not like her at all her being involved in something secret he said eyes narrowed but a small smile finally on his lean face did i understand that right did you well i cant say too much obviously warib said oh thank you dear she accepted a health drink infusion from garron garron had been a little brusque with the two young men initially they were both probably even younger than he was but that was all right hed even offered everybody drinks which was a lot better than his usual whatamijustastewardtoyou attitude but shed always been so outstanding it would only be sensible for the regiment to put her talents to good use i mean she would never actually tell me anything but warib winked at the two young men a mother can tell i think especially when youre very close almost embarrassingly close in age to your daughter oh dear i think you can tell when theres something going on shes not telling you about i cant say any more i dont know any more in the conventional sense of knowing but trust me i know the young hardfaced one nodded thats very interesting warib smiled relaxed she was much less worried about vyr now xgsv contents may differ olou caconym ogcu displacement activity ogsv

sufficient in themselves we could of course just send a message to mr ximenyr asking him to sell trade or just out of the goodness of his hearts gift us the objects concerned and put them aside until im able to get there to pick them up however i imagine we might all feel that could serve to alert him and possibly others to their mooted importance or we might ask some remaining element of the fourteenth regiment its innocenceonsidedness presumably taken as read following the attack on its hq to help us but that takes control away from those we entirely and implicitly trust and might be seen to confer potentially too much power on a gzilt person group of people or entity regarding the release or not of the information mr qirias ocular outboard data storage devices may or may not

inferred alien cachet value positive honorary had by general acclaim within the fleet and squadron now become so great that it might actually be embarrassing for it to be informed of the level to which it had ascended so rapidly it was probably and arguably already over the limit that even as august a being as ossebri haldesib holding a position as elevated as swarmprince and subswarm divisional head and fleet officer in charge could be properly expected to conferbyinforming it was decided therefore to allow the culture ship to continue to accrue inferred alien cachet value positive honorary for the meantime while still not disturbing the metaphorical airflowthroughthehive by informing the vessel of this distinction regardless gzilt and zyse now lay ahead and close hello again sorry for being so abrupt thats all right i take it were still aboard the same culture ship the mistake not yes we are so what were you looking at that disturbed you so the voice from the silvergrey cube asked or are you going to turn me off again we were looking at what youd done to yourself really what come on tell me the version of me in here and version of me that did whatever i did to myself are less than twenty years apart when youve lived as long as i have thats nothing i wont have changed much in between effectively im the same person tell me youd put your earliest memories into your eyes then had those removed she said you went to ximenyr in the girdlecity to have it done you had extra ears put where your eyes should have been well thats certainly taking my predilection for the audible over the visible to an extreme the voice sounded genuinely amused it just seemed drastic shocking cossont said it looked like like selfmutilation its my body to mutilate as i see fit cossont and from somebody currently possessing four arms thats an odd criticism cossont opened her mouth but then the voice went on this wouldnt have been on a place called cethyd would it in the mountains of the sound yes ha makes sense heard about that place quarter of a millennium or more ago been meaning to go ever since good for me for taking it seriously enough to dedicate more than the standard proportion of sensory equipment to the task i admire myself cossont lying on her bed with the cube sitting on the pillow next to her raised her eyebrows at that but let it pass an old friend of yours called tefwe went there she said to try and persuade you to talk about what had happened back when the culture was coming together and the gzilt nearly joined but didnt huh so much for swearing old lovers to secrecy and respect for ones privacy but what the hell were you thinking taking out your own eyes leaving them with ximenyr did i i bet it seemed like a good idea at the time also less obvious than leaving the data with all the other informational detritus orbiting ospin for example what were you what are you trying to hide though who knows maybe im better without the memories so were heading for xown yes cossont said quietly to the cube were going to see ximenyr in the girdlecity to try and get your eyes your memories back interesting that i didnt want the memories destroyed just parked whatever they may be whatever they may be of course just because the eyes are there doesnt mean the memories are too i could have had those wiped its gone very quiet out there hello that would be a joke too far ngaroe all the same i wouldnt put it past me this i love this when you are over me when i can barely see you or touch you but i know that you are there and just a breath away and i feel each exhaling is like a warm breeze across the land when i can hear each beat of your heart over mine when you are close enough that i can feel the heat of you on my skin then you are my presence over and above me like a promise i live for these moments i die at the thought they might stop in the sublime you say the sweetest things to me i wish i could say such things to you so beautifully you draw them from me you are their muse their true creator we make them between us i am a hopeless stumbler and stutterer always have been with anybody else so you must take half the credit at least if you say i must i must but i feel embarrassed that you say that you give so much and i cant give you the same words are just one language virisse just one way of expression you speak with your eyes you speak with your sweet tongue and gentle fingers with your whole body like this and this what no i just no here come here hold me hold me like this here ill be my presence hang over me embrace me i need you do anything for you i give myself i need to give myself oh you dont hate me for being so needed do you i am i know i am my own needing it betrays me oh my darling i love that you need me as much as i desperately need you but dont distress what is it what can you dont think theyre lying to us the sublimed the presence you dont think theyre lying to us deceiving us do you what is that not for a moment oh be calm virisse of course not do you think i would risk losing you if i thought for a moment there was any danger they lied to us that what were offered isnt true that we might simply die or be blown away like mist id never even think of this for myself for you for us for all the people isnt it like a threat though this thing hanging over us i look at it some days hanging over the city over us and it makes me shiver it used to make me catch my breath sometimes ill give you that what can i say virisse promises take many shapes and the more momentous they are the more they might look like threats all great promises are threats i suppose to the way things have been until that point to some aspect of our lives and we all suddenly become conservative even though we want and need what the promise holds and look forward to the promised change at the same time so we have that great grey shape hanging over us over the parliament itself as a reminder that this is where the final decision was taken this is where we made up our minds and it reminds us that there are powers and forces beyond us that we are in the process of surrendering our full authority in this and of taking a great new leap is it too late what im sorry my love i didnt is it too late can we still unmake our minds well no it isnt we can all change our minds right up until the last moment must there always be forces beyond us oh my love there always have been the sublimed have been there for ten billion years the elders too we are just one species not here for the longest time then here for a while then gone again just like everybody else but weve always known there is something worthwhile in just being ourselves in being us as well as we can weve found been given a way to symbolise this in the book of truth but the real truth is that every species feels the same thing and every one is right we all think were special and in a way we are but at the same time that feeling of being special is one of the things thats common to us all that unites us and makes us the same as each other and when that feeling of specialness is questioned we feel threatened naturally we all do i do we have the subliming drawing near and we seem to be collecting alien warships with culture ships already arrived two more this evening the empiricist tomorrow and the liseiden and the ronte arriving in days both seeming to think the other is the interloper while we feel they both are the eyes of the galaxy are on us and this ought to be a time of quietness and reflection and measured preparation a time of looking back with gentle pride on all weve achieved and yet we have a regiment hq attacked and thousands killed and an undignified scramble going on over our heads over our spoils and all sorts of absurd rumours and stories swirling about but we i just worry i worry that weve swept ourselves along somehow got all too excited over something we havent thought through that that people have persuaded us to do something were still not ready for well septame banstegeyn is a very persuasive man ill give you that i didnt just mean no you did and i know what you mean but you have to see that we become symbols for ourselves one person can seem to be the instigator the power behind some great powerful current within a society but theyre not necessarily producing it they may be at the front and they may have some small immediate influence over its direction hour by hour or day by day but really they are swept along by it too by the force of all those people behind them by the idea they all represent and are all borne along by but virisse what talk is this for the bed we have so few of these opportunities my love lets not waste this one in worry lets sweep each other away like this and this and this yes yes youre right ill be your spoils fight over ow what what i dont know my finger a jab like a thorn my love there of all places why what have you been doing what dont laugh no what let me see here my finger see poor finger let me see let me see ah so pleasantly engaged so sharply interrupted let me oh worth one tiny injury for such a sweet kiss you make me swoon oh wait a moment you really are i really am swoon my my head is quite quite no its all right im just its just oh im glad im lying dow no sef no say oh oh of course me too i should should have he how could oh the fool going dark what you too my love have we is this some are we being are we be doesnt know oh the cruel the stupid not not feeling so good wheres my it was here i need to call oh fuck im really im so sorry im so so sorry please never it doesnt just hold im sorry im so just hold so sorry just so nineteen s wasnt anything found mere traces septame some form of highly sophisticated very hitech device already starting to dissolve into her flesh and blood the moment after it had delivered its payloads payloads physician general locuil nodded the first almost certainly into the president the second into ms orpe possibly a few seconds apart perhaps almost at the same time there is so little left of the device so little not turned into its constituent molecules at any rate its hard to tell but the likelihood is it was something tuned to sefs own genes something that would only activate at her touch then once it had delivered the toxin into her it would deliver its second payload into the carrier into orpe locuil held up his hands in a gesture of helplessness to stop her talking we have to assume we also have to assume that she knew the device was in there but didnt know it would kill the president she might have thought it was going to drug her or given where it was she might have thought it would you know enhance things for her for both of them we cant know the physician general sighed sat back he massaged his face with one hand he sat across the septames desk from banstegeyn marshal chekwri sat nearby no others were present in the septames private study in his town house though both the marshal and the physician general had staff waiting in an anteroom along with banstegeyns own people including jevan and solbli outside it was almost dawn the two bodies had been discovered by the presidents own security team when her comm bracelet taken off lying by the bedside had finally registered that the local sets of vital signs had altered anomalously both women had been beyond saving for many minutes before they were discovered the fastacting targeted synthetic neurotoxins still multiplying within what was left of their brains and nervous systems even as they gradually dissolved a medical team of the best people and most exclusive machines had been working all night trying to work out what had happened but the thing this how would it know to when to to activate banstegeyn asked aiming to sound bewildered without seeming too naively stupid it would be monitoring everything it came into contact with locuil said wearily as soon as it sensed any genetic material belonging to the target the president itd arm check that there was an actual bit of body there to accept the microbarb then spring out deliver in a way its quite old tech septame but it would have to have a sample of of the it would need a sample or rather the results of a sample of sefoys genetic material but you could get that almost anywhere septame from a glass from one of the presidents hairs from any article of her clothing you could get that from just having shaken her hand or having brushed her cheek with your own everyone shes ever met throughout her life would be a firstorder suspect chekwri told banstegeyn crisply she turned to locuil i assume youre already cooperating with the cops locuil nodded second call her security people made truth is though chekwri said this looks like one of ours you mean the device that was used banstegeyn said chekwri nodded we had stuff like this once long ago she flexed her eyebrows back in what you might call the interesting old days it was all supposed to have been got rid of but maybe some of it wasnt maybe somebody kept some of it somewhere or kept the knowledge and the means to make it banstegeyn looked steadily into chekwris eyes as she said this and the marshal returned his gaze just as levelly or somebody invented a brand new one locuil said the fact remains the president is dead not to mention her adc not to mention in delicate circumstances but what really matters is the president is dead whats to be done about it the protocols are clear banstegeyn said he was aware that he looked dreadful tired unkempt that was good his voice was hollow flat he was keeping it that way the longestserving trime becomes acting president the longest servingseptame becomes an acting trime prophets spit chekwri said almost spluttering intyom as president even for six days she shook her head yes banstegeyn said as though not noticing and so on down the levels while a clone of sefoy geljemyn is grown and elections for a new president are set in train that might look a little pointless with the subliming so close chekwri said a vote of the whole parliament would be required to alter the protocols banstegeyn said dully letting the tiredness into his voice eighty per cent approval required for any changes wed struggle even to form a quorum with the people we could call back from outsystem in time he shook his head wiped his eyes i think we have to stick to the rules act as though there will be an election within forty days even though there wont be one or in case there is locuil said the septame and the marshal both looked at him he shrugged in case this whole situation the attack on the fourteenth the president being assassinated leads enough people to want to postpone the subliming the other two people in the room continued to stare at him well its plausible he said that would be a catastrophe banstegeyn said would it locuil looked unsure just a postponement not a cancellation the septame is concerned that one might turn into the other chekwri said everything has been put in place everything planned everything set up and aimed focused on the one single day of instigation banstegeyn said we cant go back he shook his head we go or we dont but a a postponement i dont think so well youre going to have a lot people wondering who did these things the physician general said the attack on eshri the presidents assassination these are big loose ends people will feel i dont know dissatisfied heading off into the sublime not knowing who had it in for us he looked from banstegeyn to chekwri dont you think perhaps subliming will look like a blessed relief from such worries the septame suggested neither the marshal nor the physician general looked like they were buying this well locuil said rolling up his screen and putting it back into his jacket pocket the first leak was over an hour ago the news channels are spasming or frothing or whatever it is they do i have a press conference to attend he stood septame im assuming youll want to be there too banstegeyn nodded of course locuil can you give us five minutes there are developments regarding eshri and our scavenger friends that the marshal and i have to discuss briefly though literally five minutes the septame glanced at his timeto any longer and feel free to knock on the door do you mind yes all right five minutes banstegeyn the physician general said frowning he left the room a babble of noise from the various staff members in the anteroom swelled then subsided the septame looked at the marshal for a few moments she gazed back then slowly raised her eyebrows im sorry septame were you expecting me to say something just there banstegeyn smiled thinly no good right he clasped his hands on the desk in front of him the physician general is right though i should hope so on medical matters at least come on chekwri you know what i mean on people needing answers we need to give them answers do we what answers what happened at eshri what has just happened here hes right people some people at least wont want to go wont want to sublime with all this going on unsolved so we give them a solution we do he nodded his head to one side they walked across the study to the short corridor that led to the bathroom and a small private sitting room banstegeyn closed the door behind them shutting them in the twometrelong corridor lit by a single light its very simple banstegeyn said the ronte are our fall guys chekwri looked sceptical for the prez too we say she had found out how they had been threatening us that eshri was their first shot an example of how they would deal with us if we didnt let them have their way geljemyn was about to remove preferred scavenger status from them by presidential decree so they killed her we tell them to get out of our space sling as many as we can find of them here into prison or just ship them out too and all our problems are solved the marshal looked distinctly unconvinced theyre still a little underdeveloped for convincing bad guys septame in terms of ships theyre barely out of rockets and you think youre going to convince people they could do this sort of stuff to us thats almost as bad as not knowing at all at least so long as were in the dark we can pretend its somebody bigger and badder than us this just suggests were weak blame it on all the ships that have already sublimed and hint that the ronte must have had some highertech help like the culture the marshals expression was something close to contempt they have helped the ronte havent they theyve given a handful or two of their ships a tiny boost one ship and an act of charity patronising almost hardly a mutual aid pact so no we dont try to implicate them certainly not directly just hint people will come to their own conclusions thats all we need and besides the ronte and the liseiden have backers mentors them perhaps they might be blamed you can do this cant you of course i can do it septame chekwri smiled i have a whole regimental intelligence service thats developed a fine line in rumourmongering and storyplacing over the last few years and the ear of every media player youve courted so assiduously over the decades they will ask the questions weve suggested they will listen and they will repeat what we tell them the issue is whether people believe it i might even have to seem to oppose you a little by speaking up for the fleets given that i am in charge of the combined regimental fleet command after all theyll expect me to support them and ill have to do whatever it takes he told her depend upon it septame the marshal looked at banstegeyns timeto turning her head over to one side to read the upsidedown figures and hands on the piece of jewellery adorning his chest our five minutes are almost up she observed excuse me she turned took a step i did what had to be done he said you believe that dont you he hadnt really meant to say this not to her not to anybody he was surprising himself here that wasnt good chekwri turned looked at him it doesnt matter what i believe septame she told him coolly all that matters is what you tell me to do he shook his head gave a halflaugh do you lose any sleep at all over any of this chekwri the marshal raised her eyebrows i sleep like the drugged every night septame im just a humble military officer obeying orders nobodys ordered me to worry or to lose sleep a bitterness seemed to fill his mouth it had to be done he told her of course septame chekwri shrugged i never liked her anyway pleasant enough but too weak for the position she held too accommodating her eyebrows flexed again still eh she died in the arms of somebody who really loved her they both did thats something in the circumstances its almost kind she nodded to one side i think i can hear the physician general knocking wed best go there was one more thing septame locuil said as they sat in the back of the aircraft hopping them from the diplomatic quarter to the parliament for the press conference chekwri had taken her own flier back to the home system regimental ground hq what banstegeyn asked excuse me the physician general said and reached forward to click a switch the nightdark privacy screen rose silently between them and their respective senior staff members sitting across from them locuil leaned over and very quietly into banstegeyns ear as the flier levelled out said ms orpe was pregnant what banstegeyn said only by about forty days it would not have shown even at the time of the subliming are you entirely sure no question of doubt but would she have she must have known she certainly would have known and she was no primitivist in her elective physiology she had all the standard medically advised augmentations and amendments the pregnancy must have been deliberate septame it must have been willed banstegeyn stared forward at the dark material covering the privacy panel then looked away to the side out of the dull outwardmirrored windows of the aircraft he watched the city sliding past they crossed the river the lowest tier of the parliament gardens rose walled above the troubled surface of the waves the first few buildings and pavilions would appear in a moment what had she been thinking of what did she think shed been doing had she gone completely mad why would she he said then suddenly realising stared at the physician general has it the embryo has it do you know who he was babbling this was not him he pulled himself together has it been analysed the products of conception have been removed locuil said his voice barely more than a whisper privately as it were so that these do not presently form part of the judicial or evidential material held by the security forces and they have not been analysed of course they would need to be for the identity of the it might be best if it was that is if it it might be for the best for all concerned if it was if all that disappeared the physician general sat back nodded ill see what i can do septame he thumbed the privacy screen down again banstegeyn felt his stomach lurch the aircraft began its steep descent xgsv contents may differ olou caconym ogcu displacement activity ogsv empiricist ogsv just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry oue mistake not omsv passing by and thought id drop in omsv pressure drop olsv you call this clean the avatar of the passing by and thought id drop in reports that the president of gzilt sefoy geljemyn is dead and may have been assassinated xlou caconym just looking at the feeds and the official insystem signal streams available it looks pretty damn certain she was assassinated one might have expected that our colleague the passing by and thought id drop in would know and be able to confirm this by its own direct channels rather than still be speculating like some outoftheloop news concern consisting of a couple of dodgy floatcams and a single reporter hopping round their apartment trying to get their pants on and brush their teeth at the same time while staring goggleeyed at the breaking news screens of the big boys xmsv passing by and thought id drop in in a matter of such consequence i thought it best to take a cautious approach and wait until the exact nature of the presidents death had been officially announced by the rightful authorities the caconym is welcome to take over my role here if and when it ever arrives in gzilt that will as i understand it be some considerable time after the subliming has taken place though doubtless regardless of how that goes the caconym will take the opportunity to lecture any gzilt remaining behind on how they got their whole subliming strategy wrong anyway xgsv contents may differ im sure this comes as a shock to all of us and we are bound to react to the news in different ways including blaming ourselves however once that is out of the way and the sooner the better id suggest the question is going to remain what can we do now xlou caconym might i suggest the passing by and thought id drop in takes a rather more robust and less respectful attitude to the gzilt establishment treating the gzilt as slightly eccentric but muchloved relations worthy of being indulged as we might indulge other elements of ourselves might be all very well when they are behaving as we might behave however when they start wasting zr ships major command and control elements of their own military and their head of state such indulgence starts to look at best like blindness born of selfdeception xmsv passing by and thought id drop in i can assure the caconym and the others of the group that in a situation of such import with the subliming so close and yet so threatened and a degree of panic and chaos seeming to infect even the highest echelons of gzilt society the last thing i shall be doing is indulging in any blindness or selfdeception i have already begun a more rigorous and assertive overview of the situation by various different methods and strategies however i might remind those who seek to tell me how to perform my task here that in a set of circumstances of such delicacy and sensitivity being discovered to be behaving in what might be taken by our hosts as an aggressive or even threatening manner might only inflame matters further and make any contribution we may wish and be able to make to the solution of the problem itself problematic this is not some bunch of lotechs still struggling with the concept of fourdimensionality this is an equivtech civilisation as old and as capable pointbypoint if not in overall puissance as our own and entirely able to prevent discover andor deal with the vast majority of any surveillance measures for example i might be able to emplace it is also far from impossible that gzilt is effectively under attack from outside and needs and expects our support not our intrusive suspicions xlou caconym had the passing by and thought id drop in been taking a more intrusive and suspicious approach from the start bugginghackingwhatevering the relevant players we would almost certainly know by now whether they are under attack from outside or not and i bet by the way that theyre not xgsv contents may differ im sure all these points are well made perhaps we ought to wait and see what the response of the gzilt hierarchy itself is to the presidents death before we decide what might be done next our intelligence agencies have further ah determined that these same people the ronte have been directly responsible or through their agents and abettors been indirectly though culpably responsible for both the attack on the ah headquarters of the fourteenth regiment on the fzanjuym moon of eshri izenion izenion system and the tragic despicable murder assassination of president geljemyn also for attacks on two fleet warships one at eshri and another at the planet of ablation excuse me ablate the planet of ablate too was attacked and so accordingly we are resolved to resist the arrival of the ronte fleet with all force and demand their surrender surrender of their agents and representatives here here on ah zyse and elsewhere our security forces are already this day carrying out the ah such ah actions being carried ah out thank you the new president and extremely old politician trime intyom until a small ceremony in the presidents office a few minutes ago fell silent he looked uncertain a small old man with nervous eyes and skin that had had to repair itself under the light of too many different suns the first questions were being shouted out by the media people acting president intyom asked for the first one to be repeated then held up one hand as he consulted with his staff four of whom were standing behind him on the podium and looking just as nervy dear scribes piss trime yegres sighed turning to banstegeyn with his hand partially covering his mouth gets the ablate thing wrong twice and then barely remembers the name of the planet hes fucking standing on worthy successor eh the septame nodded after a moment yegres frowned you all right banstegeyn just shocked yegres he said he looked at the mass of cameras in case any were aimed at him at least in here only handhelds were allowed and you were free from the threat of a floatcam poking a lens up your nose one or two cameras might have been trained on him and yegres he kept his blank shocked almost uncomprehending look going gazed downwards again you shocked yegres sounded surprised whatever next who knows whatever next banstegeyn said yegres sighed this is very early for this sort of thing i didnt even manage breakfast too much to expect assassins to show more tact i suppose my bellys empty as the new presidents head yegres exhaled loudly and the old ones from the rumours of what the poison did to her and that lovely girl her adc orpe wasnt it banstegeyn nodded yegres looked at the septame leaned in towards him and put his hand over his mouth again always thought she might be a bit keen on you you know was that was i septame a voice said from the other side of banstegeyn as the avatar of the passing by and thought id drop in appeared suddenly banstegeyn took a deep breath hed have sworn the silverskinned creature could slide through spaces it shouldnt have been able to insinuating itself through a press of bodies almost as though they werent there still at least now he had an excuse not to answer yegres we are deeply sorry ziborlun continued speaking very quiet and close to his ear to hear of the death of president geljemyn and wish to extend both our sympathies and an offer of help any help at all to the gzilt people i do hope you and i can talk further soon i may have information that i can share only with you thank you septame the creature touched him once on the forearm slipped away again yegres leaned out looking across banstegeyn i assume that was condolences he muttered but it looked more like a betting tip it is not known at this moment in time the acting president was saying precisely and exactly who is responsible beyond a a reasonable belief that the ronte and their ah their agents and their ah abettors are ahm behind whoever that person or persons might be so there we are yes you what banstegeyn sighed how did this moron get to be a trime or a degan or a thirtysecond for that matter yegres cleared his throat you promoted him old son the septame stared at the older man what he whispered yegres shrugged oh every available opportunity maestro gave him a helping hand whenever people wanted to kick him upstairs which was often eventually you kicked him up above yourself made the old duffer a trime yegres looked at him blearily fuck me banners youre not starting to forget which useful dipsticks youve supported over the years because theyll always agree with you are you prophets piss youll be forgetting me next he shook his head glanced at his timeto and muttered wonder if the bars are serving yet this is much more satisfactory team principal tyun told cultural mission director keril jelwilin keril had been invited back aboard the liseiden flagship the collective purposes vessel gellemtyanasoolanafawaya to be congratulated for whatever part he might have played in the recent turnaround in the fortunes of the liseiden keril floated in his transparent bubble within the ships command space a genuine smile anchored on his face he was sure that this expression even if it was firstprinciples meaningless to the liseiden indeed even if it was by some misfortune firstprinciples threatening to the liseiden would be suitably translated by the aquatic creatures ais and its happy import transmitted to the liseiden officers i am very glad sir that your faith in me and my faith in turn in ambassador mierbeunes has turned out not to be misplaced we are your faithful agents and servants team principal and are glad to have been able to fulfil this part of the mission we undertook for you sir is it true the culture are suspected of having helped the ronte i well im not that is ah the acting president said with the glazed look of somebody listening to something being said on their earbud he raised one hand and appeared to be about to press his earbud further into his ear then seemed to change his mind excuse me the acting president turned and consulted his staff he turned to face the front again well he said there are rumours apparently ah there has been help of one ship culture ship helping the fleet that has been approaching gzilt it is just one ship and im sure our own fleets own ships are entirely ah capable sir what about the gsv passing by and thought id drop in and the other culture warships now stationed directly over zyse itself well i cant i dont excuse me he said turning away again the screen cut to a different view going back to the mass of media people again and zooming in on somebody shouting sir could this delay the subliming while the acting president was talking urgently with his advisors somebody else shouted out sir will you be putting yourself forward as a candidate and will there even be an election and yet another person yelled has president geljemyns backup been woken up yet after that more shouting made it difficult to hear individual questions berdle sitting beside an openmouthed cossont looked at her and said well this is interesting cossont not long woken dressed in a loose voluminous robe just stared at the screen the presidents dead she said no berdle told her thats the new one the avatar nodded at the old man on the screen seems to work a bit like having a king there always is one no matter how many you bump off until you have a revolution or something shes dead cossont repeated president geljemyn is no more berdle agreed and we the culture appear to be in the frame somehow that seems a bit unfair i liked president geljemyn pyan said draping itself round cossonts shoulders she had a nice smile who is this old person again new president berdle told it acting president intyom i see no he hasnt got such a nice smile youre right berdle said he hasnt has he no he just hasnt has he its just not there for him i know berdle agreed smiling cossont looked from the screen to berdle what the fuck is going on the avatar shrugged looked serious long story power struggle i suppose though that seems a little pointless if everybodys going to sublime soon anyway though they might not be now berdle looked at cossont and whether they do or not might come down to what happens when we get back to xown and the girdlecity in about three days the avatar assumed a look of some thoughtfulness bit of a responsibility really cossont shook her head looked back at the screen oh fuck rescinded what can be rescinded we had an agreement we have done nothing what have we done tell us what we have done prove anything the individuals of the ronte delegation were being dragged inert out of the adapted house in the diplomatic quarter that had been their home as many media trucks were present as security vehicles the individual rontes in their exosuits had been covered in grapple nets by the security paramilitaries after being effectorstunned in the early morning raid the nets were supposed to disable their exosuits and leave only basic lifesupport working but while the aliens and their suits themselves were just dead weights being hauled out across the garden to the waiting police fliers some sort of floatcam or drone device controlled by the aliens was still functioning hovering over the scene and dodging attempts to shoot it by the security people this is a diplomatic mission on what authority do you a small gzilt security drone succeeded in landing a bore charge on the ronte device which jerked went silent then fell trailing smoke to the ground and thudded into a flowerbed the last exosuited ronte was bumped and dragged into the security flier the ramp closed and the craft took off i am standing here with ambassador mierbeunes of the liseiden a reporter said to a floatcam ambassador mierbeunes are you surprised to find the ronte being treated in this way while your own clients have been declared the new allies of the gzilt well while i entirely understand the many and various pressures which are brought to bear on an alien delegation of this nature has the culture helped the ronte or not yes specifically one of our ships helped a squadron of twelve of their vessels get from where they were to the gzilt system outskirts theyve since turned about twelve ships is this an invasion force hardly mr kresele isnt it no their ships and weapons are quite primitive check the specs freely available and why would the culture be helping anybody invade anybody else let alone help anybody invade the gzilt who have been our friends for millennia and why would anybody invade a people about to sublime in the first place come now at least try to make sense here yes maam ms aouse isnt it yes hi have you helped the ronte in any other way certainly not as far as i know and i would have been told so you could have been helping them to do what destroy the fourteenths hq thats ridiculous that was not them and it certainly wasnt us who do you think was responsible then i dont know but its more likely that one of your own ships gone rogue rather than the ronte or the culture destroyed the fzanjuym and i leave it to you to judge how absurd a proposition that is ziborlun was the culture ship working in league with the ronte acting on orders and if so whose oh so weve gone from helping to working in league with have we i see the ship the beats working a tiny ship with a crew of five humans had no orders it still has no orders it was doing what it and its crew thought was the right thing at all points including when it offered to help the ronte get here faster and at that stage lets not forget the ronte still thought you were their friends and apart from anything else wanted to get here in time to help celebrate the subliming somebody must have issued the orders no they didnt there were no orders you have much work to do mr diria understanding how the culture works yes maam ms zige isnt it has the culture been spying on gzilt if we have obviously not enough because we seem to be as confused as everybody else about what the hell is going on here yes gentleman at the back whos that smartarse cossont asked scowling at the screen from within the heavy robe looks like a ships avatar thats right berdle said ziborlun the avatar of the msv passing by and thought id drop in berdle seemed to hesitate then said ah i dont think youre going to like this what she said the image switched to yet another press conference and a senior policeman flanked by two first regiment intelligence and security officers somebodys face was shown on an insert on the screen cossont knew she knew the person for about half a second before she realised it was her own face we would be very interested in interviewing ms cossont the head cop was saying and yes she is a contributory suspect in the matter of the destruction of the regimental headquarters of the fourteenth regiment on eshri what cossont yelled jumping to her feet pyan had to hang on tight to stay round her shoulders told you you wouldnt like it berdle said oh vyr are you an outlaw pyan said sounding excited but i havent done anything cossont shouted berdle looked at her head tipped my you really are naive arent you the ship dance of triumph that had been the approaching eclipsing of one sun by another was abandoned in midfinal formation on confirmation of the humanoid treachery all ships somersaulted about went to full power and simultaneously began a maximally tight zooming loop twisting as they turned so that at all points throughout the manoeuvre their drives were presented towards their earlier destination the planet zyse in the system of gzilt the drone jonsker apcandrechenat representative of the culture ship beats working was accepted again within the command space of the interstitialexploratory vessel melancholia enshrines all triumph arriving by the quicker though most alarming method of displacement and made a show of prostrating itself before the swarmprince and subcorporation divisional head ossebri haldesib regarded the culture machine for some time before saying device there are those amongst my officers who would have us attack you believing you to have been complicit in a deception upon us they believe that you were both leading and hurrying us into a trap and that as such neither you nor your ship should be suffered to live if the swarmprince so desires i shall absent myself immediately return to my ship and depart along with it the swarmprince should know however that we have engaged in no such deception at any point and have at all times done all we could to cooperate with and to aid the ronte fleet and squadron had we been engaged in any plot to deliver the squadron to a place of jeopardy all those complicit would surely have brought the squadron further into the gzilt system where the threat to it would have been by that measure enhanced before the trap was sprung instead of timing matters such that the squadron has happily had time to deflect from its earlier course and instigate its current redisposition deflect from its earlier course and instigate its current redisposition ossebri haldesib quoted does the culture machine possess any other especially pretty ways of saying run away or escape like a shamed pursued prey swarmprince we attempt to respect your customs and protocols and the ways that you express yourselves if i fail to do so as well as i might i apologise yes we are running away i run with you being determined to stay with the squadron and fleet for as long as you wish me to the instant you wish me gone i shall be you say you respect us yet you ignore my earlier threat to attack you is that not an insult even if disguised by ignorance it is not swarmprince it reflects my belief that i personally would probably be able to frustrate any attempt by you to harm disable or imprison me and that the beats working would similarly be able to escape unharmed should any hostile act be directed at it we could of course be wrong on both counts but we think not to accept what we regard as this truth only reinforces our desire not to dwell on the unpleasantness of threats delivered by those who were so recently friends whom we still value and whom we hope will swiftly accept us as true and trustworthy friends again then kindly leave us both personally and in the shape of your ship we shall make our own way to a place of safety if what you claim is true and you meant us no harm by delivering us so expeditiously into the jaws of our enemies you may accept our apologies if not then know that the ronte make implacable foes and the memory of a betrayal against one group becomes part of the memory of all you are dismissed may i whatever it is you may not i said you are dismissed go the culture machine dipped its front portion in what was supposed to be taken as a respectful bow then the whole machine was enveloped by a silvery sphere of fields beyond the ken of the most sophisticated analytical devices the collective purposes vessel possessed the sphere shrank to a point and disappeared and the machine was gone the navigation and targeting team reported that the culture ship began to depart in the same instant pulling slowly away and then effectively disappearing a signal from the culture ship sir the communications officer said from the drone jonsker apcandrechenat show the drone appeared on screen swarmprince the drone said my apologies for intruding again so immediately however what i wished to say and still have to say is important a fiveship formation of gzilt warcraft including one capital ship has left zyse heading in your direction our initial simulations indicate that they intend to make a show of force and be seen to be seeing you off rather than intending to offer battle we believe similar though smaller gzilt formations have been disposed to carry out similar actions wherever else ronte forces have been en route to their destinations of more concern for your own squadron are two forces of liseiden ships both consisting of four vessels each at least as heavily armed as your squadron flagship these are believed to be converging on your entry point into the gzilt system the beats working continues to pull away but remains at your disposal and will respond as quickly as possible to any signal from you thank you and good luck the screen blanked out signal all squadrons and elements to turn about swarmprince ossebri haldesib said have them find places of safety according to existing fleet orders and prioritise eluding liseiden units over those of the gzilt and the culture though all are to be avoided in that order senior navigation officer you and i shall submit our codes to the ai to unlock our own sealed orders sir the sealed orders indicated that in the event of an emergency of the type now facing them the squadron should make its way to the nearby system of vatrelles five days distant at full speed to await further instructions the swarmprince issued the appropriate orders then turned to his communications officer signal the culture ship that it may remain at its current distance from us if it wishes we may have need of it yet convene a full consultation with all senior officers ais and expert systems twenty s the general systems vehicle empiricist felt it was arriving in gzilt at a bad time a bad time that was meant to be the start of a brief good time a momentous and celebrated time but which had somehow gone wrong well in the end there was no helping this sometimes you just had to adopt the attitude summed up by too bad the ship was about as big as standard culture vessels ever got a systemclass that had beefed up over the decades and centuries for what had always seemed like sound operational reasons at the time until it had become one of the most impressively large commodious and populated examples of the class that was already the most impressively large commodious and populated the culture possessed the design of the systemclass made such selfaugmentation easy the ships had no single outer hull surrounding their hundreds of individual components just colossal bubbles of air held in place by field enclosures adding new selfmanufactured bits was so simple it was for some ships at least apparently tantamount to compulsory and it was only a sort of residual decorousness and a wish not to be seen as too selfindulgently ostentatious that prevented certain systemclass vessels from going expansionmad and growing to the size of planets or at least moons that sort of indulged obsessiveness was what simming and strong vr was for you could convincingly imagine yourself being any ludicrous size without actually committing to such monomania in reality doing away with a physical hull or treating the exterior of every component as a hull depending on how you looked at it had been no great leap for gsvs ships thought of their multiplelayer fieldcomplex enclosures as their true hulls anyway that was where all the important stuff happened in relation to the outside that was where the sensory fields were where any stray impacts were absorbed where concentric layers of shielding tuned to various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum lurked where holes could be opened to allow smaller units modules and ships to enter and depart and especially in the case of the larger vessels where atmospheric pressure was kept in and sunlines could be formed and controlled to provide light for any parkland carried on the top of the ships solid hull frankly the material bit inside was just there to provide a sort of neat wrapping for all the truly internal bits and pieces like accommodation and social spaces comfortably over two hundred kilometres long even by the most conservative of measurement regimes fabulously ellipsoidally rotund dazzling with multiple sunlines and tiny artificial stars providing illumination for motley steps and levels and layers of riotous vegetation belonging strictly speaking on thousands of different worlds spread across the galaxy boasting hundreds of contrasting landscapes from the most mathematically manicured to the most seemingly pristinely savagely wild all contained on slabstoreys of components generally kilometres high each stratified within one of a dozen stacked atmospheric gradients the ships cosseted internals were riddled woven and saturated with domesticated tamed and semiwild life in hundreds of thousands of smaller enclosed habitats while its buzzing external bewilderingly complex archigeographic lines were made fuzzy imprecisely seen by nearuncountable numbers of craft moving within that vast elongated bubble of air from smaller classes of gsv through other ships modules shuttles and aircraft all the way down to individual humans in floatharnesses single drones and even smaller machines as well as thousands of species of winged and lighterthanair biocreatures the empiricist was in sum home to hundreds of billions of animals and over thirteen billion humans and drones the people of the culture better than ninetyfive per cent of them housed across the vast distributed bucolic hinterland of the orbitals scattered throughout the civilised galaxy like a million glowing bracelets were used to thinking of the gsvs as being their true megacities albeit determinedly highly mobile highspeed megacities but gsvs like the empiricist were on another level and of another order entirely they held the populations of worlds of entire inhabited stellar systems zyse the gzilt home planet and the giant gsvs destination held over three billion people the whole of the gzilt system added another twenty billion in parthabiformed worlds and moons microrbitals and other habitats the empiricist arriving was like another half a solar system of people being added like another four mature substantial planets worth of souls suddenly coming to visit preceded by a ceremonial screen of smaller craft including a couple of gsvs each home to many millions the gradually slowing empiricist first met with a couple of gzilt navy ships effectively sweeping the two cruisers up with it as it proceeded resplendently past the rendezvous point then as it slowed still further gradually attracted hundreds of civilian welcoming craft too had not so many locals been stored and had all been well within the gzilt body politic it supposed it might have attracted thousands the ships septet of semiindependent minds became graciously easily busy with welcoming signals and media requests the empiricist approached and then inserted itself into a specially cleared orbital band high over zyse it had started slowing almost a day earlier now it was down to the sort of velocity required for a stately orbit of the world every couple of hours allowing plenty of time for people on the ground to look up and see it gliding smoothly glitteringly statuesquely overhead and reducing the time it would take to ferry people to and from the planetary surface xgsv empiricist olou caconym ogsv contents may differ ogcu displacement activity ogsv just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry oue mistake not omsv passing by and thought id drop in omsv pressure drop olsv you call this clean arrived over zyse good to be here finally mostly been thinking going to keep my two delinquents headcrash and xenocrat close by they are conveniently hereabouts after all and the political atmosphere locally does seem a little odd well poisonous to be blunt how was this allowed to develop xmsv passing by and thought id drop in welcome yes we might have wished for better everythings in the signal streams of course but soaking in all the local comms and media traffic of the last twentyfew days is definitely recommended worth setting one mind on that alone if i may make so bold my network of sats and such is at your disposal though of course you may wish to emplace your own id be as happy to advise as to leave you to your own devices are you really so worried regarding the current situation to feel the delinquents must remain as close guards i think i speak for the group when i say we were hoping those and more might be available for further use in the current emergency while your own safety might be ensured with your doubtless many other assets lets see how things develop over the next couple of days for now id feel safer with the delinquents as part of my general defensive mix i did have to leave some offensive units behind to mop up at loliscombana im building to replace but thatll take time xlou caconym omsv pressure drop whats that big fuck playing at the next few days are the crucial ones the only ones we might need those ships now its being cautious and protecting a pop of umpteen bill when you carry around that sort of responsibility you cant help but become ultra careful mostly these big ships pursue a noriskswhatever policy im mildly surprised it deigned to visit gzilt at all given the recent excitements thats the trouble with ships that size too big to risk and also therefore to be effective terribly impressive and if all the bios plonk down to zyse and walk around they can surely make the place look busy for the first time in years but so what couldnt be more of a liability if it had hauled a train of orbitals behind it and parked them in the local asteroid belt anyway what does that leave us with the mistake not is about to hit xown again and the passing bys two thugs are keeping remarkably quiet wasnt one meant to be shadowing the liseiden allegedly sending a private request for a public statement we do kind of need a general update now the bigbutplugged gun has arrived nope the passing by wishes to remain reticent on the subject bet the new boy asks anyway back to listening worshipful listening as i dont doubt it will be interpreted the reception was muted due to the recent death of the president but was nevertheless still quite entirely splendid the enormous central receiving hall of the parliaments upper chamber had been trimmed everywhere in mourning red the towering mirror panels reflecting a seeming infinitude of scarlet corridors leading in every horizontal direction place looks rather good like this yegres said nodding over his glass at the huge central scoop of red marking the covered chandelier cluster hanging from the centre of the space we should have lost presidents more often its a little late though isnt it banstegeyn replied everything is yegres agreed oh he said catching sight of seven tall figures moving liquidly through the crowd on the main floor oh well here come the relations id better leave you to your ceremonial solitariness he chucked back his drink hitched up his long robes and stepped down from the dais the septame watched the arrowshaped mass of avatars and their hangerson move towards him like something aimed solitude he said to himself rather than really to yegres who was too far away and submerged in the crowd of people behind solitude not solitariness of course he was careful not to move his lips in case banstegeyn greeted the seven tall silverskinned creatures with all the dignity and politeness he could muster solemnity too though really it was easy to be solemn it was the dignity and politeness he was having problems with having dreamt of orpe on consecutive nights hed used the relevant implants to stop himself dreaming over the last two and had slept well but now he was starting to feel that he had only displaced the problem for he had the annoying irrational and even very slightly frightening feeling even though he was entirely awake and apparently well rested that orpe was just out of sight just beyond the corner of his eye it was disconcerting troubling he most certainly did not believe in ghosts or any such nonsense but when it happened catching him out when he thought he glimpsed her or thought hed just missed seeing her a moment earlier just as he turned his head or blinked he felt as terrified as he imagined people must have felt in the old days when they had been superstitious he knew it was his own mind his own brain acting against him betraying him deliberately troubling him but it felt like something other something supernatural uncanny on a few occasions over the last few days hed wanted just to scream for no good reason especially at formal ceremonial events when it would have been absolutely the worst most shocking and disrespectful thing to do so many aliens arriving so many different forms and types of creature so many in exosuits or things like tiny spacecraft it was like welcoming the contents of a toy cupboard scaled for giants how were you supposed to keep a straight face that was when he most wanted to do it to laugh hysterically in their faces or scream and shout and swear and thrash about on the floor and tear his hair out but just a few more days a few more days and it would all be over they could all go to the happy land of good and plenty and never need to bother with horrible messy painful real life again he couldnt wait it was the only thing keeping him together please he said smiling too broadly as he half turned to indicate the way through the variously smiling grinning tightfaced dignitaries behind him to the scarcely smaller and even more sumptuous room where president intyom waited enthroned enrobed befuddled this way please the president is impatient to meet you thank you the leading avatar said the seven looked identical tall straight dressed plainly but elegantly and their expressions radiating a kind of severe serenity at their rear ziborlun the culture avatar the court had become used to looked small plain and homely in comparison just as banstegeyn turned more fully to walk ahead of the culture avatars he caught a glimpse of but no of course it wasnt really her at all a civilian she hadnt been backedup one of those who believed life was lived all the more sweetly and more sensibly for knowing there was no second chance while understanding without ever really needing to think about it that a society as sophisticated and mature as that of gzilt made sudden accidental death almost unheard of anyway so it wasnt her and it would never be her and only three days to go anyway he told himself again so it didnt really matter he stumbled slightly as he walked in front of the silver creatures to the opening doors of the presidential chamber he wondered who would have noticed only three more days he walked into the hundredsstrong swirl of bizarrely accoutred aliens and milling redclad people thronging the presidential chamber septame a word marshal chekwri said touching him on one elbow to draw him slightly aside from the crowds surrounding the dais where the acting president was greeting the avatars of course chekwri but i am busy as ever however two things first the ships we had see off the ronte reckon theyre heading for vatrelles i thought we might let that leak to our new allies the liseiden what why distraction something to fill the news and if they quarrel then perhaps another reason to leave this squabbling reality behind no reinforcement yes yes all right is that all no i did say two things some pleasant news always welcome what is it the marshals staffers and his own headed by solbli and jevan had created a space around them so they could talk with a degree of privacy chekwri brought her mouth close to his ear we have a major asset in place somewhere it might come in useful do we thats good what and where where is xown what is the returned churkun it was off for a while there thinking about subliming early following the event at ablate but in the end it didnt make the leap wants to go with everybody else isnt that nice so reported to me happily always worth covering such possibilities in standing orders and asked if it could be of use so i sent it to xown because that was the last place the culture ship and the absconded ms cossont seemed to be interested in the marshal drew back a little winked at him winked had she done this before was this some new thing some fresh loosening of behaviour and discipline ahead of the sonearnow subliming the simulations backed me up but it was my idea first always good to be proved right isnt it septame always he agreed and i think this time we go in full force gloves off maximum strength if called for dont you yes yes whatever you think fit splendid so we have a fully equipped committedly oneofus combathardened battleship ready and waiting at xown and that is a very good a particularly good thing septame may i tell you why yes chekwri why dont you tell me why because it has just reported that something fast both coming in quick and braking very hard indeed has just about hauled to a stop at xown and its almost certainly going to be the culture ship colonel agansu still undergoing treatments he had come to regard as meaning he was under repair rather than representing anything as biological as healing had a dilemma colonel the regs are clear you need to update your avatar down on xown its been plugging along there patiently keeping pace with the airship for nearly ten days but now theres a distinct likelihood its going to be put in harms way and it needs to have every advantage we can give it i am aware of that captain agansu said thank you the colonel had been badly injured in the battle at the incast facility on the bokri orbital the culture creature the ships avatar had succeeded not only in destroying the combat arbite uhtryn through the illegal use of antimatter weaponry within an enclosed civilian space but had then somehow turned his own weaponry against him turning a large portion of its own body into a perfectly reflective dish that had bounced his laser pulse straight back at him crippling both his suit and his body sending him plunging down the elevator shaft with little or no ag left he could still hear his own screams loud inside his helmet as he fell blinded burning baked both legs and one arm shattered into the shaft to land with a terrible crushing crash on top of the already wrecked elevator car at the bottom hed blacked out then or the suit helmets remaining medical functions had put him mercifully under but he could still hear that raw inhuman scream in his ears and feel the awful smacking thud of impact cracking open the suit splintering his bones and breaking his back the suit its helmet had saved him then the uagren had too bringing him back on board placing him in its medical facility gently peeling away and removing the blackened bubbled remains of the suit and slicing away the burned roasted skin and flesh where it was beyond reusing before it had coaxingly almost lovingly started to knit his bones repair and regrow his torn battered organs and nurture where possible and replace where necessary his bruised assaulted flesh it was a process that was still ongoing agansu was many days away from being physically whole again and would still be largely dependent on the ship when the subliming happened in three days time assuming of course that it was still going to take place on schedule in its own way though even knowing that this bodys part in matters was over was itself a kind of comfort it meant that having given his all having been so nearly killed in honourable combat now he didnt have to leave the healing comfort of the ship again and could decide at the time whether to sublime with the uagren and its crew or not if not then he would be left by himself in a medically enabled minor craft to be delivered to whatever might be left of his regiment or indeed his civilisation after the instigation and the great enfolding but he might go with everybody after all he was thinking of changing his mind of subliming despite his earlier decision and stillexisting fears coming so close to death on bokri even while knowing that an earlier backedup version of him might be rewakened somewhere had been salutary and had made him think again about his attitude to death oblivion and the whole issue of subliming also he had in some way come to feel part of the uagren and at one with its crew he liked the idea of outloading with these already semivirtualised people assuming of course that they felt the same way he worried that he still seemed like an interloper to them perhaps even a foreign body an irritant he was nervous about broaching the subject in the meantime there was the issue of having to update the customised bioplausible android which the ship had left inside the girdlecity of xown when it had set off in pursuit of the culture ship nearly ten days earlier the uagren was on its way back to xown but unable to maintain the kind of speeds it had on that dash due to engine field degradation it was doing so at a comfortable cruise rather than a sprint and would arrive at xown a full day after the culture vessel it could still transmit the colonels mindstate ahead and have this new postbokri version integrated into the one that had been left behind but agansu had to admit he had been resisting the process using as his excuse the idea that the longer they waited the longer he would have to think about what had happened within the incast facility and learn whatever lessons could be learned from the experience before transmitting the truth was that he was reluctant to hand over to the android left behind on xown because he was jealous the android would become the new him and it not he would have the next set of experiences it would be the one the version of him that would have the opportunity to engage with the enemy and defeat the culture ships avatar it did not seem fair he wanted to be the victor this version the original frombirth cagad agansu colonel of the first the home system regiment and not some quickly customised android formed from a blank the ship had been holding probably since it was first built he knew of course he did that the android represented a version of him that it would think of itself as fully being him but that was beside the point the action would all happen away from him and the person the entity involved would not be him he would be lying here still being carried towards whatever would happen in the girdlecity on xown perhaps the experiences the android had could be reintegrated back into his own memory that was possible but it didnt always work it seemed to depend on how extreme and traumatic the experiences had been but even then he would always know that in a sense it hadnt really been him there at the front at the tip of the spear colonel the captain said talking to him across the virtual bridge of the ship where he sat to one side of the arc of officers arranged around their welter of screens readouts and controls yes captain he said i think im ready there are no more lessons to be drawn please carry out the procedure the captain nodded to the datacomms officers proceed agansu seemed to fade away for a moment and was briefly aware of not being on any sort of virtual bridge at all but being a broken body still under repair held deep in the bowels of the ship as it read his mind sorted and arranged the resulting data and encrypted it for transmission ahead to the android waiting on xown welcome back the captain said smiling as though agansu felt he was a lone bio who had needed to leave the bridge to obey a call of nature and to good news yes captain we have big guns at xown the captain announced a capital ship also reporting to marshal chekwri so on our side no matter how narrowly thats defined the captain smiled thinly and its already dealing with some of the shit the culture craft left behind the suite of materiel and general sensory assetry the mistake not had left behind at xown mostly reported back to a satellite which stowed to about the size of a human fist fully deployed with finerthanhairthin tendrils extending tens of kilometres away from it in its geosynchronous orbit it watched something big and probably military approaching xown across the skein of space it was also aware of every piece of freefloating hardware in the system being pinged with signals asking them to identify themselves this was a bad sign it reported this to the also approaching but more distant mistake not and was told to shut down to passiveminimum awareness it did so but it was still found jolted with a tiny but abrupt gravity gradient that first illuminated it in passing and swept on then returned pulsed and almost immediately plunged it into its own steep sharp hole in spacetime its last act was to destruct as chaotically and messily as possible depriving any focused analytical equipment of the chance to determine much about it at all on xown scattered about the part of girdlecity where the airship equatorial was moving slowly towards the place it had set off from five years earlier dozens of tiny bits and pieces of culture hardware started dropping out of the sky falling to the floor or tumbling clicking and clacking through the vast piped spaces of the construction some burned or fused or just glowed destructing as best they could some just had to accept deactivation and likely capture a very small number where able closed down closed off or better still ejected all their conventionally discoverable hardware processing and shifted down to backup bio or atomechanical systems even those were vulnerable through basic triangulation on their last recorded position in the network as recorded by the compromised components unable to wipe their memories in time and most succumbed snapped away by disloc knocked out of the air with closerange effector weapons or frazzled in midflight as they tried to escape by pinpoint bursts of plasma fire like miniature daytime fireworks the airship equatorial home of the last party had built up a following of several hundred people over the last few days as it and gzilt society in general approached the culmination of their respective journeys however only a few people noticed any of this smallscale destructive activity and even they dismissed it as just more random chaotic irrelevance symptomatic of these final days one small device which had looked like a fourwinged insect from the start suddenly realised that it was probably all that remained of the components the ship had left behind it sat on the snout of the airship perched clinging to a thin stanchion supporting a long dangling trailing banner and watched through impersonated compound eyes as another component a thumbsized scout missile plummeted from on high falling minutely past the bulbous nose of the slowly advancing airship unwinding a twisting thread of grey smoke as it fell unseen by any human eye it disappeared into the dark depths of the huge openwork tunnel beneath some seconds later the giant airship bulged its way through the volume of air the little device had fallen through the artificial insect detected a faint disappearing tracescent of the scout missiles descent the insect considered its instructions in the event of such eventualities waited for a time then lifted off buzzing away on a long falling curve building in just enough erraticism into its course to look convincing as it headed for the nearest point of entry into the body of the airship thats not good berdle said whats not good cossont asked something big and powerful just rolled up at xown and started blighting all my gear the avatar told her they were sitting in the shuttles compact command space watching the planet approach as they decelerated from the system edge what gear the bits and pieces i left behind to keep an eye on whatevers happening there cossont frowned at the avatar do you leave stuff behind everywhere youve been pretty much berdle looked at her with an expression indistinguishable from genuine incomprehension why wouldnt you never mind this big and powerful something bigger and more powerful than you definitely bigger we still going in even less choice now we couldnt just call ximenyr cossont said could we you know just say hi we need them eyes youve got berdle smiled briefly i have been trying to contact the gentleman i asked mr qirias mindstate if it would cooperate and it said it would but ximenyrs been impossible to contact a direct appeal to him from mr qiria ought to be our first course of action when we do gain access to him oh you might have told me i might berdle agreed looking unconcerned i would have had we been successful huh okay so this ship the same one as at bokri no the avatar said cant be registering all different anyway battleship rather than battlecruiser i can outrun it but thats not much use when we both want to be in the same place at the same time berdle shook his head shit in a slather pretty much everythings gone or going im losing all my senses down there think theyll be putting their surveillance in instead i suppose though being gzilt navy rather than special forces or anything i bet their stuff isnt as sneaky as my stuff what was the last you heard through all this sneaky stuff ximenyr was still there on the airship getting prepared for the latest bout of ceremonial partying apparently thats all according to the airships own channels i dont have direct access to him and he hasnt been heard of for at least seven days i have had stuff inside the airship but nothing in the guys own quarters after he found that scout missile pretty sure hes still there but not certain ive found some incidental recording of him still wearing the container round his neck from the day after we visited him so at least initially we didnt spook him also the whole layout of the airships been changing since a couple of days after we were here before theyve created a big new space inside and theyve been bringing in a lot of extra tech including new field projectors and water that thing must weigh a lot more than it used to but they seem to have balanced it all out with extra ag none of which would matter if we could see inside it properly but we cant plus now weve got competition and they know where our attentions been focused if they didnt before not to mention he said turning to her theres been a guy walking or jogging ahead of the airship since we left i thought there were various people doing that oh its collected lots of people keeping pace with it recently in aircars traveltube carriages special trains and ground vehicles plus there are people keeping pace with it on foot for half a day or so at a time but there was only one guy who just kept it up all the way through i had an insectile watching him the whole time and he just never stopped he hardly even varied his pace all he did was switch what level and which side he was on and keep level with different parts of the airship i suppose so he wasnt too conspicuous hes got some sort of camo or adaptive clothing on that changes every day but that didnt throw the bug off it was still the same guy walking or jogging day and night probably not human then probably not human berdle agreed though of course you never know there are some very odd humans he frowned at the screen and the giant redbrown green and blue ball of xown as though the planet itself had been responsible for this upset trouble is hes disappeared now too he awoke he was in a military medical facility aboard a regimental fleet ground liaison craft flying within a subsidiary tunnel space of the girdlecity of xown it was late afternoon on this part of xown five minutes off midnight back on zyse he was lying on a couch blinking at the ceiling light panels he was a customised bioplausible android waking after having had the latest version of his guest implanted he was colonel agansu translated and transplanted into this fresh tireless highly capable and perfectly unharmed new body it made no difference he knew that he had been worried about having his consciousness duplicated in this way but he had been a fool to torment himself with such concerns of course the original of him lying being put back together and regrown in the bowels of the uagren would always think of itself as the real him he accepted this without emotion but he knew who he was within this body here now and that there was work to be done knowing that there was another iteration of himself elsewhere was mildly comforting like having another layer of protection wrapped around him but made little real difference a screen on a flexarm swung over to inspect him a womans face looked at him from somewhere remote the doctors gaze flicked to one side then the other doubtless studying readouts then she said well whoever you are whatever it is they want you to do youre as ready as youll ever be to do it good luck and good subliming brother agansu swung out of the couch the screen seemed to flinch withdrawing towards the ceiling as he did so thank you he said he felt the aircraft settle on a solid surface interfaced with the crafts systems he knew he would be three hundred and ten metres ahead two hundred and twenty metres away laterally and zero metres vertically from the nose of the airship when he exited he checked his camouflage clothing got it to impersonate something civilian and nondescript he remembered days of jogging and walking climbing steps and ramps descending steps and ramps in filtered daylight and lamplight and ghostly satlight and no light the airship filling his view ahead or a presence at his back or a steady shape at one side or the other or above him or through gratings beneath him as he paced sometimes fireworks lasers and holographic images burst from lanced out or envelopedprecededtrailed the airship especially at night and sometimes loud music could be heard playing floodlights and running lights lit it every night sometimes when he ran behind and above it he could smell food and fumes and detect the spoor of biodrugs he recalled the feeling of being swaddled and protected within the uagren and remembered talking to the avatar of the culture ship and thinking that he had the creature and vyr cossont where he wanted them at his mercy then hurtling broken and screaming down the lift shaft like a burned insect falling flaming down a tall chimney he remembered lying broken and burned and taken apart within the ship again then beginning to be made whole again while he contemplated how close to death he had come and how the prospect of oblivion within the subliming had started to seem less terrifying two sets of memories had been formed at the same time but this made no difference either the ground liaison craft carried little weaponry and was only able to equip him with a kinex sidearm but that would not matter for too long the android body had what was effectively a laser carbine embedded in each forearm the beams exiting through a skindisguised muzzle in the heel of each hand he jumped easily seemingly lightly from the lowered door of the stealthblack craft then as it closed itself flipped over and powered off down the fiftymetrediameter tunnel he turned and jogged down a broad crosscorridor of soaring lattice girders and overarching pipes that led directly to the giant basketweave of tunnel where the equatorial moved there was an area of open balcony deck ahead the airship would be just about to pass it by the time he got there the churkun established contact colonel agansu in translation yes i am captain of the churkun the marshal sends regards please thank the marshal we have completed the scour of culture devices from the immediate volume and beyond though a vessel i would guess the culture ship that you encountered at ospin is approaching it was slowing but is now reaccelerating we are going to attempt to intercept or disrupt any attempt it makes to disloc materiel or personnel into or near the girdlecity however we cannot be certain of success it would help to know the intended location of any such attempted disloc to help confirm the nature of enemy intentions agansu sent approaching the great open balcony that gave out onto the tunnel which held the approaching airship that is entirely compatible with our own intentions well let you know where any disloc was targeted whether successful or not thank you there were people ahead the spaces around the airship equatorial had been becoming more populated over the days he had been keeping pace with it ground vehicles rumbled slowly past ahead on a broad roadway they were gaudy booming with music across the gulf of the tunnel he could see a train trundling keeping pace searchlights on it pointing back at the airship flicking slowly off and on again as they passed behind supporting struts a smaller airship like a tiny white cloud made solid appeared from a side tunnel and drew slowly ahead of the equatorial scattering clouds of sparkling coloured dust which a rearfacing laser lit up in gyrating abstract patterns the skin of the equatorial exhibited a series of large moving images as though projected onto its smooth curvature there appeared to be seven or eight of these distorted displays covering the airships surface at any one time some of the photographs were stills most moved and they sometimes fused together to provide larger images some appeared only to make any sort of sense considering the airship as a whole in other words imagining the form of the display on the other side of the craft the most common themes appeared to be records of earlier art installations aboard the craft over the last few years nature in the form of plants and animals historical and presently existing forms of transport and pornography we carry four sixtyfourunit platoons of marine combat arbites the churkuns captain told him they are at your disposal colonel shall i have my tactical engagements officer ready some or all of them for deployment please do he had to push through a small parade of people dressed in motley many dancing as they moved some singing some chanting to get to the edge of the space where the balcony gave out onto the open tunnel of curving ribs and spiralling pipes there he found the equatorial filling the monstrous tube like a comically slow shell in the biggest least efficient gun ever made then colonel agansu had a sudden literal flash of memory and remembered the magnified shadow of his own suited form being thrown out across the elevator shaft within the incast facility on bokri as the combat arbite uhtryn behind him was dissolved in a pointillist spray of tiny fierce antimatter explosions blasting a blindingly intense sleet of radiation past him through him how many of the combat arbites do you need colonel a chorus of beeps trills clangs and musical phrases followed by some cheers and the start of a fireworks display from the top of the giant airship announced that it was midnight on zyse and the instigation was only two days away all of them twentyone s because youre liable to get killed that doesnt seem to be stopping you of course not im an avatar killed doesnt even mean the same thing for me youre a bio ive seen how you guys die and its messy i meant as the ship the mistake not youre liable to get killed arent you a slightly more weighty consideration i accept but even then ive already transmitted my mindstate to my home gsv and switched to full combat readiness so im kind of ready for death and anyway not dead yet this is my fight though isnt it more than yours berdle sighed this is about the gzilt but the culture appears to be all mixed up in it through qiria so its our problem to sort out its still basically about us you cant do everything youre not our parent youre not even backedup cossont if you die you die cant you back me up no she had a sudden thought did you backup qiria his mindstate from the grey cube yes also transmitted with a note its private and to be wiped if the original survives she frowned why cant you back me up youve no neural lace even starting right now it would take far too long were already out of time berdle waved his hands as though exasperated why are you so keen to risk your life anyway youre a military reservist civilian facing subliming in a couple of days why the rush to die and im telling you having you present will make my job harder not easier you wont be contributing youll be jeopardising first of all on that last point i dont believe you i think youre just trying to protect me being all malegallant im flattered but theres no need im a fucking razorarsed starship you maniac im not male female or anything else except stupendously smart and right now tuned to smite i dont give a fuck about flattering you the few and frankly not vitally important sentiments i have concerning you i can switch off like flicking a switch anyway you cant keep me prisoner on the ship youre culture and im a free agent i demand to be set down in the girdlecity they are looking for you remember they think you trashed fzanjuym with your bare hands or whatever the fuck so youd better look after me then thats what im trying to tell you i dont need that extra workload and if you insist on quitting the ship ill put you down wherever i damn well please not where you specifically demand so there you are you cant win cossont already dressed in the same figurehugging undersuit shed worn at bokri stood looking levelly at the avatar across the modules lounge if you dont give a fuck about flattering me she said slowly and if you can just switch off any sentiments you have concerning me you can do that down there on the planet in the girdlecity in the airship so you dont have to worry about me and i will help not hinder berdle stared at her then he smiled and relaxed his tone of voice changed i dont know about you vyr he said conversationally but im sort of posturing here he shrugged if you insist on coming you can though its your funeral and i wont risk any part of what im supposed to be doing to keep you safe at all not if its a tradeoff just nothing he shook his head i thought maybe you were just putting on a sort of goodenough show you know so you could feel okay about yourself even though you didnt want to go or expect to so one last chance in all seriousness please dont come one last time i want to take me with you berdle sighed okay you cant say you werent warned put that on he nodded behind cossont she turned round to see a bizarre vision of a man in closefitting armour half mirror half sootblack headless marching out of an alcove growing an extra pair of arms and peeling itself open as it approached her whats that a better suit im downloading a copy of qirias mindstate to it now so we can access the old geezers memories direct if we get hold of his eyes without the ship around go on just step in as you are weve ninety seconds before we snap aboard so dont take too long i thought we had ten minutes not any more the ships powering back out again hoping to lure the battleship away from xown shit cossont stepped over to the suit and then into it it flowed closed around her leaving the helmet component down think thatll work she asked doubt it the avatar admitted assuming the battleships been talking to the battlecruiser itll know ive already been moving faster than it can but it might factor in too much main traction stress degradation after all the dashing about ive been doing lately and think it has a chance assuming its engines arent slightly fucked too of course worth a try pyan sprawled loosely on a couch all this time came flapping over and stood on a seatback facing her like a small stiff flag well done you it said i think youre being terribly brave but im sure itll all work out splendidly and just remember ive always loved you cossont was about to say something like okay now im worried when her eyes narrowed and she looked at berdle did you put it up to that berdle shrugged also worth a try but i do pyan exclaimed twisting to face berdle then back to cossont but i do yeah cossont said twenty seconds the ship sent a tiny update of its mindstate to its home gsv mostly just so there would be a record of cossont insisting on going with its avatar and other onplanet forces into the girdlecity the ship was a constrained shell of force hurtling across the system now reaccelerating hard packaged within its wrapping of concentric fields like something cocooned engines howling in frequencies no biological living thing would ever sense a kilometrelong projectile submerged beneath the skein of real space components of three outer fields lasing in hyperspace to direct the signal to its distant shipmother then clicking off again after a nanosecond while other configurations of fields slid and flicked stacked and snicked readying for a series of multiple highspeed highaccuracy displaces to a complextopography target deep in a gravity well probably opposed this was the ship knew going to be challenging most serious culture ships and all with any pretensions to being warships possessed burst units specialised engine components like motive power capacitors capable of providing sudden brief flares of energy and movement the mistake nots were more powerful and capable than most craft its size which was kind of a gamegivingaway liability if you actually had to use them in the presence of somebody able to spot such shenanigans but on the other hand this was exactly the situation where they might help save the day so the ship was already heading dangerously close to xowns gravity well having to adjust its course in hyperspace to avoid crashing into the downward curve of skein it jinked closer still at the last moment using up all its burst unit energies both to swerve and slow then focused in on the relatively tiny part of itself that held the module where its avatar and the humanoid were snapping the two humanshaped forms and the womans pet away and then the module separately it loosed the module first targeting the displace at a spot just outside the girdlecity twelve hundred metres above local ground level and ten kilometres back from the current location of the airship equatorial it was given the relative velocities involved one of the most accurate and precisely located flying displaces it had ever heard of snapping the module into the air within an elegantly aligned pocket of vacuum that collapsed at just the right rate to allow the craft to continue on its way under its own power now so smoothly that the ship doubted somebody standing inside the module had there been anybody would even have wobbled as the transition was completed that the whole craft was almost immediately snatched away again by an almost equally heavyduty disloc facility with a most inelegant bang like a sonic boom caused by the caissonfield collapsing uncontrolled was happily quite beside the point while the gzilt ship was busy doing this the mistake not was merrily zapping all its real payloads its avatar and cossont included into the places it had wanted to in the first place that done within the same millisecond it was off again spiralling down under even fiercer acceleration as though intent on diving right under the planets depression in the skein and aiming for the energy grid far beneath it steadied zoomed sped off tracked but not targeted by the gzilt warcraft which remained stationary hugging close to the planet pyan was dumped into the ships last remaining human habitable space a sixperson shuttle wheres this the creature said new home the ship sent its small and boring so are you what how dare you would you rather be on the planet which is safer the mistake not watched the gzilt ship staying annoyingly frustratingly exactly where it was singularly failing to pursue it even though the mistake not had pretended to be less quick than it really was just to make it think it had a chance probably the planet now it admitted the planet then well hurry up too far next passapproach youre going back of course im going back i protest at this behaviour towards me why wasnt i best you go to sleep now the ship said pyan flopped inert to the floor of the little shuttle and was tidied neatly folded into a slim locker by a small ship drone which then checked that everything else in the tiny craft was stowed and strapped in case there was any wild manoeuvring then it too stowed itself securely in another locker xgsv empiricist olou caconym ogsv contents may differ ogcu displacement activity ogsv just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry oue mistake not omsv passing by and thought id drop in omsv pressure drop olsv you call this clean open question specifically to the mistake not are you sure you are doing the right thing it is plausible that the gzilt craft is an possibly the ship responsible for what happened at ablate it is certainly powerful and may be unconstrained by conscience xue mistake not no not sure at all but committed so lets see what happens xgsv contents may differ i am equally worried re the beats working it just transmitted its mindstate xlou caconym suggestion tell it whatever its thinking of doing dont xgsv contents may differ i have been trying to contact it after the mindstate signal arrived nothing to pass the time while i wait for a reply i have been trawling the banks for evidence that this is anything other than a bad sign coming from a contact unit guess what xgsv empiricist the beats working is with the largest part of the ronte fleet heading for vatrelles the gzilt saw them off but only as far as the system outskirts then returned with no known other hostility that leaves the liseiden we have the thugclass value judgement with the main squadron do we not xmsv passing by and thought id drop in yes though the main the largest squadron is not the flagship flotilla they redispositioned bringing various of their separate squadrons together into a more martial metaconfiguration following the original decision on preferred scavenger status going against them one group of three ships joined the three of the flagship squadron but three separate groups of three also amalgamated and as that then constituted the greatest force they had that is the one the value judgement was sent to shadow we have nothing with the flagship squadron commanded by nyxandabo tyun and as that was the force already also converging on zyse that is the force most likely to offer any threat to the ronte attempting to make vatrelles xlou caconym omsv pressure drop shit i bet the gzilt told the liseiden where it looked like the ronte were heading and if the fucking empiricist had let us use those delinquents we wouldnt be looking at this debacle xgsv empiricist i suggest i send my fastest ship to rendezvous with the beats working and the ronte while signalling the liseiden to desist from any hostile action they may be contemplating i am sure we have such a preponderance of forces locally we can prevent any mooted unpleasantness xlou caconym omsv pressure drop here we go spoken like a ship with no idea of how things actually work its not about what forces youve got its about what forces youve got where youd think even a civilian would understand that you may be being too harsh agreed nothing it has can get to the likely volume of combat in time but it has a point regarding a warning possibly being enough that would apply if we had nothing military here at all we are who we are and we can call any shots at any time that still might not stop the liseiden from making a point to the ronte just to show whos boss in future lets hope youre wrong yes why dont we that ought to pass the time anyway lets hear what the empiricist thinks we ought to do xgsv empiricist i am despatching the rou learned response the lou new toy and the gou questionable ethics in string formation rou leading to maximum reach and make rendezvous the lou to per cent and the

team principal nyxandabo tyun accepted the call in his private cabin it was from his sensorstargeting officer he had asked not to be disturbed unless something urgent came up what he said with deliberate gruffness though secretly he was glad of the interruption he was finding writing what he hoped would turn into one of the more exciting parts of his memoirs rather more difficult than hed anticipated sir we have the ronte fleet in sight at extended scanner range thirteen targets thirteen so the culture ship is still with them appears so sir are they aware of us doubtful sir id prefer a percentage applied to that doubt officer sir ninety per cent certain they havent detected us sir thats better also sir comms coming on line with a signal from the culture gsv empiricist shall i yes comms what are they saying theres quite a lot of it sir ive patched it through but it boils down to them telling us not to attack the ronte i bet it does ill take a look shortly you have followed my earlier orders and not acknowledged yes sir good st sir the sensorstargeting officer said how long until we have the ronte fleet in range a fraction over two hours at current velocities and courses sir two hours i thought we expected to have them in range forty minutes after contact their drive signatures are messier than anticipated sir plus the culture ship with them appears to be hurrying them on hard to tell from this far away only about fifteen per cent certain but it looks like its encased them in its own field enclosure highly extended and is acting like a sort of highspeed tug i see engineering sir can you give us a little more power negative sir another stepup from here would imply a seventy per cent chance of serious engine malfunction probably in one or both of the two jubundeclass ships hmm very well continue to close at current velocity combat sir go to full readiness in one hour shipwide ill rejoin the bridge then sir proceed all he said he cut off the chorus of acknowledgements and resumed his compositional task with a watery sigh the insectile drone jonsker apcandrechenat representative of the culture ship beats working floated in front of the swarmprince ossebri haldesib in the command space of the ronte interstitialexploratory vessel melancholia enshrines all triumph this need not be your fight machine haldesib told the drone it feels like it is swarmprince i led you into danger i thought i might help you escape it but it would appear we are discovered so now the least i can do is try to make amends by coming between you and the enemies into whose reach i so foolishly delivered you haldesib flicked one leg in a dismissive gesture for ourselves we do not seek our end but the hive the swarm the race will go on no matter you need not presume to share our fate through misplaced guilt i feel i have no honourable choice swarmprince you intend to attack the liseiden ships i intend to engage with them the distinction might be lost on them we have dealt with the liseiden before they will interpret any engagement as an attack or at least claim to afterwards be warned thank you i am this is the decision of your human crew no it is mine i intend to get my human crew to safety before matters become critical they concur with this they have come to accept it two wanted to be heroes and stay aboard i argued them out of this course the swarmprince flexed his wing plates in a human the equivalent might have been a shake of the head we may all die out here machine but of all of us you have some choice must you be a hero can you not argue yourself out of this course i probably could swarmprince but id regret it subsequently i believe this is the right thing to do and so i am doing it you may steal some of our glory the swarmprinces legs flexed as he said this dipping his body briefly to indicate that it was said humorously not aggressively i shall engage with them first independently swarmprince before any action between them and you if i may ill transmit to you whatever i can discover of their ships abilities strengths and weaknesses it may help if i am unable to stop them we are pleased to accept this kind offer but what if you prevail we shall be denied all chance to prove ourselves then you will have the benefit of my most profuse apologies i shall accept any amount of inferred alien cachet value negative honorary you care to bestow and i shall be grateful subsequently for even the most demeaning andor minor role in any ship dance within which you care to include me legclicks indicated the swarmprince was laughing a few other ronte in the command space joined in quietly it has been gratifying to us to witness the knowledge of and respect for our ways you have displayed ship the swarmprince said we can only wish you well with your engagement fight well live if you can die well if you must thank you swarmprince its been a pleasure you look tired septame chekwri told him as she entered his office in the parliament building i feel tired marshal never mind not long to go now you chosen your last outfit what your clothing whatever youre going to wear for the instigation have you decided how youll be dressed when you meet your glorious translation into the enfolded i i think thats all predecided for me ceremonial solbli yes solbli shell be taking care of all that umm you oh i shall be resplendent in all my finery septame medals gleaming chekwri said folding herself into a seat across from the septame banstegeyn had noticed that the marshal didnt ask whether she might disturb him these days or wait to be invited to sit before he might have made some frosty comment and insisted on protocols being followed but no more people were going quietly crazy in these last couple of days in fact some people were going noisily boisterously even dangerously crazy meanwhile all across the gzilt domain those who had been stored some for less than a year some for a couple of decades or more were waking up for final reunions last goodbyes leaving parties and faretheewellsinwhatcomesnext i have buffed and polished my medals for decades of steady dedicated watchfulness the marshal continued clasping her hands behind her head as she leaned back and relaxed legs crossed counted and recounted my medals for outstanding work in simulations and exercises carefully arranged my medals for heroic bravery under virtual fire and even found room for my many many medals for exemplary valour in the face of fellow officers coveting the same promotions as i she smiled at him without humour shame we havent had time to strike any medals commemorating our latest exploits jumping unarmed ships wasting our own and setting naive aliens on each other still one can have too much of a good thing eh septame and they do say theres no guilt in the sublime you seem positively energised by the whole process chekwri he looked pointedly round the room and very confident that my office isnt bugged i had my own people make quite sure of that some time ago septame chekwri said smiling while planting your own the marshals smile broadened have you always been so suspicious banstegeyn he looked at her unsmiling no i stumbled into a position of great power quite by accident chekwri grinned then shrugged our troubles will soon be over septame she said then frowned what she asked banstegeyn had just twitched and glanced to one side like hed seen something alarming from the corner of one eye the septame shook his head and bent back to his desk where he was signing documents on his desk screen nothing he muttered scrawling his signature have you only come to discuss matters of ceremonial attire or is there some actual point to this visit chekwri stood walked to the window overlooking the stepped gardens and the city beyond the curve of river my i do believe some people have started fires she said i thought that wasnt our style she looked back at banstegeyn one lot of aliens is about to trash another the mighty empiricist no less has signalled the miscreants telling them to play nicely but the rumour is its being ignored i just wanted to be sure you were happy that we let things be and allow what might happen to happen this is not to say that theyd take any notice of us either but in theory we might threaten to withdraw scavenger cooperation this has been suggested by whom media culture one or two politicos thered be more but of course everybodys distracted youre the brave space marshal what would your advice be id be indifferent doesnt affect us save for the fact that our returned bad boy and what sounds like its entire marine force are just about to tangle with a culture ship out at xown that could get messy might require extraneous distractions to keep people from concerning themselves with it she crossed her arms intelligence has crunched some more numbers and now thinks that particular sideshow might all turn on this absurdly old culture guy and cossont the girl who survived fzanjuym and the fracas at bokri i think we take no chances and continue to let our assets around the girdlecity do whatevers needed does that sound yes yes it does do whatevers needed the septame said not looking up is that all he asked lot of signing required winding up an entire civilisation and the president was only too happy to delegate to his trimes and septames then ive got the joy of backtoback receptions for a variety of newly arrived aliens and recently destored selfimportant political nonentities to attend you should just tell them to fuck off chekwri said cheerfully go for a walk get laid start a fire she headed for the door why not the door closed leaving him alone he brought his head up gazing at the closed door for a moment then his eyes flicked to one side for an instant he made a small keening noise and bent quickly back to his task the nib of the stylo scratching drily at the desk screen salvage and reprocessing team principal nyxandabo tyun i have that honour and you tyun had been called back to the bridge from his private cabin half an hour early it appeared the culture ship wanted to talk and was falling back towards them leaving the ronte fleet to crawl on without it tyun watched the representation of the situation on a giant screen stretching right across the forward part of the bridge i am the culture ship beats working the voice said in perfect unaccented liseiden formal sir tyuns combat officer broke in a contact registering less than ten metres in length and flagging as an unarmed civilian personnel craft has left the culture ship divergent course peeling away slung and slowing tyun could see the tiny trace curving away from the approaching culture ship a thread from a speck could it be a warhead he asked technically possible sir the combat officer said something improvised big though for such a small craft theyre not supposed to carry any weapons anywhere near deploy an hrmp to track it slow approach keep the platform between the new contact and us heavy remote missile platform launched sir launch authority for the missiles what would you recommend officer zero automaticity sir our direct positive command that then team principal the culture ship said tyun clicked back to speak to the culture ship again yes i take it youve noticed that i have despatched my human crew in a small shuttle craft their identities and the crafts course are appended they and the shuttle are entirely unarmed why are your crew abandoning ship i asked them to and advised them that they ought to why would that be in case there are any hostilities why should there be any hostilities i believe you mean some harm to the ronte not at all you presume too much i might as well assume that you mean harm to me and my ships because you have loosed what for all i know might be a warhead disguised as a shuttle the shuttle craft is drawing further away from you all the time and its course is set also it is demonstrably unarmed seven minutes until the culture ships in range sir the combat officer told him are we in range of it yet tyun asked he checked the magnification the screen was using shown as a logarithmically scaled bar on one side shouldnt be sir not a scree class theyre almost unarmed and you tyun asked clicking back to talk to the culture ship are you unarmed machine and what are your intentions i have only very limited military capability my intention is to prevent you engaging with the ronte ships ahead of you what makes you think we wish to engage with them you are pursuing them hmm i would not care to define it as such we are merely following them you have targeted them we have illuminated them the better to track their progress this is not fully plausible i believe you mean them harm not at all we may ask them to heave to and submit to our inspection we are entitled to do so under the terms of our agreement with the gzilt as long as the ronte or any unauthorised military or semimilitary forces are in gzilt space which they are of course you know the ronte will never permit such a thing thats their problem certainly they have proved treacherous in the past and gone back on their agreements with us so we are unable sadly to take their word regarding any questions we may have for them regarding cargo weaponry and intentions as i say our initial approach will be entirely nonviolent simply requesting them to halt and cooperate such an approach virtually guarantees there will be conflict i believe you know this i know no such thing ship i am acting within my rights according to the recently signed agreement between the liseiden people and the gzilt an agreement which rescinds and cancels any previous agreements your clients might have thought theyd inveigled the gzilt into signing with them and i wonder that a culture ship appears so determined to ally itself with those barbaric ruffians the ronte i wonder are we suffering from a degree of guilt at having enabled your ronte friends to encroach so far into gzilt space if so ship i understand that you might feel some shame some wounded pride but our contention at this time is not with you if it is with anyone it is with them i must ask you to break off what is beginning to look like an attack run on our far superior force before we are compelled to take defensive action which may im afraid to say include interception munitions i intend to continue on my present course team principal on the giant screen the culture ship looked very close now tyun clicked out navigation prepare to split the squadron in two three right three left to half a light second apart on my order well let the culture ship go straight through the gap between all ships target and prepare to fire on any hostile action from the culture ship we can afford to ignore the ronte for a short while yes maybe five minutes on present velocities his navigation officer said fine then make good those orders and to be clear only fire on actual overt hostile action from the culture ship not just targeting we all got that sir targeting the combat officer said split the fleet tyun ordered he could hear and feel the ship around him hauling itself away from its earlier straight course starting to curve to one side along with two of the other ships on the screen the view swung keeping the approaching ronte fleet at one edge as the elongated dot that was the beats working swept past between the separated halves of the liseiden squadron fleet split as prescribed the navigation officer reported culture ship maintaining correction target slowing rapidly target now stopped relative to us accelerating catching up level with us in four seconds the screen view swung slowly keeping the smeared dot of the culture ship at one edge the view hazed oddly as though they were running through a gas cloud sir the quiatreaanang reports total loss of engine control sir the abalulesheliz reports total loss of power what he had two junior officers from fleet control talking to him at once the main screen hazed grey then blanked out entirely what the fuck tyun said glancing at the display in his own helmet the helmet display was still working but seemed to be having trouble locking on to his eyes to present a true holo image a stray flash briefly dazzled him main screen in shutdown the damage control officer said sounding puzzled cause unknown the screen flashed shivered woozily went blank again the damage control officer broke in effector attack on us targeting engine control and main sensors sir the quiatreaanang reports total traction loss culture ship level with us now sir starting to draw ahead its not changing sir the quiatreaanang reports total sensor loss engineering telemetry down sir the laskuilhliz reports total loss of power velocity were slowing fleet formation breaking up sir the abalulesheliz reports its being targeted by the quiatreaanangs target illumination systems what our engines beginning stepped disengagement on false telemetry sir trying to head them off and reinitialise but they keep tyun could hear and feel something alter in the ship a single great deep note was deepening still further like something winding down while a forward drag stirred microcurrents into the waters around him sir the abalulesheliz reports its being targeted by our own tis thats shit the junior combattargeting officer said voice shaking thats just shit not true sir this is an attack tyun said this is hostile action fire to disable hard small target sir doubt we can be that accurate well just hit it sir the fulanyaguang reports total loss of engine telemetry no weapon control all weapons aboard shutting to failsafe mode active systems powering down hit it with something disable it destroy it i dont care nothing to throw at it sir sir the quiatreaanang reports total weapon control loss sir the culture ship is within quick strike range of the missile platform launched earlier might not have spotted it can the platform fire have we comms with it yes sir sir the fulanyaguang reports total loss of main power well fire it sir how many everything all the missiles six missiles firing the combat officer said four sec one missile gone two destruct three four gone five five gone shit we we hit it last one got it holy fuck we got it sir the fuckers dust we got it we fucking got it order on the bridge tyun said sir engine telemetry reestablished the damage control officer reported the main screen went into startup mode checking itself out with quick darting blocks of colour and sudden scrolls of text and logos gone too quickly to read sir all other ships reporting all controls and telemetry returning to normalcy the main screen came alive it showed a view on medium magnification looking twenty degrees astern at one edge of a small cloud of expanding radiative debris dotted alongside leading away into the darkness were five even smaller clouds ronte fleet ahead sir within range theyre targeting aggressively tyun tore his gaze away from the puff of slowly cooling debris falling further away into the night behind them he switched his attention to the ronte fleet as the screen view swung back round the ronte ships were close now they had started moving around in one of their odd foreverchanging patterns as though unsure what formation to fly in not that that would make any difference to the targeting ais it was even quite pretty in a pathetic sort of way tyun collected himself send the hail sent sir all systems aboard at prime sir minimal radiation damage to rear sensors all ships at prime sir confirm that sir back to full battleready state zero damage all ships positive locks on all twelve ronte ships sir ronte reply in sir and obscene sir absolute noncompliance tyun looked at the message on his now properly functioning inhelmet display it was indeed obscene almost inventively so the ronte must have been doing their homework on liseiden physiology salvage and reprocessing team principal nyxandabo tyun floated back a little in his command bubble he checked the distance and the time to vatrelles system or to any other known ships nothing around for light days they had hours to play with officers we are going to fire to disable targeting their engines historically they dont disable too well sir the combat officer said yes they tend to explode i know tyun said let their high command regard whats going to follow as an incentive to improve their engine design all combat officers sir was said in chorus concentrate all fire full squadron flagship combat officer coordinating he commanded pick them off one at a time nearest at all times unless they turn and attack they probably will then each ship to deal with the most immediate threat to it the flagship will resend the hail to stop and submit to inspection to all remaining ronte vessels after each successful engagement begin the first ronte ship became an expanding flower of plasma within a minute the ronte employed better tactics than had been anticipated and each subsequent ship took a little longer to destroy than the one before nevertheless the whole engagement lasted less than a third of an hour the fulanyaguang was lost with all hands when what was left of the last ronte ship believed to be the fleet flagship rammed it this last development was tyun felt secretly almost a relief to overwhelm an inferior fleet with no losses at all made it look like a dishonourably unequal contest almost a massacre losing a ship made everything look a lot better and would give him an opportunity to sound grave and caring for the dead and their loved ones when he wrote his memoirs besting a suicidal culture ship gone native even if it was just a contact

xgsv empiricist indeed i think no immediate action need or should be taken against the liseiden our longterm disapproval and the implications that this will have for their reputation might prove most

meanwhile on xown reality calling mistake not yes were talking about you xue mistake not yes hi its all getting terribly interesting colonel maam agansu replied the signaladjunct protocols indicated he was addressing marshal chekwri this is marshal chekwri i am aware an honour your current status i am walking alongside the airship equatorial awaiting confirmation from the churkun regarding the disposition of its forces and that of the other side media reports indicate that those in charge of the airship have undertaken to open the vessel to the public sometime in the next few minutes i intend to board then or before should we find our adversaries are already aboard permit me awareness through your own senses of course the sensation of manipulating aspects of his sensorium was a new one for agansu and yet one which felt perfectly natural he briefly marvelled at all the thought and careful design that must have gone into making it seem routine for something like himself something which felt like a human to delve into what was basically its own being and adjust the settings it found there so that a live link of what it was experiencing through its senses was now being sent to another person at the same time agansu was becoming aware of how many differences there were between his own biological body and this one with the possible exception of being considerably heavier than the bio version despite being precisely the same volume all the differences were positive how much more powerful capable and sophisticated this new form was how much more sensitive where it needed to be his own biobody held many augmentations and desirable amendments over the humanbasic standard yet in this new one for example he could see in much greater detail and over a far greater spread of the electromagnetic spectrum than the old version was able to yet how much less vulnerable it was where it didnt require such sensitivity this android body felt no pain at all ones motivation for avoiding harm was knowing that harm reduced ones ability to function while the indication that harm had been inflicted was no more than that a sign something to be noted taken into account and acted upon but no more thank you the marshal sent there had been almost no delay between him agreeing to let the marshal see through his eyes and generally sense through his senses him setting this up and her beginning to receive the data and yet he had had time to take a look round inside himself as it were and start to appreciate all the differences between his biobody and this one and then to think about all this all before the marshal had thanked him agansu marvelled at how little time it had all taken his bioself would hardly have had time for one completed thought in that halfsecond or so right colonel the marshal sent we think the culture people are trying to get to this ximenyr guy because of something he has or something he knows about this qiria person you have to stop them that done you get ximenyr find out what he has or knows you may be as brusque as you like i understand maam agansu sent as he looked about the crowds of chanting singing dancing people and gaudily painted bannered and holod machines keeping pace with the giant airship sounds loud colonel yes maam he was aware of many different sound streams around him principally dance music emanating from the various vehicles around him on the broad balcony roadway more seemed to be joining the throng all the time kind of crowded there too a burst of fireworks lit up the openwork tunnel around the nose of the equatorial some set of automatic reactions built into the android he inhabited seemed to be reacting to the fireworks clenching instinctively as it witnessed nearby mortars firing nearby mortars which were not flagged as friendly and their payloads unguided highly inaccurately aimed payloads detonating bursts of light were followed by booms thuds and crackles a few echoes came back but most of the sound was swallowed by the huge spaces of the girdlecity and absorbed within the surrounding patchwork of musics knowing the speed of sound in xowns atmosphere and the altitude here he was able to tell exactly how far away he was from each exploding mortar shell yes it is maam quite crowded uhhuh you know if anything serious does kick off there colonel you will need to limit civilian casualties as far as possible i am aware of that maam agansu sent thinking how typical and shameful it was that a superior tried to cover themselves against any unfortunate outcome by restating something that was already entirely and properly covered in ambient standing orders and by military rules of engagement at the same time if he failed to do as he was required to do by those same superiors because anxious to avoid collateral civilian damage he pulled back from using the most destructive weaponry he might have been able to deploy hed be blamed for that too he had thanks to her reputation thought better of marshal chekwri but obviously hed been wrong to think her any different marshal colonel the churkuns captain sent further on the current situation we intercepted and redislocd a relatively massive displace by the culture vessel and captured what is probably its principal auxiliary craft however it was unoccupied and unarmed and probably constituted a diversion a number of further displaces occurred almost immediately thereafter centred on the volume immediately around the airship but we were unable to intercept or disrupt them neither are we able to pin down their destinations further we are confident they are not actually inside the ship due to the fourdimensional aspect of its construction it is effectively shielded against disloc this means that the other side must achieve entry to the airship by conventional means as we have had sensors watching the craft for some time and discerned no suspicious activity we are confident that this has not thus far been achieved further the full force of all four of this ships marine platoons are now available for disloc at instant notice on the colonels order i see captain agansu sent he might have said more but there would be time later for pinning down the responsibility for the churkun being unable to do more regarding the culture ships displaces now was not the time for that so our adversaries are here but we dont know where indeed colonel in that case i suggest that you bring in all the marine arbite platoons immediately place some ahead of the ship some behind say half a platoon in each position but most in a couple of concentric shells of arbites entirely surrounding the vessel keeping within tens out to a hundred metres of it but distributed within the structure with only a squadlevel force stationed on the outside of the girdlecity order all of them to keep pace with the airship have them stealthed as far as possible or camod to resemble camera drones or other civilian devices at that moment a woman danced out of the crowd of people around him and started trying to get him to dance with her he shook his head and drew back his hands as she tried to grab them she persisted trying to again get hold of his hands so he turned quickly and walked off towards the wire parapet at the edge of the roadway pushing between a couple of people apologising as he went suggest we stagger their arrival colonel the churkuns captain sent or itll be kind of obvious popping in that many youre liable to hear them as well as maybe see them a second or two between each arrival ought to be okay if you think so captain agansu replied as another flicker of mortar fire presaged yet more smokey lowexplosive detonations in the tunnel ahead of the airship captain marshal chekwri sent might i suggest you time more intense disloc bursts to coincide with barrages of fireworks good idea maam seconds later agansu heard a series of additional dulled crackles sounding all around him just as the next fusillade of fireworks detonated he looked around and saw a couple more of what looked like mediacam platforms than had been there before a few hazy disturbances in the air high over and ahead of the airship easily missable by the normal human eye were probably the marine arbites too camouflaged he called up confirmation immediately a picture began to build up inside his mind a schematic of the girdlecity around him showing the tube that the airship equatorial moved through at its centre and all the structure around it along with the positions of all the arbite marines popping into existence all that was missing from the picture was any sign of where his adversaries might be okay marshal chekwri sent im at a reception with stuff that needs to be done ill check in later but let me know if anything dramatic happens captain colonel you are fucking joking me were where were in the stern ventral waste disposal semisolids holding tank berdle said through the suit his voice in her ears sounded perfectly unconcerned she couldnt see him she couldnt see anything basically or touch anything solid cossont was aware of floating in something thick and warm in complete darkness at normal wavelengths her augmented eyes working in unison with the combat suits sensors were happy to relay the fact that the stuff she was surrounded by and floating within was just a little beneath normal gzilt body core temperature you have literally landed us in the fucking shit she said trying not to sound panicked not being able to touch see or really sense anything very much was she told herself worse than knowing what she was submerged within its ideal berdle told her this bit of the airships not shielded with d because i imagine it gets emptied rather than recycled very oldfashioned anyway it means we were able to blat right in of course its well sensoredup to look out for this sort of intrusion but the clever bit was displacing out an exactly similar volume just before dropping us in dont think we troubled the header tank or the relief valves at all or caused any blowback anywhere for that matter that might have been really messy thank goodness for that but in other business how the fuck do we get out very easily back to that later but heres another one how the fuck do we get clean also very easily im switching you to sonar follow me swim cossont suddenly had a view to look at it was like a drawing rather than a proper picture everything was white with fuzzy blue lines delineating edges and a sort of background green wash indicating surfaces she could thankfully see nothing of what actually surrounded her but she could see a suited streamlined version of berdle a couple of metres away turning away from her to swim towards the top of the large cylindrical tank they were in beneath and to the side there were hints of tapered supports holding the tank with further structure sketched in above and below showing where the decks were these vanished into the distance cossont twisted began to swim after berdle she could feel her hands and limbs contacting semisolids as she swam it was like swimming through thick soup she tried not to think about it she was doing okay until she remembered the last time she and berdle had been here on the airship when they had been met by the strange person with the bowlofsoup face suddenly she nearly threw up would have thrown up but something inside her seemed to intervene at the last moment hey calm berdle said easily as he arrived at the top of the tank youre triggering the suits medical unit he reached out to something on the undersurface that formed the ceiling you be calm she told the avatar im swimming through shit here youre a fucking android but this stuff is personal to us biologicals fair enough but out in a trice berdle said both hands on a circular structure that cossont sincerely hoped was a hatch one more sensor to fool done and a couple of little expander spheres to emplace to take up our volume when we get out there his arms twirled the circular object swung up and away hinging she reached a surface shed not even been aware was there her top set of arms and her head suddenly in air or at least gas she was half a metre below the opened hatch berdle pulled himself up through it as easily as though they were in zerog beside cossont as berdle exited the tank a tiny floating sphere expanded smoothly to over a metre in diameter pressing against the surface of the tank and then down into the liquid then a hand came down and pulled her up though the suit made it feel like there was no weight or effort involved anyway having four arms probably helped too once she was on her feet the view switched conventional sight again she was standing under a low dark ceiling on a dimly lit gantry facing berdle a spotless conventionally clothed berdle across a sidehinged hatchway at their feet she looked down her suit was also spotless though it had gone back to looking like it was made of liquid mirror and soot again she heard a tiny plopping noise in the tank beneath and then the suit snapped back to impersonating a normalenoughlooking pants and jacket combo oh she said as berdle lowered the hatch closed with his foot her voice sounded just as it had in the tank which meant slightly odd the suits helmet unit was still covering her face this doubtless explained why she was being spared any smells she might not have cared for and why she was still listening to her own voice as relayed through the suits earbuds berdle nodded there you are clean he said happy now though that was weird too because his mouth didnt move as she heard him say this ecstatic thanks welcome suitsurface nanofields vyr the avatar said turning and walking away from her towards a low doorway at the far end of the gantry where it met a bulkhead zero friction unsticky she heard him say he shook his head really yeah cossont said following him hey i dont want to disturb you but you were just starting to sound a bit dismissive there berdle was bent down poking seemingly randomly at the area around the mechanical handle on the door as though expecting to find a fingersized keyhole sorry she joined him at the door do you think theres any field or area where i could make you feel small and a bit slow compared to me berdle ever the avatar kept poking at the door with his finger well of course not he said patiently his mouth still not moving im not a person vyr im the walking talking figurehead of a ship he squatted staring at the door a culture ship he added sticking his finger out and poking again a culture ship he muttered of some intellectual distinction and martial wherewithal moreover his finger seemed to slip into the surface of the door as though it or his finger was a hologram berdle withdrew his finger and stood up something clicked and the door swung open towards them me first he said conversationally there was a pause oh berdle said they really have changed the place well weve changed the place a bit ximenyr said walking in front of the reporter arbite with its camera eyes he was granting an exclusive interview letting just one media representative in initially before the airship was opened up to everybody else the last eight days have been very busy with restructuring quite radical restructuring involving pretty much everybody on board which has been one reason for keeping people away though mostly its just to make it a more exciting reveal he smiled at the arbite ximenyr was dressed in a plain white shift five of his fellow partygoers similarly clad accompanied him and the arbite along the dark broad gently downwardcurving corridor many of us have been doing our own personal restructuring too he said ximenyr waved one hand i had all sorts of weird shit going on with my body but ive brought myself back to something much more standard much more pure even do you regret your early excesses the arbite asked it was taking instructions from a panel of biojournalists spread across xown and beyond an ai was collating their queries and producing representative questions oh no ximenyr said looking almost serious one should never regret ones excesses only ones failures of nerve is it true your body was covered in over a hundred penises no i think the most i ever had was about sixty but that was slightly too many i settled on fiftythree as the maximum even then it was very difficult maintaining an erection in all of them at the same time even with four hearts and most of them had to remain dry or produce only well sort of sweatgland quantities of ejaculate though it was very nice ejaculate sort of slightly oily perfume and not in the least icky unless you thought about it of course do you feel you are a more serious artist now no i have claimed to be an artist in the past but really all ive ever been is a sort of glorified surgeon i would like to think ive been artistic at times and shown artistic flare and so on but i think that especially now that were nearly at the end of things its all right to abandon claims and pretensions and just relax a bit maybe ive inspired artistry and artisticness in others thatd be a happy assessment what is the greatest number of people youve had sex with at the same time about fortyfour fortyfive fortysix it was hard to be sure in the heat of the moment we tried to get to the maximum of fiftythree obviously but even in effective zerog all oiled up and most people just sticking their hands in from the outside of this heaving mass of bodies we just couldnt make it too close together and also frankly i think some people got too excited and interested in each other rather than going for this record with me you know still it was a lot of fun trying on the other hand it was an effort too you know so much preparation and setup and planning and briefing sex should be about spontaneous fun dont you think anyway here we are their little party had arrived at the bottom of the gently bowed corridor where it briefly levelled out and then started to rise again heading aft a small crowd of people mostly dressed in plain white shifts like the one ximenyr wore so that they looked vaguely like they belonged to a religious order were busy gathering up pieces of complicatedlooking equipment and wrapping foam and loading everything onto a series of little flattopped wheeled vehicles one fully loaded was making its own way up the slope beyond just about to disappear under the curve of ceiling directly above where ximenyr his followers and the reporter arbite now stood there was a wide newlooking circular staircase leading up to a cakesliceshaped hole in the ceiling where there was darkness punctured by a few tiny lights come on up ximenyr said leading the way he started ascending the fan of stairway followed by the arbite and the five people whod accompanied them lights please and enhance ximenyr said as he walked out into the space above the reporter arbite arrived looked up the space above was a single enormous space which almost filled the remainder of the airship right to the top it was mostly dark but lit by thousands of small lights pointing inwards at a vast hazy cylindrical space perhaps five hundred metres long and four hundred metres across what looked like a small globular galaxy lay directly overhead shining the way the light moved within the space overhead suggested that it was full of water or some sort of transparent liquid the space immediately round the stairhead held stacks and racks of lockers and shelves beyond shadows hid any walls for all its obvious extent the low ceiling the darkness and the sensation of a great mass hanging immediately above made the place feel oddly oppressive right in front of them there was one of six small translucent spheres each about three metres in diameter all arranged around the very bottom of the vast container above and looking like hopelessly inadequate supports for its bulk the dark walls around the vast lit space showed no other form of support just the tiny floodlights now were playing around with image a bit here ximenyr said reaching up and patting the surface of one of the small translucent spheres because you couldnt see through that much of even the purest water but this is a sortoftrue representation of what youd see if the water wasnt there so the arbite said what is this this is a giant water pool you climb up those steps get naked stick one of these breathers in your gob ximenyr picked up a stubby tube from one of the nearby shelves and waved it in front of his mouth pass through one of these spheres and then float up to the bright lights up there at the top thats the ultimate party area thats like heaven like our own little minisubliming i mean its just the usual stuff up there comfy furniture drink drugs and lots of images and music and dancing and fucking youd imagine but all a bit more quiet and contemplative i guess and all under this lovely clear dome under the top of the ship and the whole point is this is the only way to get there and once youre there theres no way out but it doesnt matter because then comes the subliming ximenyr grinned at the arbites camera eyes this was my plan from the start of the last party and my original idea was to spend a year or years sort of milking myself for the fluids to go in here but that proved impractical water it is perfumed water he winked at the arbites eye cameras fucking typical man cossont muttered you know what hes done in that water dont you yes but its art berdle said looking serious he and cossont were holed up behind some lightweight furniture in a disused storage space one deck below the curving corridor ximenyr and the reporter arbite had just walked down they were watching the arbites feed along with whoknewhowmany people across xown and the gzilt domain there was no shortage of fascinating screen to watch from all over the gzilt hegemony in these enddays for those with time to spare from their own preparations for the subliming but the last party had achieved a modest level of fame over the years and allegedly many millions of people were watching lovely warm perfumed water ximenyr was saying dosed with cutaneouscontacthallucinogens so itll be quite a crazy ride just getting to the top and you cant just float straight up either there are baffles so its more of a d maze really so is this symbolic of our struggle towards enlightenment or a comment on our tortuous route to subliming ximenyr shrugged yeah if you like i just thought itd be neat what about pressure ximenyr snapped his fingers good question you know i didnt think of that at first either just not of a practical or engineering turn of mind i guess but its much smarter than that there are field projectors and ag units studded all around the cylinder there are all these exotic matter particles or something dissolved into the water whatever dont ask me the technical details and you pass through these levels of pressure he slapped the tautsounding surface of the nearest small sphere again the pressure is highest down here but its only like being about eight metres down not four hundred so ximenyr anyone may join you in this anyone but not everyone well have to be selective let just a few people aboard at a time we need to balance the extra weight of people coming in with our positive buoyancy factor or something anyway theres refuse weve got stored up and longterm supplies were not going to be using all of which well be dumping gradually as we take people on so were going to have room for lots more people he looked up nodding at the circular patch of bright lights directly overhead a few brave guys and gals are already up there after doing the testing couple of panickers when it all took too long and they couldnt work out the maze but theyre fine by now and weve made it all a lot easier with cheats and guidance available he smiled dazzlingly at the arbites camera eyes should be a cool last ride thats annoying berdle said why cossont asked compared to the last tank of warm liquid we were in yes but if we have to get through that one im going to show up im too dense if i support myself with ag or even field theyll spot me cossont was squatting beside him in her doublelayer suit she had watched the feed from the arbite on a wrist screen after deciding to risk rolling down the helmet parts of both suits the air she had been pleased to discover smelled perfectly nice though somehow you could sort of tell there had been construction work going on recently too dense like too heavy she asked yes berdle looked at cossont nodding at her suit and youll be too those suits mass a lot more than they feel outer one especially inner might expand enough though you might look a bit fat cossont shrugged im not my mother i dont care more to the point though did you spot that our man doesnt seem to have his necklace on any more yes the avatar nodded that could be a problem we dont even know how personal that stuff is for him cossont said might have just abandoned it left it in a bedside cabinet or something god he might have thrown it out maybe we should look back in the sewage tank berdle suggested cossont looked at him the avatar shrugged just kidding i checked it out as a matter of course when we were in there nothing maybe its up at his bedroom suite where we were when we saw him before cossont suggested thats not there any more berdle said ive found the remodelling plans in one of the airships data banks such as they are whole volume was ripped out the avatar shook his head their internal video monitoring is so patchy there might be some record in here of what happened to all that stuff but found it ah is that a good ah cossont asked partially berdle told her all his personal effects are more or less where they were in some sort of chest or locker yes a big sort of upright wheeled chest thing in this heaven space at the top of the giant liquid tank think mr qs missing bits are there maybe ximenyrs had a temporary cabin near the main medical suite for the last eight days berdle reported still quizzing the airships systems probably having all his extra cocks removed cossont muttered berdle shook his head very suspicious ais on this thing i am having to do so much trackcoveringup as i go along here yes he had a locker or something of some sort there too going to check that first cossont started to stand up but he pulled her back down again ive an insectile on that particular job if theyre not there think well have to swim through the big tank perhaps cant we just come in from the top no its all shielded it looks transparent up there like a big glass dome but it isnt its a twoway screen metres thick once the ships back in about twelve minutes we have the option of blasting the shielding out of the way and displacing in but thats a last resort wasting d without causing horrendous collateral in the associate flatspace is almost impossible in d you think all youve done is kick down a door and imagine youve done it really neatly minimum force but then you look back into d and realise youve blown down the whole building sometimes the whole block twelve minutes till the ships back just under though how easy the gzilt battleship will make it for me to do anything as delicate as targeting bits of d shielding in the first place is very much open to question is there going to be a fight yeah could be berdle said there goes our boy he added cossont switched her wrist screen on again to see ximenyr placing his white shift on a shelf and then walking into a vaginallooking vertical aperture in one of the translucent spheres a breather tube gripped in his mouth he was quite naked only one penis as far as cossont could see and he didnt seem to have anything else with him that might have contained the pair of eyes some sort of double liquidlock had allowed ximenyr to enter the sphere without any fluid spilling there was a pause while he stood and fluid swirled up around him then a sphincter valve at the top of the sphere opened and he rose quickly and easily up out of the sphere and into the liquidfilled tank above and so the reporter arbite began to intone gravely cossont switched the sound off and just watched ximenyrs palelooking body as he swam out at an angle into the darkness the extra lights hed asked for earlier or the enhancement had been switched off so his shape disappeared into the watery shadows after barely half a minute the vast tank was now an almost entirely dark megatonne presence hanging over the scene below the view switched to the other partygoers taking off their own shifts and preparing to step naked into the translucent spheres to follow ximenyr the locker in the medical suites got nothing berdle said quietly shaking his head can i see she asked need a helmet to see properly the avatar told her use the inner suit she brought the hoodhelmet up the view darkened stabilised a space like a small dark room one wall edged all round with dim light quilts on the floor a small rug rolled and a couple of ancientlooking flat screens a pair of pants berdle announced a single sock the end of a roll of antiseptic splintbandage patches a tooth plectrum a pair of timeto devices thats all sure this isnt art too fairly certain were going to have to go up through that fucking tank arent we looking like it cossont redirected her attention to local reality in time to watch berdle stand and then saw what looked like his skin and flesh just falling away under his clothes exactly as if his flesh had turned to jelly she felt her mouth open had time to wonder if they were under attack from some sort of fleshmelting weapon then noticed that the avatar was watching this whole process with nothing more than interest shedding excess weight berdle said through her helmet he stood in a neatly circular pool of fleshy stuff reduced to something not far off a skeleton though one with what still looked like a covering of skin clothes hanging off him face like a skull his knees the widest part of his legs and his elbows the widest part of his arms above his wirethin wrists wrinkled skin covering all exposed surfaces then he filled slowly out again as though his stillskincovered bones or what passed for bones were themselves expanding his skin became smooth again his face filled out then his clothes fell away too joining the thick puddle at his feet all of which turned white and developed folds the avatar equipped with a perfectly respectablelooking penis cossont was pleased in a general kind of way to see stooped and picked up the stuff that had recently been the equivalent of skin flesh and muscle and which was now a convincing if quite thick white robe which he let drop on from above there was another one still round his feet he lifted it with one foot handed it to her best i can do he said no no bravo youll need to lose the outer suit sorry thats okay the suit split down the front and she stepped out of it it collapsed and compressed into something that looked like a sort of flattened elongated black crash helmet we wont have to go out the same way we came in will we she asked berdle shook his head highly unlikely just the undersuit would keep you safe anyway the undersuit was changing too expanding slightly so that in most places its surface was about a centimetre or so out from her own skin it was changing colour and texture too coming to look convincingly like skin a thin layer crept over her face making her skin feel tight that feels weird yes but youre unrecognisable the avatar told her berdles face had changed too he looked nothing like he had the last time theyd been here still goodlooking but less striking cossont looked down at herself weird she said i feel more naked now than i do when im naked she pulled the thick heavy shift on over her head it lay weighty on her shoulders theres only one set of arm holes her lower arms had to hang down inside the pale shift those extra arms are the one thing about you its hard to disguise berdle said hmm she said yeah i suppose it is better if we dont advertise those take the shift off as late as you can berdle suggested okay what about mr q cossont asked she recalled the avatar telling her while theyd still been on the mistake not that qirias mindstate had been put into the outer suit ive already transferred him to the inner suit berdle told her hell run slower but feel free to wake him up and talk to him if you want hes functional maybe later cossont used one foot toeing the compacted outer suit this stays here unless we need it when it becomes a drone though itll blow its cover the instant it switches on its ag or a liftfield berdle straightened flexed looked at her ready as ill ever be lets go we are quite certain there is no way they could already be aboard colonel agansu asked the churkuns captain we are reasonably certain the captain replied not absolutely certain agansu found this reply inadequate but chose not to say anything people were cheering all around him he looked at the airship the equatorial was displaying a countdown on its hull now giant numbers three hundred metres high were clicking down the time to zero there was half a minute to go boarding gantries had swung out from various opened galleries and balconies dotted along the side of the airship where crew could be seen opening doors and preparing to extend the gantries the last few metres that would let people use them to board the gantries ended in complicatedlooking upandover constructions that let them extend over the roadway parapet agansu watched the nearest one lower slowly towards the roadway surface just ahead a crewperson from the airship stood on the bottom step of the lowering gantry holding a flimsylooking gate closed preparing to open it people were already jostling to get close to the steps agansu simply massing much more than any human of his size had no difficulty in shouldering people out of the way and making his way quickly to the front he made suitably placatory gestures and muttered excuse me several times to avoid unnecessary unpleasantness though he did hear some complaints soon he was walking at a slow stroll with the gated steps facing him and various people jostling him ineffectually at his sides and back colonel im going to hand you over to our marine operations officer now the captain sent the culture ship is returning and showing every indication it intends to pull to a stop here in about ten minutes and my full attention is required to be focused on this development i see agansu replied marine operations here colonel ive had all units looking for anything remotely like a ship avatar and so far nothings registering with this many units in a minimum doubleshell configuration weve got really good triangulation and background grain size so something ought to have shown up by now i think the person or people youre looking for isare already aboard also a closer inspection of the airship has identified a few spaces that are not fully shielded our surveillance specialist has started putting equipment in there though its not proving easy to gain access to the rest of the vessel do you want us to look for a place to disloc you aboard that will not be necessary agansu replied looking across to the giant figures displayed on the airships skin just a few seconds left he could see more galleries appearing on the side of the vessel as portions of the hull folded inwards doors were opening i am about to board now conventionally inform marshal chekwri acknowledged sir will do weve got insectplausible surveillance devices entering the apertures opening in the airship though the shielding is going to make keeping in touch with them difficult well need a lot to keep a comms chain open also im just getting some civilian feed here from the airship public channel seems this ximenyr person is heading for the top of the ship but the only way in is through some big water tank from the bottom thank you agansu sent as the countdown shown on the side of the airship reached zero a great ragged cheer went up all around and the crewperson on the steps just ahead of him opened the boarding gate agansu stepped onto the gantry feeling it dip under his weight continue to monitor me he sent and have arbites near ready to lend close support sir he smiled at the crewperson cossont was letting the shift drop from round her shoulders with berdle just behind her sheltering her the lady is modest hed told the people helping just then right at the entrance to one of the translucent spheres something happened to several of the lights shining into the giant tank one in particular off to the side flared brightly then seemed to go out entirely most of the rest kept on flickering as they dimmed everybody in the space under the tank was looking at the lights cossont forewarned by berdle was almost the only person not distracted she stepped quickly out of the fallen shift and into the glutinously resisting field protecting the entrance to the sphere warm water swirled rapidly up round her almost immediately she was raised off her feet a little as it reached her neck she lifted her head with the breather device clamped in her mouth and over her nose as the waters closed over her and the valve above opened she was borne up anyway but kicked as well catching a hazy distorted glimpse of berdle picking up her shift and walking across the space beneath her now to deposit it on a shelf the lights seemed to return to normal as the view below disappeared the maze is fairly simple berdle said through the suits earbuds as she bumped headfirst into what felt like a ceiling of something elastic and giving but strong the suit will tell you the direction to head in using this voice for now turn ninety degrees to your left follow the ceiling until you feel a downward current and then swim to your right she did as she was told she could see a couple of other people exiting from other spheres and striking out into the darkness shadowy forms moving slowly in the darkness like smooth and liquid flames of flesh she kept her lower set of arms tight against her body as she swam with the upper set until the other people had faded into the darkness taking different routes then she pulled hard with all four arms and kicked she felt a current heading down and so turned right straight up now the voice said and she zoomed passing into a strange gellike region in the water where it seemed to grow thicker and press in against her from all sides through it she felt the water pressure change a little decreasing the temperature was a little cooler too just entering the tank now berdle told her keep going ill stay behind you prevented from speaking by the breather in her mouth and unable to just thinksend speech the way the avatar could she found herself nodding and wondered if the suit would transmit the action to berdle she swam on up through the darkness alone save for the sound of her own breathing and a few dim wavering lights firearms are not permitted on board sir the crewperson told agansu were showing that you have a sidearm secreted by your lower back that will have to be left here with us he had been stopped at the far end of the boarding gantry on a sort of gallery set into the side of the airship two people both large and dressed in standardlooking private security garb barred his way the woman who was talking was in front her male colleague behind standing in the open doorway in the hull of the equatorial i am a colonel in the home system regiment on a special assignment agansu said quietly to the woman aware of people starting to queue up behind him on the narrow gantry i appreciate and commend your alertness however i do require entry to the vessel and i may well have need of my sidearm marine operations officer agansu sent are you reading all this yes sir kindly bring one of your units to bear here would you prepare to stun to temporary unconsciousness the two people blocking my way ten minutes should be sufficient and have four units ready to accompany me inside the vessel sir using ag inside the vessel is likely to make the units obvious to the airships systems have them switch to limbed locomotion on entry sir five units switched to your immediate control now i have them agansu confirmed aware in a virtual space behind his eyes of exactly where the five marine arbites were in relation to him and his immediate surroundings im afraid our orders make no allowance for that sir the security officer was telling him sir the marine operations officer sent getting some data on a person of interest the cossont vyr woman entering the water tank in the airship sir not a definite id though small bug a distance off and comms link unsteady hey somebody shouted in the queue behind agansu get moving the security officer glanced behind him then frowned at him also sir she said im just hearing from our colleagues on board that you are showing as very nonstandard physiologically there is a new policy in force aboard which means that if youre an android or avatar you will need special permission to board the man behind her had stepped back a pace and one hand had fallen to a holstered sidearm stun both now sir the womans eyes closed she collapsed her knees giving way first so that she just seemed to sit heavily then she fell over backwards the man behind performed the same actions a halfsecond later as though in impersonation agansu stepped over the two inert bodies and into the doorway two marine arbites visible more as disturbances in the air than as anything physical darted in before him they landed on the threshold with audible thumps the air shimmering as they entered whoa hey what voices said inside stun agansu sent as he looked within two more bodies were folding into unconsciousness a couple of metres inside the door agansu turned and looked back at the faces of the people crowding the boarding gantry they were all looking either at the two fallen security guards outside or at him he smiled the other two arbites made shimmering shapes in the air and landed in the doorway slipping inside like shadows only half seen close and lock the door he said over the channel to the arbite marines the door swung to then made clunking locking noises the space he was in now was perhaps twenty metres long but only five deep various fixtures and fittings none of them relevant save that there seemed to be a large number of white tabards or shifts neatly wrapped and stacked another open doorway led into the rest of the ship show yourselves please agansu said over the marines channel the four marine arbites dropped their camouflage revealing them as stocky metallic vaguely humanoid shapes crouched on pairs of zigzag legs each looked like something crayoned by a child then rendered in gunmetal their heads were long flat featureless you will be arbites one through four from lowest to highest serial number agansu told them understood understood the arbites said in unison they even sounded metallic she swam up through the layers and corridors of dark warm water the suit spoke to her in berdles voice now and again directing her or berdle spoke to her it was hard to tell she looked about as she swam and noticed that some of the tiny dim lights visible through the fluid had been arranged so as to look like the most familiar constellations visible from xown this made the experience like swimming through space she wondered if the avatar would feel this she saw only one other person briefly some distance off and below she and berdle had joined the unhurried groups of people heading towards the access spheres from the rest of the airship near the start of the whole process fewer than fifty people had preceded them into the giant tank most of the last partygoers would ascend before anybody from outside though a few would hold back to help guide any stragglers and there were some who just wanted to be last or amongst the last to make the journey the other person swam off away from her and disappeared she felt oddly abandoned almost sad she hoped the other swimmer would make it to the top of the tank without incident there were berdle had assured her various viable routes to the top of the tank she and the avatar were taking the shortest and quickest the skincontact hallucinogens in the water were diluted to deliver a modest dose to somebody swimming completely naked so they were having no discernible effect on her at all still there was a dreaminess and unreality to the dark swim that along with the relative simplicity of only having to think to the extent of following an instruction every half minute or so and the pleasant glow of continuous but unstressed physical effort allowed her mind to wander allowed her to think what a strange way to be approaching the end of ones life she thought swimming through a vast tank of water and scribeknewwhat towards a little artificial heaven with no escape or only one in search of a mans discarded eyes with the avatar of a culture ship following swimming and one of her own peoples ships seemingly intent on stopping them she had done a few strange things in her life she supposed why not leave one of the weirdest of all till last to be topped only by the subliming itself she guessed her breathing went on like something apart from her the whole soundscape to her steady paced exertion save that the silence was entire and she had started to understand something of qirias slowbuilding obsession with immersion both literal and in sound especially in sound in the waves of compression that took and flowed through the body rather than like light like sight stopping at the surface she had done something similar in a minor key herself she realised every time she stepped into the hollowness of the elevenstring and let that resound around her through her she became slowly aware that looking straight up there was a sort of sparkling grey haze ahead of her spreading to all sides lights lots of tiny lights they started to grow brighter everywhere overhead not far now berdles voice said mmm she heard herself say mouth still clamped round the breather theres one last turn to your left as it is at present then straight up berdle said through the earbuds take it easy there okay slow down ill catch up and we can surface together she said mmm again and nodded she wondered why as an avatar berdle couldnt just power his way up to join her but maybe he was so weakened after having to lose so much mass this wasnt possible or he just wanted to keep looking plausibly human the spread of lights was close enough now for her to see the hints of some sort of framework stretched across the whole expanse above her she thought she could see somebody walking along some sort of pierced walkway five metres or so overhead the two ships faced each other the gzilt ship displayed as what it truly looked like inside its nest of fields a steely clutch of blades like a hundred fat broadswords compressed into a barbed and jagged arrowhead the culture vessel projected no image beyond the surface view of its outermost fields they were absurdly close by the normal standards of conflict at their technological level which was generally carried out from realspace light seconds away at least to be squaring up to an opponent from just a few kilometres off was pretty preposterous both ships could extend their field enclosures well beyond this distance it was a statement of relatively peaceful intent in a way fullscale conflict was obviously not intended by either or one of them would long since have opened fire by now but worrying at the same time given that both vessels knew their missions and intentions were incompatible relative to xown the gzilt ship had remained almost perfectly stationary throughout parked in real space directly above the girdlecity moving at the same slow strolling speed as the equatorial five hundred kilometres below the churkun watched the culture ship draw to a stop relative to it still entirely in hyperspace it was a minor feat of field management to be able to do this so far into the gravity well of a planet but then according to the intelligence the churkun had received via marshal chekwri this vessel the mistake not a culture ship of slightly worrying indeterminate class had proved itself something of an adept at this sort of thing at bokri the churkun was keeled into hyperspace its field enclosure bulging into the fourth dimension like somebody pressing an empty bowl brimdeep into a bath this let it keep its options open and certainly it was able to watch everything that was happening there but staying in the real meant it could react faster to anything happening in the girdlecity without having to worry about dislocs being intercepted the crew of the gzilt ship were gauging what they could of their potential adversary which expressed within hyperspace as the usual gauzylooking silvery ellipsoid its current field enclosure topography guaranteed certain physical maxima and strongly indicated some likely limitations so it was certainly categorically no more than five kilometres in length and a third of that in diameter and if it followed conventional culture field disposition genuinely physically likely to be about twelve hundred metres long and maybe four hundred in diameter this would make the vessel about fifty per cent smaller by volume than the churkun though the difference was not so great that it guaranteed the gzilt ships superiority good day the culture ship sent im the mistake not i believe you are the churkun correct and i am its captain might we ask what brings you here got personnel inside the girdlecity though i suspect youve already guessed that we are providing support for persons in there ourselves further to that this is now a zone of operational interest so we do have to ask you to leave i see you still have my module i believe we do though not actually aboard as it were just in case were inclined to treat it as captured hostile equipment especially given the way it was delivered perhaps we might return it to you following your departure once this is no longer a zone of operational interest which we repeat we must ask you to leave immediately ah keep it if you like not that bothered but i do need to stick around for a bit it is not going to be possible to accommodate that desire obviously we have no wish to engage in any hostilities with you but if it comes to it we are entirely prepared to do just that if you do not leave immediately be a bit closerange like nukes in a shed well whatever it might take this is though sadly not open for negotiation we must ask you to leave immediately one culture ship has already met its end within gzilt space in the last few hours i assume you have heard of the fate of the beats working yes its just the kind of thing us culture ships natter about it would be unfortunate in the extreme if it were not to remain the only casualty of such status hereabouts please leave and do understand that this is not a reduction in the force of our demand that you do so which remains in force and is as of this statement up to its fourth restatement it is rather an additional plea from those of us aboard with some respect for culture vessels that you accede without delay to our demand before anything unfortunate occurs of course not the only casualty hereabouts the plucky little beats working indeed twelve ronte ships were lost as well with all hands and then in addition to that there was that zr ship out at ablate twentytwo days ago really really kind of kicked off this whole rolling unpleasantness everything was spinning along pretty much fine until that bit of well how would one characterise it illegality cowardice piracy bullying to the point of murder just murder how little the differences between these terms mean to those subject to the act concerned you ought to pay heed me that spotted it too i was rendezvousing with our liseiden chums out at ry when it happened caught the blink of that particular little atrocity remarkable that is some distance away well spotted now we really must ask you to leave for the last time there will be no more requests only action our patience is truly exhausted we could start by sort of tussling with fields i did that out at bokri in ospin with your pal the uagren that was fun not something you get to do every day bestial nearly like locking horns actually more like naked wrestling all oiled up i found it quite erotic to tell the truth homoerotic i suppose technically as were all just ships together and were all the same gender neutral or hermaphrodite or whatever dont you think the churkuns reply was to attempt to wrap a burst field all around the smaller culture ship an element of its field enclosure pulsing suddenly nearly instantly out like a loop of a suns magnetic field flicking releasing a pulse of charged particles not even a nice try shipfucker the culture ship sent already dodged before the field bubble got anywhere near it and now watch this it flickered shimmering in hyperspace as it fell powering the trivial distance from where it had been down the curve of the planets gravity well to the girdlecity then it disappeared the first sign of alarm had been the warbling of a siren in the distance as he and the arbites had progressed along a broad downwardslanting corridor he hadnt noticed at first as he was busy trying to reestablish contact with the ship marine operations officer he sent then waited a few civilians walked in the distance many were dressed in white shifts similar to those he had seen earlier captain some more whiteclad civilians appeared from an elevator just ahead they stopped and stared when they saw agansu and the disturbance in the air caused by the arbites camouflage effectively invisible to the naked eye from as little as ten metres away the machines werent fooling anybody this close not when they moved even the blind would know they were there the machines were marching carefully out of step and treading as delicately as they were able but there was still a noticeable vibration shuddering along the wide floor of the corridor captain still no answer communications officer communication with the ship is not possible within this shielded environment arbite one told him we have no link to other assets aboard he asked none at present the arbite replied hey somebody shouted behind them stop on the floor now agansu turned round to see a helmeted security person armed with what was probably a stun rifle running down the corridor towards them stun he said to one the security guard staggered but didnt collapse stunning ineffective arbite one said the guard dropped to one knee and raised the gun light flared the guards head flicked backwards and the figure collapsed weapon aimed action taken arbite one sent when agansu looked at it standing orders now people were screaming the group at the open elevator were crowding back in in the direction they had been heading those who had been walking in front of them were stationary looking back lights red situated every fifteen metres along the corner the walls made with the ceiling started to flash another siren had joined the first i think to put it in the vernacular idiom our cover is blown agansu told the marine arbites resume full capacity including ag and field the arbites seemed to collapse in on themselves compacting to the size of bulky backpacks and hovering agansu thought his own ag on it was as though an invisible seat rose beneath him bringing his legs up as he lay back he had flown like this before in training and simulations a familiarfeeling virtual glovecontrol seemed to fill his hand he held the kinex sidearm in the other hand follow me he sent to the four arbites he raced down the corridor a metre and a half off the floor feet first this was the luge configuration others preferred the toboggan though agansu had always thought such headfirst antics both intrinsically more dangerous and a little showy the arbites flew in a horizontal square formation around him they rose very close to the ceiling as they tore over the crowd of people theyd been following earlier passing overhead without incident though he heard somebody screaming they had all dropped to the floor anyway the piercing sound of the scream dopplered oddly as they swept past above still following the downward curve of the corridor seconds later some distance ahead he could see a crowd of whiteclad people clustered around a broad circular staircase leading upwards insectplausible device ahead reports person of interest passed this way up steps ahead into tank earlier arbite one sent there were hundreds there the steps were packed with people dressed in white deploy there he sent make some noise now get those people out of the way laser area denial bursts too civilian warning grade the two lead arbites deployed tiny blast grenades producing sudden flickers of light twenty metres in front of the crowd of people the noise was very loud indeed more light strobed turning the whole scene ahead into a bright flare people dropped covered their ears their eyes make for the aperture he sent spotting the large triangular piercing in the ceiling where the steps led the two leading arbites zoomed disappeared more flashes of light weapon aimed action taken he heard again as he curved up and through to land on the deck above it was generally dark people were scattering two guards lay dead faces gone stun guns at their sides this was a dark very large space almost entirely filled with a vast tank that looked like water lights pointed inwards from every side around the enormous space his enhanced senses mapped out what could be mapped out one of the insectplausible devices registered as nearby olonel somebody sent the signal protocols were missing colonel agansu it was the marine operations officer here beneath this large tank agansu replied were having some problems with the culture ship supporting the voice crackled disappeared came back on another crackle ersons of interest would appear to be up inside it was gone again units present undergoing effector attack internal airship own arbite one reported defending actions deployed agansu was experiencing some problems of his own the view was hazing over insectplau arbite three began hostile insectplausible device attached to arbite three arbite one sent something was glowing brightly on the upper surface of the arbite nearest the triangular hole in the floor hostile insectplausible device attached to arbite three arbite two confirmed our insectplausible device immediately external reports hostile device app there was a flash outside where the stairs led down our insectplausible device destroyed arbite one reported hostile device approaching registering as knife missile or similar marine operations officer agansu sent reinforcements immediately use any means something punched through the floor beneath arbite one spearing it and throwing it upwards to impact against the underside of the giant transparent tank the glowing thing on the top surface of arbite three detonated at the same moment blinding destroy the tank agansu sent raising the kinex gun he was able to fire once before he was blown off his feet by the blast from the erupted arbite destroy tank destroy tank the two remaining arbites replied and began firing upwards and around the walls filling the darkness with insane stuttering flares of light she was treading water revolving slowly and looking down between her slow weedwaving legs trying to see berdle when he said on second thoughts just get to the surface ill join you shortly mmm she said and after a quick look round struck out wrong way turn about the suit told her in berdles voice she stopped this was the way shed been heading wasnt it could the suit have got it wrong wrong way turn about the suit repeated hnnh she said then realised she had been twisting round while shed been looking down to see the avatar that was why shed taken the wrong direction initially youre heading the wrong way berdle told her theres some sort of emergency down there just turn round get out as quickly as you can ill be there very shortly she did a forward roll started back the way shed come mmm she said again swimming hard now suddenly she felt very vulnerable suit or no suit something flickered deep below as though from right at the bottom of the tank something very bright she knew she had seen light that white and intense recently her stomach lurched like shed been punched she got to where shed been treading water moments earlier the light flickered again brighter still seeming to reflect off the distant sides of the vast tank swim up fast now berdle shouted she was already kicking out as hard as she could when it felt like the whole tank shuddered the first kinex round from his pistol had hit the lower surface of the great transparent tank and caused a single great torus of white to flash away from the point of impact then hed been knocked off his feet despite the best efforts of the android body to stay upright further blindingly bright flashes filled the space as he struggled to kneel firing upwards the air shook like jelly around him onel the marine operations officer was screaming at him unit four destroyed by enemy action arbite two sent the tank burst it burst raggedly in many different places parts and levels of it seeming to stay where they were while other sections tore and fell and the released waters came crashing hurtling down onto the space beneath he threw himself to the floor hold where you are he was able to send to the remaining arbite before the waters slammed into his back light burst out everywhere below a series of pulses shivered through the water and through her as cossont kicked for the silvery lightflecked surface above she had grasped the lowest step of a small ladder extending from the surfacelevel walkway above and was just starting to pull herself up when the water began to fall away around her she spat the breather away and yelled berdle as she hauled herself up and out needing all four arms to pull her own weight and resist the sucking drag of the descending water a great roaring noise seemed to come partly from below and partly from above sounding more like a powerful wind than water the sound from above rose swiftly to a shriek somebody small female wearing a plain dark tunic was running along the walkway towards her the water beneath the dripping walkway no longer lit by the bright pulses of light from below was five metres down now swirling in different directions thrashing like something alive and lowering everywhere leaving behind an entire dripping web of walkways a hundred metres across suspended on swaying chains from a dark ceiling just a couple of metres above where panels were being torn away and sent spinning whirling downwards still making upward progress berdle said calmly through the suits earbuds relatively and now absolutely the girl running towards cossont looked shocked her mouth hanging open as she glanced over the side you all right she asked as she knelt by cossont having to raise her voice over the screaming wind something burst from the surface of the waters ten metres beneath and rose towards them it was vaguely humanshaped but too big to be berdle what the fuck the girl said the whole airship seemed to shudder the girl reached out to grab hold of a stanchion the figure rising from the still falling waters fifteen metres down now rotated a little it was berdle holding a naked man supporting him with his own feet and an arm under his chest reckoned the time for a stealthy approach was gone cossont heard the avatar say as he landed beside her and the girl barely had the ag to rescue this poor fellow the man he was holding had wide terrifiedlooking eyes he didnt have a breather device in his mouth he was coughing a lot berdle lowered him to the deck and the man clung to it coughing up water the girl patted his back good day berdle said to her loudly then held a hand out to cossont shall we cossont got to her feet whats happ the whole fabric of the airship shuddered once more beneath where the waters roared fifty metres down two explosions burst from the swirling waves time to run berdle said turning and sprinting off along the walkway for a distant patch of light follow me she raced off after him vaulting the naked coughing man and hammering down the walkway behind the avatar thin pillars of cerise light flicked into existence splashing fire from the ceiling one lanced through the walkway a metre behind berdles flying feet she jumped the resulting fistsized hole one right turn at the next junction steps up dead ahead she heard his voice tell her ill join you momentarily then the avatar put out a hand caught hold of one of the walkways supporting chains and was lifted off his feet and spun round just as another pink bolt pierced the walkway immediately ahead of him he dropped over the side of the walkway at first falling then curving away through the darkness and the everywhere roar of water light glittered again inside the tank as two shapes rose twisting though the air beneath filling the space with hairthin shining filaments she put her head down pounded along the wildly swinging gantry skidded round the corner at the junction and saw a short flight of steps leading up through the ceiling the storm of air howling down through the hole in the ceiling made it almost impossible to make any headway she needed all four arms to pull herself upwards on the chain bannister rails and all the strength in her own legs and the suits to force her way up the metal steps small pieces of debris came hurtling down from above and hit her shoulders or bounced off her head hurting her even through the thin covering of suithelmet ow fuck she said though the scream of air tearing around her was so loud she couldnt actually hear anything else she made the deck above threw herself onto the soft carpeted floor under subdued lighting and rolled away from the torrent of air being sucked howling into the emptying cavern beneath around her in what looked like a very large complicated lowceilinged room terrifiedlooking people were staring wideeyed at her over the top of luxuriously sculpted pieces of pale furniture a man and a woman were sitting on a nearby couch feet braced against the floor causing rumples in the carpet their fingers clawing into the soft material of the cushions they sat on the couch itself was jerking and sliding across the floor towards the hole the woman closed her eyes the man opened his mouth in what was probably a scream but there was too much other noise to tell cossont used all four hands to claw her way across the floor something white came whirling towards her she ducked instinctively as a fat square pillow bounced over her and disappeared into the maelstrom around the aperture in the floor where it had come from twenty metres away part of the floor gave way and a set of couches and chairs holding maybe a half dozen people disappeared sucked downwards into the darkness berdle she yelled but she didnt even know if hed be able to hear her she couldnt hear herself the first problem was getting all the bits and pieces out of the way so there would be room for itself actually who was it kidding the first problem was all about not blowing up the world or at the very least not annihilating both itself fifty horizontal kilometres of girdlecity whoknewhowmany lives locally and immediately and then an additional whoknewhowsizable number over a significant proportion of the rest of the planet with the resulting fireball blast front secondary debris impact events and all the resulting ancillary fire tertiary impact and groundshock effects another fucking day at the office the ship thought putting all such thoughts to one side and cascadechecking all the available variables before just doing it there were fourteen craft and over eighty individuals in the fifteen hundred metres of tunnel which started one hundred metres behind the stern of the equatorial the first task was displacing them safely or at least quickly the quickly mattered more than the safely and one of the larger craft containing nine or ten people picked up rather more relative velocity at the far end of the displace than the mistake not would have liked sending the flier flicking forward by a couple of extra metres per second as it bounced in that might mean broken limbs if the occupants werent restrained but that was the worst of it everything else transitioned relatively smoothly the space was clear the ship went for it jumping across into real space in a single vast snap as precisely aligned as possible in the circumstances and the time available its enclosure fields shrunk sucked wrapped as tight as they would go about itself leaving it with maybe fifty metres all around it between the outermost of those tightly compressed fields and the nearest bit of girdlecity solidity there was an important part of the whole process that depended on something called only slightly misleadingly the singularityexpansor transfer component the ship finessed that as well as it could but this time its own safety not to mention the safety of the girdlecity millions of people the planet etc trumped technical perfection so the expansion ended up being relatively rough and ready and undeniably abrupt the ship blew into existence almost explosionfast creating a vast pulse of air that tore out through the fortunately dispersed structure of the openwork tunnel and the surrounding architecture of the girdlecity bowling people over sending nearby aircraft tumbling shattering antique windows and denting cladding panels for hundreds of metres about it messy the mistake not would be entirely prepared to concede but never mind in the end it had worked and it was where it had wanted to be in the same huge basketweave tunnel as the airship equatorial just a hundred metres behind it what idiocy is this the captain of the churkun sent a fitting idiocy the ship replied i fit you wont and if i need to i can put my enclosure right around the airship from here so i suggest you leave me be out the blast of air seemed to have relented a little if only because more floor panels had given way providing additional routes for the air to escape through the two people on the couch that had been slipping towards the hole in the floor had scrambled up and over the back of it crawling away the couch itself had stopped moving berdle cossont screamed no reply it was still bedlam but at least now she could hear herself she saw another stairway spiralling upwards ten metres away behind the nearest semicircle of chairs she got onto one knee heaved herself upright and leaned into the stillfurious gale forcing herself forward straining to see any more debris coming her way another shudder ran through the whole airship sending her flying she heard herself yelp as she fell being blown backwards caught in the lacerating torrent of air she dropped to the floor and held on again cursing agansu pushed himself up against the pummelling force of the water finally getting to all fours the android body was gauging calibrating allowing for the vast pressing weight surging across it it could still function and its ag should still be effective walls burst the floor gave way in a variety of places nearby letting in a little more light allowing the surging fall of water to escape the remaining arbite reported when agansu pinged it holding approximately steady in downward course of water it told him attempt to rise he told it head for the top of the tank i shall too the suit let him stand unsteady shuddering in the torrent agansu saw two brokenlooking bodies being swept past naked he activated the ag lifted off the floor and began to make his way quivering battered from all sides up through the chaotic swirl of the descending column of water he and the remaining arbite burst from the surface of the water into a great dark space more than sixty metres high and hundreds across buffeted by swirling winds high above just beneath a randomly pierced ceiling a rig of metalwork gantries hung suspended some figures moved up there avatarandroid identified the arbite told him as they rose accelerating together fire destroy it he told the arbite violet bolts seared through the air sparking explosions from the ceiling sparks and pieces of glowing debris fell towards them two figures were running overhead target employing visual camouflage fields the arbite reported still firing as they rose next thing the leading figure a composite haze of images like a stacked pack of ghosts fell or threw itself from the gantry and came whirling down through the turmoil of air and falling debris towards them light glittering from it the colonel realised suddenly only at this point that he had lost the kinex sidearm he had no idea exactly when or where this was upsetting the android body had its pair of forearmmounted lasers but he doubted they would prove especially effective after what had happened at bokri the arbite fired at the falling figure seeming to hit it agansu raised his arms aiming at the other running figure then in a single staggering impact and a wash of white was hit by something and sent tumbling he was aware of falling somersaulting he steadied himself or the suit did he didnt know when he was floating in midair he looked around and could see nothing of the last arbite or the figure that had dropped from the gantry below in the great swirl of water and dashing chaotic waves there were the fading remains of what might have been two large splashes on the dark waters arbite report he said comms internal only the android body told him agansu felt groggy and odd strange unbalanced he looked at his right arm which was not there he stared the arm ended at about midway on the upper part the stump was still smoking arbite marine oper he started to say still unsure regarding what had happened comms internal only the android body repeated yes of course agansu said looking inside himself to monitor the bodys operational state severely compromised ai substrate intact obviously ag conventional locomotion and one arm and one laser left upwards he thought and ascended through the bruising cataract of air ximenyr wheres ximenyr she yelled crouched down by the frightenedlooking man in front of her he was clad in one of the dark tunics and holding grimly on to a desk as the air rushed past this level one up looked like the foyer of some exclusive hotel getting up here had been a little easier than her last ascent as the storm of air gradually lessened it was still fierce enough wheres ximenyr she shouted again over the roaring the man just shook his head she turned away muttered suit any idea interrogating local systems the suit said still in berdles voice mr ximenyrs suite is this way please follow the suit seemed to raise itself it faced a broad welllit corridor she walked with the suit then started to jog through the noticeably thinner air switching to supplemental oxygen supply ten per cent the suit announced she felt something connect delicately with her nostrils a cool draught hit the skin there still trying berdle she asked the suit constantly it told her in his voice here the suit said drawing them both to a stop at a double doorway open it asked yes opening the suit said and the doors slid apart oh shit the ship thought to itself the mistake not had lost contact with all of its devices on and in the airship including its own avatar it was busily scattering new surveillance stuff all over the place now as fast as it could but it might already be too late the airship equatorial was riding as high as it could go tearing its upper surfaces to shreds along the giant grater that was the ceiling of the huge open tunnel shedding panels and pieces of equipment as it ground slowly to a stop all the while dropping what looked like megatonnes of water from its lower reaches whole falls giant cascades of water were issuing from its sides while further sheets and folds of water fell straight down from its ventral line taking bulkhead panels and entire sections of hull with them falling spinning slowly away in the colossal squall of rain the airship ground to a stop trapped against the ceiling of the tunnel water continued to gush from its lower hull crushed broken bodies littered the network of pipes girders and structure beneath the stricken craft not all were dead the ship displaced what medical support drone and lifesaving equipment it had to those still able to be saved there were a lot of dronelike military devices floating about the place over two hundred and forty of them they were making a nuisance of themselves sixtyfour had already tried attacking its outermost bumpfield with xray lasers though exactly why and with what hope of success the ship was unable to work out maybe theyd all gone mad plus all of them now seemed to be working themselves up to attack it again with some other piece of seedshootery nonsense so once it had despatched all its medical teams it targeted all of the enemy drones disabling each with a pinpoint granule of plasma fire and instantly even before they could explode properly wrapping them individually in displace fields and swatting them into hyperspace directed roughly towards where the churkun was it assumed they were its there might be more of these aggravations inside the airship it supposed it still couldnt see within the vessel properly and its devices were taking their time getting inside fuck this the mistake not decided and sliced a tiny cone less than a couple of metres deep and the same across off the very stern of the airship with a millimetrically flourished zpebedged destabiliser field the cone fell away in a cloud of sparkling grey no bodies sliced in half which was good but there was still d shielding ahead the ship cut again three metres this time still with no casualties or result the zeropoint energybrane edging component seemed be handling the d shielding well much less blowback than it had been led to expect from the simulations the mistake not was growing more confident using the weapon this time it cut twenty metres off the stern of the crippled airship and held the resulting hull section in a maniple field lowering the conic section to the soaking pooled floor of the tunnel trying to avoid laying it on any of the bodies finally it was past the shielding it could see into the interior of the airship it could already tell there were a lot more dead and dying bodies inside though no more annoying drone military berdle anybody it asked ximenyrs suite or not the man himself wasnt there no persons present the suit told her she looked around some sort of sitting or reception room the place looked banal in a spacious luxurious understated sort of way quite different from the sumptuous overdressed surroundings she and berdle had found the master of the revels in the last time theyd been in the airship what about that chest thing berdle mentioned she asked she moved towards another set of double doors the lights flickered in the suite seeming almost to fail then recovering item fitting description in adjacent cabin facing the suit said helpfully just before it opened the doors for her still nobody about one giant octagonal bed many curtained alcoves some holding items of furniture in one stood the big upright chest berdle had talked about earlier it was about as tall as she was and maybe a metre wide and deep when closed it had a small wheel at each corner and stood hinged open to about ninety degrees clothes on a rail filled most of one side the other side was all drawers she opened the top drawer going up on tiptoe to see inside the little cylinder lay on a piece of soft folded material along with the rest of the bits and pieces that had been on the necklace theyd seen ten days earlier she stared at it picked it up behind their little window of thick crystal the pair of seagreen orbs that had looked like berries seemed to stare back at her anomalous pres the suit began then two things happened she was struck kicked it felt like in the back very hard though somehow she and the suit managed to stay standing at the same time something burst brightly pink and white off the drawerfront immediately before her about level with the middle of her chest she was still thinking about turning round wondering what had happened when she realised that whatever light had burst against the drawerfront must have come straight through her to get there smoke drifted up from the exit wound in her chest she could smell roasted meat over the cold sharp sensation of the oxygen ence detect the suit said as more individually slightly lighter kicks struck her all over her back and rear this time she was thrown against the drawers of the chest and the whole thing nearly tipped over then it bounced off the bulkhead behind and she was thrown back again turning woozily round as she did so the little trails of smoke made pretty spirals in the relatively still air before she started to slide downwards the ruined ragged back of the suit went stuttering down the set of drawer handles jolting her as she slumped to the deck a onearmed figure was standing in the doorway looking at her just lowering his one good arm ship re establish blish lish ish shh the suit whispered to her and sighed to quietness the faint draft of oxygen at her nostrils faded then the onearmed figure in the doorway lit up brilliantly all down one side from foot to scalp and was thrown bodily hard against the door jamb pieces flying off it as it rebounded lit up from the other side now disintegrating what was left reduced to something like a toothin charred onearmed skeleton fell forwards hitting the deck at about the same time as she did twentythree s something somebody talking to her asking questions a question did she want to keep both sets of arms of course she wanted to keep both sets of arms what sort of idiotic dumbass back to sleep this would all be hurried extemporised done much more quickly than the normal guidelines advised to keep to the schedule she didnt know didnt care didnt even know where she was in this darkness once or twice she woke up in this darkness and wondered who she was but each time she remembered it was all a sociological experiment by the zihdren a rogue philosophariat the philosophariat apposital i think that was their name they it it was all down to one individual in the end planted everything in the book of truth according to some obscure metalogical hypothesis to settle an argument between two groups of scholars with opposing theories briper drodj the scribe elaborated on the basics as everybody pretty much knew but the essence was always what the zihdren had put there of course this whole approach was later discredited and the philosophariat apposital was dissolved with moderate disgrace not long after and this particular experiment like many similar others was quietly forgotten the zihdren sublimed a couple of centuries later decades before the gzilt even reached space all this became known to a very few people way back at the start of the process which brought the culture into existence happened following contact by zihdrenremnanter they were i suppose so they claimed consciencestricken well consciencecharged might be a better way of putting it the zihdren had felt bad taking this grubby little secret into the enfolding so they thought they could have the best of both worlds by subliming without mentioning it but leaving it to their remnanters to spill the broth at a later date there had been rumours about all this before of course but no one who counted in gzilt society or not enough of them had ever really thought it mattered all that much until then when the whole jointhisnewgroupingornot thing was in the air and by the by it wasnt even definitely going to be called the culture at this point did you know that a lot of people wanted that we should all call ourselves the aliens i remember but anyway the vote went to culture though frankly i didnt vote for it or aliens i might add i abstained anyway we knew the negotiating teams knew that there was something the remnanters had inherited some dark secret or something that might have a bearing one way or the other on the whole joining issue for the gzilt maybe even the rumours were crazy some of them for the others too as in a veto against the gzilt joining being used perhaps by one or more of the other parties which was sort of ticklish enough but the thing is the remnanters still wanted the thing kept secret afterwards even after it had been factored into the negotiations that caused some headscratching it was an ai that came up with what looked like the best solution at which i recall we were all quite pleasantly surprised at the time huh that was a sign of the future if ever there was one anyway so the solution was that one volunteer representative who at the same time would have to be approved by the others in his or her team so it wasnt as simple as the first volunteer getting the gig anyway one of us from each of the relevant civs should agree to hear this evidence from the zihdrenremnanter vote on it with a veto and then forget what it was wed been asked to vote on this was all going to be made possible by preparing each of these reps brains before they heard the big secret then after they had just well wiping that bit of their memories we were all assured this was all entirely possible and reliable and not in any way dangerous and the most wed forget would be a single days worth of memories so we all agreed and it all happened and we all heard the big bad terrible secret but obviously it wasnt that big or bad or terrible because nobody vetoed the gzilt joining this new cobbledtogether civ we were calling ourselves mongrels even back then feeling very edgy and radical and so the gzilt were cleared to become part of the culture even though in the end they didnt actually take up the offer and go through with it so all well and good you might think thats what we all thought except one member of the negotiating party a certain representative ngaroe qiria from the buhdren federality that would be me later remembered what it was that hed heard what hed been expected to forget what he thought like everybody else he had forgotten thing is id always been interested in longterm living even way back then and particularly in holding on to memories that might otherwise get forgotten overwritten or whatever so id had some experimental cranial biochemical brainchemistrymangling stuff done not all of it entirely legal or even medically advisable but most of it didnt seem to have worked anyway frankly so it never really occurred to me it might interfere with this hearandforget thing theyd hit us with during the negotiations turned out i remembered all this stuff id been meant to forget due to a fix even i didnt know i had something the clinicians had added as some sort of experimental afterthought and then either forgot to tell me about ha or decided it might be better to keep quiet about anyway the effects have been ongoing and have stayed and developed though theyve long since been smoothed over and eversocarefully incorporated into all the other treatments and amendments and augmentations ive had since at first i wouldnt sublime or even be stored or undergo any sort of transitional state because i was afraid this secret would come out because i dont think i understood that though it was a i dont know a faithshaking secret thats just in theory in practice people dont believe for good reasons anyway they just believe and thats it like we dont love for good reasons we just love because we need to love later even knowing this and knowing that the gzilt knowing would make little real difference because they would just ignore the knowledge or find another way of not thinking about it i still just kept on living not subliming with any group and not transcorporating into a groupmind or into a mind or anything else because it had become a habit this going on and going on it had become so much of what made me who i had become there seemed no point in trying to change it so i became the man who lived for ever more or less because id once held a secret i didnt care about any more well didnt care about until i heard about the gzilt subliming and in time decided that what i knew about them might be dangerous to me living for a long time can make you very cautious cautious to the point of something close to cowardice frankly and so anyway i got rid of the information had it excised and put it away from me even though i put it somewhere in gzilt space somewhere pointed with the last party and ximenyr where it seemed to me it belonged this amused me at the time it amuses me still id asked ximenyr to look after what id left with him and keep it keep them close i didnt tell him what they held or how important that information might be i didnt imagine he would wear them in full view and plain sight but then why not that amuses me too berdle had perished protecting her attacking the android that had held colonel agansus personality before it could target cossont who had been running along the gantry above that had let the arbite accompanying agansu get in a killshot on the avatar the arbite had then been destroyed by the already halfcrippled remains of the outer suit they had left behind earlier operating as berdle had said it would as a drone ximenyr was dead hed been in the tank when it was attacked helping people confused by the watery maze but he was being brought back from a stored version made ten days earlier hed always been backedup hundreds had died in the airship and beneath it drowned crushed torn apart the ship had killed agansu itself using a displaced sleet of mdaws nanomissiles slaved your forces have been routed despatched the culture ship had sent to the gzilt ship no need for you to hang about here now ill be going myself shortly probably best you dont try to stop me i have a regimental marshal talking to me slowly of course on another channel she wishes me to engage you in combat yes but i already have what we came here to look for unless you withdraw to the system outskirts and make no sudden moves ill broadcast the results to the whole of xown and packet it all up to spread through the whole of gzilt let me go without resistance and theres still im guessing a significantly better than even chance that nothing will come of this and what i now know will remain buried so all this so much death has been for nothing way it works sometimes and my conscience is clear i didnt start this in the end though were at the place at least one of us wanted to get to end of run of course rather than the choice between what you threaten and our allowing you to escape we might engage with you on the instant to prevent you from carrying out either i never did tell you my whole name did i you did not many have remarked that your name would appear to be part of a longer one and yet unusually even uniquely nobody has heard the whole of it may i tell you it now please do my full name is the mistake not my current state of joshing gentle peevishness for the awesome and terrible majesty of the towering seas of ire that are themselves the mere milquetoast shallows fringing my vast oceans of wrath cool eh such braggadocio that smacks of smokescreen not power take it as you will chum but how many culture ships do you know of that exaggerate their puissance none till now you may be the first oh adjust yourself you people have spent ten millennia playing at soldiers while becoming ever more dedicated civilians weve spent the last thousand years trying hard to stay civilian while refining the legacy of a won galactic war who do you think has the real martial provenance here in a fight youd have no choice but to try to destroy me immediately youd fail id have a choice of just how humiliatingly to cripple you this is the truth depend so you say we might beg enough i think i know what happened out at ablate i owe you no respect if you are experiencing a craving to die honourably feel free to try to stop me when i instigate kickaway in one millisecond from now otherwise stand aside also i retract my suggestion that you ought to depart the place down here is a wreck im leaving various drone teams and bits of medical gear behind but i do intend to leave and the locals could do with some disaster control stepping into that breach would be substantially more constructive than placing yourself across the cannons mouth your choice goodbye one way or the other the mistake not slipped out from under the real it left behind a silvery ellipsoid just to the rear of the drained ruin that was the airship equatorial the silvery ellipsoid shrank to nothing and winked out over the course of several seconds in a gentle orderly fashion producing no more than moderate breezes as the air flowed in to replace the volume of the departed ship the ship itself fell beneath the planet where the worlds gravity distorted the skein of space into a shallow bowl shape then it turned twisted aimed and powered away unmolested she felt like shit and great and hopeless and euphoric all at the same time the ship had brought her back to some sort of life normally that badly injured that close to death after such major trauma to every single major organ save her brain shed have been left in a therapeutic coma for nine or ten days and even then the change the difference between her physical state at the beginning and at the end of that time would have seemed nothing short of miraculous to people of a past age taking her from goodasdead to goodasever instead because of the subliming she had been repaired bit by bit detail by detail almost cell by cell leaving her body a patchwork of preexisting normality and dazzlingly fresh new bits so that she felt jangled vibrating bruised beyond belief yet with nothing to show for it perpetually astounded at being suddenly not dead not seriously injured to the point of neardeath she had listened in from her sickbed in a much smaller but stillwellequipped module to the debriefing qiria gave on being reunited with the memories stored in the recovered eyes you are perhaps the only gzilt who will ever hear this the avatar told her the ship had made a new avatar it looked and talked like berdle had before ithe had changed to look more like a gzilt male the first time they had set foot on the girdlecity together sure you should be telling me she asked huskily even her throat and lower tongue had taken a puncture wound in that last fusillade of fire from the android agansu i think you earned it the ship told her it had yet to give its new avatar a name it wouldnt use berdle again it was sort of a tradition it said that when you lost an avatar you gave the next one a different name huh was all she would say pyan heard the secret about the book of truth too pyan now forever wanting to be wrapped whimpering and cooing annoyingly round her neck consoling seemingly genuinely honestly concerned for her after so nearly losing her but the ship at vyrs request made sure that what pyan heard of this pyan forgot again she still hadnt managed to lose the elevenstring either as part of her personal effects the ship had thoughtfully transferred it to the smaller shuttle craft before slinging the larger one the one shed been staying in alongside the girdlecity to distract the churkun it was a relief albeit a guilty one that there wasnt room to play it inside the smaller craft it still took up an awful lot of space xgsv empiricist olou caconym ogsv contents may differ ogcu displacement activity ogsv just the washing instruction chip in lifes rich tapestry oue mistake not omsv passing by and thought id drop in omsv pressure drop olsv you call this clean fellows colleagues friends we have our answer it is much as we expected though the import of even the most expected news changes when it becomes definite and fact the question is what do we do what do we say xlou caconym id tell them id swamp their airways with it id announce it so its the first thing the newly prewoken hear but i know we wont for what its worth im resigned to the decision were all about to make of keeping it quiet xgsv contents may differ the simulations have been exhaustive but inconclusive the likelihood is that releasing the information would make little difference but with the outside possibility that there might be chaos a partial subliming with a significant part of the gzilt populace and ais changing their minds further dispute between the scavengers and possibly even between the nonsubliming part of the gzilt and the scavengers the chance of things turning ugly is small but not that small and the ugly might be very big ugly xmsv passing by and thought id drop in we cant tell them those that would most care already know or guess those that might be most affected are those we have the least right to disturb xmsv pressure drop i cant agree the truth is the truth you tell it even when it hurts or it loses value even when it doesnt xlsv you call this clean technically i agree with that in practice i agree we say and do nothing the circumstances due to the timing are unique yes you should always tell the truth unless you find yourself in a situation where it would be utter moral folly to do so at least now we know the truth the fevered speculative potential of it has collapsed to something definite and not so terrible after all to tell it would not be the worst thing ever either and one should always tell the truth unless the point is that we are not automata we have a choice i say we exercise it wisely and stay silent xgsv empiricist so shall we vote andor open it up to others so that more may vote xue mistake not if i might xgsv empiricist please xue mistake not we know how this works if we do nothing then any disaster that befalls the gzilt over the next few hours is entirely theirs if we intervene we become at least complicit this is a truth that has not been asked for even the original bearers of it the zr made it clear they were happy it stay unknown we know and what we know is now that we can be sure of what we know that it is not our business whether the knowing was worth the price we and others have paid is another sort of moral equation at rightangles to this one i say we do nothing vote if you like xlou caconym anybody wish to wrest from me my claim for precedence in the awkward customerdissenting adultoutright contrarian stakes no thought not then when i say that i reluctantly agree with what our colleague the mistake not has just said i think we might consider the matter closed the caconym in the shape of its virtual avatoid returned to the castlemadeofcastles it had modelled within the nearunending recesses of its computational matrices its humanoid shape set out from the gatehouse that was made of tens of thousands of already mighty gatehouses and walked all the way to the high tower which sat like a fat flagpole on top of the great composite tower many subjective kilometres away into the fractal architecture of the baroque edifice it had waited all this time to hear anything from the mindstate of the zoologist anything at all that might have helped it and its colleagues in their attempts to understand the workings of the sublime and despite being tempted to do so many times it had not come back here to attempt to force the pace or the issue now that the matter in hand appeared to have been settled without it had to be said any help from the zoologist it had something to report and could release the soul of the other ship from whatever obligation to help that it might have felt under not that that appeared to be very much given the continuing silence at least the instances of weird ambiguous intrusions into its substrates maybe from the sublimed realm had tailed off to nothing recently that was a good sign perhaps or perhaps not it was starting to worry about that it arrived at last after a climb of many thousands of steps at the door to the airy enclosed lair inhabited by the consciousness of the sublimereturnee the abstract of what had once been the mind of the zoologist there was no answer when it knocked the place sounded quiet it already felt that it knew what it was going to find the door was locked but only at a crude physical level within the sim unlocking it was hardly more complicated than the act of turning the handle and pushing the door open the door swung stuck had to be pushed the caconyms avatoid walked in and looked around the space was as it had guessed empty of the zoologists mindstate it was full of almost everything else including debris litter and rubbish of every kind stained glassware bulbously gleaming electrical gear intestinal quantities of tubing foul smells loudly protesting unfed animals and multitudinous ropes hanging from the ceiling but of the strange creature with the pale red mottled skin and the long arms with six fingers there was no sign after it stopped looking for the avatoid of the zoologist it started looking for a note it didnt find one you might have said goodbye it said eventually to the air in case its departed guest had left some sort of message behind that might be triggered by speech but its voice just disappeared into the clutter and the dust and the hazy sunlight coming through the tall windows and brought no response the ship instituted a full search of its computational and storage substrates just in case but with no real hope it would find any sign of the zoologist sure enough there was nothing apart from this ersatz abandoned lab and its own memories of its departed colleague the zoologist had left without a trace the caconym was about to calm the squawking screeching animals in their cages but then grew instantly tired of the whole absurd conceit and with one command abolished the entire castle and everything in and around it closing down the whole scenario with a single thought twentyfour s in the end he went with everybody else there had been a time there when he thought he must have gone mad for he had been thinking of staying behind of not going at all and perhaps once it had all taken place of putting himself into the hands of some authority to be tried and judged and accept whatever punishment might be decreed for what he had done for all the things he had done but especially for this last thing but that had been just a passing fantasy a mood something to be indulged in the end he knew he had to go and he told himself that not going and indulging in this masochistic orgy of justice and repentance would be the truly selfish thing for him to do finally at long last it was not all about him he was he would be just another humble enfoldee taking his place along with everybody else for the step off the cliff that bore you up rather than causing you to fall the presence that had hung over the parliament building for so long had swelled a little become a dark sphere in the last few hours more and more presences had appeared sliding into existence throughout the whole of gzilt space wherever there were people in homes and communes and barracks in ships and sea ships and aircraft in squares and piazzas in public halls lecture theatres auditoria and temples markets and malls sports venues and transport stations and in all the places where the stored had recently been resting before prewaking the aliens who had come to wish the gzilt farewell and those who had come to profit from their going had by convention withdrawn for the moment leaving those about to depart to themselves timeto devices and public clocks and displays spread throughout the gzilt realm ticked down the last few hours and minutes and people met at prearranged places and ate last meals and said last things and sometimes told others secrets theyd been keeping or decided not to generally as people tended to they got together in groups of family and friends then joined with other groups to form gatherings of dozens or hundreds and again as people usually did though the exact expression of such emotionality depended both on the physical as well as the psychological makeup of the species concerned they held hands many sang many bands and orchestras played and in the end the time counted down to nothing and in the presence of presences all you did was say i sublime i sublime i sublime and that was that off you went just folding out of existence as though turning through a crease in the air that nobody had noticed was there before he met up with marshal chekwri at the end she had no more family than he did and they had come to share much over the last twenty days or so they stood in the gardens of the parliament under an inappropriately squally sky with showers waiting to say the words with a few dozen others they left it relatively late during the hour that was regarded as the optimum period just to make sure that a respectable proportion of the whole gzilt civilisation was indeed going it was he reflected numbly a lot like watching election results coming in there was a slow start to the instigation but the numbers quickly swelled about a quarter of an hour in according to the news channels still covering events and by the start of the last third of the hour it was obvious almost everybody was making the transition the numbers subliming accelerated again those gathered in the garden agreed they could go traditionally people tell each other secrets at this point marshal chekwri said to him in a brief moment when the others were all making their goodbyes and choosing where to stand and with whom mine chekwri said with a smirk is that i failed my officer exam i cheated blackmailed a senior officer to get the pass she shrugged never looked back she put her head to one side you he stared at her for an instant he wasnt sure he knew who he was staring at or why or that he knew anybody or anything any more eventually he shook his head too many he said almost too quietly to be heard turning away from her too many jevan and solbli his secretary and aidedecamp were there and he was astonished when it was jevan who said he had always loved him not solbli whose secret was that she had no secret he mumbled something lost for speech for the first time in many decades they chose the end of the juststarted minute as the time they would go they all joined hands and when the time came they all said the words and went just as a small rain shower began in the end he went with everybody else he was remade and yet he had been destroyed he knew he would have done all he could in his additional incarnation within the android on xown but still again it had not been enough had he been successful he might have stayed behind with something to celebrate and to live up to instead he could only admit defeat it was some consolation that nothing calamitous happened in the interval between the failed operation inside the girdlecity and the instigation that was the beginning of the subliming all that mattered now was that the crew of the uagren had accepted him and he was part of the ship now no presence needed to appear ship ais were capable of performing their own enfolding agansu went with them in the end she didnt go not there and then she knew what this meant i cant leave without you warib had wailed from the screen the sea bluegreen behind her the happy voyagers forming up in their last formations hugging and crying and choosing who to hold hands with and in the end all she could say was yes you can mother and kill the connection knowing that she could and that she would twentyfive s at sunset above the plains of kwaalon on a dark high terrace balanced on a glittering black swirl of architecture forming a relatively microscopic part of the equatorial girdlecity of xown vyr cossont lieutenant commander reserve vyr cossont as she had once been sat performing t c vilabiers th stringspecific sonata for an instrument yet to be invented catalogue number mw on one of the few surviving examples of the instrument developed specifically to play the piece the notoriously difficult temperamental and tonally challenged antagonistic undecagonstring or elevenstring as it was commonly known t c vilabiers th stringspecific sonata for an instrument yet to be invented mw was more usually known as the hydrogen sonata while she played and the sun sank beyond the distant hulking line of the dark neartotally deserted girdlecity a lone liseiden freighter took off from a part of the great structure just a few kilometres away close enough for the sound of its relatively crude engines to impinge on cossonts consciousness she was able to ignore this potential distraction she kept on playing her own flier sat at the far edge of the terrace twenty metres off a few lights glowing in the cockpit where pyan lay curled asleep exhausted after an afternoon and early evening spent playing with flocks of birds eventually almost an hour after shed started cossont got to the end of the piece and as the last notes died away she set the two bows in their resting places kicked down the siderest and flexing her back carefully stood up and out of the instrument she opened her mouth wide rubbed her face with her top set of hands and massaged the small of her back with her lower pair through the material of a lords of excrement jacket she hooked her slippers off with her toes then bent and pulled on her boots she stood looking at the elevenstring for a while listening to the quiet harmonics that the evening winds made in the external resonating strings she had walked the empty echoing spaces of the girdlecity many times over the last few days and evenings and taken the flier to other places around the planet you had to fly on manual now the nav and safety systems were mostly still there but not to be relied upon she had seen nobody at all within the girdlecity she had chanced upon the same abandoned school she had walked past that first evening when commissarcolonel etalde had appeared to whisk her away it was twice deserted now with all the storage units opened the people they had held departed even the guard arbite shed accidentally activated had gone maybe taken by the liseiden the winds moaned through the vast spaces of the girdlecity playing it like some colossal instrument in the cities and towns and villages scattered across the planet she had seen a few people though only ever from a distance she was forming the impression that the only individuals left were those whod always fantasised about having the world to themselves one day most days though she saw nobody the closest encounter shed had with anything large and living had been when shed surprised a wandering skitterpaw late one evening in a small windswept city on the dry coast bordering the dust the animal had gone loping off into the shadows after giving her a good long look like it had been deciding whether to attack her or not she had a little tenmillimetre knife missile with her a gift from the ship and a device not above reminding her whenever she was about to leave home without it so it hadnt been as frightening an experience as it might have been still it had been scary enough and it was surprising how quickly the wild had started to colonise the deserted structures of civilisation and how much difference it made there being in most places nobody about rather than almost nobody about the final figures for those making the transition into the sublime had come in at over ninetynine point nine per cent as far as anyone could tell with little variation between planets and habitats xown and zyse had carried even greater proportions of their populations across into the enfold this was unless you were absolutely determined to regard the whole process as an act of tragic collective insanity an excellent and satisfying result a slightly stronger gust of wind swirled about the platform and the elevenstring made a new deep lowing sound like it wanted to be released back into the wild now even though there was nothing biological about its construction and it had been fashioned by a culture ship twenty years past and a quarter of the galaxy away she smiled ruefully in the dusk light then turned her back on the instrument and walked to the flier leaving the elevenstring standing slightly lopsided where it was with its protective case arranged still open neatly to one side she heaved herself up and into the flier shooing pyan out of the way the creature protested sleepily and didnt wake up properly finally wrapping itself limply round her neck and hanging there without even bothering to form a knot she suspected that if familiars had been prone to snoring pyan would have been snoring she sat in the flier for a moment letting it check its systems she gazed at the girdlecity focusing on where it dipped to meet the horizon the sun had not long set and the redgold skies were swiftly darkening she had thought of looking for the couple with the child again the little family shed met inside the girdlecity on that first evening the search and successfully finding them would be sufficient shed decided that would be difficult enough she wouldnt want to suggest that she stay with them or any such foolishness in addition she had an invitation to go with the mistake not which would be departing before too long having helped in the general business of keeping the peace amongst the scavenger civs as they took stuff dismantled things occupied places or studied tech to copy the culture ship would be heading out on a long voyage to the planet called cethyd on the far side of the galaxy to attempt to contact the original biological qiria to see if he would like his eyes and his memories back now that all the fuss was over just getting to him might be interesting given the bizarre hostility of the locals and notquitesolocals so it promised to be an adventure there was no rush anyway though the whole scavenger thing had quieted down the culture ships had stuck around for a bit and were now awaiting the arrival of the last of the ships that had been involved in their recent discussions over what to do about the gzilt shed got the impression they were all quietly pleased with themselves also that this gettogether was just an excuse for some mutual metaphorical backslapping and whatever passed amongst culture minds for nights of drunken revelry and general carousing and that they were already turning the whole fractious murderous escapade into something semimythical to take its place in the ongoing history of terrific things the culture and its brilliant ships had got up to over the years though not one called the caconym apparently it had just turned without ceremony and gone back to doing whatever it was it liked doing and not the empiricist it had more important things to do elsewhere systemclass ships always did apparently cossont strapped in closed the canopy took manual control and lifted the little flier away from the terrace letting the craft rise and bank and pirouette all at once first she would go home after that she had no idea what she might do the antagonistic undecagonstring caught in the swirling breeze produced by the fliers
