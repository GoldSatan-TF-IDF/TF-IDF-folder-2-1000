young zaphod plays it safe douglas adams young zaphod plays it safe a short story by douglas adams a large flying craft moved swiftly across the surface of an astoundingly beautiful sea from midmorning onwards it plied back and forth in great widening arcs and at last attracted the attention of the local islanders a peaceful seafood loving people who gathered on the beach and squinted up into the blinding sun trying to see what was there any sophisticated knowledgeable person who had knocked about seen a few things would probably have remarked on how much the craft looked like a filing cabinet a large and recently burgled filing cabinet lying on its back with its drawers in the air and flying the islanders whose experience was of a different kind were instead struck by how little it looked like a lobster they chattered excitedly about its total lack of claws its stiff unbendy back and the fact that it seemed to experience the greatest difficulty staying on the ground this last feature seemed particularly funny to them they jumped up and down on the spot a lot to demonstrate to the stupid thing that they themselves found staying on the ground the easiest thing in the world but soon this entertainment began to pall for them after all since it was perfectly clear to them that the thing was not a lobster and since their world was blessed with an abundance of things that were lobsters a good half a dozen of which were now marching succulently up the beach towards them they saw no reason to waste any more time on the thing but decided instead to adjourn immediately for a late lobster lunch at that exact moment the craft stopped suddenly in midair then upended itself and plunged headlong into the ocean with a great crash of spray which sent them shouting into the trees when they reemerged nervously a few minutes later all they were able to see was a smoothly scarred circle of water and a few gulping bubbles thats odd they said to each other between mouthfuls of the best lobster to be had anywhere in the western galaxy thats the second time thats happened in a year the craft which wasnt a lobster dived direct to a depth of two hundred feet and hung there in the heavy blueness while vast masses of water swayed about it high above where the water was magically clear a brilliant formation of fish flashed away below where the light had difficulty reaching the colour of the water sank to a dark and savage blue here at two hundred feet the sun streamed feebly a large silk skinned seamammal rolled idly by inspecting the craft with a kind of halfinterest as if it had half expected to find something of this kind round about here and then it slid on up and away towards the rippling light the craft waited here for a minute or two taking readings and then descended another hundred feet at this depth it was becoming seriously dark after a moment or two the internal lights of the craft shut down and in the second or so that passed before the main external beams suddenly stabbed out the only visible light came from a small hazily illuminated pink sign which read the beeblebrox salvage and really wild stuff corporation the huge beams switched downwards catching a vast shoal of silver fish which swiveled away in silent panic in the dim control room which extended in a broad bow from the crafts blunt prow four heads were gathered round a computer display that was analysing the very very faint and intermittent signals that were emanating from deep on the sea bed thats it said the owner of one of the heads finally can we be quite sure said the owner of another of the heads one hundred per cent positive replied the owner of the first head youre one hundred per cent positive that the ship which is crashed on the bottom of this ocean is the ship which you said you were one hundred per cent positive could one hundred per cent positively never crash said the owner of the two remaining heads hey he put up two of his hands im only asking the two officials from the safety and civil reassurance administration responded to this with a very cold stare but the man with the odd or rather the even number of heads missed it he flung himself back on the pilot couch opened a couple of beers one for himself and the other also for himself stuck his feet on the console and said hey baby through the ultraglass at a passing fish mr beeblebrox began the shorter and less reassuring of the two officials in a low voice yup said zaphod rapping a suddenly empty can down on some of the more sensitive instruments you ready to dive lets go mr beeblebrox let us make one thing perfectly clear yeah lets said zaphod how about this for a start why dont you just tell me whats really on this ship we have told you said the official byproducts zaphod exchanged weary glances with himself byproducts he said byproducts of what processes said the official what processes processes that are perfectly safe santa zarquana voostra exclaimed both of zaphods heads in chorus so safe that you have to build a zarking fortress ship to take the byproducts to the nearest black hole and tip them in only it doesnt get there because the pilot does a detour is this right to pick up some lobster ok so the guy is cool but i mean own up this is barking time this is major lunch this is stool approaching critical mass this is this is total vocabulary failure shut up his right head yelled at his left were flanging he got a good calming grip on the remaining beer can listen guys he resumed after a moments peace and contemplation the two officials had said nothing conversation at this level was not something to which they felt they could aspire i just want to know insisted zaphod what youre getting me into here he stabbed a finger at the intermittent readings trickling over the computer screen they meant nothing to him but he didnt like the look of them at all they were all squiggly with lots of long numbers and things its breaking up is that it he shouted its got a hold full epsilonic radiating aorist rods or something thatll fry this whole space sector for zillions of years back and its breaking up is that the story is that what were going down to find am i going to come out of that wreck with even more heads it cannot possibly be a wreck mr beeblebrox insisted the official the ship is guaranteed to be perfectly safe it cannot possibly break up then why are you so keen to go and look at it we like to look at things that are perfectly safe freeeooow mr beeblebrox said on official patiently may i remind you that you have a job to do yeah well maybe i dont feel so keen on doing it all of a sudden what do you think i am completely without any moral whatsits what are they called those moral things scruples scruples thank you whatsoever well the two officials waited calmly they coughed slightly to help pass the time zaphod sighed a what is the world coming to sort of sigh to absolve himself from all blame and swung himself round in his seat ship he called yup said the ship do what i do the ship thought about this for a few milliseconds and then after double checking all the seals on its heavy duty bulkheads it began slowly inexorably in the hazy blaze of its lights to sink to the lowest depths five hundred feet a thousand two thousand here at a pressure of nearly seventy atmospheres in the chilling depths where no light reaches nature keeps its most heated imaginings two footlong nightmares loomed wildly into the bleaching light yawned and vanished back into the blackness two and a half thousand feet at the dim edges of the ships lights guilty secrets flitted by with their eyes on stalks gradually the topography of the distantly approaching ocean bed resolved with greater and greater clarity on the computer displays until at last a shape could be made out that was separate and distinct from its surroundings it was like a huge lopsided cylindrical fortress which widened sharply halfway along its length to accommodate the heavy ultraplating with which the crucial storage holds were clad and which were supposed by its builders to have made this the most secure and impregnable spaceship ever built before launch the material structure of this section had been battered rammed blasted and subjected to every assault its builders knew it could withstand in order to demonstrate that it could withstand them the tense silence in the cockpit tightened perceptibly as it became clear that it was this section that had broken rather neatly in two in fact its perfectly safe said one of the officials its built so that even if the ship does break up the storage holds cannot possibly be breached three thousand eight hundred and twenty five feet four hipresha smartsuits moved slowly out of the open hatchway of the salvage craft and waded through the barrage of its lights towards the monstrous shape that loomed darkly out of the sea night they moved with a sort of clumsy grace near weightless though weighed on by a world of water with his righthand head zaphod peered up into the black immensities above him and for a moment his mind sang with a silent roar of horror he glanced to his left and was relieved to see that his other head was busy watching the brockian ultracricket broadcasts on the helmet vid without concern slightly behind him to his left walked the two officials from the safety and civil reassurance administration slightly in front of him to his right walked the empty suit carrying their implements and testing the way for them they passed the huge rift in the broken backed starship billion year bunker and played their flashlights up into it mangled machinery loomed between torn and twisted bulkheads two feet thick a family of large transparent eels lived in there now and seemed to like it the empty suit preceded them along the length of the ships gigantic murky hull trying the airlocks the third one it tested ground open uneasily they crowded inside it and waited for several long minutes while the pump mechanisms dealt with the hideous pressure that the ocean exerted and slowly replaced it with an equally hideous pressure of air and inert gases at last the inner door slid open and they were admitted to a dark outer holding area of the starship billion year bunker several more high security titanohold doors had to be passed through each of which the officials opened with a selection of quark keys soon they were so deep within the heavy security fields that the ultracricket broadcasts were beginning to fade and zaphod had to switch to one of the rock video stations since there was nowhere that they were not able to reach a final doorway slid open and they emerged into a large sepulchral space zaphod played his flashlight against the opposite wall and it fell full on a wildeyed screaming face zaphod screamed a diminished fifth himself dropped his light and sat heavily on the floor or rather on a body which had been lying there undisturbed for around six months and which reacted to being sat on by exploding with great violence zaphod wondered what to do about all this and after a brief but hectic internal debate decided that passing out would be the very thing he came to a few minutes later and pretended not to know who he was where he was or how he had got there but was not able to convince anybody he then pretended that his memory suddenly returned with a rush and that the shock caused him to pass out again but he was helped unwillingly to his feet by the empty suit which he was beginning to take a serious dislike to and forced to come to terms with his surroundings they were dimly and fitfully lit and unpleasant in a number of respects the most obvious of which was the colourful arrangement of parts of the ships late lamented navigation officer over the floor walls and ceiling and especially over the lower half of his zaphods suit the effect of this was so astoundingly nasty that we shall not be referring to again at any point in this narrative other than to record briefly the fact that it caused zaphod to throw up inside his suit which he therefore removed and swapped after suitable headgear modifications with the empty one unfortunately the stench of the fetid air in the ship followed by the sight of his own suit walking around casually draped in rotting intestines was enough to make him throw up in the other suit as well which was a problem that he and the suit would simply have to live with there all done no more nastiness at least no more of that particular nastiness the owner of the screaming face had calmed down very slightly now and was bubbling away incoherently in a large tank of yellow liquid an emergency suspension tank it was crazy he babbled crazy i told him we could always try the lobster on the way back but he was crazy obsessed do you ever get like that about lobster because i dont seems to me its all rubbery and fiddly to eat and not that much taste well i mean is there i infinitely prefer scallops and said so oh zarquon i said so zaphod stared at this extraordinary apparition flailing in its tank the man was attached to all kinds of lifesupport tubes and his voice was bubbling out of speakers that echoed insanely round the ship returning as haunting echoes from deep and distant corridors that was where i went wrong the madman yelled i actually said that i preferred scallops and he said it was because i hadnt had real lobster like they did where his ancestors came from which was here and hed prove it he said it was no problem he said the lobster here was worth a whole journey let alone the small diversion it would take to get here and he swore he could handle the ship in the atmosphere but it was madness madness he screamed and paused with his eyes rolling as if the word had rung some kind of bell in his mind the ship went right out of control i couldnt believe what we were doing and just to prove a point about lobster which is really so overrated as a food im sorry to go on about lobsters so much ill try and stop in a minute but theyve been on my mind so much for the months ive been in this tank can you imagine what its like to be stuck in a ship with the same guys for months eating junk food when all one guy will talk about is lobster and then spend six months floating by yourself in a tank thinking about it i promise i will try and shut up about the lobsters i really will lobsters lobsters lobsters enough i think im the only survivor im the only one who managed to get to an emergency tank before we went down i sent out the mayday and then we hit its a disaster isnt it a total disaster and all because the guy liked lobsters how much sense am i making its really hard for me to tell he gazed at them beseechingly and his mind seemed to sway slowly back down to earth like a falling leaf he blinked and looked at them oddly like a monkey peering at a strange fish he scrabbled curiously with his wrinkled up fingers at the glass side of the tank tiny thick yellow bubbles loosed themselves from his mouth and nose caught briefly in his swab of hair and strayed on upwards oh zarquon oh heavens he mumbled pathetically to himself ive been found ive been rescued well said one of the officials briskly youve been found at least he strode over to the main computer bank in the middle of the chamber and started checking quickly through the ships main monitor circuits for damage reports the aorist rod chambers are intact he said holy dingos dos snarled zaphod there are aorist rods on board aorist rods were devices used in a now happily abandoned form of energy production when the hunt for new sources of energy had at one point got particularly frantic one bright young chap suddenly spotted that one place which had never used up all its available energy was the past and with the sudden rush of blood to the head that such insights tend to induce he invented a way of mining it that very same night and within a year huge tracts of the past were being drained of all their energy and simply wasting away those who claimed that the past should be left unspoilt were accused of indulging in an extremely expensive form of sentimentality the past provided a very cheap plentiful and clean source of energy there could always be a few natural past reserves set up if anyone wanted to pay for their upkeep and as for the claim that draining the past impoverished the present well maybe it did slightly but the effects were immeasurable and you really had to keep a sense of proportion it was only when it was realised that the present really was being impoverished and that the reason for it was that those selfish plundering wastrel bastards up in the future were doing exactly the same thing that everyone realised that every single aorist rod and the terrible secret of how they were made would have to be utterly and forever destroyed they claimed it was for the sake of their grandparents and grandchildren but it was of course for the sake of their grandparents grandchildren and their grandchildrens grandparents the official from the safety and civil reassurance administration gave a dismissive shrug theyre perfectly safe he said he glanced up at zaphod and suddenly said with uncharacteristic frankness theres worse than that on board at least he added tapping at one of the computer screens i hope its on board the other official rounded on him sharply what the hell do you think youre saying he snapped the first shrugged again he said it doesnt matter he can say what he likes no one would believe him its why we chose to use him rather than do anything official isnt it the more wild the story he tells the more itll sound like hes some hippy adventurer making it up he can even say that we said this and itll make him sound like a paranoid he smiled pleasantly at zaphod who was seething in a suit full of sick you may accompany us he told him if you wish you see said the official examining the ultratitanium outer seals of the aorist rod hold perfectly secure perfectly safe he said the same thing as they passed holds containing chemical weapons so powerful that a teaspoonful could fatally infect an entire planet he said the same thing as they passed holds containing zetaactive compounds so powerful that a teaspoonful could blow up a whole planet he said the same thing as they passed holds containing thetaactive compounds so powerful that a teaspoonful could irradiate a whole planet im glad im not a planet muttered zaphod youd have nothing to fear assured the official from the safety and civil reassurance administration planets are very safe provided he added and paused they were approaching the hold nearest to the point where the back of the starship billion year bunker was broken the corridor here was twisted and deformed and the floor was damp and sticky in patches ho hum he said ho very much hum whats in this hold demanded zaphod byproducts said the official clamming up again byproducts insisted zaphod quietly of what neither official answered instead they examined the hold door very carefully and saw that its seals were twisted apart by the forces that had deformed the whole corridor one of them touched the door lightly it swung open to his touch there was darkness inside with just a couple of dim yellow lights deep within it of what hissed zaphod the leading official turned to the other theres an escape capsule he said that the crew were to use to abandon ship before jettisoning it into the black hole he said i think it would be good to know that its still there the other official nodded and left without a word the first official quietly beckoned zaphod in the large dim yellow lights glowed about twenty feet from them the reason he said quietly why everything else in this ship is i maintain safe is that no one is really crazy enough to use them no one at least no one that crazy would ever get near them anyone that mad or dangerous ring very deep alarm bells people may be stupid but theyre not that stupid byproducts hissed zaphod again he had to hiss in order that his voice shouldnt be heard to tremble of what er designer people what the sirius cybernetics corporation were awarded a huge research grant to design and produce synthetic personalities to order the results were uniformly disastrous all the people and personalities turned out to be amalgams of characteristics which simply could not coexist in naturally occurring life forms most of them were just poor pathetic misfits but some were deeply deeply dangerous dangerous because they didnt ring alarm bells in other people they could walk through situations the way that ghosts walk through walls because no one spotted the danger the most dangerous of all were three identical ones they were put in this hold to be blasted with this ship right out of this universe they are not evil in fact they are rather simple and charming but they are the most dangerous creatures that ever lived because there is nothing they will not do if allowed and nothing they will not be allowed to do zaphod looked at the dim yellow lights the two dim yellow lights as his eyes became accustomed to the light he saw that the two lights framed a third space where something was broken wet sticky patches gleamed dully on the floor zaphod and the official walked cautiously towards the lights at that moment four words came crashing into the helmet headsets from the other official the capsule has gone he said tersely trace it snapped zaphods companion find exactly where it has gone we must know where it has gone zaphod slid aside a large ground glass door beyond it lay a tank full of thick yellow liquid and floating in it was a man a kindly looking man with lots of pleasant laugh lines round his face he seemed to be floating quite contentedly and smiling to himself another terse message suddenly came through his helmet headset the planet towards which the escape capsule had headed had already been identified it was in galactic sector zz plural z alpha the kindly looking man in the tank seemed to be babbling gently to himself just as the copilot had been in his tank little yellow bubbles beaded on the mans lips zaphod found a small speaker by the tank and turned it on he heard the man babbling gently about a shining city on a hill he also heard the official from the safety and civil reassurance administration issue instructions that the planet in zz plural z alpha must be made perfectly safe
