the reivers william faulkner chapter grandfather said this is the kind of a man boon hogganbeck was hung on the wall it could have been his epitaph like a bertillon chart or a police poster any cop in north mississippi would have arrested him out of any crowd after merely reading the date it was saturday morning about ten oclock weyour greatgrandfather and iwere in the office father sitting at the desk totting up the money from the canvas sack and matching it against the list of freight bills which i had just collected around the square and i sitting in the chair against the wall waiting for noon when i would be paid my saturdays weeks wage of ten cents and we would go home and eat dinner and i would be free at last to overtake it was may the baseball game which had been running since breakfast without me the idea not mine your greatgrandfathers being that even at eleven a man should already have behind him one year of paying for assuming responsibility for the space he occupied the room he took up in the worlds jefferson mississippis anyway economy i would leave home with father immediately after breakfast each saturday morning when all the other boys on the street were merely arming themselves with balls and bats and glovesnot to mention my three brothers who being younger and therefore smaller than i were more fortunate assuming this was fathers logic or premise that since any adult man worth his salt could balance or stand off four children in economic occupancy any one of the children the largest certainly would suffice to carry the burden of the requisite economic motions in this case making the rounds each saturday morning with the bills for the boxes and cases of freight which our negro drivers had picked up at the depot during the week and delivered to the back doors of the grocery aifd hardware and farmers supply stores and bring the canvas sack back to the livery stable for father to count and balance it then sit in the office for the rest of the morning ostensibly to answer the telephonethis for the sum of ten cents a week which it was assumed i would live inside of thats what we were doing when boon came jumping through the door thats right jumping it was not really a high step up from the hallway even for a boy of eleven though john powell the head hostler had had son thomas the youngest driver find borrow takeanyway snafflefrom somewhere a wooden block as an intermediate step for me and boon could have taken it as he always did in his own sixfootfour stride but not this time jumping into the room in its normal state his face never looked especially gentle or composed at this moment it looked like it was about to explode right out from between his shoulders with excitement urgency whatever it was jumping on across the office toward the desk and already hollering at father look out mr maury get out of the way reaching lunging across father toward the lower drawer where the liverystable pistol lived i couldnt tell whether it was boon lunging for the drawer who knocked the chair it was a swivel chair on casters back or whether it was father who flung the chair back to make himself room to kick at boons reaching hand the neat stacks of coins scattering in all directions across the desk and father hollering too now still stomping either at the drawer or boons hand or maybe both god damn it stop it im going to shoot ludus boon hollered hes probably clean across the square by now look out mr maury no father said get away you wont let me have it boon said no god damn it father said all right boon said already jumping again back toward the door and out of it but father just sat there im sure you have often noticed how ignorant people beyond thirty and forty are i dont mean forgetful thats specious and easy too easy to say oh papa or grandpa or mama or grandma theyre just old they have forgotten because there are some things some of the hard facts of life that you dont forget no matter how old you are there is a ditch a chasm as a boy you crossed it on a footlog you come creeping and doddering back at thirtyfive or forty and the footlog is gone you may not even remember the footlog but at least you dont step out onto that empty gravity that footlog once spanned that was father then boon came jumping without warning into the office and almost knocked father chair and all over grabbling at the drawer where the pistol was until father managed to kick or stomp or whatever it was his hand away then boon turned and went jumping back out of the office and apparently obviously father thought that was all of it that it was finished he even finished cursing just on principle as though there were no urgency anywhere heeling the chair back to the desk and seeing the scattered money which would have to be counted all over now and then he started to curse at boon again not even about the pistol but simply at boon for being boon hogganbeck until i told him hes gone to try to borrow john powells i said what father said then he jumped too both of us across the office and down into the hallway and down the hallway toward the lot behind the stable where john powell and luster were helping gabe the blacksmith shoe three of the mules and one of the harness horses father not even taking time to curse now just hollering john boon john boon every three steps but he was too late this time too because boon fooled himus because john powells pistol was not just a moral problem in the stable it was an emotional one top it was a caliber snubnosed revolver quite old but in excellent condition because john had kept it that way ever since he bought it from his father the day he was twentyone years old only he was not supposed to have it i mean officially it did not exist the decree as old as the stable itself was that the only pistol connected with it would be the one which stayed in the bottom righthand drawer of the desk in the office and the mutual gentlemens assumption was that no one on the staff of the establishment even owned a firearm from the time he came on duty until he went back home let alone brought one to work with him yetand john had explained it to all of us and had our confederated sympathy and understanding a unified and impregnable front to the world and even to father himself if that unimaginable crisis had ever arisen which it would not have except for boon hogganbeck telling us john how he had earned the price of the pistol by doing outside work on his own time on time apart from helping his father on the farm time which was his own to spend eating or sleeping until on his twentyfirst birthday he had paid the final coin into his fathers hand and received the pistol telling us how the pistol was the living symbol of his manhood the ineffaceable proof that he was now twentyone and a man that he never intended to declined even to imagine the circumstance in which he would ever pull its trigger against a human being yet he must have it with him he would no more have left the pistol at home when he came away than he would have left his manhood in a distant closet or drawer when he came to work he told us and we believed him that if the moment ever came when he would have to choose between leaving the pistol at home or not coming to work himself there would have been but one possible choice for him so at first his wife had stitched a neat strong pocket exactly fitting the pistol on the inside of the bib of his overalls but john himself realised at once that this wouldnt do not that the pistol might fall out at some irretrievable moment but that the shape of it was obvious through the cloth it couldnt have been anything else but a pistol obvious not to us we all knew it was there from mr ballott the white stable foreman and boon his assistant whose duty was night duty and so he should have been at home in bed at this moment on down through all the negro drivers and hostlers down to the last lowly stall cleaner and even to me who only collected the saturday accumulation of freight bills and answered the telephone on even to old dan grinnup a dirty man with a tobaccostained beard who was never quite completely drunk who had no official position in the stable partly because of the whiskey maybe but mostly because of his name which was not grinnup at all but grenier one of the oldest names in the county until the family went to seedthe huguenot louis grenier who crossed the mountains from virginia and carolina after the revolution and came down into mississippi in the seventeen nineties and established jefferson and named itwho old dan lived nowhere and had no family save an idiot nephew or cousin or something still living in a tent in the river jungle beyond frenchmans bend which had once been a part of the grenier plantation until he old dan would appear never too drunk to drive it at the stable in time to take the hack to the depot and meet the pm and the am trains and deliver the drummers to the hotel or on duty all night sometimes when there were balls or minstrel or drama shows at the opera house at times at some cold and scornful pitch of drink he would say that once greniers led yoknapatawpha society now grinnups drove it holding his job some said because mr ballotts first wife had been his daughter though we in the stableall believed it was because when father was a boy he used to fox hunt with old dans father out at frenchmans bend obvious the pistol not only to us but to father himself because father knew about it too he had to know about it our establishment was too small too intricate too closely knit so fathers moral problem was exactly the same as john powells and both of them knew it and handled it as mutual gentlemen must and should if father were ever compelled to acknowledge the pistol was there he would have to tell john either to leave it at home tomorrow or not come back himself and john knew this and a gentleman too he himself would never be the one to compel father to acknowledge the pistol existed so instead of in the overall bib johns wife stitched the pocket just under the left armpit of the jumper itself invisible anyway unobtrusive when john was wearing the jumper or when in warm weather like now the jumper hung on johns private nail in the harness room that was the situation of the pistol when boon who was being paid to be and who in a sense had given his word that he would be at home in bed at this hour instead of hanging around the square where he would be vulnerable to what had sent him rushing back to the stable came jumping through the office door a minute ago and made father and john powell both liars only father was too late again boon fooled himus because boon knew about that nail in the harness room too and smart too too smart to come back up the hallway where he would have to pass the office when we reached the lot john and luster and gabe the three mules and the horse too were still watching the stillswinging side gate through which boon had just vanished carrying the pistol in his hand john and father looked at each other for about ten seconds while the whole edifice of entendredenoblesse collapsed into dust though the noblesse the oblige still remained it was mine john said yes father said he saw ludus on the square ill catch him john said take it away from him too say the word catch ludus somebody gabe said though short he was a tremendously big man bigger than boon with a terrifically twisted leg from an old injury in his trade he would pick up the hind foot of a horse or mule and lock it behind the warped knee and if there was somethinga postanythingfor him to hold to the horse or mule might throw itself but no more neither snatch that foot free nor get enough balance to kick him with the other one here luster you jump and catch aint nobody studying ludus john said ludus the safest man there i seen boon hogganbeckhe didnt say mister and he knew father heard him something he would never have failed to do in the hearing of any white man he considered his equal because john was a gentleman but father was competent for noblesse too it was that pistol which was unforgivable and father knew it shoot before say the word mr maury no father said you run to the office and telephone mr hampton thats right a hampton was sheriff then too tell him i said to grab mr boon as quick as he can father went toward the gate go with him gabe told luster he might need somebody to run for him and latch that gate so the three of us went up the alley toward the square me trotting now to keep up not really trying to overtake boon so much as to stay between boon and the pistol and john powell because as john himself had said nobody needed to study ludus because we all knew boons marksmanship and with boon shooting at ludus ludus himself was safe he ludus had been one of our drivers too until last tuesday morning this is what happened as reconstructed from boon and mr ballott and john powell and a little from ludus himself a week or two before ludus had found a new girl daughter or wife we didnt know which of a tenant on a farm six miles from town on monday evening when boon came in to relieve mr ballott for the night shift all the teams and wagons and drivers were in except ludus mr ballott told boon to telephone him when ludus came in and went home that was mr ballotts testimony this was boons corroborated in part by john powell father himself had gone home some time before mr ballott was barely out the front door when ludus came in the back way on foot ludus told boon that the tire on one of his wheels had loosened and he had stopped at our house and seen father who had told him to drive the wagon into the pond in the pasture where the wood of the wheel would swell back to the tire and stable and feed the mules in our lot and come and get them in the morning which you could have expected even boon to believe as john powell immediately did not since anyone who knew either would have known that whatever disposition he made of the wagon for the night father would have sent ludus to lead the team back to their stalls in the livery stable where they could be cleaned and fed properly but thats what boon said he was told which he said was why he didnt interrupt mr ballotts evening meal to notify him since father knew where the mules and wagon were and it was father not mr ballott who owned them now john powell telling it but reluctantly he would likely never have told it at all if boon had not made his johns silence about the truth a larger moral issue than his loyalty to his race once he saw ludus walk emptyhanded into the back door of the stable at the next coincident moment to mr ballotts departure by the front one leaving only boon in charge john didnt even bother to listen to what tale ludus would tell he simply went back through the hallway and across the lot into the alley and on to the end of the alley and was actually standing beside the wagon when ludus returned to it it now contained a sack of flour a gallon jug of coal oil and john said a nickel sack of peppermint candy this is about what happened because although johns word about any horse or mule while inside the stable was law inviolable even beyond boon right up to mr ballott or father himself out here in no mans land he was just another wage hand in maury priests livery stable and he and ludus both knew it maybe ludus even reminded him of this but i doubt it because all ludus needed to say was something like ji word gets back to maury priest about how i borried this wagon and team tonight maybe the same word gonter get back to him about whats sewed up in that jumper you wears and i dont think he said that either because he and john both knew that too just as they both knew that if ludus waited for john to report to father what ludus called the borrying of the wagon and team father would never know it and if john waited for ludus or any other negro in the stable or jefferson either to tell father about that pistol father would never know that either so ludus probably said nothing at all and john only said all right but if them mules aint back in their stalls without one sweat or whip mark on them and not even looking sleepy a good solid hour before mr ballott gets here tomorrow morning you will have already noticed how both of them had completely dismissed boon from the affair neither ludus to say mr boon knows these mules wont be in tonight aint he the boss until mr ballott comes back in the morning nor john to say anybody that would believe the tale you brought in here tonight in place of them mules aint competent to be the boss of nothing and i aint even good convinced yet that his name is boon hogganbeck mr maury aint just gonter know where that team and wagon wasnt last night hes gonter know where they was but john didnt say it and sure enough although luduss mules had been back in their stalls a good hour before daylight fifteen minutes after mr ballott reached the stable at six the next morning he sent for ludus and told him he was fired mr boon knowed my team was out ludus said he sent me himself to get him a jug of whiskey i brung it back to him about four this morning i didnt send you anywhere boon said when he come in here last night with that cockandbull story about them mules being in mr maurys lot i never even listened i didnt even bother to ask him where that wagon actually was let alone why he was in such a sweating need of a wagon and team last night what i told him was before he brought that wagon back this morning i would expect him to go by mack winbushs and bring me back a gallon of uncle cal bookwrights whiskey i give him the money for ittwo dollars and i brung you the whiskey ludus said i dont know what you done with it you brought me a half a jug of rotgut mainly lye and red pepper boon said i dont know what mr maurys going to do to you about keeping them mules out all night but it aint a circumstance to what calvin bookwright will do to you when i show him that whiskey and tell him you claim he made it mr winbush stays a solid eight miles from town ludus said it would a been midnight before i could get back to and stopped so thats why you needed a wagon boon said you finally tomcatted yourself clean out of jefferson and now you got to ramshack the country to locate another back window you can crawl in well youll have plenty of time now the only trouble is youll have to walk you tole me a jug of whiskey ludus said sullenly i brung you a jug it wasnt even half full boon said then to mr ballott hell fire you wont even have to give him a weeks pay now the weekly pay of drivers was two dollars this was remember he already owes me that for that whiskey what you waiting for for mr maury to come in hisself and fire him though if mr ballott and father had really intended to fire ludus for good they would have given him his weeks pay the very fact that they didnt indicated and ludus knew it that he was merely being docked a weeks pay with vacation for keeping a team out all night without proper authority next monday morning ludus would appear with the other drivers at the regular time and john powell would have his team ready for him as if nothing had happened only faterumorgossip had to intervene so father luster and i hurried up the alley toward the square me trotting now and still too late we hadnt even reached the end of the alley when we heard the shots all five of them whow whow whow whow whow like that then we were in the square and it wasnt far right at the corner in front of cousin isaac mccaslins hardware store we could see it there were plenty of them boon sure picked his day for witnesses first saturdays were trade days even then even in may when you would think people would be too busy getting land planted but not in yoknapatawpha county they were all there black and white one crowd where mr hampton the grandfather of this same little hub who is sheriff now or will be again next year and two or three bystanders were wrestling with boon and another crowd where another deputy was holding ludus about twenty feet away and still in the frozen attitude of running or frozen in the attitude of running or in the attitude of frozen running whichever is right and another crowd around the window of cousin ikes store which one of boons bullets they never did find where the other four went had shattered after creasing the buttock of a negro girl who was now lying on the pavement screaming until cousin ike himself came jumping out of the store and drowned her voice with his roaring with rage at boon not for ruining his window but cousin ike was young then but already the best woodsman and hunter this county ever had for being unable to hit with five shots an object only twenty feet away it continued to go fast doctor peabodys office was just across the street above christians drugstore with mr hampton carrying john powells pistol and leading luster and another negro man carried the girl still screaming and bleeding like a stuck pig up the stairs father following with boon then me and the deputy with ludus and as many more as could crowd onto the stairs until mr hampton stopped and turned and bellowed at them judge stevenss office was just down the gallery from doctor peabodys he was standing at the top of the steps as we came up so wei mean father and me and boon and ludus and the deputywent in there to wait for mr hampton to come back from doctor peabodys office it wasnt long all right mr hampton said it barely creased her buy her a new dress there wasnt anything under it and a bag of candy and give her father ten dollars and thatll settle boon with her i aint quite decided yet whatll settle him with me he breathed hard at boon a moment a big man with hard little gray eyes as big as boon in fact though not as tall all right he told boon he insulted me boon said he told son thomas i was a narrowasted son of a bitch now mr hampton looked at ludus all right he said i never said he was norrerasted ludus said i said he was norrorheaded what boon said thats worse judge stevens said of course its worse boon said cried cant you see and i aint even got any choice me a white man have got to stand here and let a damn mulewrestling nigger either criticise my private tail or state before five public witnesses that i aint got any sense cant you see because you cant take nothing back not nothing you cant even correct it because there aint nothing to correct neither one of them to he was almost crying now his big ugly florid walnuttough walnuthard face wrung and twisted like a childs even if i managed to get another pistol somewhere to shoot son thomas with id likely miss him too father got up quickly and briskly he was the only one sitting down even judge stevens was standing spraddled on the hearth before the cold fireplace with his hands under his coattails exactly like it was winter and there was a fire burning i must get back to work father said what does the old saw say about idle hands he said not to anybody i want both of them boon and this boy put under bond to keep the peace say a hundred dollars each i will make the bond only i want two mutual doubleaction bonds i want two bonds both of which will be abrogated fall due at the same moment that either one of them does anything thatthat i that dont suit you judge stevens said much obliged father said the same second that either one of them breaks the peace i dont know if that is legal or not i dont either judge stevens said we can try if such a bond is not legal it ought to be much obliged father said wefather and i and boonwent toward the door i could come back now without waiting to monday ludus said iffen you needs me no father said wefather and i and boonwent out down the stairs to the street it was still first saturday and trade day but thats all it was nowthat is until somebody else named boon hogganbeck got hold of another pistol we went on back along the street toward the stable father and i and boon he spoke now across the top of my head toward the back of father a dollar a week for two hundred dollars is a year and fortyeight weeks that window of ikes will be another ten or fifteen i reckon besides that girl that got in the way say two years and three months ive got about forty dollars in money if i gave you that as a cash down payment i still dont reckon youd put me and ludus and son thomas in one of the empty stalls and lock the door for ten minutes would you no father said chapter that was saturday ludus was back at work monday morning on the next friday my grandfatherthe other one mothers father your greatgrandmothers father died in bay st louis boon didnt actually belong to us i mean not solely to us the priests or rather i mean the mccaslins and edmondses of whom we priests are what might be called the cadet branch boon had three proprietors not only us as represented by grandfather and father and cousin ike mccaslin and our other cousin zachary edmonds to whose father mccaslin edmonds cousin ike on his twentyfirst birthday had abdicated the mccaslin plantation he belonged not just to us but to major de spain and general compson too until he died boon was a corporation a holding company in which the three of usmccaslins de spain and general compsonhad mutually equal but completely undefined shares of responsibility the one and only corporation rule being that whoever was nearest at the crises would leap immediately into whatever breach boon had this time created or committed or simply fallen heir to he boon was a mutual benevolent protective benefit association of which the benefits were all boons and the mutuality and the benevolence and the protecting all ours his grandmother had been the daughter of one of old issetibbehas chickasaws who married a white whiskey trader at times depending on the depth of his cups boon would declare himself to be at least ninetynine onefaradredths chickasaw and in fact a lineal royal descendant of old issetibbeha himself the next time he would offer to fight any man who dared even ultimate that he had one drop of indian blood in his veins he was tough faithful brave and completely unreliable he was six feet four inches tall and weighed two hundred and forty pounds and had the mentality of a child over a year ago father had already begun to say that at any moment now i would outgrow him in fact although he was obviously a perfectly normal fleshandblood biological result vide the moments in his cups when he was not merely ready and willing but even eager to fight any man or men either pro or con depending on how the drink had taken him for the right to ancestry and hence he had to have been somewhere during those first nine or ten or eleven years it was as if boon had been created whole and already nine or ten or eleven years old by the three of us mccaslinde spaincompson as a solution to a dilemma one day at major de spains hunting camp thats right the same camp which you will probably continue to call mccaslins camp for a few years after your cousin ike is gone just as weyour fatherscontinued to call it de spains camp for years after major de spain was gone but in the time of my fathers when major de spain bought or borrowed or leased the land however men managed to acquire valid titles in mississippi between and and built the lodge and stables and kennels it was his camp who culled and selected the men he considered worthy to hunt the game he decreed to be hunted and so in that sense not only owned who hunted it but where they hunted and even what the bear and deer and wolves and panthers also ranged it then less than twenty miles from jeffersonthe four or five sections of riverbottom jungle which had been a portion of old thomas sutpens vast kingly dream which in the end had destroyed not only itself but sutpen too which in those days was a sort of eastern gateway to the still almost virgin wilderness of swamp and jungle which stretched westward from the hills to the towns and plantations along the mississippi it was only twenty miles then our fathers could leave jefferson at midnight in buggies and wagons a man on a horse did it even quicker on the fifteenth of november and be on a deer or bearstand by daybreak even in the wilderness had retreated only twenty more miles the wagons bearing the guns and food and bedding had merely to start at sundown and now a northern lumber company had built a narrowgauge railroad for hauling logs which connected with the main line passing within a mile of major de spains new camp with a courtesy stop to let major de spain and his guests off to be met by the wagons which had gone in the day before though by we could already see the doom major de spain and the rest of that old group save your cousin ike and boon were gone now and there was gravel now all the way from jefferson to de spains flag stop their inheritors switched off their automobile engines to the sound of axes and saws where a year ago there had been only the voices of the running hounds because manfred de spain was a banker not a hunter like his father he sold lease land and timber and by it was mccaslins camp now theywewould load everything into pickup trucks and drive two hundred miles over paved highways to find enough wilderness to pitch tents in though by the automobile will be as obsolete to reach wilderness with as the automobile will have made the wilderness it seeks but perhaps theyyouwill find wilderness on the back side of mars or the moon with maybe even bear and deer to run it but then when boon materialized at the camp one day full panoplied and already ten or eleven or twelve years old there were only twenty miles for major de spain and general compson and mccaslin edmonds and walter ewell and old bob legate and the halfdozen others who would come and go to travel but general compson although he had commanded troops not too unsuccessfully as a colonel at shiloh and again not too unsuccessfully as a brigadier during johnstons retreat on atlanta was a little short in terrain topography and would promptly get lost ten minutes after he left camp the mule he preferred to ride would have brought him back at any time but not only a paroled confederate general but a compson too he declined to accept counsel or advice from a mute so as soon as the last hunter was in from the mornings drive everyone would take turns blowing a horn until general compson at last got in which was satisfactory anyway served until general compsons hearing began to fail too until finally one afternoon walter ewell and sam fathers who was half negro and half chickasaw indian had to track him down and camp in the woods with him all night facing major de spain with the alternative of either forbidding him to leave the tent or expelling him from the club when lo there was boon hogganbeck already a giant even at ten or eleven already bigger than general compson whose nurse he becamea waif who seemed to have nothing and know nothing but his name even cousin ike is not sure whether it was mccaslin edmonds or major de spam who found boon first where whoever bore him had abandoned him all ike knowsremembers is that boon was already there about twelve years old out at old carothers mccaslins place where mccaslin edmonds was already raising ike as if he was his father and now and without breaking stride took over boon too as though he had been boons father also though at that time mccaslin edmonds himself was only thirty anyway as soon as major de spain realised that he must either expel general compson from the club which would be difficult or forbid him to leave the camp which would be impossible and hence he must equip general compson with something resembling a boon hogganbeck there was the boon hogganbeck produced either by mccaslin edmonds or perhaps by both of themedmonds and de spain himselfin simultaneous crisis ike could remember that the loading of the bedding and guns and food into the wagon on the fourteenth of november with tennies jim grandfather of this bobo beauchamp of whom you will hear presently and sam fathers and boon he ike was only five or six then another four or five years before he would be ten and could make one also and mccaslin himself riding ahead on the horse to the camp where each morning boon would follow general compson on a second mule until by simple force probably since at twelve boon was already bigger than his charge boon would compel him to the right direction in time to reach camp before dark thus general compson made a woodsman of boon despite himself you might say in simple selfdefense but even eating at the same table and ranging the same woods and sleeping in the same rain even with walter ewell never made a marksman of him one of the camps favorite stories was about boons shooting told by walter ewell of being on a stand where he had left boon old general compson had gone to his fathers at lastor to whatever bivouac old soldiers of that war blue or gray either probably insisted on going to since probably no place would suit them for anything resembling a permanent stay and now boon was a regular hunter like anybody else and of hearing the hounds and realising that the deer was going to cross at boons stand then of hearing the five shots from boons ramshackle pump gun general compson had bequeathed it to him it had never been in the best condition while compson owned it and walter said his real surprise was that the gun had fired even twice without jamming let alone five times and then boons voice across the woods between them god damn yonder he goesl head him head him and how hewalter hurried across to boons stand and found the five exploded shells on the ground and not ten paces away the prints of the running buck which boon had not even touched then grandfather bought that automobile and boon found his souls mate by this time he was officially by mutual mccaslinedmondspriest consent even mccaslin edmonds having given up or seen the light at last when boon failed the third grade for the second time tooor maybe the real light mccaslin saw was that boon would never stay on any farm long enough to learn to be a farmer a member of the livery stable staff at first the jobs were mostly still the odd onesfeeding cleaning harness and buggies but i told you he had a way with horses and mules and soon he was a regular driver of hired vehicleshacks and cabs which met the daytime trams and the buggies and surreys and light wagons in which the drummers made the rounds of the country stores he lived in town now except when mccaslin and zachary both were away at night and boon would sleep in the house to protect the women and children i mean he lived in jefferson i mean he actually had a homea single rented room in what in my grandfathers time was the commercial hotel established in hopeful rivalry of the holston house but never making the grade in that rivalry but solid enough where juries were lodged and fed during court terms and where country litigants and horse and muletraders felt more at ease than among the carpets and brass cuspidors and leather chairs and linen tablecloths across town then in my time the snopes hotel with both handpainted esses upside down when mr flem snopes the banker murdered ten or twelve years ago by the mad kinsman who perhaps didnt believe his cousin had actually sent him to the penitentiary but at least could have kept him out or anyway tried to began to lead his tribe out of the wilderness behind frenchmans bend into town then for a brief time in the midthirties leased by a brassyhaired gentlewoman who came briefly from nowhere and went briefly back known to your father and the police as little chicago and which you know those glories but memories now as mrs rouncewels boarding house but in boons time it was still the commercial hotel in the intervals between sleeping on the floor of some compson or edmonds or priest kitchen he was living there when my grandfather bought the automobile my grandfather didnt want an automobile at all he was forced to buy one a banker president of the older bank of jefferson the first bank in yoknapatawpha county he believed then and right on to his death many years afterward by which time everybody else even in yoknapatawpha county had realised that the automobile had come to stay that the motor vehicle was an insolvent phenomenon like last nights toadstool and like the fungus would vanish with tomorrows sun but colonel sartoris president of the newer the mushroom merchants and farmers bank forced him to buy one or rather another insolvent a dreamy myopic gentianeyed mechanical wizard named buffaloe compelled him to because my grandfathers car wasnt even the first one in jefferson i dont count manfred de spains red emf racer although de spam owned it and drove it daily through jefferson streets for several years it had no more place in the decorous uxorious pattern of a community than manfred himself did both of them being incorrigible and bachelor not in the town but on it and up to no good like one prolonged unbroken saturday night even while manfred was actually mayor its very scarlet color being not even a scornful defiance of the town but rather a kind of almost inattentive disavowal grandfathers was not even the first automobile to see jefferson or vice versa it was not even the first one to inhabit jefferson two years before one had driven all the way down from memphis making the eightymile trip in less than three days then it rained and the car stayed in jefferson two weeks during which time we almost had no electric lights at all nor if the livery stable had depended solely on boon no public transportation either because mr buffaloe was the manthe one man the sole human being nearer than memphis who knew how towho kept the steamdriven electric plant running and from the moment the automobile indicated that it was not going any further at least today mr buffaloe and boon were inseparable from it like two shadows a big one and a little onethe hulking giant smelling of ammonia and harness oil and the little greasecovered sootcolored man with eyes like two bluebird feathers moulted onto a small lump of coal who would barely have tipped a hundred pounds with all his the citys too tools in ms pocketsthe one motionless staring at the car with a kind of incredulous yearning like a fixed bull the other dreaming at it gentle tender his grimed hand gentle as a womans as he touched it stroked it caressed it then the next moment plunged to the hips under the raised bonnet then it rained all that night and was still raining the next morning the owner of tihe car was told assuredby mr buffaloe it appeared a little strange since nobody had ever known him to be far enough away from the light plant or the little shop in his back yard to have ever used roads enough to prophesy their conditionthat the roads would be impassable for at least a week maybe ten days so the owner went back to memphis by train leaving the automobile to be stored in what in anybody elses back yard but mr buffaloes would have been a horse or cowbarn nor could we figure this how mr buffaloe a meek mild almost inarticulate little man in a constant condition of unworldly greasecoated dreamlike somnambulism how by what means what mesmeric and hypnotic gifts which until now even he could not have known he possessed he had persuaded the complete stranger to abandon his expensive toy into mr buffaloes charge but he did and went back to memphis and now when electric trouble occurred in jefferson someone had to go by foot or horse or bicycle out to mr buffaloes home on the edge of town whereupon mr buffaloe would appear vague and dreaming and without haste and still wiping his hands around the corner of his house from his back yard and by the third day father finally found out where boon would be had been during the time when heboon should have been in the livery stable because on that day boon himself revealed the secret spilled the beans with frantic and raging urgency he and mr buffaloe had come to what would have been physical battle had not mr buffaloethat apparently inexhaustible reservoir of surprases and capabilitiesdrawn a greasy and sootgrimed but perfectly efficient pistol on boon that was how boon told it he and mr buffaloe had been not merely in complete but instantaneous accord and understanding in the whole process of getting the automobile into mr buftaloes hands and the owner of it out of town so that boon naturally thought mr buftaloe would quickly solve the mystery of how to operate it and they would slip it out after dark and ride in it but to boons shocked and outraged amazement all mr buffaloe wanted was to find out why it ran hes ruined it boon said hes done took it all to pieces just to see what was inside he wont never get it all back together again but buftaloe did he stood mild and greasestained and gently dreaming when two weeks later the owner returned and cranked it up and drove away and a year later buffaloe had made one of his own engine gears and all into a rubbertired buggy that afternoon stinking noisily and sedately and not at all fast across the square he frightened colonel sartoriss matched carriage horses into bolting with the luckily empty surrey and more or less destroying it by the next night there was formally recorded into the archives of jefferson a city ordinance against the operation of any mechanically propelled vehicle inside the corporate limits so as president of the older the senior bank in yoknapatawpha county my grandfather was forced to buy one or else be dictated to by the president of the junior one you see what i mean not senior and junior in the social hierarchy of the town least of all rivals in it but bankers dedicated priests in the impenetrable and ineluctable mysteries of finance it was as though despite his lifelong ramrodstiff and unyielding opposition to refusal even to acknowledge the machine age grandfather had been vouchsafed somewhere in the beginning a sort ofto himnightmare vision of our nations vast and boundless future in which the basic unit of its economy and prosperity would be a small massproduced cubicle containing four wheels and an engine so he bought the automobile and boon found his souls lily maid the virgins love of his rough and innocent heart it was a winton flyer this was the first one hewe owned before the white steamer which grandfather traded it for when grandmother finally decided two years later that she couldnt bear the smell of gasoline at all you cranked it by hand while standing in front of it with no more risk provided you had remembered to take it out of gear than a bone or two in your forearm it had kerosene lamps for night driving and when rain threatened five or six people could readily put up the top and curtains in ten or fifteen minutes and grandfather himself equipped it with a kerosene lantern a new axe and a small coil of barbed wire attached to a light block and tackle for driving beyond the town limits with which equipment it couldand did once of which i shall speak presentlygo as far as memphis also all of us grandparents parents aunts cousins and children had special costumes for riding in it consisting of veils caps goggles gauntlet gloves and long shapeless throatclose neutralcolored garments called dusters of which i shall also speak later by this time mr buffaloe had long since taught boon to operate his homemade one they couldnt use the streets of jefferson of coursein fact never again did it cross the line of mr buffaloes front fencebut there was an area of open land behind his house which in time mr buffaloe and boon had beaten down and relatively smoothed into a fair motordrome so by the time boon and mr wordwin the cashier in grandfathers bank he was a bachelor one of our most prominent clubmen or men about town in ten years he had been a groomsman in thirteen weddings went to memphis by tram and brought the automobile back in less than two days this time a record boon was already destined to be the dean of jefferson motorcar drivers then as far as boons dream was concerned my grandfather abolished that automobile he merely bought it paid what boon called a sizable chunk of hard valuable cash for it looked at it thoroughly and inscrutably once and then eliminated it from circulation hegrandfather couldnt do that completely of course there was that arrogant decree of colonel sartoriss which hegrandfatherbeing the senior could not permit himself to allow to stand no matter what his own opinion of motor vehicles was in fact in this opinion he and colonel sartoris were absolutely eyetoeye until their deaths by which time all yoknapatawpha countys daytime air was odorous with gasoline fumes and its nights saturdays especially filled with the clash of colliding fenders and the squeal of brakes neither of them would lend a penny to any man they merely suspected was going to buy an automobile with it colonel sartoriss crime was simply in having taken the pas of his senior in a move which they both approvedofficially banning automobiles from jefferson even before they got there you see grandfather bought the automobile not as a defiance of colonel sartoriss decree it was simply a calm and deliberately considered abrogation of it even if only by weekly token even before colonel sartoriss decree grandfather had had ms carriage and horses moved from his back yard to the livery stable where they were actually more accessible to grandmothers telephone call than to her shouts from an upstairs back window because somebody always answered the telephone at the livery stable which ned in the kitchen or stable or wherever he happened to be or was supposed to happen to be when grandmother wanted him didnt always in fact he was more often nowhere in range of any voice from grandmothers house since one of them was his wifes so now we come to ned he was grandfathers coachman his wife the one he had then he had four was delphine grandmothers cook at that time he was uncle ned only to mother i mean she was the one who insisted that all us childrenthree of us that is because alexander couldnt call anybody anything yet call him uncle ned nobody else cared whether we did or not not even grandmother who was a mccaslin too and certainly not ned himself who hadnt earned it even by just living long enough for the fringe of hair embracing his bald skull to begin to turn gray let alone white it never did i mean his hair turn white nor even gray when he died at seventyfour except for having run through four wives he hadnt changed at all and who indeed may not have wanted to be called uncle none of these but only mother who in the mccaslin sense was not even kin to us insisted on it because henedwas a mccaslin born in the mccaslin back yard in he was our family skeleton we inherited him in turn with his legend which had no firmer supporter than ned himself that his mother had been the natural daughter of old lucius quintus carothers himself and a negro slave never did ned let any of us forget that he along with cousin isaac was an actual grandson to old timehonored lancaster where we moiling edmondses and priests even though three of usyou me and my grandfatherwere named for him were mere diminishing connections and hangerson so when boon and mr wordwin arrived with the car the carriage house was all ready for it newfloored anddoored with a brandnew padlock already in grandfathers hand while he walked slowly around the car looking at it exactly as he would have examined the plow or reaper or wagon the client too for that matter on which a wouldbe patron of the bank was offering to borrow money then he motioned boon to drive it on into the garage oh yes we already knew that was the name of an automobile shed even in even in mississippi what boon said drive it in grandfather said you aint even going to try it boon said no grandfather said boon drove it into the garage and just boon came out again there had been astonishment in his face now there was shock divination something like terror has it got a key grandfather said what boon said a catch a pin a hook something you start it with slowly boon took something from his pocket and put it into grandfathers hand shut the doors grandfather said and himself walked up and snapped the new padlock through the hasp and put that key into his pocket also now boon was fighting a battle with himself he was in crisis the matter was desperate iwe mr wordwin grandmother ned delphine and everybody else white and black who had happened along the street when the automobile came upwatched him win it or that initial engagement of pickets anyway ill come back after dinner so miss sarah that was grandmother can try it about one oclock i can come sooner if thatll be too late ill send word to the stable grandfather said because it was a fullscale action no mere squabbling of outposts it was all out win or lose logistics came into it and terrain feint thrust and parry deception but most of all patience the long view it lasted the remaining three days until saturday boon returned to the livery stable all that afternoon he was never very far from the telephone though not ostensibly obviously so revealing nothing he even did his workor so they thought until father discovered that boon on his own authority had deputised luster to meet with the hack the afternoon train whose arrival unless it was late always coincided with the time moment when grandfather left the bank for the day but although the battle was still a holding action requiring nay demandingconstant alertness and vigilance instead of a drive capable of carrying itself with its own momentum boon was still confident still on top sure i sent luster the way this town is growing we will need two hacks at them trains any day now and i been had my eye on luster for the second driver a good while now dont worry im going to watch him but no telephone by six oclock even boon admitted that today there would be none but it was a holding action nothing was lost yet and in the dark he could even shift his forces a little the next morning about ten he weentered the bank as though by passing afterthought lemme have the keys he told grandfather all that missippi dust and mud let alone the tennessee mud and dust already under it ill take the hose with me from the stable in case ned has mislaid yours out of sight somewhere grandfather was looking at boon just looking at him with no hurry like boon really was the one with the wagon or hay baler offering to borrow fifteen dollars i dont want the inside of the carriage house wet grandfather said but boon matched him as detached and even more indifferent with even more time to spare use sure sure remember the man said the engine ought to be run every day not to go nowhere just to keep the spark plugs and magneto from rusting and costing you twenty twentyfive dollars for a new one all the way from memphis or somewhere maybe all the way back to the factory i dont blame you all i know is what he told you id just have to take his word too but then you can afford it you own the automobile if you want to rust it up it aint nobody elses business a horse would a been different even if you hadnt even paid a hundred dollars for a horse youd a had me out there at daylight lunging him on a rope just to keep his guts working because grandfather was a good banker and boon knew it that grandfather not only knew when to foreclose but when to compound and cancel too he reached into his pocket and handed boon the two keysthe one to the padlock and the thing that turned the automobile on come on boon told me already turning while we were still up the street we could already hear grandmother hollering for ned from the upstairs back window though by the time we reached the gate she had quit as we crossed the back yard to get the hose delphine came out the kitchen door where is ned she said we been hollering for him all morning is he up there at the livery stable sure boon said ill tell him too just dont expect him neither ned was there he and two of my brothers were like a row of stairsteps trying to see through the cracks in the garage door i reckon alexander would have been there too except he couldnt walk yet i dont know why aunt callie hadnt thought of it yet then alexander was there mother came across the street from our house carrying him so maybe aunt callic was still washing diapers morning miss alison boon said morning miss sarah he said because now grandmother was there too with delphine behind her and now there were two more ladies neighbors still in their boudoir caps because maybe boon wasnt a banker nor even a very good trader either but he was proving to be a pretty damned good guerrilla fighter he went and unlocked the garage door and opened it ned was the first one inside well boon said to him you been here ever since daylight to peep at it through that crack what do you think about it i dont think nothing about it ned said boss priest could a bought the best twohundreddollar horse in yoknapatawpha county for this money there aint any twohundreddollar horse in yoknapatawpha county boon said if there was this automobile would buy ten of them go be hooking up that hose go be hooking up that hose lucius ned said to me he didnt even look around he went to the automobile door and opened it it was the back seat front seats didnt have doors in those days you just walked up and got in come on miss sarah you and miss alison ned said delphine can wait with the children for the next trip you go hook up that hose like i told you boon said i got to get it out of here before i can do anything to it you aint gonter tote it out in your hand is you ned said i reckon we can ride that far i reckon im gonter have to drive it so the sooner i starts the quicker it will be he said hee hee hee he said come on miss sarah will it be all right boon grandmother said yessum miss sarah boon said grandmother and mother got in before boon could close the door ned was already in the front seat get out of there boon said go ahead and tend to your business if you knows how to ned said i aint gonter touch nothing until i learns how and just setting here aint gonter learn me go on and hook up or whatever you does to it boon went around to the drivers side and set the switches and levers and went to the front and jerked the crank on the third pull the engine roared pâni grandmother cried its all right miss sarah boon hollered above the noise running back to the guiding wheel i dont care grandmother said get in quick im nervous boon got in and quieted the engine and shifted the levers a moment then the automobile moved quietly and slowly backward out of the shed into the lot the sunshine and stopped hee hee hee ned said be careful boon grandmother said i could see her hand gripping the stanchion of the top yessum boon said the automobile moved again backward beginning to turn then it moved forward still turning grandmothers hand still gripped the stanchion mothers face looked like a girls the car went slowly and quietly across the lot until it was facing the gate to the lane to the outside to the world and stopped and boon didnt say anything he just sat there behind the wheel the engine running smooth and quiet his head turned just enough for grandmother to see his face oh yes maybe he wasnt a negotiablepaper wizard like grandfather and there were folks in jefferson that would say he wasnt much of anything else either but for this skirmish anyway he was a skirmish fighter of consummate skill and grace grandmother sat for maybe a half a minute then she drew a long breath and expelled it no she said we must wait for mister priest maybe it wasnt a victory but anyway our sideboon had not only discovered the weak point in the enemys grandfathers front by suppertime that night the enemy himself would discover it too discover in fact that his flank had been turned the next afternoon saturday after the bank closed and each succeeding saturday afternoon and then when summer came every afternoon except when rain was actually falling grandfather in front beside boon and the rest of us in rotationgrandmother mother me and my three brothers and aunt callie that nursed us in turn including father and delphine and our various connections and neighbors and grandmothers close friends in their ordered rote in the linen dusters and goggles would drive through jefferson and the adjacent countryside aunt callie and delphine in their turns but not ned he rode in it once that one minute while it backed slowly out of the garage and the two minutes while it turned and moved slowly forward across the lot until grandmother lost her nerve and said no to the open gate and the public world but not again by the second saturday he had realised accepted anyway become convincedthat even if grandfather had ever intended to make him the official operator and custodian of the automobile he could have approached it only over boons dead body but although he declined to recognise that the automobile existed on the place he and grandfather had met on some unspoken gentlemens ground regarding it ned never to speak in scorn or derogation of its ownership and presence grandfather never to order ned to wash and polish it as he used to do the carriagewhich grandfather and ned both knew ned would have refused to do even if boon had let him by which grandfather visited on ned his only punishment for his apostasy he refused to give ned the public chance to refuse to wash the automobile before boon might have ihad a public chance to refuse to let him do it because that was when boon transferredwas transferred by mutual and instantaneous consentfrom the day shift at the stable to the night shift otherwise the livery business would have known him no more that part of our jefferson leisure class friends or acquaintances of fathers or maybe just friends of horses who could have used the stable as a permanent business addressif they had had any business or expected any mailwere less strangers there than boon ifwhenyou meaning father wanted boon now you sent me to grandfathers lot where he would be washing and polishing the automobile this even during those first weeks when it had not left the lot since last saturday and would not leave it again until the next one backing it out of the shed and washing it again each morning with tender absorption right down to the last spoke and nut then sitting guard over it while it dried hes going to soak all the paint off of it mr ballott said does boss know hes running the hose on that automobile four or five hours every day what if he did father said boon would still sit there in the lot all day looking at it put him on the night shift mr ballott said then he could do whatever he wants to with his daylight and john powell could go home and sleep in a bed every night for a change i already have father said as soon as i can find somebody to go to that lot and tell him there was a shuck mattress in the harness room on which until now john powell or one of the other drivers or hostlers under his command always spent the night mainly as night watchmen against fire now father installed a cot and mattress in the office itself where boon could get some sleep which he needed since now he could spend all day with complete immunity in grandfathers lot either washing the automobile or just looking at it so now every afternoon as many of us as the back seat would hold in our ordered turns would drive through the square and into the country grandfather had already installed the extraneous emergency gear to be as much and inseparable a part of the automobiles equipment as the engine which moved it but always through the square first you would have thought that as soon as he bought the automobile grandfather would have done what you would have done having bought the automobile for that end lain in wait for colonel sartoris and his carriage and ambushed bushwhacked him and really taught him how to pass ordinances restricting others rights and privileges without consulting his betters first but grandfather didnt do this we finally realised that he wasnt interested in colonel sartoris he was interested in teams vehicles because i told you he was a farsighted man a man capable of vision grandmother sitting tense and rigid and gripping the top stanchion and not even calling grandfather mister priest now as she had done as long as we had known her but calling him by his given name as though she were no kin to him the horse or team we were approaching reined back and braced to shy and sometimes even rearing and grandmother saying lucius lucius and grandfather if a man was driving and there were no women or children in the buggy or wagon saying quietly to boon dont stop keep going but slow now or when a woman had the lines telling boon to stop and himself getting out talking quietly and steadily to the spooked horse until he could get hold of the bit and lead the vehicle past and remove his hat to the ladies in the buggy and come back and get back into the front seat and only then answer grandmother we must get them used to it who knows there may be another automobile in jefferson in the next ten or fifteen years in fact that homemade dream which mr bufialoe had created singlehanded in his back yard two years ago came within an ace of curing grandfather of a habit which he had had since he was nineteen years old he chewed tobacco the first time he turned his head to spit out of the moving automobile we in the back seat didnt know what was going to happen until it was already too late because how could we none of us had ever ridden in an automobile before farther than this was the first trip from the carriage house to the lot gate let alone one going fifteen miles an hour and this was something else when we were going ten miles an hour boon always said we were doing twenty at twenty he always said forty we discovered a straight stretch about a half a mile long a few miles out of town where the automobile would get up to twentyfive where i heard him tell a group of men on the square that the automobile made sixty miles an hour this was before he knew that we knew that the thing on the dashboard which looked like a steam gauge was a speedometer so how could we be expected to besides it didnt make any difference to the rest of us we all had our goggles and dusters and veils and even if the dusters were new the spots and splashes were just brown spots and splashes and just because they were called dusters was no reason why they should not be called on to face anything else but dust maybe it was because grandmother was sitting on the left side in those days automobiles operated from the right side like buggies even henry ford a man as longvisioned as grandfather had not yet divined that the steering wheel would be on the left directly behind grandfather she said at once to boon stop the automobile and sat there not mad so much as coldly and implacably outraged and shocked she was just past fifty then she was fifteen when she and grandfather married and in all those fifty years she had no more believed that a man let alone her husband would spit in her face than she could have believed that boon for instance would approach a curve in the road without tooting the horn she said to nobody she didnt even raise her hand to wipe the spit away take me home now sarah grandfather said now sarah he threw the chew away and took out the clean handkerchief from bis other pocket but grandmother wouldnt even take it boon had already started to get out and go to a house we could see and get a pan of water and soap and a towel but grandmother wouldnt have that either dont touch me she said drive on so we went on grandmother with the long drying brown splash across one of her goggles and down her cheek even though mother kept on offering to spit on her handkerchief and wipe it off let me alone alison grandmother said but not mother she didnt mind tobacco not in the car maybe that was why but more and more that summer it would be just mother and us and aunt callie and one or two neighbor children in the back seat mothers face flushed and bright and eager like a girls because she had invented a kind of shield on a handle like a big fan light enough for her to raise in front of us almost as fast as grandfather could turn his head so he could chew now mother always alert and ready with the screen all of us were quick now in fact so that almost before the instant when grandfather knew he was going to turn his head to the left to spit the screen had already come up and all of us in the back seat had leaned to the right like we were on the same wire actually doing twenty and twentyfive miles an hour now because there were already two more automobiles in jefierson that summer it was as though the automobiles themselves were beating the roads smooth long before the money they represented would begin to compel smoother roads twentyfive years from now there wont be a road in the county you cant drive an automobile on in any weather grandfather said wont that cost a lot of money papa mother said it will cost a great deal of money grandfather said the road builders will issue bonds the bank will buy them our bank mother said buy bonds for automobiles yes grandfather said we will buy them but what about usi mean maury he will still be in the livery business grandfather said he will just have a new name for it priests garage maybe or the priest motor company people will pay any price for motion they will even work for it look at bicycles look at boon we dont know why then the next may came and my other grandfather mothers father died in bay st louis chapter it was saturday again the next one in fact ludus was going to start getting paid again every saturday night maybe he had even stopped borrowing mules it was barely eight oclock i wasnt even halfway around the square with the freight bills and my canvas sack to carry the money in just finishing in the farmers supply when boon came hi fast too quick for him i should have suspected at once no i should have known at once having known boon all my life let alone having watched him for a year now with that automobile he was already reaching for the money sack taking it right out of my hand before i could even close my fist leave it he said come on here i said ive barely started i said leave it shake it up hurry theyve got to make twentythree he said already turning he had completely ignored the unpaid freight bills themselves they were just paper the railroad company had plenty more of them but the sack contained money whos got to make twentythree i said number twentythree was the southbound morning train oh yes jefferson had passenger trains then enough of them so they had to number them to keep them separate goddammit boon said how can i break it gentle to you when you wont even listen your grandpa died last night we got to hurry he didnt i said cried he was on the front gallery this morning when we passed he was father and i both saw him either reading the paper or just standing or sitting there like he was every morning waiting for time to go to the bank who the hells talking about boss boon said i said your other grandpa your mas papa down there at jackson or mobile or wherever it is oh i said dont you even know the difference between bay st louis and mobile because it was all right now this was different bay st louis was three hundred miles i hardly knew grandfather lessep except twice at christmas in jefferson and three times we went down there in the summer also ihe had been sick a long time wemother and ushad been there last summer actually to see him enter what was to be his last bed even if we didnt know it then mother and aunt callie because your greatuncle alexander had arrived a month before had been down last whiter when they thought he was going to die i say if meaning mother to a child when an old person becomes sick he or she has already quitted living the actual death merely clears the atmosphere so to speak incapable of removing anything which was already gone all right all right boon said just come on jackson mobile new orleansall i know is its down that way somewhere and wherever it is they still got to catch that train and thatthe name new orleans not dropped so much as escaped into that contextshould have told me all revealed the whole of boons outrageous dream intent determination his later elaborate machinations to seduce me to it should merely have corroborated but maybe i was still recovering from shock also at that moment i didnt have as many facts as boon did so we just went on fast i trotting to keep up the shortest way across the square until we reached home where was much commotion it was barely two hours until the train and mother was far too busy to take time to mourn or grieve merely palefaced intent efficient because i now learned what boon had already told me twice that grandfather and grandmother were going to bury grandfather lessep also he and grandfather had been roommates in the same class at the university they had been groomsmen in each others wedding which possibly had a little something to do with why mother and father chose one another out of all the earth to look into her eyes forever more i understand you call it going steady and grandmother and grandmother lessep lived far enough apart to continue to be civil and even pleasant to the other mother of an only child besides that people took funerals seriously in those days not death death was our constant familiar no family but whose annals were dotted with headstones whose memorialees had been too brief in tenure to bear a name evenunless of course the mother slept there too in that one grave which happened more often than you would like to think not to mention the husbands and uncles and aunts in the twenties and thirties and forties and the grandparents and childless greatuncles and aunts who died at home then in the same rooms and beds they were born in instead of in cubicled euphemisms with names pertaining to sunset but the funerals the ritual ceremonial of interment with tenuous yet steelstrong threads capable of extending even further and bearing even more weight than the distance between jefferson and the gulf of mexico so grandfather and grandmother were also going to the funeral which meant only incidentally that lacking any other close kinfolks in town weme and my three brothers and aunt calliewould have to be sent out to cousin zachary edmondss farm seventeen miles away to stay until father and mother got back it meant only incidentally that father and mother would be gone four days what it actually meant was that grandfather and grandmother would not even come back after four days because grandfather never left jefferson at all even to go only to memphis without spending two or three days in new orleans which he loved either going or coming and this time they might quite possibly take mother and father with them it meant in fact what boon had already told me twice by exuberant and still unbelieving inadvertence that the owner of that automobile and everyone else having or even assuming authority over it would be three hundred miles from it for anywhere from four days to a week so all his clumsy machinations to seduce and corrupt me were only corroboration they were not even cumshaw lagniappe he could have taken the car alone and doubtless would if i had been incorruptible even knowing that someday he must bring it back or come back himself in order to face lesser music than he would if whengrandfathers police caught up with him because come back he must where else could he go who knew nowhere else to whom the words namesjefferson mccaslin de spain compsonwere not just home but father and mother both but some frayed ragtag judgment some embryo gleam of simple yetvirgin discretion and common sense persuaded him at least to try me first to have me by as a kind of hostage and he didnt need to try test me first when grown people speak of the innocence of children they dont really know what they mean pressed they will go a step further and say well ignorance then the child is neither there is no crime which a boy of eleven had not envisaged long ago his only innocence is he may not yet be old enough to desire the fruits of it which is not innocence but appetite his ignorance is he does not know how to commit it which is not ignorance but size but boon didnt know this he must seduce me and he had so little time only from the time the train left until dark he could have started cold from scratch tomorrow or next day or any day up to and including wednesday but today now was his best with the car visible to all jefferson already in motion already involved in the condition of departure it was as if the gods themselves had offered him these scotfree hours between eleventwo and sunset he to scorn ignore them at his peril the car came up grandfather and grandmother already in it with the shoebox of fried chicken and devilled eggs and cake for dinner since there wouldnt be a dining car until they changed to the limited at the junction at one oclock and grandmother and mother both knew grandfather and father well enough by this time to know they were not going to wait until one oclock to eat dinner no matter who was dead no grandmother too if the bereaved had been anybody but mother no thats wrong too grandmother had a wider range than her sons wife maybe all mother would have needed was to be a female its not men who cope with death they resist try to fight back and get their brains trampled out in consequence where women just flank it envelop it in one soft and instantaneous confederation of unresistance like cotton batting or cobwebs already destingered and harmless not merely reduced to size and usable but even useful like a penniless bachelor or spinster connection always available to fill an empty space or conduct an extra guest down to dinner their grips were already tied onto the fenders and son thomas had already brought mothers and fathers out to the street and now we all followed mother in her black veil and father with his black arm band us following with aunt callie carrying alexander goodbye mother said goodbye kissing us veil and all smelling like she always did but with something black in the smell too like the thin black veil which really hid nothing as if more than just a mechanical electric message over the copper wire had come that three hundred miles up from bay st louis oh yes i could smell it when she kissed me saying youre the big boy the man now you must help aunt callie with the others so they wont worry cousin louisa already getting quick into the automobile beside grandmother when boon said ill have to fill the tank for the trip out to mccaslin after dinner i thought lucius could come along now and help me on the way back from the depot you see how easy it was going to be it was too easy making you a little ashamed it was as if the very cards of virtue and rectitude were stacked against grandfather and grandmother and mother and father all right then against me too even the fact that automobiles were only two or three years old in jefferson abetted boonall right us mr rouncewell the oil company agent who supplied all the stores in yoknapatawpha county from his tanks on the side track at the depot for the last two years had also had a special tank of gasoline with a pump and a negro to pump it all boon or anyone else who wanted gasoline had to do was simply drive up and stop and get out and the negro would lift off the front seat and measure the tank with his special notched stick and fill the tank and collect the money or if mr rouncewell himself wasnt there let you yourself wiite down your name and how many gallons in a greasy ledger but although grandfather had owned the car almost a year now not one of themgrandfather or grandmother or father or motherhad either the knowledge about how cars operated or the temerity or maybe it was just the curiosity to question or challenge boon so he and i stood on the platform mother waved to us through the window as the train drew away now it was his move he would have to say something have to begin he had managed to get the decks cleared and me in his power at least until aunt callie began to wonder where i was to eat my dinner i mean boon didnt know he didnt have to say anything other than perhaps to tell me where we were going and even thatthe destinationdidnt matter he had learned nothing since about human beings and apparently had even forgot what he once must have known about boys and now boon himself didnt know how to begin he had prayed for luck and immediately by return post you might say had been vouchsafed more than he knew what to do with they have told you before this probably that fortune is a fickle jade who never withholds but gives either good or bad more of the former than you ever believe perhaps with justice that you deserve more of the latter than you can handle so with boon so all he said was well nor did i help him i took that revenge all right revenge on whom not on boon of course on me my shame perhaps on father and mother who had abandoned me to the shame perhaps on grandfather whose automobile had made the shame available who knows perhaps on mr buftaloe himselfthat rapt and divinely stricken somnambulist who had started the whole thing two innocent years ago but i did feel sorry for boon because he had so little time it was after eleven now aunt callie would be expecting me back in a matter of minutes not because she knew it couldnt take more than ten minutes to get back home after she heard twentythree whistle for the lower crossing but because she would already be in a driving impatience to get us all fed and on the way to mccaslin she had been born in the country and still preferred it boon wasnt looking at me he very carefully wasnt looking at me three hundred miles he said good thing somebody invented trains if theyd a had to go by mule wagon like folks used to they couldnt even get there in ten days let alone back in ten days too father said four days i said thats right boon said so he did maybe we got four days to get back to the house in but that still dont give us forever we went back to the car and got in it but he didnt start it maybe when boss gets back in te four days hell let me learn you to run this thing youre big enough besides you already know how have you ever thought about that no i said because he aint going to let me well you dont need to rush at it you got four days for him to change his mind in though my guess is nearer ten still he didnt move to start the car ten days he said how far do you reckon this automobile could travel in ten days father said four i said all right he said how far in four days i aint going to know that either i said because aint anybody around here going to find out to tell me all right he said he started the car suddenly and backed and turned it already going fast neither toward the square nor toward mr rouncewells gasoline pump i thought we had to get gasoline i said we were going fast i changed my mind boon said ill tend to that just before we leave for mccaslin after dinner then so much of it wont evaporate away just standing around we were in a lane now going fast between negro cabins and vegetable patches and chicken yards with chickens and mongrel dogs leaping frantically from the dust just in time out of the lane and into a vacant field a waste place marked faintly with tire tracks but no hooves and now i recognised it mr buffaloes homemade motordrome where colonel sartoriss law had driven him two years ago and where he had taught boon to operate an automobile and still i didnt understand until boon wrenched the car to a stop and said move over here so i was late for dinner after all aunt gallic was already standing on the front gallery carrying alexander and already yelling at boon and me even before he stopped the car to let me out because boon licked me in fair battle after all evidently he hadnt quite forgot all he remembered from his own youth about boys i know better now of course and i even knew better then that boons fall and mine were not only instantaneous but simultaneous too back at the identical instant when mother got the message that grandfather lessep was dead but thats what i would have liked to believe that boon simply licked me anyway thats what i told myself at the time that secure behind that inviolable and inescapable rectitude concomitant with the name i bore patterned on the knightly shapes of my male ancestors as bequeathed nay compelledto me by my fathers wordofmouth further bolstered and made vulnerable to shame by my mothers doting conviction i had been merely testing boon not trying my own virtue but simply testing boons capacity to undermine it and in my innocence trusting too much in the armor and shield of innocence expected demanded assumed more than that frail milanese was capable of withstanding i say frail milanese not advisedly but explicitly having noticed in my time how quite often the advocates and even the practitioners of virtue evidently have grave doubts of their own regarding the impregnability of virtue as a shield putting their faith and trust not in virtue but rather in the god or goddess whose charge virtue is bypassing virtue as it were in allegiance to the overgoddess herself in return for which the goddess will either divert temptation away or anyhow intercede between them which explains a lot having likewise noticed in my time that the goddess in charge of virtue sems to be the same one in charge of luck if not of folly also so boon beat me in fair battle using as a gentleman should and would gloves when he stopped the car and said move over i thought i knew what he intended we had done this before at four or five convenient and discreet times in grandfathers lot me sitting on boons lap holding the wheel and steering while he let the automobile move slowly in a low gear across the lot so i was ready for him i was already en garde and had even begun the counterthrust opening my mouth to say its too hot to sit on anybody today besides we better get on back on home when i saw that he was already out of the car on his side while he was still speaking standing there with one hand on the wheel and the engine still running for another second or two i still couldnt believe it hurry up he said any minute now callie will come running out of that lane toting that baby under one arm and already yelling so i moved under the wheel and with boon beside me over me across me one hand on mine to shift the gears one hand on mine to regulate the throttle we moved back and forth across that vacant sunglared waste forward a while backward a while intent timeless boon as much as i immersed rapt steadying me he was playing for such stakes you see out of time beyond it invulnerable to time until the courthouse clock striking noon a halfmile away restored us hurled us back into the impending hard world of finagle and deception all right boon said quick not even waiting but lifting me bodily across him as he slid under the wheel the car already rushing back across the field toward home we talking mantoman now mutual in crime confederate of course but not coeval yet because of my innocence i already beginning to say what do i do now youll have to tell me when once again boon spoke first and made us equal too have you figgered how to do it we aint got much time all right i said go on get on back to the house before aunt gallic starts hollering so you see what i mean about virtue you have heardor anyway you will people talk about evil times or an evil generation there are no such things no epoch of history nor generation of human beings either ever was or is or will be big enough to hold the unvirtue of any given moment any more than they could contain all the air of any given moment all they can do is hope to be as little soiled as possible during their passage through it because what pity that virtue does notpossibly cannottake care of its own as nonvirtue does probably it cannot who to the dedicated to virtue offer in reward only cold and odorless and tasteless virtue as compared not only to the bright rewards of sin and pleasure but to the ever watchful unflagging omniprescient skillthat incredible matchless capacity for invention and imaginationwith which even the tottering footsteps of infancy are steadily and firmly guided into the primrose path because oh yes i had matured terrifyingly since that clock struck two minutes ago it has been my observation that except in a few scattered cases of what might be called malevolent hyperprematurity children like poets lie rather for pleasure than profit or so i thought i had until then with a few negligible exceptions involving simple selfdefense against creatures my parents bigger and stronger than me but not any more or anyway not now i was as bent as boon andduring the next step anywayeven more culpable because i realised no knew it was obvious boon himself admitted it in so many words i was smarter than boon i realised felt suddenly that same exultant feverflash which faustus himself must have experienced that of we two doomed and irrevocable i was the leader i was the boss the master aunt gallic was already standing on the front gallery carrying alexander and yelling dry up i said aint dinner ready the automobile broke down boon fixed it we never had time to get the gasoline and now i have to eat in a hurry and go back and help him fill the tank i went back to the dining room dinner was already on the table lessep and maury were already eating aunt gallic had already dressed them she had dressed them to go seventeen miles out to cousin zacks to spend four days as if they were going to memphis i dont know why unless it was because she didnt have anything else to do between the time mother and father left and dinner because maury and alexander would both have to take a nap before we could leave but by the front of his blouse she would have to wash maury off and dress him again even then i finished before they did and went back aunt gallic was still yelling not loud in the house of course but what could she do singlehandedand a negroagainst nonvirtue across the street to grandfathers ned had probably left for town as soon as the automobile drove off but he would probably come back for his dinner he had we stood in the back yard he blinked at me quite often most of the time in fact his eyes had a reddish look like a foxs why dont you aim to stay out there he said i promised some fellows we would slip off tomorrow and try a new fishing hole one of them knows about ned blinked at me so you aims to ride out to mccaslin with boon hogganbeck and then turn right around and come back with him only you got to have something to tell miss louisa so shell let you come back and so you needs me to front for you no i said i dont need anything from you im just telling you so youll know where i am and they wont blame you i aint even going to bother you im going to stay with cousin ike before the rest of them came i mean my brothers when mother and father were out late at night and grandfather and grandmother were gone too i used to stay with ned and delphine sometimes i would sleep in their house all night just for fun i could have done that now if it would have worked but cousin dee lived alone in a single room over his hardware store even if ned or somebody else concerned asked him pointblank if i was with him saturday night it would be at least monday by then and i had already decided quick and hard not to think about monday you see if only people didnt refuse quick and hard to think about next monday virtue wouldnt have such a hard and thankless time of it i see ned said you aint needing nothing from me you just being bighearted to save me bother and worry over you save everybody bother and worry that conies around wanting to know why you aint out at mccaslin where your paw told you to be he bunked at me hee hee hee he said all right i said tell father i went fishing on sunday while they were gone see if i care i aint fixing to tell nobody nothing about you he said you aint none of my business yous callies business unto your maw gets back unlessen you gonter transfer to mr ikes business for tonight like you said he blinked at me when is boon hogganbeck coming for yawl pretty soon now i said and you better not let father or boss hear you calling him boon hogganbeck i calls him mister in plenty of time for him to earn it ned said let alone deserve it he said hee hee hee you see i was doing the best i could my trouble was the tools i had to use the innocence and the ignorance i not only didnt have strength and knowledge i didnt even have time enough when the fates godsall right nonvirtuegive you opportunities the least they can do is give you room but at least cousin ike was easy to find on saturday you bet he said come and stay with me tonight maybe well go fishing tomorrowjust dont tell your father no sir i said not stay with you tonight im going to stay with ned and delphine like i always do i just wanted you to know since mothers not here where i can tell her i mean ask her you see doing the best i could with what i had knew not that i was losing faith in ultimate success it simply seemed to me that nonvirtue was wasting in merely testing me that time which was urgent and even desperate for greater ends i went back home not running jefferson must not see me running but as fast as i could without it you see i did not dare trust boon unbacked in aunt callies hands i was in time in fact it was boon and the automobile who were late aunt callie even had maury and alexander redressed again if they had had naps since dinner it was the shortest fastest sleep on record in our house also ned was there where he had no business being no thats not right i mean his being there was completely wrong not being at our house he was often there but being anywhere where he could be doing something useful with grandfather and grandmother out of town because he was carrying the baggage out the wicker basket of alexanders diapers and other personal odds and ends the grips containing mine and lesseps and maurys clothes for four days and aunt callies clothwrapped bundle lumping them without order at the gate and telling aunt callie you might just as well set down and rest your feet boon hogganbecks done broke that thing and is somewhere trying to fix it if you really wants to get out to mccaslin before suppertime telefoam mr ballott at the stable to send son thomas with the carriage and ill drive you out there like folks ought to travel and after a while it began to look like ned was right half past one came which time alexander and maury could have spent sleeping and no boon then maury and alexander could have slept another half an hour on top of that ned had said i tole you so so many times by now that aunt callie had quit yelling about boon and yelled at ned himself until he went and sat in the scuppernong arbor she was just about to send me to look for boon and the automobile when he drove up when i saw him i was terrified he had changed his clothes i mean he had shaved and he had on not merely a white shirt but a clean one with a collar and necktie without doubt when he got out of the car to load us in he would have a coat over his arm and the first thing aunt callie would see when she reached the car would be his grip on the floor horror but rage too not at boon i discovered realised that at once at myself who should have known anticipated this having known i realised this too now all my life that who dealt with boon dealt with a child and had not merely to cope with but even anticipate its unpredictable vagaries not the folly of boons lack of the simplest rudiments of common sense but the shame of my failure to anticipate assume he would lack them saying crying to whoever it is you indict in such crises dont you realise i aint but eleven years old how do you expect me to do all this at just eleven years old dont you see you are putting on me more than i can handle but in the next second rage at boon too not that his stupidity had now wrecked for good our motor trip to memphis thats right memphis as our destination has never been mentioned either to you or between boon and me why should it have been where else did we have to go indeed where else could anyone in north mississippi want to go some aged and finished creature on his or her deathbed might contemplate or fear a more distant destination but they were not boon and me in fact at this moment i wished i had never heard of memphis or boon or automobiles either i was on colonel sartoriss side now to have abolished mr buffaloe and his dream both from the face of the earth at the instant of its inception my rage at boon was for having destroyed cast down with that one childish blow like the blind kick of an infants foot the precarious and frantic ramshackle of my lies and false promises and false swearing revealing the clayfooted sham for which i had barterednay damned my soul that or maybe the exposing of the true shoddy worthlessness of the soul i had been vain enough to assume the devil would pay anything for like losing your maidenhead through some shabby inattentive mischance such as not watching where you were going innocent even of pleasure let alone of sin then even the rage was gone nothing remained nothing i didnt want to go anywhere be anywhere i mean i didnt want to be is anywhere if i had to be something i wanted it to be was i said and i believed it i know i believed it because i have said it a thousand times since and i still believe it and i hope to say it a thousand times more in my hfe and i defy anyone to say i will not believe it will never lie again its too much trouble its too much like trying to prop a feather upright in a saucer of sand theres never any end to it you never get any rest youre never finished you never even use up the sand so that you can quit trying only nothing happened boon got out without any coat ned was already loading our grips and baskets and bundles into the car he said grimly hee hee hee he said come on get started so you can break down and still have time to fix it and get back to town before dark so he was talking to boon now he said are you coming back to town before you leaves then boon said leave for where leave to eat supper ned said where does anybody with good sense leave to do at sundown oh boon said you worry about your supper thats the only supper you got to worry about eating we got in and started me in front with boon and the rest of them in the back we crossed the square crowded with saturday afternoon and then we were out of town but there we were i mean we were no forrader we would come presently to the fork of the road which led to cousin zacks and we would even be going in the wrong direction and even if it had been the right direction we still would not be free as long as we still had aunt callie and lessep and maury and alexander in the back seat we were only free of ned eing where nobody in the world had expected him to be saying hee hee hee and are you coming back to town before boon had never once looked at me not i at him nor had he spoken to me either possibly he sensed that he had frightened me with his clean shirt and collar and necktie and the shave in the middle of the day and all the rest of the giveaway aura of travel departure separation severance sensed that i was not only frightened but angry that i had been vulnerable to fright going on the sunny early afternoon road stretching on ahead for the seventeen miles during which something would have to be decided agreed upon on across the bright may land our dust spurting and coiling behind us unless we had to slow down for a bridge or a sandy stretch which required the low gears the seventeen miles which would not last forever even though there were seventeen of them the mileposts diminishing much too rapidly while something had to be done decided sooner and sooner and nearer and nearer and i didnt know what yet or maybe just something said a voice noise a human sound since no matter what bitter forfeit nonvirtue may afterward wrench and wring from you loneliness solitude silence should not be part of it but at least boon tried or maybe with him it was just the silence too and any unsilence were better no matter how foolish nor longago predoomed no it was more than that we had less than half the distance left now and something had to be done started fusedoff the roads are sure fine now everywhere even further than yoknapatawpha county a man couldnt want better roads for a long trip like a automobile funeral or something than they are now how far do you reckon this car could go between now and sundown you see addressed to nobody like the drowning man thrusting one desperate hand above the surface hoping there might be a straw there he found none i dont know aunt callie said from the back seat holding alexander who had been asleep since we left town and didnt deserve a car ride of one mile let alone seventeen and you aint gonter know neither unlessen you studies it out setting in that front seat locked up in that shed in bosss back yard tonight now we were almost there so you want boon said out of the side of his mouth just exactly loud enough for me to hear aimed exactly at my right ear like a gun or an arrow or maybe a handful of sand at a closed window shut up i said exactly like him the simple and cowardly thing would be to tell him suddenly to stop and as he did so leap from the car already running presenting to aunt callie the splitsecond alternative either to abandon alexander to boon and try to run me down in the bushes or stick with alexander and pursue me with simple yelling i mean have boon drive on and leave them at the house and i to spring out from the roadside and leap back aboard as he passed going back to town or any direction opposite from all who would miss me and have authority over me the cowardly way so why didnt i take it who was already a lost liar already damned by deceit why didnt i go the whole hog and be a coward too be irrevocable and irremediable like faustus became glory in baseness make compel my new master to respect me for my completeness even if he did scorn my size only i didnt it wouldnt have worked one of us anyway had to be practical granted that boon and i would be well on our way before cousin louisa could send someone to the field where cousin zack would be at three oclock in the afternoon during planting time and granted that cousin zack couldnt possibly have overtaken us on his saddle horse he wouldnt have tried to he would have ridden straight to town and after one minute each with ned and cousin ike he would have known exactly what to do and would have done it using the telephone and the police we were there i got out and opened the gate the same posts of old lucius quintus carotherss time your present cousin carothers has a cattle guard in it now so automobiles can cross not owning hooves and we went on up the locust drive toward the house it is still there the tworoom mudchinked log half domicile and half fort which old lucius came with his slaves and foxhounds across the mountains from carolina in and built it is still there somewhere bidden beneath the clapboards and greek revival and steamboat scrollwork which the women the successive edmondses marry have added to it cousin louisa and everybody else on the place had already heard us approaching and except probably the ones cousin zack could actually see from bis horse were all on the front gallery and steps and the yard when we drove up and stopped all right boon said again out of the side of his mouth do you want because as you say nowadays this was it no time any more let alone privacy to get someanyinkling of what he now must desperately know because wehe and iwere so new at this you see we were worse than amateurs innocents complete innocents at stealing automobiles even though neither of us would have called it stealing since we intended to return it unharmed and even if people the world jefferson anyway had just let us alone unmissed even if i could have answered him if he had asked because it was even worse for me than for him both of us were desperate but mine was the more urgent desperation since i had to do something and quick in a matter of seconds now while all he had to do was sit in the car with at most his fingers crossed i didnt know what to do now i had already told more lies than i had believed myself capable of inventing and had had them believed or at least accepted with a consistency which had left me spellbound if not already appalled i was in the position of the old negro who said here i is lord if you wants me saved you got the best chance you ever seen standing right here looking at you i had shot my bow boons too if nonvirtue still wanted either of us it was now her move which she did she was dressed as cousin zachary edmonds he came out the front door at that moment and at the same moment i saw that a negro boy in the yard was holding the reins of his saddle horse you see what i mean zachary edmonds whom jefferson never saw on a weekday between the first groundbreaking in march and layingby in july had been in town this morning something urgent about the grist mill and had stopped in cousin ikes store barely minutes after i had done so myself which dovetailed neatly and exactly with the hour and more nonvirtue had required to shave boon and change his shirt had given cousin zack the exact time necessary to ride home and be getting off his horse at his doorstep when they heard us coming he saidto me what are you doing out here ike told me you were going to stay in town tonight and he is going to take you fishing tomorrow so of course aunt callie began yelling then so i didnt need to say anything at all even if i had known anything to say fishing she hollered on sunday if his paw could hear that he would jump off that train this minute without even waiting to telegraph his maw too miss alison aint told him to stay in town with no mister ike nor anybody else she told him to come on out here with me and these other chillen and if he dont behave hisself mister zack would make him all right all right cousin zack said stop yelling a minute i cant hear him maybe hes changed his mind have you sir i said yes sir i mean no sir well which are you going to stay out here or are you going back with boon yes sir i said im going back cousin ike told me to ask you if i could and aunt callie yelled again she had never really stopped except for maybe that one long breath when cousin zack told her to but that was all she still yelling and cousin zack saying stop it stop it stop it i cant hear my ears if ike dont bring him out tomorrow ill send in for him monday i went back to the car boon had the engine already running well ill be damned he said not loud but with complete respect even awe a little come on i said get away from here we went on smoothly but quick faster back down the drive toward the gate maybe were wasting something just spending it on a automobile trip he said maybe i ought to use you for something thats got money in it just get on i said because how could i tell him how say it to him im sick and tired of lying of having to lie because i knew realised now that it had only begun there would be no end to it not only no end to the lies i would continue to have to tell merely to protect the ones i had already told but that i would never be free of the old wornout ones i had already used and exhausted we went back to town we went fast this time if there was scenery now nobody in that automobile used any of it it was going on five oclock now boon spoke tense and urgent but quite composed we got to let it cool awhile they saw me drive out of town taking you folks out to mccaslin theyll see me come back with just you and me alone theyll expect to see me put the car back in bosss carriage house they got to see me and you but separate just walking around like it wasnt nothing going on but how could i say that either no lets go now if ive got to tett more lies at least let it be to strangers he was still talking car what was that he said about were we coming back through town before we left what who said ned back there just before we left town i dont remember i said what about the car where to leave it while i take a santer around the square and you go home and get a clean shirt or whatever youll need i had to unload all the stuff out at mccaslin remember yours too i mean just in case some meddling busybody is hanging around just on the happenchance we both knew who he meant why cant you lock it in the carriage house i aint got the key he said all i got is the lock boss took the key away from me this morning and unlocked the lock and give the key to mr ballott to keep until he gets back im supposed to run the car in as soon as i get back from mccaslin and lock the lock shut and boss will telegraph mr ballott what train to unlock the door so i can meet them then well just have to risk it i said yes well have to risk it maybe with boss and miss sarah gone even delphine aint going to see him again until monday morning so we risked it boon drove into the carriage house and got his grip and coat down from where he had hidden them in the loft and reached up again and dragged down a folded tarpaulin and put his grip and coat in on the floor of the back seat the gasoline can was all ready a brandnew fivegallon can which grandfather had had the tinsmith who made the toolbox more or less rebuild until it was smelltight since grandmother already didnt like the smell of gasoline which we had never used yet because the automobile had never been this far before the funnel and the chamois strainer were already in the toolbox with the tire tools and jack and wrenches that came with the car and the lantern and axe and shovel and coil of barbed wire and the block and tackle which grandfather had added along with the tin bucket to fill the radiator when we passed creeks or barrow pits he put the can it was full maybe that was what took him that extra tune before he came for us in the back and opened the tarpaulin not spreading it but tumbling it into the back until everything was concealed to just look like a jumbled mass of tarpaulin well shove yours under the same way he said then it wont look like nothing but a wad of tarpollyon somebody was too lazy to fold up what you better do is to go home and get your clean shirt and come straight back here and wait i wont be long just santer around the square in case ike wants to start asking questions too then well be gone we closed the door boon started to hang the open padlock back in the staple no i said i couldnt even have said why so fast i had progressed in evil put it in your pocket but he knew why he told me you damn right he said we done gone tihrough too much to have somebody happenchance by and snap it shut because they thought i forgot to i went home it was just across the street a filling station is there now and what was grandfathers house is now chopped into apartments precarious of tenure the house was empty unlocked of course since nobody in jefferson locked mere homes in those innocent days it was only a little after five nowhere near sundown yet the day was finished done for the empty silent house was not vacant at all but filled with presences like held breath and suddenly i wanted my mother i wanted no more of this no more of free will i wanted to return relinquish be secure safe from the sort of decisions and deciding whose foster twin was this having to steal an automobile but it was too late now i had already chosen elected if i had sold my soul to satan for a mess of pottage at least i would damn well collect the pottage and eat it too hadnt booa himself just reminded me almost as if he had foreseen this moment of weakness and vacillation in the empty house and forewarned me we have gone through too much to let nothing stop us now my clothesfresh blouses pants stockings my toothbrushwere out at mccaslin now i had more in my drawer of course except the toothbrush which in mothers absence it was a fair gamble that neither aunt gallic nor cousin louisa would remember about but i took no clothes nothing not that i forgot to but probably because i had never intended to i just entered the house and stood inside the door long enough to prove to myself that of boon and me it wouldnt be me who failed us and went back across the street and across grandfathers back yard to the lot nor was boon the one who would fail us i heard the engine running quietly before i reached the carriage house boon was already behind the wheel i think the automobile was even already in gear wheres your clean shirt he said never mind ill buy you one in memphis come on we can move now he backed the car out the open lock was once more hanging in the staple come on he said dont stop to lock it its too late now no i said i couldnt have said then why either with the padlock snapped through the staple and hasp of the closed door it would look like the automobile was safely inside and so it would be the whole thing no more than a dream from which i could wake tomorrow perhaps now the next moment and be safe saved so i closed the door and locked the padlock and opened the lot gate for boon to drive out and closed that to and got in the car already in motionif in fact it had ever completely stopped if we go the back way we can dodge the square i said and again he said its too late now all they can do now is holler but none hollered but even with the square behind it still was not too late that irrevocable decision was still a mile ahead where the road to mccaslin forked away from the memphis road where i could say stop let me out and he would do it more i could say ive changed my mind take me back to mccaslin and i knew he would do that too then suddenly i knew that if i said turn around i will get that key from mr ballott and we will lock this automobile up in the carnage house where boss believes it already is at this moment and he would do that and more that he wanted me to do that was silently begging me to do that he and i both aghast not at his individual temerity but at our mutual our confederated recklessness and that boon knew he had not the strength to resist his and so must cast himself on my strength and rectitude you see what i told you about nonvirtue if things had been reversed and i had silently pled with boon to turn back i could have depended on his virtue and pity where he to whom boon had pled had neither so i said nothing the fork the last frail impotent hand reached down to save me flew up and passed and fled was gone irrevocable i said all right then here i come maybe boon heard it since i was still boss anyway he put jefferson behind vis satan would at least defend his faithful from the first one or two tomorrows he said we aint really got anything to worry about but hell creek bottom tomorrow harrykin creek aint anything who said it was i said hurricane creek is four miles from town you have passed over it so fast all your life you probably dont even know its name but people who crossed it then knew it there was a wooden bridge over the creek itself but even in the top of summer the approaches to it were a series of mudholes thats what im telling you boon said it aint anything me and mr wordwin got through it that day last year without even using the block and tackle just a shovel and axe mr wordwin borrowed from a house about a half a mile away that now you mention it i dont believe he took back likely though the fellow come and got them the next day he was almost right we got through the first mudhole and even across the bridge but the other mudhole stopped us the automobile lurched once twice tilted and hiing spinning boon didnt waste any time already removing his shoes i forgot to say he had had them shined too and rolled up his pants legs and stepped out into the mud move over he said put it in low gear and start when i tell you come on you know how to do it you learned how this morning i got under the wheel he didnt even stop for the block and tackle i dont need it itll take too much time getting it out and putting it back and we aint got time he didnt need it there was a snake fence beside the road he had already wrenched the top rail off and himself kneedeep in mud and water wedged the end under the back axle and said now pour the coal to her and lifted the automobile bodily and shot it forward lurching and heaving by main strength up onto dry ground again shouting at me shut it off shut it off which i did managed to and he came and shoved me over and got in under the wheel he didnt even stop to roll his muddy pants down because the sun was almost down now it would be nearly dark by the time we reached ballenbaughs where we would spend the night we went as fast as we dared now and soon we were passing mr wyottsa family friend of ours father took me bird hunting there that christmaswhich was eight miles from jefferson and still four miles from the river with the sun just setting behind the house we went on there would be a moon after a while because our oil headlights were better to show someone else you were coming rather than to light you where you were going but suddenly boon said whats that smell was it you but before i could deny it he had jerked the automobile to a stop sat for an instant then turned and reached back and flung back the lumped and jumbled mass of the tarpaulin which had filled the back of the car ned sat up from the floor he had on the black suit and hat and the white shirt with the gold collar stud without either collar or tie which he wore on sunday he even had the small battered hand grip you would call it a brief or attache case now which had belonged to old lucius mccaslin before even father was born i dont know what else he might have carried in it at other times all i ever saw in it was the bible likewise from greatgreatgrandmofher mccaslin which he couldnt read and a pint flask containing maybe a good double tablespoonful of whiskey ill be a son of a bitch boon said i wants a trip too ned said hee hee hee chapter i got just as much right to a trip as you and lucius ned said i got more this automobile belongs to boss and lucius aint nothing but his grandboy and you aint no kin to him atall all right all right boon said what im talking about you laid there under that tarpollyon all the time and let me get out in the mud and lift this whole car out singlehanded by main strength and hot under there too mon ned said i dont see how i stood it not to mention having to hold off this here sheetiron churn from knocking my brains out every time you bounced let alone waiting for that gasoline or whatever you calls it to get all joogled up to where it would decide to blow up too what did you aim for me to do that was just four miles from town youd make me walk back home this is ten miles now boon said what makes you think you aint going to walk them back home i said rapidly quickly have you forgot that was wyotts about two miles back we might just as well be two miles from bay st louis thats right ned said pleasantly the walking aint near so fur from here boon didnt look at him long get out and fold up that tarpollyon where it wont take up no more room than it has to he told ned and air it off some too if we got to ride with it it was all that bumping and jolting you done ned said you talk like i broke my manners just on purpose to get caught also boon lit the headlights while we were stopped and now he wiped his feet and legs off on a corner of the tarpaulin and put his socks and shoes on and rolled his pants back down they were already drying the sun was gone now already you could see the moonlight it would be full night when we reached ballenbaughs i understand that ballenbaughs is now a fishing camp run by an offandon italian bootleggeroff i mean during the one or two weeks it takes each new sheriff every four years to discover the true will of the people he thought voted for him all that stretch of river bottom which was a part of thomas sutpens doomed baronial dreaim and the site of major de spains hunting camp is now a drainage district the wilderness where boon himself in his youth hunted or anyway was present while his betters did bear and deer and panther is tame with cotton and corn now and even wyotts crossing is only a name even in there was still vestigial wilderness though most of the deer and all the bears and panthers also major de spain and his hunters were gone the ferry also and now we called wyotts crossing the iron bridge the iron bridge since it was the first iron bridge and for several years yet the only one we in yoknapatawpha county had or knew of but back in the old days in the time of our own petty chickasaw kings issetibbejha and moketubbe and the regicideusurper who called himself doom and the first wyott came along and the indians showed him the crossing and he built his store and ferryboat and named it after himself this was not only the only crossing within miles but the head of navigation too boats in the high water of winter even a small steamboat came as it were right to wyotts front door bringing the whiskey and plows and coal oil and peppermint candy up from vicksburg and carrying the cotton and furs back but memphis was nearer than vicksburg even by mule team so they built a road as straight from jefferson to the south bend of wyotts ferryboat as they could run it and as straight from the north end of the ferryboat to memphis as they could run that so the cotton and freight began to come and go that way mule or oxdrawn whereupon there appeared immediately from nowhere an ancestryless giant calling himself ballenbaugh some said he actually bought from wyott the small dim heretofore peaceful oneroom combined residence and store including whatever claim he wyott considered he had in the old chickasaw crossing others said that ballenbaugh simply suggested to wyott that he wyott had been there long enough now and the time had come for him to move four miles back from the river and become a farmer anyway thats what wyott did and then his little wildernesscradled hermitage became a roaring place indeed it became dormitory grubbing station and saloon for the transient freighters and the fixed crews of hardmouthed hardsouled mule skinners who met the wagons at both edges of the bottom with two and three and when necessary four span of already gearedup mules to curse the heavy wagons in to the ferry on one side of the river and from the ferry to high ground once more on the other a roaring place who faced it were anyway men but just tough men then no more until colonel sartoris i dont mean the banker with his courtesy title acquired partly by inheritance and partly by propinquity who was responsible for boon and me being where we at this moment were i mean his father the actual colonel csasoldier statesman politician duelist the collateral descending nephews and cousins of one twentyyearold yoknapatawpha county youth say murderer built his railroad in the midseventies and destroyed it but not ballenbaughs let alone ballenbaugh the wagon trains came and drove the boats from the river and changed the name of wyotts crossing to ballenbaughs ferry the railroads came and removed the cotton bales from the wagons and therefore the ferry from ballenbaughs but that was all forty years before in the modest case of the trader wyott ballenbaugh snowed himself perfectly capable of anticipating the wave of the future and riding it now in the person of his son mother giant who in returned with it was said his coat lined with uncut united states bank notes from he said arkansas where he said he had served and been honorably discharged from a troop of partisan rangers the name of whose commander he was never subsequently able to recall he showed that he had lost none of his old deftness and skill and omniscience formerly people passed through ballenbaughs pausing for the night now they travelled to ballenbaughs always at night and often rapidly to give ballenbaugh as much time as possible to get the horse or cow concealed in the swamp before the law or the owner arrived because in addition to gangs of angry farmers following the nonreturning prints of horses and cattle and sheriffs following those of actual murderers into ballenbaughs at least one federal revenue agent left a set of nonreturning footprints because where ballenbaugh senior merely sold whiskey this one made it too he was now the patron of what is covered by the euphemistic blanketterm of dance hall and by the mideighties ballenbaughs was a byword miles around for horror and indignation ministers and old ladies tried to nominate sheriffs whose entire platform would be running ballenbaugh and his drunks and fiddlers and gamblers and girls out of yoknapatawpha county and mississippi too if possible but ballenbaugh and his entouragestable pleasuredome whatever you want to call itnever bothered us outsiders they never came out of their fastness and there was no law compelling anyone to go there also seemingly his new avocation avatar was so rewarding that word went round that anyone with sights and ambition no higher than one spavined horse or dry heifer was no longer welcome there so sensible people simply let ballenbaughs alone which certainly included sheriffs who were not only sensible but family men too and who had the example of the federal revenuer who had vanished in that direction not so long ago that is until the summer of when a baptist minister named hiram hightoweralso a giant of a man as tall and almost as big as ballenbaugh himself who on sunday from to had been one of forrests company chaplains and on the other six days one of his hardest and most courageous troopersrode into ballenbaughs armed with a bible and his bare hands and converted the entire settlement with his fists one at a time when he could two or three at a time when he had to so when boon and ned and i approached it in this may dusk of ballenbaugh was accomplishing his third avatar in the person of a fiftyyearold maiden his only child a prim fleshless severe irongray woman who farmed a quarter section of good bottom cotton and cornland and conducted a small store with a loft above it containing a row of shuck mattresses each with its neat perfectly clean sheets and pillow cases and blankets for the accommodation of fox and coonhunters and fishermen who it was said returned the second time not for the hunting and fishing but for the table miss ballenbaugh set she heard us too nor were we the first she told us that we were the thirteenth automobile to pass there in the last two years five of them in the last forty days she had already lost two hens and would probably have to begin keeping everything penned up even the hounds she and the cook and a negro man were already on the front gallery shading their eyes against the ghostly flicker of our headlights as we drove up she not only knew boon of old she recognised the automobile first already even after only thirteen of them her eye for individual cars was that good so you really did make it to jefferson after all she said in a year boon said lord miss ballenbaugh this automobile has been a hundred times farther than jefferson since then a thousand times you might as well give you got to get used to automobiles like everybody else that was when she told us about the thirteen cars in two years and the two hens at least they got a ride on an automobile for a little piece anyway she said which is more than i can say you mean to say you aint never rode in one boon said here ned he said jump out of there and get them grips out too loosh let miss ballenbaugh set up in front where she can see out wait miss ballenbaugh said i must tell alice about supper supper can wait boon said i bet alice aint never had a car ride neither come on alice whos that with you your husband i aint studying no husband the cook said and i wouldnt be studying ephum even if i was bring him on anyway boon said the cook and the man came and got in too into the back seat with the gasoline can and the folded tarpaulin ned and i stood in the lamplight from the open door and watched the automobile the red tail lamp move on up the rokd then stop and back and turn and come back past us boon blowing the horn now miss ballenbaugh sitting erect and a little tense in the front seat alice and ephum in the back seat waving to us as they passed whooee boy ephum shouted at ned git a horse showing off ned said he meant boon he better be sho proud boss priest aint standing here too hed show him off the car stopped and backed and turned again and came back to us and stopped after a moment miss ballenbaugh said well then she moved she said briskly all right alice so we have supper and i knew why the hunters and fishermen came back then ned went off with ephum and i made my manners to miss ballenbaugh and boon carrying the lamp we went upstairs to the loft above the store didnt you bring nothing boon said not even a clean handkerchief i wont need anything i said well you cant sleep like that look at them clean sheets at least take off your shoes and pants and your maw would make you brush your teeth too no she wouldnt i said she couldnt i aint got anything to brush them with that wouldnt stop her and you know it if you couldnt find something youd make something to do it with or know the reason why all right i said i was already on my mattress good night he stood with his hand up to blow out the lamp you all right he said shut up i said say the word well go back home not now but in the morning did you wait this long to get scared i said good night he said he blew out the lamp and got on his mattress then there was all the spring darkness the big basstalking frogs from the sloughs the sound that the woods makes the big woods the wilderness with the wild things coons and rabbits and mink and mushrats and the big owls and the big snakesmoccasins and rattlersand maybe even the trees breathing and the river itself breathing not to mention the ghoststhe old chickasaws who named the land before the white men ever saw it and the white men afterwardwyott and old sutpen and major de spains hunters and the flatboats full of cotton and then the wagon trains and the brawling teamsters and the line of brigands and murderers which produced miss ballenbaugh suddenly i realised what the noise was that boon was making what are you laughing at i said im thinking about hell creek bottom well hit it about eleven oclock tomorrow morning i thought you said well have trouble there you damn right we will boon said itll take that axe and shovel and bob wire and block and tackle and all the fence rails and me and you and ned all three thats who im laughing at ned by the time we are through hell creek tomorrow hes going to wish he hadnt busted what he calls his manners nor et nor done nothing else under that tarpollyon until he felt memphis itself under them wheels then he waked me early and everybody else within a half mile though it still took some time to get ned up from where he had slept in ephums house to the kitchen to eat his breakfast and even longer than that to get him out of the kitchen again with a woman in it we ate breakfastand after that breakfast if i had been a hunter or a fisherman i wouldnt have felt like walking anywhere for a whileand boon gave miss ballenbaugh another ride in the automobile but without alice and ephum this time though ephum was on hand then weboonfilled the gasoline tank and the radiator not because they needed it but i think because miss ballenbaugh and ephum were there watching and started the sun was just rising as we crossed the iron bridge over the river and the ghost of that steamboat too i had forgot that last night into foreign country another county by night it would even be another state and memphis providing we get through hell creek boon said maybe if youd just stop talking about it i said sure boon said hell creek bottom dont care whether you talk about it or not it dont have to give a durn youll see then he said well there it is it was only a little after ten we had made excellent time following the ridges the roads dry and dusty between the sprouting fields the land vacant and peaceful with sunday the people already in their sunday clothes idle on the front galleries the children and dogs already running toward the fence or road to watch us pass then in the surreys and buggies and wagons and horseand muleback anywhere from one to three on the horse but not on the mule a little after nine we passed another automobile boon said it was a ford he had an eye for automobiles like miss ballenbaughs on the way to the small white churches in the spring groves a wide valley lay before us the road descending from the plateau toward a band of willow and cypress which marked the creek it didnt look very bad to me nowhere near as wide as the river bottom we had already crossed and we could even see the dusty gash of the road mounting to the opposite plateau beyond it but boon had already started to curse driving even faster down the hill almost as if he were eager anxious to reach and join battle with it as if it were something sentient not merely inimical but unredeemable like a human enemy another man look at it he said innocent as a newlaid egg you can even see the road beyond it like it was laughing at us like it was saying if you could just get here you could durn near see memphis except just see if you can get here if its all that bad why dont we go around it ned said thats what i would do if it was me setting there where you is because hell creek bottom aint got no around boon said violently go one way and youd wind up in alabama go the other way and youll fall off in the missippi river i seen the missippi river at memphis once ned said now you mention it i done already seen memphis too but i aint never seen alabama maybe id like a trip there you aint never visited hell creek bottom before neither boon said providing what you hid under that tarpollyon for yesterday is education why do you reckon the only two automobiles we have seen between now and jefferson was this one and that ford because there aint no other automobiles in missippi below hell creek thats why miss ballenbaugh counted thirteen passed her house in the last two years i said two of them was this one boon said and even them other eleven she never counted crossing hell creek did she maybe it depends on whos doing the driving ned said hee hee hee boon stopped the car quickly he turned his head all right jump out you want to visit alabama you done already made yourself fifteen minutes late running your mouth why you got to snatch a man up just for passing the day with you ned said but boon wasnt listening to him i dont think he was really speaking to ned he was already out of the car he opened the toolbox grandfather had had made on the running board to hold the block and tackle and axe and spade and the lantern taking everything out but the lantern and tumbling them into the back seat with ned so we wont waste any time he said speaking rapidly but quite composed calm without hysteria or even urgency closing the box and getting back under the wheel lets hit it whatre we waiting for still it didnt look bad to mejust another country road crossing another swampy creek the road no longer dry but not really wet yet the holes and boggy places already filled for our convenience by previous pioneers with brush tops and limbs and sections of it even corduroyed with poles laid crossways in the mud oh yes i realised suddenly that the roadfor lack of any closer termhad stopped being not really wet yet too so perhaps boon himself was responsible he himself had populated the stagnant cypress and willowarched mosquitowhined gloom with the wraiths of stuck automobiles and sweating and cursing people then i thought we had struck it except for that fact that i not only couldnt see any rise of drier ground which would indicate we were reaching approaching the other side of the swamp i couldnt even see the creek itself ahead yet let alone a bridge again the automobile lurched canted and hung as it did yesterday at hurricane creek again boon was already removing his shoes and socks and rolling up his pants all right he said to ned over his shoulder get out i dont know how ned said not moving i aint learned about automobiles yet ill just be in your way ill set here with lucius so you can have plenty of room hee hee hee boon said in savage and vicious mimicry you wanted a trip now you got one get out i got my sunday clothes on ned said so have i boon said if i aint scared of a pair of britches you neednt be you can talk ned said you got mr maury i has to work for my money when my clothes gets mint or wore out i has to buy new ones myself you never bought a garment of clothes or shoes or a hat neither in your life boon said you got one pigeontailed coat i know of that old lucius mccaslin himself wore let alone general compsons and major de spains and bosss too you can roll your britches up and take off your shoes or not thats your business but youre going to get out of this automobile let lucius get out ned said hes younger than me and stouter too for his size hes got to steer it boon said ill steer it if thats all you needs ned said i been what you calls steering horses and mules and oxen all my life and i reckon gee and haw with that steering wheel aint no different from gee and haw with a pair of lines or a goad then to me jump out boy and help mr boon better take your shoes and stockings are you going to get out or do i pick you up with one hand and snatch this automobile out from under you with the other boon said ned moved then fast enough when he finally accepted the fact that he had to only grunting a little as he took off his shoes and rolled up his pants and removed his coat when i looked back at boon he was already dragging two poles saplingsized tree trunks out of the weeds and briers aint you going to use the block and tackle yet i said hell no boon said when the time comes for that you wont need to ask nobodys permission about it youll already know it so its the bridge i thought maybe theres not even a bridge at all and thats whats wrong and boon read my mind there too dont worry about the bridge we aint even come to the bridge yet i would learn what he meant by that too but not now ned lowered one foot gingerly into the water this water got dirt in it he said if theres one thing i hates its dirt betwixt my nekkid toes thats because your circulation aint warmed up yet boon said take aholt of this pole you said you aint acquainted with automobiles yet thats one complaint you wont never have to make again for the rest of your life all rightto meease her ahead now and whenever she bites keep her going which we did boon and ned levering their poles forward under the back axle pinching us forward for another lurch of two or three or sometimes five feet until the car hung spinning again the whirling back wheels coating them both from knee to crown as if they had been swung at with one of the spray nozzles which house painters use now see what i mean boon said spitting giving another terrific wrench and heave which sent us lurching forward about getting acquainted with automobiles exactly like horses and mules dont never stand directly behind one thats got one hind foot already lifted then i saw the bridge we had come up onto a patch of earth so comparatively dry that boon and ned almost indistinguishable now with mud had to trot with their poles and even then couldnt keep up boon hollering panting go on keep going until i saw the bridge a hundred yards ahead and then saw what was still between us and the bridge and i knew what he meant i stopped the car the road the passage whatever you would call it now in front of us had not altered so much as it had transmogrified exchanged mediums elements it now resembled a big receptacle of milkinfused coffee from which protruded here and there a few forlorn impotent hopeless odds and ends of sticks and brush and logs and an occasional hump of actual earth which looked startiingly like it had been deliberately thrown up by a plow then i saw something else and understood what boon had been telling me by indirection about hell creek bottom for over a year now and what he had been reiterating with a kind of haunted bemused obsession ever since we left jefferson yesterday standing hitched to a tree just off the road canal were two mules in plow gearthat is in bridles and collars and hames the trace chains looped over the hames and the plowlines coiled into neat hanks and hanging from the hames also leaning against another tree nearby was a heavy doublewinged plowa middlebustercaked wings shank and the beam itself with more of the same mud which was rapidly encasing boon and ned a doubletree likewise mudcaked leaning against the plow and in the immediate background a new tworoom paintless shotgun cabin on the gallery of which a man sat tilted in a splint chair barefoot his galluses down about his waist and his likewise muddy brogan shoes against the wall beside the chair and i knew that this and not hurricane creek was where boon said he and mr wordwin had had to borrow the shovel last year which boon said mr wordwin had forgot to return and which the shovel mr wordwin might as well have forgot to borrow also for all the good it did them ned had seen it too he had already had one hard look at the mudhole now he looked at the already gearedup mules standing there swishing and slapping at mosquitoes while they waited for us now thats what i calls convenient he said shut up boon said in a fierce murmur not a word dont make a sound he spoke in a tense controlled fury propping his muddy pole against the car and hauling out the block and tackle and the barbed wire and the axe and spade he said son of a bitch three times then he said to me you too me i said but look at them mules ned said he even got a log chain already hooked to that doubletree didnt you hear me say shut up boon said in that fierce quite courteous murmur if i didnt speak plain enough excuse me what im trying to say is shut up only what in the world do he want with the middlebuster ned said and it muddy clean up to the handles too like he been you mean to say he gets in here with that team and works this place like a patch just to keep it boggy boon had the spade axe and block and tackle all three in his hands for a second i thought he would strike ned with any one or maybe all three of them i said quickly what do you want me yes boon said it will take all of us ime and mr wordwin had a little trouble with him here last year we got to get through this time how much did you have to pay him last year to get drug out ned said two dollars boon said so you better take off your whole pants take off your shirt too itll be all right here two dollars ned said this sho beats cotton he can farm right here setting in the shade without even moving what i wants boss to get me is a welltravelled mudhole fine boon said you can learn how on this one he gave ned the block and tackle and the piece of barbed wire take it yonder to that willow the big one and get a good holt with it ned payed out the rope and carried the head block to the tree i took off my pants and shoes and stepped down into the mud it felt good cool maybe it felt that way to boon too or maybe hisneds too was just release freedom from having to waste any time now trying not to get muddy anyway from now on he simply ignored the mud squatting in it saying son of a bitch quietly and steadily while he fumbled the other piece of barbed wire into a loop on the front of the car to hook the block in here he told me you be dragging up some of that brush over yonder reading my mind again too i dont know where it came from neither maybe he stacks it up there himself to keep handy for folks so they can find out how bad they owe him two dollars so i dragged up the brushbranches topsinto the mud in front of the car while boon and ned took up the slack in the tackle and got ready ned and i on the takeup rope of the tackle boon at the back of the car with his prize pole again you got the easy job he told us all you got to do is grab and hold when i heave all right he said lets go there was something dreamlike about it not nightmarish just dreamlikethe peaceful quiet remote sylvan almost primeval setting of ooze and slime and jungle growth and heat in which the very mules themselves peacefully swishing and stamping at the teeming infinitesimal invisible myriad life which was the actual air we moved and breathed in were not only unalien but in fact curiously appropriate being themselves biological dead ends and hence already obsolete before they were born the automobile the expensive useless mechanical toy rated in power and strength by the dozens of horses yet held helpless and impotent in the almost infantile clutch of a few inches of the temporary confederation of two mild and pacific elementsearth and waterwhich the frailest integers and units of motion as produced by the ancient unmechanical methods had coped with for countless generations without really having noticed it the three of us three forked identical and now unrecognisable mudcolored creatures engaged in a lifeanddeath struggle with it the progressif anyof which had to be computed in dreadful and glacierlike inches and all the while the man sat in his tilted chair on the gallery watching us while ned and i strained for every inch we could get on the rope which by now was too slippery with mud to grip with the hands and at the rear of the car boon strove like a demon titanic ramming his pole beneath the automobile and lifting and heaving it forward at one time he dropped flung away the pole and stooping grasped the car with his hands and actually ran it forward for a foot or two as though it were a wheelbarrow no man could stand it no man should ever have to i said so at last i stopped pulling i said panted no we cant do it we just cant and boon in an expiring voice as faint and gentle as the whisper of love then get out of the way or ill run it over you no i said i stumbled slipping and plunging back to him no i said youll kill yourself i aint tired boon said in that light dry voice im just getting started good but you and ned can take a rest while youre getting your breath suppose you drag up some more of that brush no i said no here he comes do you want him to see it because we could see him as well as hearthe suck and plop of the mules feet as they picked their delicate way along the edge of the mudhole the almost musical jangle of the looped chains the man riding one and leading the other his shoes tied together by the laces looped over one of the hames the doubletree balanced in front of him as the old buffalo hunters in the pictures carried their gunsa gaunt man older than wei anyway had assumed morning boys he said looks like youre about ready for me now howdy jefferson he said to boon looks like you did get through last summer after all looks like it boon said he had changed instantaneous and complete like a turned page the poker player who has just seen the second deuce fall to a hand across the table we might a got through this time too if you folks didnt raise such heavy mud up here dont hold that against us the man said muds one of our best crops up thisaway at two dollars a mudhole it ought to be your best ned said the man blinked at ned a moment i dont know but what youre right he said here you take this doubletree you look like a boy that knows which end of a mule to hook to get down and do it yourself boon said why else are we paying you two dollars to be the hired expert you done it last year that was last year the man said dabbling around in this water hooking log chains to them things undermined my system to where i come down with rheumatism if i so much as spit on myself so he didnt stir he just brought the mules up and turned them side by side while boon and ned hooked the trace chains to the singletrees and then boon squatted in the mud to make the log chain fast to the car what do you want me to hook it to he said i dont care myself the man said hook up to any part of it you want out of this mudhole if you want all of it to come out at the same time id say hook to the axle but first id put all them spades and ropes back in the automobile you wont need them no more at least here so ned and i did that and boon hooked up and we all three stood clear and watched he was an expert of course but by now the mules were experts too breaking the automobile free of the mud keeping the strain balanced on the doubletree as delicately as wire walkers getting the automobile into motion and keeping it there with no more guidance than a word now and then from the man who rode the near mule and an occasional touch from the peeled switch he carried on to where the ground was more earth than water all right ned boon said unhook him not yet the man said theres another hole just this side of the bridge that im throwing in free you aint been acquainted here for a year now he said to ned what we call the reserve patch up thisaway you means the christmas middle ned said maybe i do the man said what is it ned told him its how we done at mccaslin back before the surrender when old lqc was alive and how the edmonds boy still does every spring a middle is streaked off in the best ground on the place and every stalk of cotton betwixt that middle and the edge of the field belongs to the christmas fund not for the boss but for every mccaslin nigger to have a christmas share of it thats what a christmas middle is likely you mudfarming folks up here never heard of it the man looked at ned awhile after a while ned said hee hee hee thats better the man said i thought for a minute me and you was about to misunderstand one another he said to boon maybe somebody better guide it yes boon said all right he told me so i got under the wheel mud and all but we didnt move yet the man said i forgot to mention it so maybe i better prices have doubled around here since last year why boon said its the same car the same mudhole be damned if i dont believe its even the same mud that was last year theres more business now so much more that i cant afford not to go up all right goddammit boon said go on so we moved ignominious at the pace of the mules on into the next mudhole without stopping on and out again the bridge was just ahead now beyond it we could see the road all the way to the edge of the bottom and safety youre all right now the man said until you come back boon was unhooking the log chain while ned freed the traces and handed the doubletree back up to the man on the mule we aint coming back this way boon said i wouldnt neither the man said boon went back to the last puddle and washed some of the mud from his hands and came back and took four dollars from his wallet the man didnt move its six dollars he said last year it was two dollars boon said you said its double now double two is four all right heres four dollars i charge a dollar a passenger the man said there was two of you last year that was two dollars the price is doubled now theres three of you thats six dollars maybe youd rather walk back to jefferson than pay two dollars but maybe that boy and that nigger wouldnt and maybe i aint gone up neither boon said suppose i dont pay you six dollars suppose in fact i dont pay you nothing you can do that too the man said these mules has had a hard day but i reckon theres still enough git in them to drag that thing back where they got it from but boon had already quit given up surrendered god damn it he said this boy aint nothing but a child sholy for just a little child walking back to jefferson might be lighter for him the man said but it wont be no shorter all right boon said but look at the other one when he gets that mud washed off he aint even white the man looked at distance awhile then he looked at boon son he said both these mules is colorblind chapter boon had told ned and me that once we had conquered hell creek bottom we would be in civilisation he drew a picture of all the roads from there on cluttered thick as fleas with automobiles though maybe it was necessary first to put hell creek as far behind us as limbo or forgetfulness or at least out of sight maybe we would not be worthy of civilisation until we had got the hell creek mud off anyway nothing happened yet the man took his sk dollars and went away with his mules and doubletree i noticed in fact that he didnt return to his little house but went on back through the swamp and vanished as if the day were over so did ned notice it he aint a hog ned said he dont need to be hes done already made six dollars and it aint even dinnertime yet it is as far as im concerned boon said bring the lunch too so we took the lunch box miss ballenbaugh had packed for us and the block and tackle and axe and shovel and our shoes and stockings and my pants we couldnt do anything about the automobile besides being a waste of work until we could reach memphis where surelyat least we hopedthere wouldnt be any more mudholes and went back down to the creek and washed the tools off and coiled down the block and tackle and there wasnt much to be done about boons and neds clothes either though boon got bodily into the water clothes and all and washed himself off and tried to persuade ned to follow suit since heboonhad a change of clothes in his grip but all ned would do was to remove his shirt and put his coat back on i think i told you about his attache case which he didnt so much carry when abroad as he wore it as diplomats wear theirs carrying i mean ned bible and the two tablespoonfuls ofprobablygrandfathers best whiskey i suspect at times even less in them then we ate lunchthe ham and fried chicken and biscuits and homemade pear preserves and cake and the jug of buttermilkand put back the emergency muddefying gear which in the end had been not a defiance but an inglorious brag and measured the gasoline tanka gesture not to distance but to timeand went on because the die was indeed cast now we looked not back to remorse or regret or mighthavebeen if we crossed rubicon when we crossed the iron bridge into another county when we conquered hell creek we locked the portcullis and set the bridge on fire and it did seem as though we had won to reprieve as a reward for invincible determination or refusal to recognise defeat when we faced it or it faced us or maybe it was just virtue who had given up relinquished us to nonvirtue to cherish and nurture and coddle in the style whose right we had won with the now irrevocable barter of our souls the very land itself seemed to have changed the farms were bigger more prosperous with tighter fences and painted houses and even barns the very air was urban we came at last to a broad highway running stringstraight into distance and heavily marked with wheel prints boon said with a kind of triumph as if we had doubted him or as if he had invented it to disprove us created it cleared and graded and smoothed it with his own hands and perhaps even added the wheel marks what did i tell you the highway to memphis we could see for miles much closer than that was a rapid and mounting cloud of dust like a portent a promise it was indubitable travelling that fast and that much of it we were not even surprised when it contained an automobile we passed each other commingling our dust into one giant cloud like a pillar a signpost raised and set to cover the land with the adumbration of the future the antlike to and fro the incurable downpayment itchfoot the mechanised the mobilised the inescapable destiny of america and now gray with dust from toes to eyelids particularly boons stilldamp clothes we could make time even if for a while not speed without switching off the engine boon got out and walked briskly around the car to my side saying briskly to me all right slide over you know how just dont get the idea youre a fortymileahour railroad engine so i drove on across the sunny may afternoon i couldnt look at it though i was too busy too concentrated all right too nervous and proud the sabbath afternoon workless the cotton and corn growing unvexed now the mules themselves sabbatical and idle in the pastures the people still in their sunday clothes on galleries and in shady yards with glasses of lemonade or saucers of the ice cream left from dinner then we made speed too boon said were coming to some towns now i better take it we went on civilisation was now constant single country stores and crossroads hamlets we were barely free of one before here was another commerce was rife about us the air was indeed urban the very dust itself which we raised and moved in had a metropolitan taste to tongue and nostrils even the aittle children and the dogs no longer ran to the gates and fences to watch us and the three other automobiles we had passed in the last thirteen miles then the country itself was gone there were no longer intervals between the houses and shops and stores suddenly before us was a wide treebordered and ordered boulevard with car tracks in the middle and sure enough there was the streetcar itself the conductor and motorman just lowering the back trolley and raising the front one to turn it around and go back to main street two minutes to five oclock boon said twentythree and a half hours ago we were in jefferson missippi eighty miles away a record i had been in memphis before so had ned this morning he had told us so thirty minutes from now he would prove it but always by train never like this to watch memphis grow increase to assimilate it deliberately like a spoonful of ice cream in the mouth i had never thought about it other than to assume we would go to the gayoso hotel as wei anywayalways had so i dont know what mind boon read this time were going to a kind a boarding house i know he said youll like it i had a letter last week from one of the g ladies staying there that shes got her nephew visiting her so youll even have somebody to play with the cook can locate a place for ned to sleep too hee hee hee ned said besides the streetcars there were buggies and surreysphaetons traps stanhopes at least one victoria the horses a little whiteeyed at us but still collected evidently memphis horses were already used to automobilesso boon couldnt turn his head to look at ned but he could turn one eye just what do you mean by that he said nothing ned said mind where youre going and nemmine me nemmine me nohow i got friends here too you just show me where this automobile gonter be at to morrow morning and ill be there too and you damn well better be boon said if you aim to go back to jefferson in it me and lucius never invited you on this trip so you aint none of mine and his responsibility as far as me and jefferson are concerned i dont give a damn whether you come back or not when we gets this automobile back in jefferson and has to try to look boss priest and mr maury in the eye aint none of us gonter have time to give a damn who is back and who aint ned said but it was too late now far too late to keep on bringing that up so boon just said all right all right all i said was if you want to be back in jefferson when you start doing your not having time to give a damn you better be where i can see you when i start back we were getting close to main street nowthe tall buildings the stores the hotels the gaston gone now and the peabody they have moved it since and the gayoso to which all us mccaslinsedmondsespriests devoted our allegiance as to a family shrine because our remote uncle and cousin theophilus mccaslin cousin ikes father had been a member of the party of horsemen which legend said that is legend to some people maybe to us it was historical fact general forrests brother led at a gallop into the lobby itself and almost captured a yankee general we didnt go that far though boon turned into a side street almost a back alley with two saloons at the corner and lined with houses that didnt look old or new either all very quiet as quiet as jefferson itself on sunday afternoon boon in fact said so you ought to seen it last night i bet on any saturday night or even on a week night when theres a firemans or policemans or a elk or something convention in town maybe theyve all gone to early prayer meeting i said no boon said i dont think so likely theyre just resting from what i said hee hee hee ned said in the back seat obviously we were learning ned had been in memphis before though probably even grandfather though he might have known when didnt know how often and you see i was only eleven this time the street being empty boon did turn his head just one more out of you he told ned one more which ned said all i says is point out where this thing gonter be at tomorrow morning and ill already be setting in it when it leaves so boon did we were almost there a house needing about the same amount of paint the others did in a small grassless yard but with a sort of lattice vestibule like a well house at the front door boon stopped the car at the curb now he could turn and look at ned all right he said im taking you at your word and you better take me at mine on the stroke of eight oclock tomorrow morning and i mean the first stroke not the last one because i aint even going to be here to hear it ned was already getting out carrying his little grip and his muddy shirt aint you got enough troubles of your own on your mind without trying to tote mine too he said if you can finish your business here by eight oclock tomorrow morning how come you think i cant neither he walked on then he said still walking on and not looking back hee hee hee come on boon said miss reball let us wash up we got out boon reached into the back and started to pick up his grip and said oh yes and reached to the dashboard and took the switch key out of the slot and put it in his pocket and started to pick up the grip and stopped and took the switch key out of his pocket and said here you keep it i might lay it down somewhere and mislay it put it in your pocket good so it wont fall out you can wad your handkerchief on top of it i took the key and he started to reach for the grip again and stopped again and looked quick over his shoulder at the boarding house and turned sideways a little and took his wallet out of his hind pocket and opened it close to him and took out a fivedollar bill and stopped and then took out a onedollar bill also and closed the wallet and slid it toward me behind his body saying not quick so much as quiet keep this too i might forget it somewhere too whenever we need money out of it ill tell you how much to give me because i had never been inside a boarding house either and remember i was just eleven so i put the wallet into my pocket too and boon took the grip and we went through the gate and up the walk and into the lattice vestibule and there was the front door boon had barely touched the bell when we heard feet inside what did i tell you boon said rapidly they probably are all peeping from behind the window curtains at that automobile the door opened it was a young negro woman but before she could open her mouth a white woman pushed her aside a young woman too with a kind hard handsome face and hair that was too red with two of the biggest yellowishcolored diamonds i ever saw in her ears dammit boon she said the minute corrie got that dispatch yesterday i told her to telegraph you right back not to bring that child here ive already had one in the house for a week now and one hellonwheels is enough for any house or street either for that matter or even all memphis providing its that one we already got and dont lie that you never got the message neither i didnt boon said we must have already left jefferson before it got there what do you want me to do with him then tie him out in the yard come on in she said she moved out of the door so we could enter as soon as we did so the maid locked the door again i didnt know why then maybe that was the way all people in memphis did even while they were at home it was like any other hall with a stairway going up only at once i smelled something the whole house smelled that way i had never smelled it before i didnt dislike it i was just surprised i mean as soon as i smelled it it was like a smell i had been waiting all my life to smell i think you should be tumbled pellmell without warning only into experience which you might well have spent the rest of your life not having to meet but with an inevitable ay necessary one its not really decent of circumstance fate not to prepare you first especially when the preparation is as simple as just being fifteen years old that was the kind of smell it was the woman was still talking you know as well as i do that mr binford disapproves like hell of kids using houses for holiday vacations you heard him last summer when corrie brought that little sob in here the first time because she claims he dont get enough refinement on that arkansas tenant farm like mr binford says theyll be in here soon enough anyhow so why rush them until at least they have some jack and are capable of spending it not to mention the customers coming in here for business and finding instead were running a damn kindergarden we were in the dining room now it had a pianola in it the woman was still talking whats his name lucius boon said make your manners to miss reba he told me i did so the way i always did that i reckon grandfathers mother taught him and grandfather taught father and mother taught us what ned called drug my foot when i straightened up miss reba was watching me she had a curious look on her face ill be damned she said minnie did you see that is miss corrie she dressing as fast as she can the maid said and that was when i saw it i mean minnies tooth i mean that was howyes whyi you people everybody remembered minnie she had beautiful teeth anyhow like small richly alabaster matched and evenly serrated headstones against the rich chocolate of her face when she smiled or spoke but she had more the middle righthand upper one was gold in her dark face it reigned like a queen among the white dazzle of the others seeming actually to glow gleam as with a slow inner fire or lambence of more than gold until that single tooth appeared even bigger than both of miss rebas yellowish diamonds put together later i learnedno matter howthat she had had the gold one taken out and an ordinary white one like anybody elses put in and i grieved i thought that had i been of her race and age group it would have been worth being her husband just to watch that tooth in action across the table every day a child of eleven it seemed to me that the very food it masticated must taste different better miss reba turned to boon again what you been doing wrassling with hogs we got in a mudhole back down the road we drove up the automobiles outside now i saw it miss reba said we all did dont tell me its yours just tell me if the police are after it if they are get it away from my door mr binfords strict about having police around here too so am i the automobiles all right boon said it better be miss reba said she was looking at me again she said lucius not to anybody too bad you didnt get here sooner mr binford likes kids he still likes them even after he begins to have doubts and this last week would have raised doubts in anybody that aint a ossified corpse i mean he was still willing to give otis the benefit of the doubt to take him to the zoo right after dinner lucius could have gone too but then on the other hand maybe not if otis is still using up doubts at the same rate he was before they left here he aint coming backproviding theres some way to get him up close enough to the cage for one of them lions or tigers to reach himproviding a lion or tiger would want him which they wouldnt if theyd ever spent a week in the same house with him she was still looking at me she said lucius again not at anybody then she said to minnie go up and tell everybody to stay out of the bathroom for the next half an hour she said to boon you got a change of clothes with you yes boon said then wash yourself off and put them on this is a decent place not a joint let them use veras room minnie veras visiting her folks up in paducah she said to boon or maybe to both of us minnie fixed a bed for otis up ffi the attic lucius can sleep with him tonight there were feet on the stairs then in the hall and in the door this time it was a big girl i dont mean fat just big like boon was big but still a girl young too with dark hair and blue eyes and at first i thought her face was plain but she came into the room already looking at me â iknew it didnt matter what her face was hi kiddo boon said but she didnt pay any attention to him at all yet she and miss reba were both looking at me watch now miss reba said lucius this is miss come i made my manners again see what i mean miss reba said you brought that nephew of yours over here hunting refinement here it is waiting for him he wont know what it means let alone why hes doing it but maybe lucius could learn him to at least ape it all right she said to boon go get cleaned up j mayb corrie me help us boon said he was holding miss corries hand hi kiddo he said again в artmkmg like a shantyboat swamp rat miss reba said ill keep this damned place respectable on sunday anyhow minnie showed us where the room and the bathroom were upstairs and gave us soap and a towel apiece and went out boon put his grip on the bed and opened it and took out a clean shirt and his other pants they were his everyday pants but the sunday ones he had on wouldnt be ere until they were cleaned with naptha ee he said i told you so i done the x make you brins at least a clean shirt my blouse aint muddy i said bathe r said l had a bath yesterday said didnt you said but yвu hcard what miss reba aid j never ew вy adies anytasqt trying to make somebody take a bath в known miss reba a few hours out you done learned something else and one shirt from one grip but he over the open grip busy holding the shirt in his hand while he decided where to put the pants then putting the shirt on the bed and picking up the pants again and moving them about a foot further along the bed then picking up the shirt again and putting it where the pants were then he cleared his throat loud and hard and went to the window and opened it and leaned out and spit and closed the window and came back to the bed not looking at me talking loud like somebody that comes upstairs first on christmas morning and tells you what youre going to get on the christmas tree thats not the thing you wrote santa claus for dont it beat all how much a fellow can learn and in what a short time about something he not only never knowed before he never even had no idea he would ever want to know it let alone would find it useful to him for the rest of his lifeproviding he kept it never let it get away from him take you for instance just think here it aint but yesterday morning not even two days back yet and think how much you have learned how to drive a automobile how to go to memphis across the country without depending on the railroad even how to get a automobile out of a mudhole so that when you get big and own a automobile of your own you will not only already know how to drive it but the road to memphis too and even how to get it out of a ffludhole boss says that when i get old enough to own an automobile there wont be any more mudholes to get into that all the roads everywhere will be so smooth and hard that automobiles will be foreclosed and reclaimed by the bank or even wear out without ever seeing a mudhole sure sure boon said all right all right say there aint no more need to know how to get out of a mudhole at least youll still know how to because why because you aint give the knowing how away to nobody who could i give it to i said who would want to know how if there aint any more mudholes all right all right boon said just listen to me a minute will you i aint talking about mudholes im talking about the things a fellowboy can learn that he never even thought about before that forever afterward when he needs them he will already have them because there aint nothing you ever learn that the day wont come when youll need it or find use for itproviding youve still got it aint let it get away from you by chance or worse than that give it away from carelessness or pure and simple bad judgment do you see what i mean now is that clear i dont know i said it must be or you couldnt keep on talking about it all right he said thats point number one now for point number two me and you have been good friends as long as we have known each other were having a nice trip together you done already learned a few things you never seen nor heard of before and im proud to be the one to be along and help you learn them and tonight youre fixing to learn some more things i dont think you have thought about before neitherthings and information and doings that a lot of folks in jefferson and other places too will try to claim you aint old enough yet to be bothered with knowing about them but shucks a boy that not only learned to run a automobile but how to drive it to memphis and get it out of that son of a bitchs private mudhole too all in one day is plenty old enough to handle anything hell meet only he had to cough again hard and clear his throat and then go to the window and open it and spit again and close it again then he came back and thats point number three thats what im trying to impress on you everything a mfelboy sees and learns and hears about even if he dont understand it at the time and cant even imagine he will ever have any use to know it some day he will have a use for it and will need it providing he has still got it and aint give it away to nobody and then he will thank his stars for the good friend that has been his friend since he had to be toted around that livery stable on his back like a baby and held mm on the first horse he ever rode that warned him in time not to throw it away and lose it for good by forgetfulness or accident or mischance or maybe even just friendly blabbing about what aint nobody elses business but theirs what you mean is whatever i see on this trip up here not to tell boss or father or mother or grandmother when we get back home is that it dont you agree boon said aint that not a bit more than just pure and sensible good sense and nobodys business but yours and mine dont you agree then why didnt you just come right out and say so i said only he still remembered to make me take another bath the bathroom smelled even more i dont mean stronger i just mean more i didnt know much about boarding houses so maybe they could have one with just ladies in it i asked boon we were on the way back downstairs then it was beginning to get dark and i was hungry you damn right theyre ladies he said if i so much as catch you trying to show any sass to any of them i mean dont any men board here live here no dont no men actively live here except mr binford and there aint no boarding to speak of neither but they have plenty of company here in and out after supper and later on youll see of course this is sunday night and mr binford is pretty strict about sunday no dancing and frolicking just visiting their particular friends quiet and polite and not wasting too much time and mr binford sees to it they damn sure better keep on being quiet and polite while they are here in fact hes a good deal that way even on week nights which reminds me all you need to do is be quiet and polite yourself and enjoy yourself and listen good in case he happens to say anything to you in particular because he dont talk very loud the first time and he dont never like it when somebody makes him have to talk twice this way theyre likely in miss rebas room they were miss reba miss corrie mr binford and otis miss reba had on a black dress now and three more diamonds yellowing too mr binford was little the littlest one in the room above otis and me he had on a black sunday suit and gold studs and a big gold watch chain and a heavy moustache and a goldheaded cane and his derby hat and a glass of whiskey on the table at his elbow but the first thing you noticed about him was his eyes because the first thing you found out was that he was already looking at you otis had his sunday clothes on too he was not even as big as me but there was something wrong about him evening boon mr binford said evening mr binford boon said this is a friend of mine lucius priest but when i made my manners to him he didnt say anything at all he just quit looking at me reba he said buy boon and corrie a drink tell minnie to make these boys some lemonade minnies putting supper on miss reba said she unlocked the closet door it had a kind of bar in itone shelf with glasses another with bottles besides that one of corries dont want lemonade no more than boon does he wants beer i know it mr binford said he slipped away from me out at the park he would have made it only he couldnt find anybody to go into the saloon for him is yours a beerhead too boon no sir i said i dont drink beer why mr binford said you dont like it or you cant get it no sir i said im not old enough yet whiskey then mr binford said no sir i said i dont drink anything i promised my mother i wouldnt unless father or boss invited me whos his boss mr binford said to boon he means his grandfather boon said oh mr binford said the one that owns the automobile so evidently nobody promised him anything you dont need to boon said he tells you what to do and you do it you sound like you call him boss too mr binford said sometimes thats right boon said thats what i meant about mr binford he was already looking at me before i even knew it but your mothers not here now he said youre on a tear with boon now eightyis itmiles away no sir i said i promised her i see mr binford said you just promised her you wouldnt drink with boon you didnt promise not to go whorehopping with him you son of a bitch miss reba said i dont know how to say it without moving she and miss corrie jumped sprang confederated miss reba with the whiskey bottle in one hand and three glasses in the other thatll do mr binford said like hell miss reba said i can throw you out too dont think i wont what the hell kind of language is that and you too miss corrie said she was talking at miss reba youre just as bad right in front of them i said thatll do mr binford said one of them cant get beer and the other dont drink it so maybe they both just come here for refinement and education call it they just got some they just learned that whore and son of a bitch are both words to think twice before pulling the trigger on because both of them can backfire aw come on mr binford boon said why be damned if here aint still another hog in this wallow mr binford said a big one too wake up miss reba before these folks suffocate for moisture miss reba poured the whiskey her hand shaking enough to clink the bottle against the glass saying son of a bitch son of a bitch son of a bitch in a thick fierce whisper thats better mr binford said lets have peace around lets drink to it he raised his glass and was saying l dies and gents all when somebodyminnie i supposei began to ring a hand bell somewhere in the back mr binford got up thats better still he said hash time learn us all the refinement and education that theres a better use for the mouth than running private opinions through it we went back toward the dining room not fast mr binford leading the way there were feet again going fast two more ladies girlsthat is one of them was still a girt hurried down the stairs still buttoning their clothes one in a red dress and the other in pink panting a little we hurried as fast as we could one of them said quickly to mr binford were not late im glad of that mr binford said i dont feel like lateness tonight we went in there were more than enough places at the table even with otis and me minnie was still bringing things all coldfried chicken and biscuits and vegetables left over from dinner except mr binfords his supper was hot not a plate a dish of steak smothered in onions at his place you see how much ahead of his time mr binford was already a republican i dont mean a republicani dont know what his tennessee politics were or if he had anyi mean a republican he was more he was a conservative like this a republican is a man who made his money a liberal is a man who inherited his a democrat is a barei footed liberal in a crosscountry race a conservative is a republican who has learned to read and write we all sat down the two new ladies too i had met so many people by now that i couldnt get names any more and had stopped trying besides i never saw these two again we began to eat maybe the reason mr binf ords steak smelled so extra was that the rest of the food had smelled itself out at noon then one of the new ladiesthe one who was no longer a girlsaid were we mr binford now the other one the gi had stopped eating too were you what mr binford said you know what the girl said cried miss reba said you know we do the best we candont dare mate no extra noiseno music on sunday when all the other places doalways shushing our customers up every time they just want to have a little extra funbut if we aiit already setting down at our places in this dining room p when he sticks his nose in the door next saturday we got to drop twentyfive cents into that god damned box they are house rules mr binford said a house without rules is not a house the trouble with you bitches is you have to act like ladies some of the time but you dont know how im learning you how you cant talk to me that way the older one said all right mr binford said well turn it around the trouble with you ladies is you dont know how to quit acting like bitches the older one was standing now there was something wrong about her too it wasnt that she was old like grandmother is old because she wasnt she was alone it was just that she shouldnt have had to be here alone to have to go through this no thats wrong too its that nobody should ever have to be that alone nobody not ever she said im sorry miss reba im going to move out tonight where mr binford said across the street to birdie wattss maybe shell let you bring your trunk back with you this timeunless shes already sold it miss reba the woman said quietly miss reba all right miss reba said briskly sit down and eat your supper you aint going nowhere yes she said i like peace too so im going to mention just one more thing then well close this subject for good she was talking up the table at mr binford now what the hells wrong with you what the hell happened this afternoon to get you into this god damned humor nothing that i noticed mr binford said thats right otis said suddenly nothing sure didnt happen he wouldnt even run there was something like a quick touch of electricity miss reba was sitting with her mouth open and her fork halfway in it i didnt understand yet but everybody else even boon did and in the next minute i did too who wouldnt run miss reba said the horse otis said the horse and buggy we bet on in the race did they mr binford now the silence was no longer merely electric it was shocked electrocuted remember i told you there was something wrong somewhere about otis though i still didnt think this was quite it or at least all of it but miss reba was still fighting because women are wonderful they can bear anything because they are wise enough to know that all you have to do with grief and trouble is just go on through them and come out on the other side i think they can do this because they not only decline to dignify physical pain by taking it seriously they have no sense of shame at the idea of being knocked out she didnt quit even then a horse race she said at the zoo in overton park not overton park otis said the driving park we met a man on the streetcar that knowed which horse and buggy was going to win and changed our mind about overton park only they didnt win did they mr binford but even then we never lost as much as the man did we didnt even lose forty dollars because mr binford give me twentyfive cents of it not to tell so all we lost was just thirtynine dollars and seventyfive cents only on top of that my twentyfive cents got away from me in that beer mixup mr binford was telling about didnt it mr binford and then some more silence it was quite peaceful then miss reba said you son of a bitch then she said go on finish your steak first if you want and mr binford wasnt a quitter either he was proud too that gave no quarter and accepted none like a gamecock he crossed his knife and fork neatly and without haste on the steak he had barely cut into yet he even folded his napkin and pushed it back through the ring and got up and said excuse me all and went out looking at nobody not even otis well jesus the younger of the two late ones the girl said it was then i noticed minnie standing in the halfopen kitchen door what do you know get to hell out of here miss reba said to the girl both of you the girl and the woman rose quickly you mean leave the girl said no miss corrie said just get out of here if youre not expecting anybody in the next few minutes why dont you take a walk around the block or something they didnt waste any time either miss corrie got up you too she told otis go upstairs to your room and stay there hell have to pass miss rebas door to do that boon said have you forgot about that quarter it was more than a quarter otis said there was them eightyfive cents i made pumping the pee a noler for them to dance saturday night when he found out about the beer he taken that away from me too but miss reba looked at him so you sold him out for eightyfive cents she said go to the kitchen miss corrie told otis let him come back there minnie all right minnie said ill try to keep him out of the icebox but hes too fast for me hell let him stay here miss reba said its too late now he should have been sent somewhere else before he ever got off that arkansas train last week miss corrie went to the chair next to miss reba why dont you go and help him pack she said quite gently who the hell are you accusing miss reba said i will trust him with every penny ive got except for those god damn horses she stood up suddenly with her trim rich body and the hard handsome face and the hair that was too richly red why the hell cant i do without him she said why the hell cant i now now miss corrie said you need a drink give minnie the keys no she cant go to your room yet he gone minnie said i heard the front door it dont take him long it never do thats right miss reba said me and minnie have been here before havent we minnie she gave minnie the keys and sat down and minnie went out and came back with a bottle of gin this time and they all had a glass of gin minnie too though she declined to drink with this many white people at once each time carrying her full glass back to the kitchen then reappearing a moment later with the glass empty except otis and me and so i found out about mr binford he was the landlord that was his official even if unwritten title and designation all places houses like this had one had to have one in the alien outside world fortunate enough not to have to make a living in this hard and doomed and selfdestroying way he had a harder and more contemptuous name but here the lone male not even in a simple household of women but in a hysteria of them he was not just lord but the unthanked and thankless catalyst the single frail power wearing the shape of respectability sufficient to compel enough of order on the hysteria to keep the unit solvent or anyway eatinghe was the agent who counted down the money and took the receipt for the taxes and utilities who dealt with the tradesmen from the liquor dealers through the grocers and coal merchants down through the plumbers who thawed the frozen pipes in winter and the casual labor which cleaned the chimneys and gutters and cut the weeds out of the yard his was the hand which paid the blackmail to the law it was his voice which fought the losing battles with the street and assessmentcommissioners and cursed the newspaper boy the day after the paper wasnt delivered and of these i mean landlords in this society mr binford was the prince and paragon a man of style and presence and manner and ideals incorruptible in principles impeccable in morals more faithful than many husbands during the whole five years he had been miss rebas lover whose sole and only vice was horses running in competition on which bets could be placed this he could not resist he knew it was his weakness and he fought against it but each time at the cry of theyre off he was putty in the hands of any stranger with a dollar to bet he knowed it hisself minnie said he was ashamed of hisself and for hisself both for being so weak of there being anything bigger than him to find out he aint bigger than anything he could meet up with he dont care where nor what even if on the outside to folks that didnt know him he just looked like a banty rooster so he would promise us and mean it like he done that time two years ago when we finally had to throw him out you remember how much work it taken to get him back that time she told miss reba i remember miss reba said pour another round i dont know how hell manage it minnie said because when he leaves he dont take nothing but his clothes i mean just the ones hes got on since it was miss rebas money that paid for them but wont two days pass before a messenger will be knocking on the door with every cent of them forty dollars you mean thirtynine six bits boon said no minnie said every one of them forty dollars even that quarter was miss rebas he wont be satisfied less then miss reba will send for him and he wont come last year when we finally found him he was working in a gang laying a sewer line way down past the frisco depot until she had to beg him right down on her bended knee come on miss reba said stop running your mouth long enough to pour the gin anyway minnie began to pour then she stopped the bottle suspended whats that hollering she said now we all heard it a faint bawling from somewhere toward the back go and see miss reba said here give me the bottle minnie gave her the bottle and went back to the kitchen miss reba poured and passed the bottle hes two years older now miss corrie said hell have more sense whats he saving it for miss reba said go on pass it minnie came back she said man standing in the back yard hollering mr boon hogganbeck at the back wall of the house he got something big with him we ran following boon through the kitchen and out onto the back gallery it was quite dark now the moon was not high enough yet to do any good two dim things a little one and a big one were standing in the middle of the back yard the little one bawling boon hogganbeck mister boon hogganbeck hellaw hellaw toward the upstairs windows until boon overrode him by simple volume shut up shut up shut up it was ned what he had with him was a horse chapter we were all in the kitchen good godalmighty boon said you swapped bosss automobile for a horse he had to say it twice even because ned was still looking at minnies tooth i mean he was waiting for it again maybe miss reba had said something to her or maybe minnie had spoken herself what i do remember is the rich instantaneous glint of gold out of the middle of whatever minnie said in the electric light of the kitchen as if the tooth itself had gained a new luster lambence from the softer light of the lamp in the outside darkness like the horses eyes hadthis and its effect on ned it had stopped him cold for that moment instant like basilisk so had it stopped me when i first saw it so i knew what ned was experiencing only his was more so because i realised this dimly too even at only eleven that i was too far asunder not merely in race but in age to feel what ned felt i could only be awed astonished and pleased by it i could not like ned participate in that tooth here in the ancient battle of the sexes was a foeman worthy of his steel in the ancient mystic solidarity of race here was a high priestess worth dying forif such was your capacity for devotion which it was soon obvious was not what ned intended anyway hoped to do with minnie so boon had to repeat before ned heardor anyway noticedhim you know good as me ned said that boss dont want no automobile he bought that thing because he had to because colonel sartoris made him he had to buy that automobile to put colonel sartoris back in his place he had done upstarted from what bass likes is a horseand i dont mean none of these highnamed harness plugs you and mr maury has in that livery stable but a horse and i got him one the minute he sees this horse hes gonter and mr maury has in that livery stable but a horse and could get afaolt of it before somebody else done it it was like a dream a nightmare you know it is and if you can only touch something hard real actual unaltered you can wake yourself boon and i had the same idea instantaneous i moved quicker only because there was less of me to put in motion ned stopped us he read two minds no need to go look he said he done already come and got it boon frozen in midstride glared at me the two of us mutual in one horrified unbelief while i fumbled in my pocket but the switch key was there sho ned said be never needed that thing he was a expert he claimed he knowed how to reach his hand in behind the lock and turn it on from the back he done it too i didnt believe it neither until i seen it it never give him no trouble atall he even throwed in the halter with the horse weboon and iwere not running but fast enough miss reba and miss corrie too to the front door the automobile was gone that was when i realised that miss reba and miss corrie were there too and that they had said nothing whatever themselvesno surprise shock watching and listening not missing any part of it but not saying anything at all as if they belonged to a different and separate society kind from boon and me and ned and grandfathers automobile and the horse whoever it belonged to and had no concern with us and our doings but entertainment and i remembered how that was exactly the way mother would watch me and my brothers and whatever neighborhood boys were involved not missing anything quite constant and quite dependable even warmly so bright and kind but insulate until the moment the need arrived to abolish the bone and when necessary stanch the consequent blood we went back to the kitchen where we had left ned and minnie we could already hear ned money you talking about goodlooking i got it or i can get it lemme get this horse put up and fed and me and you gonter step out and let that tooth do its shining amongst something good enough to match it like a dish of catfish or maybe hog meat if it likes hog meat better all right boon said go get that horse where does the man live which man ned said what you want with him to get bosss automobile back ill decide then whether to send you to jail here or take you back to jefferson and let boss have the fun whynt you stop talking a minute and listen to me ned said in course i knows where the man lives didnt i just trade a horse from him this evening let him alone we dont want him yet we wont need him until after the race because we aint just got the horse he throwed in the horse race too a man at possum got a horse waiting right this minute to run against him as soon as we get there in case you ladies dont know where possums at its where the railroad comes up from jefferson and crosses the memphis one where you changes cars unlessen you comes by automobile like we done all right boon said a man at possum oh miss reba said parsham thats right ned said where they has the birddog trials it aint no piece got a horse done already challenged this un to a threeheat race fifty dollars a heat winner take all but that aint nothing just a hundred and fifty dollars what we gonter do is win back that automobile how boon said how the hell are you going to use tiie horse to win the automobile back from the man that has already give you the horse for it because the man dont believe the horse can run why you think he swapped me as cheap as a automobile why didnt he just keep the horse and win him a automobile of his own if he wanted one and have both of thema horse and a automobile too ill bite boon said why i just told you this horse done already been beat twice by that possum horse because never nobody knowed how to make him run so naturally the man will believe that if the horse wouldnt run them other two times he aint gonter run this time neither so all we got to do is bet him the horse against bosss automobile which he will be glad to bet because naturally he wouldnt mind owning the horse back too long as hes already got the automobile especially when it aint no more risk than just having to wait at the finish line until the horse finally comes up to where he can catch him and tie him behind the automobile and come on back to memphis this was the first time miss reba spoke she said jesus because he dont believe i can make that horse run neither but unlessen i done got rusty on my trading and made a mistake i dont know about he dont disbelieve it enough not to be at possum day after tomorrow to find out and if you cant scrap up enough extra boot amongst these ladies here to make him good interested in betting that automobile against it you better hadnt never laid eyes on boss priest in your born life it would have tooken a braver man than me to just took his automobile back to him but maybe this horse will save you because the minute i laid my eyes on that horse it put me in mind of hee hee hee boon said in that harsh and savage parody you give away bosss automobile for a horse that cant run and now youre fixing to give the horse back providing i can scrape up enough boot to interest him let me finish ned said boon stopped you gonter let me finish ned said finish then boon said and make it put me in mind of a mule i use to own ned said now they both stopped looking at each other we all watched them after a moment ned said gently almost dreamily these ladies wasnt acquainted with that mule naturally being young ladies like they is not to mention so fur away as yoknapatawpha county its too bad boss or mr maury aint here now to tell them about him i could have done that because the mule was one of our family legends it was back when father and ned were young men before grandfather moved in from mccaslin to become a jefferson banker one day during cousin mccaslins cousin zacks fathers absence ned bred the mare of his matched standardbred carriage team to the farm jack when the consequent uproar exhausted itself and the mule colt was foaled cousin mccaslin made ned buy it from him at ten cents a week subtracted from neds wages it took ned three years by which time the mule had consistently beaten every mule matched against him for fifteen or twenty miles around and was now being challenged by mules from forty and fifty and beating them you were born too late to be acquainted with mules and so comprehend the startling the even shocking import of this statement a mule which will gallop for a halfmile in the single direction elected by its rider even one time becomes a neighborhood legend one that will do it consistently time after time is an incredible phenomenon because unlike a horse a mule is far too intelligent to break its heart for glory running around the rim of a milelong saucer in fact i rate mules second only to rats in intelligence the mule followed in order by cats dogs and horses lastassuming of course that you accept my definition of intelligence which is the ability to cope with environment which means to accept environment yet still retain at least something of personal liberty the rat of course i rate first he lives in your house without helping you to buy it or build it or repair it or keep the taxes paid he eats what you eat without helping you raise it or buy it or even haul it into the house you cannot get rid of him were he not a cannibal he would long since have inherited the earth the cat is third with some of the same qualities but a weaker punier creature he neither toils nor spins he is a parasite on you but he does not love you he would die cease to exist vanish from the earth i mean in his socalled domestic form but so far he has not had to there is the fable chinese i think literary i am sure of a period on earth when the dominant creatures were cats who after ages of trying to cope with the anguishes of mortalityfamine plague war injustice folly greedin a word civilised government convened a congress of the wisest cat philosophers to see if anything could be done who after long deliberation agreed that the dilemma the problems themselves were insoluble and the only practical solution was to give it up relinquish abdicate by selecting from among the lesser creatures a species race optimistic enough to believe that the mortal predicament could be solved and ignorant enough never to learn better which is why the cat lives with you is completely dependent on you for food and shelter but lifts no paw for you and loves you not in a word why your cat looks at you the way it does the dog i rate fourth he is courageous faithful monogamous in his devotion he is your parasite too his failure as compared to the cat is that he will work for youi mean willingly gladly ape any trick no matter how silly just to please you for a pat on the head as sound and firstrate a parasite as any his failure is that he is a sycophant believing that he has to show gratitude also he will debase and violate his own dignity for your amusement he fawns in return for a kick he will give his life for you in battle and grieve himself to starvation over your bones the horse i rate last a creature capable of but one idea at a time his strongest quality is timidity and fear he can be tricked and cajoled by a child into breaking his limbs or his heart too in running too far too fast or jumping things too wide or hard or high he will eat himself to death if not guarded like a baby if he had only one gram of the intelligence of the most backward rat he would be the rider the mule i rate second but second only because you can make him work for you but that too only within his own rigid selfset regulations he will not permit himself to eat too much he will draw a wagon or a plow but he will not run a race he will not try to jump anything he does not indubitably know beforehand he can jump he will not enter any place unless he knows of his own knowledge what is on the other side he will work for you patiently for ten years for the chance to kick you once in a word free of the obligations of ancestry and the responsibilities of posterity he has conquered not only life but death too and hence is immortal were he to vanish from the earth today the same chanceful biological combination which produced him yesterday would produce him a thousand years hence unaltered unchanged incorrigible still within the limitations which he himself had proved and tested still free still coping which is why neds mule was unique a phenomenon put a dozen mules on a track and when the word go is given a dozen different directions will be taken like a scattering of disturbed bugs on the surface of a pond the one of the twelve whose direction happens to coincide with the track will inevitably win but not neds mule father said it ran like a horse but without the horses frantic frenzy the starts and falterings and the frightened heartbreaking bursts of speed it ran a race like a job it sprang into what it had already calculated would be the exact necessary speed at neds touch or voice or whatever his signal was and that speed never altered until it crossed the finish line and ned stopped it and nobody not even fatherwho was neds well not groom exactly but rather his second and betting agent knew just what ned did to it naturally the legend of that grew and mounted doing no harm to their stable either also i mean of just what magic ned had found or invented to make the mule run completely unlike any known mule but theywenever learned what it was nor did anybody else ever ride as its jockey even after ned began to put on years and weight until the mule died unbeaten at twentytwo years of age its grave any number of edmondses have certainly shown it to you is out there at mccaslin now thats what ned meant and boon knew it and ned knew he knew it they stared at each other this aint that mule boon said this is a horse this horse got the same kind of sense that mule had ned said he aint got as much of it but its the same kind they stared at each other then boon said lets go look at him minnie lighted a lamp with boon carrying it we all went out to the back porch and into the yard minnie and miss corrie and miss reba too the moon was just getting up now and we could see a little the horse was tied beneath a locust tree in the corner its eyes glowed then flashed away it snorted and we could hear one nervous foot you ladies kindly stand back a minute please ned said he aint used to much society yet we stopped boon holding the lamp high the eyes glowed coldly and nervously again as ned walked toward it talking to it until he could touch its shoulder stroking it still talking to it until he had the halter in his hand now dont run that lamp at him he told boon just walk up and hold the light where the ladies can see a horse if they wants to and when i says horse i means horse not them plugs they calls horses back yonder in jefferson stop talking and bring him out where we can see him boon said youre looking at him now ned said hold the lamp up nevertheless he brought the horse out and moved him a little oh yes i remember him a threeyearold threequartersbred at least maybe more i wasnt expert enough to tell chestnut gelding not large not even sixteen hands but with the long neck for balance and the laidback shoulders for speed and the big hocks for drive and according to ned ned mccaslin for heart and will so that even at only eleven i believe i was thinking exactly what boon proved a moment later that he was he looked at the horse then he looked at ned but when he spoke his voice was no more than a murmur this horse is wait miss corrie said thats right i hadnt even noticed otis that was something else about him when you noticed him it was just a second before it would have been too late but that was still not what was wrong about him god yes miss reba said i tell you women are wonderful get out of here she told otis go in the house otis miss corrie said you bet otis said come on lucius no miss corrie said just you go on now you can go up to your room now its early yet otis said i aint sleepy neither i aint going to tell you twice miss reba said boon waited until otis was in the house we all did boon holding the lamp high so its light fell mostly on his and neds faces speaking again in that heatless monotone he and ned both this horse is stolen boon murmured what would you call that automobile ned murmured yes wonderful miss rebas tone was no more than boons and neds only brisker you got to get it out of town thats just exactly the idea i brought him here with ned said soon as i eats my supper me and him gonter start for possum have you got any idea how far it is to possum let alone in what direction boon said does it matter ned said when boss left town without taking that automobile with him right in his hand did your mind worry you about how far memphis was miss reba moved come in the house she said can anybody see him here she said to ned nome ned said i got that much sense i done already seen to that he tied the horse to the tree again and we followed miss reba up the back steps the kitchen she said its getting time for company to start coming in in the kitchen she said to minnie sit in my room where you can answer the door did you give me the keys back or have you all right dont give no credit to anybody unless you know them make the change before you even pull the cork if you can see whos in the house now too if anybody asks for miss corrie just say her friend from chicagos in town in case any of them dont believe you tell them to come around the alley and knock on the back door boon said for christs sake miss reba said havent you got troubles enough already to keep you busy if you dont want corrie having company why the hell dont you buy her outright instead of just renting her once every six months all right all right boon said and see where everybody in the house is too miss reba told minnie ill see about him myself miss corrie said make him stay there miss reba said hes already played all the hell with horses im going to put up with in one day miss corrie went out miss reba went herself and closed the door and stood looking at ned you mean you were going to walk to parsham and lead that horse thats right ned said do you know how far it is to parsham do it matter ned said again i dont need to know how far it is to possum all i needs is possum thats why i changed my mind about leading him it might be far at first i thought being as youre in the connection business what the hell do you mean miss reba said i run a house anybody thats too polite to call it that i dont want in my front door or back door neither i mean one of your ladies connections ned said that might have a saddle horse or even a plow horse or even a mule i could ride whilst lucius rides the colt and go to possum that way but we aint only got to run a solid mile the day after tomorrow we got to do it three times and at least two of them gonter have to be before the next horse can so im gonter walk him to possum all right miss reba said you and the horse are in parsham ah you need now is a iorse race any man with a horse can find a horse race anywhere ned said all he needs is for both of them to be able to stand up long enough to start can you make this one stand up that long thats right ned said can you make him run while hes standing up thats right ned said how do you know you can i made that mule run ned said what mule miss reba said miss corrie came in shutting the door behind her shut it good miss reba said she said to ned all right tell me about that race now ned looked at her for a full quarter of a minute the spoiled immune privilegedretainer impudence of his relations with boon and the avuncular bossiness of those with me were completely gone you sounds like you want to talk sense for a while he said try me miss reba said all right ned said a man another rich white man i dont call his name but i can find him aint but one horse like that in twenty miles of possum let alone tenowns a blood horse too that has already run twice against this horse last whiter and beat him twice that possum horse beat this horse just enough bad the first time for the other rich white man that owned that horse to bet twice as much the second time and got beat just enough more bad that second time that when this horse turns up in possum day after tomorrow wanting to run him another race that possum rich white man wont be just willing to run his horse again hell likely be proud and ashamed both to take the money all right miss reba said go on thats all ned said i can make this horse run only dont nobody but me know it yet so just in case you ladies would like to make up a little jackpot me and lucius and mr hogganbeck can take that along with us too that includes the one thats got that automobile now too miss reba said i mean among the ones that dont know you can make it run thats right ned said then why didnt he save everybody trouble and send you and the horse both to parsham since he believes all hes got to do to have the horse and the automobile both is to run that race now there was no sound they just looked at each other come on miss reba said you got to say something whats your name ned william mccaslin jefferson missippi ned said well miss reba said maybe he couldnt afford it ned said hell boon said neither have we shut up miss reba said to boon she said to ned i thought you said he was rich im talking about the one i swapped with ned said did he buy the horse from the rich one he had the horse ned said did he give you a paper of any kind when you swapped i got the horse ned said you cant read miss reba said can you i got the horse ned said miss reba stared at him youve got the horse youve got him to parsham you say you got a system that will make him run will the same system get that automobile to parsham too use your sense ned said you got plenty of it you done already seen more and seen it quicker than anybody else here just look a little harder and see that them folks i swapped that horse from them miss reba said you said a man but ned hadnt even stopped is in exactly the same fix we is they got to go back home sometime too sooner or later whether his name is ned william mccaslin or boon hogganbeck or whether its them folks i swapped the horse from to go back home with just the horse or just the automobile aint going to be enough hes got to have both of them is that it miss reba said not near enough ned said aint that what i been trying to tell you for two hours now miss reba stared at ned she breathed quietly once so now youre going to walk him to parsham with every cop in west tennessee snuffing every road out of memphis for horse reba miss corrie said by daylight tomorrow morning thats right ned said its long past too late for nobody to get caught now but you doing all right you doing fine you tell me she was looking at him she breathed twice this time she didnt even move her eyes when she spoke to miss corrie that brakeman what brakeman miss corrie said you know the one i mean that his mothers uncle or cousin or something hes not a brakeman miss corrie said hes a flagman on the memphis special to new york he wears a uniform too just like the conductor all right miss reba said flagman now she was talking to boon one of corries she looked at ned a moment connections maybe i like that word of yours after all his mothers uncle or something is vice president or something of the railroad that goes through parsham his uncle is division superintendent miss corrie said division superintendent miss reba said that is between the times when hes out at the driving park here or in any of the other towns his trains go through where he can watch horse races while his nephew is working his way up from the bottom with the silver spoon already in his mouth as long as he dont bite down on it hard enough to draw too much notice see what i mean the baggage car boon said right miss reba said then theyll be in parshain and already out of sight by daylight tomorrow even with the baggage car it will still cost money boon said then to stay hid until the race and then we got to put up a hundred and fifty for the race itself and all i got is fifteen or twenty dollars he rose go get that horse he told ned where did you say the man you gave that automobile lives sit down miss reba said jesus the trouble youre already in when you get back to jefferson and you still got time to count pennies she looked at ned what did you say your name was ned told her again you wants to know about that mule ask boon hogganbeck about him dont you ever make him call you mister she said to boon i always does ned said mister boon hogganbeck ask him about that mule she turned to miss corrie is sam in town tonight yes miss corrie said can you get hold of him now yes miss corrie said miss reba turned to boon you get out of here take a walk for a couple of hours or go over to birdie wattss if you want only for christs sake dont get drunk what the hell do you think corrie eats and pays her rent with while youre down there in that missippi swamp stealing automobiles and kidnapping children air i aint going nowhere boon said god damn it he said to ned go get that horse i dont need to entertain him miss corrie said i can use the telephone it was not smug nor coy it was just serene she was much too big a girl there was much too much of her for smugness or coyness but she was exactly right for serenity you sure miss reba said yes miss corrie said then get at it miss reba said come here boon said miss corrie stopped come here i said boon said she approached then just outside boons reach i noticed suddenly that she wasnt looking at boon at all she was looking at me which was perhaps why boon still sitting was able to reach suddenly and catch her arm before she could evade him drawing her toward him she struggling belatedly as a girl that big would have to still watching me turn loose she said ive got to telephone sure sure boon said plenty of time for that drawing her on until with that counterfeit composure that desperate willing to look at once forceful and harmless with which you toss the apple in your hand or any other piece of momentary distraction toward the bull you suddenly find is also on your side of the fence she leaned briskly down and kissed him pecked him quickly on the top of the head already drawing back but again too late his hand dropping and already gripping one cheek of her bottom in sight of us all she straining back and looking at me again with something dark and beseeching in her eyesshame grief i dont know whatwhile the blood rushed slowly into her big girls face that was not really plain at all except at first but only a moment she was still going to be a lady she even struggled like a lady but she was simply too big too strong for even anyone as big and strong as boon to hold with just one hand with no more grip than that she was free aint you ashamed of yourself she said cant you save that long enough for her to make one telephone call even miss reba said to boon if youre going to run fevers over her purity why the hell dont you set her up in a place of her own where she can keep pure and still eat then to miss corrie go on and telephone its already nine oclock already late for all we had to do the place had begun to wake upjumping as you say nowadays but decorously no uproar either musical or simply convivial mr binfords ghost still reigned still adumbrated his callipygian grottoes since only two of the ladies actually knew he was gone and the customers had not missed him yet we had heard the bell and minnies voice faintly at the front door and the footsteps of the descending nymphs themselves had penetrated from the stairs and even as miss corrie stood with the knob in her hand the chink of glasses interspersed in orderly frequence the bass rumble of the entertained and the shriller pipes of their entertainers beyond the door she opened and went through and then closed again then minnie came back too it seems that the unoccupied ladies would take turnabout as receptionists during the emergency you see how indeed the child is father to the man and mother to the woman also back there in jefferson i had thought that the reason corruption nonvirtue had met so puny a foeman in me as to be not even worthy of the name was because of my tenderness and youths concomitant innocence but that victory at least required the three hours between the moment i learned of grandfather seps death and that one when the train began to r and i realised that boon would be in unchallenged rx sion of the key to grandfathers automobile for at four days while here were miss reba and miss co foemen you would say already toughened even if wisened by constant daily experience to any wile or ass nonvirtue or virtue might invent against them already sacked and pillaged who thirty minutes before didnt even know that ned existed let alone the horse not to mentioj the complete stranger whom miss corrie had just left the room tranquilly confident to conquer with no other weapon than the telephone she had been gone nearly two minutes now minnie had taken the lamp and gone back to the back porch i noticed that ned was not in the room either minnie miss reba said toward the back door was any of that chicken yessum minnie said i already fixed him a plate he setting down to it now ned said something we couldnt hear it but we could hear minnie if all you got to depend on for appetite is me you gonter starve twice between here and morning we couldnt hear ned now miss corrie had been gone almost four minutes boon stood up quick god damn it he said are you even jealous of a telephone miss reba said what the hell can he do to her through that damn guttapercha earpiece but we could hear minnie a quick sharp flat sound then her feet she came in she was breathing a little quick but not much whats wrong miss reba said aint nothing wrong minnie said he like most of them he got plenty of appetite but he cant seem to locate where it is give him a bottle of beer unless youre afraid to go back out there i aint afraid minnie said he just natureminded maybe a little extra im used to it a heap of them are that way so natureminded dont nobody get no rest until they goes to sleep i bet you are boon said its that tooth thats the hell of women you wont let well enough alone what do you mean miss reba said you know damn well what i mean boon said you dont never quit you aint never satisfied you dont never have no mercy on a damn man look at her aint satisfied until she has saved and scraped to put a gold tooth a gold tooth in the middle of her face just to drive crazy a poor ignorant country nigger or spending five minutes talking into a wooden box just to dttve ctazy aaotriet poor ignorant covintry bastard that aint done nothing in the world but steal an automobile and now a horse i never knew anybody that needed to get married as bad as you do he sure do minnie said from the door that would cure him i tried it twice and i sho learned my lesson miss corrie came in all right she said serene no more plain than a big porcelain lamp with the wick burning inside is plain hes coming too hes going to help us he not me boon said the son of a bitch aint going to help me then beat it miss reba said get out of here how you going to do it walk back to missippi or ride the horse go on sit down you might as well while we wait for him tell us she said to miss corrie you see hes not a brakeman hes a flagman he wears a uniform just the same as the conductors hes going to help us all the world loves a lover quoth i think the swan who saw deeper than any into the human heart what pity he had no acquaintance with horses to have added all the world apparently loves a stolen race horse also miss corrie told us and otis was in the room now though i hadnt seen him come in with something still wrong about him though not noticing him until it was almost too late still wasnt it well have to buy at least one ticket to possum to have its parsham miss reba said all right miss corrie said something to check him as baggage on like you do a trunk sam will bring the ticket and the baggage check with him but it will be all right an empty boxcar will be on a side tracksam will know whereand all we have to do is get the horse in it and sam said wall him up in one corner with planks so he cant slip down sam will have some planks and nails ready too he said this was the best he could do at short notice because he didnt dare tell his uncle any more than he had to or his uncle would want to come too so sam says the only risk will be getting the horse from here to where the boxcar is waiting he says it wont do for she stopped looking at ned ned william mccaslin jefferson missippi ned said hours between the moment i learned of grandfather lesseps death and that one when the train began to move and i realised that boon would be in unchallenged possession of the key to grandfathers automobile for at least four days while here were miss reba and miss corrie foemen you would say already toughened even if not

for she stopped looking at ned ned william mccaslin jefferson missippi ned said ned to be walking along even a back street this late at night leading a horse the first policeman they pass will stop him so hesamis bringing a blanket and hes going to wear his uniform and him and boon and me will lead the horse to the depot and nobody will notice anything oh yes and the passenger train will jesus miss reba said a whore a pullman conductor and a missippi swamp rat the size of a water tank leading a race horse through memphis at midnight sunday night and nobody will notice it you stop miss corrie said stop what miss reba said you know talking like that in front of oh miss reba said if he just dropped up here from missippi with boon on a friendly visit you might say we might of could protected his ears but using this place as headquarters while they steal automobiles and horses hes got to take his chances like anybody else what were you saying about the train yes the passenger train that leaves for washington at four am will pick the boxcar up and well all be in possum before daylight parsham god damn it miss reba said we aint you coming too miss corrie said chapter thats what we did though first sam had to see the horse he came in the back way through the kitchen carrying the horse blanket he was in his uniform he was almost as big as boon so weall of us againstood once more in the back yard ned holding the lamp this time to shine its light not on the horse but on sams brassbuttoned coat and vest and the flat cap with the gold lettering across the front in fact i had expected trouble with ned over sam and the horse but i was wrong who me ned said what for we couldnt be no better off with a policeman himself leading the horse to possum on the contrary the trouble we were going to have about sam would be with boon sam looked at the horse thats a good horse sam said he looks like a damn good horse to me sure boon said he aint got no whistle nor bell neither on him he aint even got a headlight im surprised you can see him atall what do you mean by that sam said i dont mean nothing boon said just what i said youre an ironhorse man maybe you better go on to the depot without waiting for us you has miss reba said then she started over cant you see the mans just trying to help you going out of his way so that the minute you get back home the first live animal youll see wont be the sheriff hes the one to be inviting you to get to hell back where you came from and take your goddamn horse along with you apologise all right boon said forget it you call that an apology miss reba said what do you want boon said me to bend over and invite him to you hush right this minute miss corrie said and you dont help none neither boon said you already got me and miss reba both to where well have to try to forget the whole english language before we can even pass the time of day thats no lie miss reba said that one you brought here from arkansas was bad enough with one hand in the icebox after beer and the other one reaching for whatever was little and not nailed down whenever anybody wasnt looking and now boon hogganbecks got to bring another one thats got me scared to even open my mouth he didnt miss corrie said otis dont take anything without asking first do you otis thats right miss reba said ask him he certainly ought to know ladies ladies ladies sam said does this horse want to go to parsham tonight or dont he so we started but at first miss corrie was still looking at otis and me they ought to be in bed she said sure miss reba said over in arkansas or back down there in missippi or even further than that if i had my way but its too late now you cant send one to bed without the other and that one of boons owns part of the horse only at the last miss reba couldnt go either she and minnie couldnt be spared the place was jumping indeed now but still discreetly with sabbath decorum saturday nights fading tide rip in one last spumy upfling against the arduous humdrum of daybyday for mere bread and shetler so ned and boon put the blanket on the horse then from the sidewalk wened and otis and mewatched boon and sam in polyandrous maybe not amity but at least armistice miss corrie between them leading the horse down the middle of the street from arc light to arc light through the sunday evening quiet of second and third streets toward the union depot it was after ten now there were few lights these only in the other boarding houses i was experienced now i was a sophisticate not a connoisseur of course but at least cognizant i recognised a place similar to miss rebas when i saw one the saloons though were all dark that is i didnt know a saloon just by passing it there were still a few degrees yet veiled to me it was ned who told usotis and methey were saloons and that they were closed i had expected them to be neither one neither closed nor open remember i had been in memphis or in catalpa street less than six hours without my mother or father either to instruct me i was doing pretty well they calls it the blue law ned said whats a blue law i said i dont know neither ned said lessen it means they blewed in all the money saturday night and aint none of them got enough left now to make it worth burning the coal oil thats just the saloons otis said it dont hurt nobody that way what they dont sell sunday night they can just save it and sell it to somebody maybe the same folks monday but pugnucklings different you can sell it tonight and turn right around again and sell the same pugnuckling again tomorrow you aint lost nothing likely if they tried to put that blue law onto pugnuckling the police would come in and stop them whats pugnuckling i said you knows a heap dont you ned said to otis no wonder arkansaw cant hold you if the rest of the folks there knows as much as you do at your age time theys twentyone even texas wont be big enough otis said whats pugnuckling i said try can you put your mind on knuckling up some feed for that horse ned said to me still louder to try to keep him quiet long enough to get him to possum let alone into that train in the first place that there railroadowning conductor flinging boxcars around without even taking his hand out of his pocket is somebody reminded him of that maybe even a bucket of soap and water too so your aunthe was talking to otis nowcan take you around behind something and wash your mouth out otis said or maybe even the nearest handy stick ned said otis said and sure enough we met a policeman i mean otis saw the policeman even before the policeman saw the horse twentythree skiddoo otis said the policeman knew miss corrie then apparently he knew sam too where you taking him he said did you steal him borrowed him sam said they didnt stop we rode him to prayer meeting tonight and now were taking him back home we went on otis said twentythree skiddoo again i never seen that before he said every policeman i ever seen before speaking to anybody they give him something like minnie and miss reba already having a bottle of beer waiting for him before he could even get his foot inside even if miss reba cussed him before he come and cussed him again after he left and ever since i got here last summer and found out about it every day i go up to court square where that italian wop has got that fruit and peanut stand and sho enough here the policeman comes and without even noticing it takes a apple or a handful of peanuts he was almost trotting to keep up with us he was that much smaller than me i mean he didnt seem so much smaller until you saw him trotting to keep up there was something wrong about him when its you you say to yourself next year im going to be bigger than i am now simply because being bigger is not only natural its inevitable it doesnt even matter that you cant imagine to yourself how or what you will look like then and the same with other children they cant help it either but otis looked like two or three years ago he had already reached where you wont be until next year and since then he had been going backward he was still talking so what i thought back then was that the only thing to be was a policeman but i never taken long to get over that its too limited limited to what ned said to beer and apples and peanuts otis said whos going to waste his time on beer and apples and peanuts he said twentythree skiddoo three times now this town is where the jacks at jacks ned said in course they has jacks here dont memphis need mules the same as anybody else jack otis said spondulicks cash when i think about all that time i wasted in arkansas before anybody ever told me about memphis that tooth how much do you reckon that tooth by itself is worth if she just walked into the bank and taken it out and laid it on the counter and said gimme change for it yes ned said i mind a boy like you back there in jefferson used to keep his mind on money all the time too you know where hes at now here in memphis if hes got any sense otis said he never got that far ned said the most he could get was into the state penitentiary at parchman and at the rate you sounds like going thats where youll wind up too but not tomorrow otis said maybe not the next day neither twentythree skiddoo where even a durn policeman cant even pass by without a bottle of beer or a apple or a handful of peanuts put right in his hand before he can even ask for it them eightyfive cents them folks give me last night for pumping the pee a noler that that son of a bitch taken away from me this evening that i might a even pumped that pee a noler free for nothing if i hadnt found out by pure accident that they was aiming to pay me for it if i had just happened to step out the door a minute i might a missed it and if i hadnt even been there they would still a give it to somebody anybody that just happened to pass by see what i mean sometime just thinking about it i feel like just giving up just quitting quitting what ned said quitting for what just quitting otis said when i think of all them years i spent over there on a durn farm in arkansas with memphis right here across the river and i never even knowed it how if i had just knowed when i was four or five years old what i had to wait until just last year to find out about sometimes i just want to give up and quit but i reckon i wont i reckon maybe i can make it up how much you folks figger on making out of that horse never you mind about that horse ned said and the making up you needs to do is to make back up that street to wherever it is you gonter sleep tonight and go to bed he even paused half turning do you know the way back there aint nothing there otis said i already tried it they watch too close it aint like over in arkansas when aunt corrie was still at aunt fitties and i had that peephole if you swapped that automobile for him you must be figgering on at least two hundred this time ned turned completely around otis sprang leaped away cursing ned calling him niggersomething father and grandfather must have been teaching me before i could remember because i dont know when it began i just knew it was so that no gentleman ever referred to anyone by his race or religion go on i said theyre leaving us they were almost two blocks ahead now and already turning a corner we ran trotted ned too to catch up and barely did so the depot was in front of us and sam was talking to another man in greasy overalls with a lanterna switchman a railroad man anyway see what i mean ned said can you imagine police sending out a man with a lantern to show us the way and you see what i mean too all the world i mean about a stolen race horse who serves virtue works alone unaided in a chilly vacuum of reserved judgment where pledge yourself to nonvirtue and the whole countryside boils with volunteers to help you it seems that sam was trying to persuade miss corrie to wait in the depot with otis and me while they located the boxcar and loaded the horse into it even voluntarily suggesting that boon attend us with the protection of his size and age and sex proving that sams half anyway of the polyandrous stalemate was amicable and trusting but miss corrie would have no part of it speaking for all of us so we turned aside following the lantern through a gate into a maze of loading platforms and tracks now ned himself had to come forward and take the halter and quiet the horse to where we could move again in the aura now of the horses hot ammoniac reek you never smelled a frightened horse did you and the steady murmur of neds voice talking to it both of themmurmur and smellthickened dense concentrated now between the loom of lightless baggage cars and passenger coaches among the greenandruby gleams of switch points on until we were clear of the passenger yard and were now following a cinder path beside a spur track leading to a big dark warehouse with a loading platform in front of it and there was the boxcar too with a good twentyfive feet of moonlit thats right we were in moonlight now free of the street and depotlights wei could see it now vacancy between it and the nearest point of the platforma good big jump for even a jumping horse let alone a threeyearold flat racer that according to ned had a little trouble running anyway sam cursed quietly the entire depot establishment switchmen yard crews ticket sellers and all ill go get the goat the man with the lantern said we dont need no goat ned said no matter how far he can jump what we needs is to either move that flatform or that boxcar he means the switch engine sam told ned no he told the man with the lantern i expected this for a switching crew to miss just twentyfive feet is practically zero thats why i told you to bring the key to the section house get the crowbars maybe mr boon wont mind helping you why dont you go yourself boon said its your railroad im a stranger here why dont you take these boys on back home to bed if youre all that timid around strangers miss corrie said why dont you take them back home yourself boon said your old buddyboy there has already told you once you aint got no business here ill go with him to get the crowbars miss corrie told sam will you keep your eye on the boys all right all right boon said lets do something for christs sake that train will be along in four or five hours while were still debating whos first at the lick dog wheres that tool shed jack so he and the man with the lantern went on we had only moonlight now the horse hardly smelled at all now and i could see it nuzzling at neds coat like a pet and sam was thinking what i had been thinking ever since i saw the platform theres a ramp around at the back he said did he ever walk a ramp before why dont you take him on now and let him look at it when we get the car placed we can all help you carry him up if we have to dont you waste your time worrying about us ned said you just get that boxcar to where we wont have to jump no tenfoot gash into it this horse wants to get out of memphis as bad as you does only i was afraid sam would say dont you want this boy to go with you because i wanted to see that boxcar moved i didnt believe it so we waited it wasnt long boon and the man with the lantern came back with two crowbars that looked at least eight feet long and i watched miss corrie and otis too while they did it the man set his lantern down and climbed the ladder onto the roof and released the brake wheel and sam and boon jammed the ends of the bars between the back wheels and the rails pinching and nudging in short strokes like pumping and i still didnt believe it the car looming black and square and high in the moon solid and rectangular as a black wall inside the narrow silver frame of the moonlight one high puny figure wrenching at the brake wheel on top and two more puny figures crouching creeping nudging the silverlanced iron bars behind the back wheels so huge and so immobile that at first it looked not like the car was moving forward but rather boon and sam in terrific pantomimic obeisance were pinching infinitesimally rearward past the cars fixed and foundationed mass the moonmazed panoramic earth so delicately balanced now in the massive midst of motion that sam and boon dropped the bars and boon alone pressed the car gently on with his hands as though it were a childs perambulator up alongside the platform and into position and sam said all right and the man on top set the brake wheel again so all we had to do now was get the horse into it which was like saying here we are in alaska all we have to do now is find the gold mine we went around to the back of the warehouse there was a cleated ramp but the platform had been built at the right height for the drays to load and unload from it and the ramp was little more than a track for hand trucks and wheelbarrows stout enough but only about five feet wide railless ned was standing there talking to the horse he done seen it he said he know we want him to walk up it but he aint decided yet do he want to i wish now mr boxcar man had went a little further and borried a whup too you got one boon said he meant meone of my tricks graces i made it with my tongue against the sounding board of my mouth throat gorgea sound quite sharp and loud as sharp and loud when done right as the crack of a whip mother finally forbade me to do it anywhere inside our yard let alone in the house then it made grandmother jump once and use a swear word but just once that was almost a year ago so i might have forgotten how by this time thats right ned said so we has he said to me get you a long switch they ought to be one in that hedge bush yonder there was a privet bush all this was probably somebodys lawn or garden before progress industry commerce railroads came i cut the switch and came back ned led the horse up facing the ramp now you big folks mr boon and mr boxcar come up one on either side like you was the gateposts they did so ned halfway up the ramp now with the lead rope facing the horse and talking to it there you is he said right straight up this here chicken walk to glory and possum tennessee by sunup tomorrow he came back down already turning the horse moving fairly rapidly speaking to me now he done seen the switch fall right in behind him dont touch him or pop till i tell you to i did that the three of usned the horse then memoving directly away from the ramp for perhaps twenty yards when without stopping ned turned and wheeled the horse i still following until it faced the rise of the ramp between boon and sam twenty yards away when it saw the ramp it checked pop ned said i made the sound a good one the horse sprang a little ned already moving on a little faster now back toward the ramp when i tells you to pop this time touch him with the switch dont bit just tap him at the root of his tail a second after you pops he had already passed between boon and sam and was on the ramp the horse was now trying to decide which to do refuse or run out with the additional confusion of having to decide which of boon and sam would run over the easiest or simply bolt over and through us all you could almost see it happening which was maybe what ned was counting on an intelligence panicky and timorous and capable of only one idea at a time in which the intrusion of a second one reduces all to chaos pop ned said this time i tapped the horse too as ned had told me it surged leaped its forefeet halfway up the ramp the near hind foot boons side striking the edge of the ramp and sliding off until boon before ned could speak grasped the leg in both hands and set it back on the ramp leaning his weight against the flank the horse motionless now trembling all four feet on the ramp now now ned said lay your switch right across his hocks so hell know he got something behind him to not let him fall to not let him back off the ramp you mean sam said we need one of the crowbars go get it charley thats right ned said we gonter need that crowbar in a minute but all we needs right now is that switch yous too little he told me let mr boon and mr boxcar have it loop it behind his hocks like britching they did so one at each end of the umber switch now walk him right on up when i say pop this time pop loud so he will think the lick gonter be loud too but i didnt need to pop at all again ned said to the horse come on son lets go to possum and the horse moved boon and sam moving with it the switch like a loop of string pressing it on its forefeet on the solid platform now then one final scuffling scrabbling surge the platform resounding once as if it had leaped onto a wooden bridge its going to take more than this switch or that boy popping his tongue either to get him into that car sam said what gonter get him into that boxcar is that crowbar ned said aint it come yet it was here now prize thatere chicken walk loose ned said wait sam said what for so he can walk on it into that boxcar ned said hes used to it now hes done already found out aint nothing at the other end gonter hurt or skeer him he aint smelled the inside of an empty boxcar yet though sam said thats what im thinking about but neds idea did make sense besides we had gone much too far now to boggle even if ned had commanded us to throw down both walls of the warehouse so the horse wouldnt have to turn corners so boon and the railroad man prized the ramp away from the platform god damn it sam said do it quiet cant you aint you right here with us ned said sholy you can get a little more benefit outen them brass buttons than just walking around in them though it took all of us including miss corrie to lift the ramp onto the platform and carry it across and lay it like a bridge from the platform into the black yawn of the open car door then ned led the horse up and at once i understood what sam had meant the horse had not only never smelled an empty boxcar before but unlike mere humans it could see inside too i remember thinking now that weve torn up the ramp we cant even get it down off the platform again before daylight catches us but nothing like that happened i mean nothing happened i mean i dont know what happened none of us did ned led the horse its hooves ringing loud and hollow on the planks up to the end of the ramp which now was a bridge ned standing on the bridge just inside the door talking to the horse pulling lightly on the halter until the horse put one foot forward onto the bridge and i dont know what i was thinking a moment ago i had believed that not in all memphis were there enough people to get that horse into that black orifice then the next instant i was expecting that same surge and leap which would have taken the horse inside the boxcar as it had up the ramp when the horse lifted the foot and drew it back to the platform it and ned facing each other like a tableau i heard ned breathe once you folks just step back to the wall he said we did so i didnt know then what he did i just saw him one hand holding the lead rope the other stroking touching the horses muzzle then he stepped back into the car and vanished the lead rope tightened but only his voice came out come on son i got it ill be god damned sam said because that was all the loose bridge clattered a little the cavernous blackness inside the car boomed to the hooves but no more we carried the lantern in the horses eyes glowed coldly and vanished where ned stood with it in the corner wheres them planks and nails you talked about he asked sam bring that chicken walk on in thats already one whole wall hell sam said hold on now folks coming in here tomorrow morning already missing a whole boxcar ned said aint gonter have time to be littleminded over a homemade ladder outen somebodys henhouse so all of us again except nedincluding miss corriecarried the ravished ramp into the car and set it up and held it in place while boon and sam and the railroad man sam had the planks and nails ready too built a stall around the horse in the corner of the car before ned could even complain sam had a bucket for water and a box for grain and even a bundle of hay too we all stood back now in the aura of the horses contented munching he just the same as in possum right this minute ned said what you folks better wish is that he has already crossed that finish line first day after tomorrow sam said what time is it then he told us himself just past midnight time for a little sleep before the train leaves at four he was talking to boon now you and ned will want to stay here with your horse of course thats why i brought all that extra hay so you bed down here and ill take corrie and the boys on back home and well all meet here at you says boon said not harshly so much as with a kind of cold grimness you do the meeting here at four oclock if you dont oversleep maybe well see you he was already turning come on corrie youre going go leave your bosss automobilei mean your bosss horsei mean this horse whoever it really belongs tohere with nobody to watch it but this colored boy sam said naw boon said that horse belongs to the railroad now i got a baggage check to prove it maybe you just borrowed that railroad suit to impress women and little boys in but as long as youre in it you better use it to impress that baggage check or the railroad might not like it boon miss corrie said im not going home with anybody come on lucius you and otis its all right sam said we keep on forgetting how boon has to slave for five or six months in that cotton patch or whatever it is to make one night on catalpa street you all go on ill see you at the train cant you even say much obliged miss corrie said to boon sure boon said who do i owe one to the horse try one on ned sam said he said to ned you want me to stay here with you well be all right ned said maybe if you go too it might get quiet enough around here to where somebody can get some sleep i just wish now i had thought in time âž â i did sam said wheres that other bucket charley the railroad manswitchman whatever he was had it too it was in the same corner of the car with the planks and nails and tools and the feed it contained a thick crude ham sandwich and a quart bottle of water and a pint bottle of whiskey there you are sam said breakfast too i see it ned said whats your name whitefolks sam caldwell sam said sam caldwell ned said it strikes me that sam caldwell is a better name for this kind of horse business than twice some others a man could mention around here a little more and i could be wishing me and you was frequent enough to be permanent kindly much obliged youre kindly welcome sam said so we said good night to sam and ned and charley all of us except boon and otis that is and went back to miss rebas the streets were empty and quiet now memphis was using the frazzled wornout end of the week to get at least a little sleep and rest to face monday morning witlh we walked quietly too from vacant light to light between the dark windows and the walls but one faint single light dimly visible in what my new infallible roues instinct recognised immediately as a competitor of miss reba a single light similar in wanness behind miss rebas curtains because even here throe must by this time have spent itself even minnie herself gone to bed or home or wherever she retired to at her and miss rebas trades evensong because miss reba herself unlocked the front door to us smelling strongly of gin and in her hard handsome competent way even beginning to look like it she had changed her dress too this one didnt have hardly any top to it at all and in those days ladieswomendidnt really paint their faces so that was the first time i ever saw that too and she had on still more diamonds as big and yellowish as the first two no five but minnie hadnt gone to bed either she was standing in the door to miss rebas room looking just about worn out all fixed miss reba said locking the door behind us yes miss corrie said why dont you go to bed minnie make her go to bed you could a asked me that a hour back from now minnie said i just wish wouldnt nobody still be asking it two hours ahead from now but you wasnt here that other time two years ago come on to bed miss corrie said when we get back from possum wednesday god damn it parsham miss reba said all right miss corrie said wednesday minnie will have found out where he is and we can go and get him sure miss reba said and bury him right there in the same ditch this time pick and shovel and all if i had any sense you want a drink she said to boon minnies a damn christian scientist or republican or something and wont take one somebody around here has got to not take one minnie said it dont need no republican for that all it needs is just to be wore out and want to go to bed thats what we all need miss corrie said that train leaves at four and its already after one come on now go to bed then miss reba said who the hells stopping you so we went upstairs then otis and i went upstairs again he knew the way an attic with nothing in it but some trunks and boxes and a mattress made up into a bed on the floor otis had a nightshirt but the nightshirt still had the creases in it where miss corrie i suppose had bought it off the shelf in the store he went to bed just like i had to took off his pants and shoes and turned off the light and lay down too there was one little window and now we could see the moon and then i could even see inside the room because of the moonlight there was something wrong with him i was tired and coming up the stairs i had thought i would be asleep almost before i finished lying down but i could feel him lying there beside me not just wide awake but rather like something that never slept in its life and didnt even know it never had and suddenly there was something wrong with me too it was like i didnt know what it was yet only that there was something wrong and in a minute now i would know what and i would hate it and suddenly i didnt want to be there at all i didnt want to be in memphis or ever to have heard of memphis i wanted to be at home otis said twentythree skiddoo again the jack thats here he said you can even smell it it aint fair that its just women can make money pugnuckling while all a man can do is just try to snatch onto a little of it while its passing by there was that word again that i had asked twice what it meant but not any more not again lying there tense and rigid with the moonshaped window lying across mine and otiss legs trying not to hear him but having to one of the rooms is right under here on a busy night like saddy was you can hear them right up through the floor but there aint no chance here even if i could get a auger and bore a peephole through it that nigger and miss reba wouldnt let me bring nobody up here to make no money off of and even if i did they would probably take the money away from me like that son of a bitch done that pee a noler money today but it was different back home at aunt fitties when bee he stopped he lay perfectly still he said twentythree skiddoo again bee i said but it was too late no it wasnt too late because i already knew now how old are you he said eleven i said you got a year on me then he said too bad you aint going to be here after tonight if you just stayed around here next week we might figger that peephole out some way what for i said you see i had to ask it because what i wanted was to be back home i wanted my mother because you should be prepared for experience knowledge knowing not bludgeoned unaware in the dark as by a highwayman or footpad i was just eleven remember there are things circumstances conditions in the world which should not be there but are and you cant escape them and indeed you would not escape them even if you had the choice since they too are a part of motion of participating in life being alive but they should arrive with grace decency i was having to learn too much too fast unassisted i had nowhere to put it no receptacle pigeonhole prepared yet to accept it without pain and lacerations he was lying face up as i was he hadnt moved not even his eyes but i could feel him watching me you dont know much do you he said where did you say you was from missippi i said t he said no wonder you dont know nothing all right i said bee is miss corrie here i am throwing money away like it wasnt nothing he said but maybe me and you both can make something out of it sure her name is everbe corinthia named for grandmaw and what a hell of a name that is to have to work under bad enough even over there around kiblett where some of them already knowed it and was used to it and the others was usually in too much of a hurry to give a hoot whether she called herself nothing or not but here in memphis in a house like this that they tell me every girl in memphis is trying to get into it as soon as a room is vacant so it never made much difference over there around kiblett after her maw died and aunt fittie taken her to raise and started her out soon as she got big enough then when she found out how much more money there was in memphis and come over here never nobody knowed about the everbe and so she could call herself corrie so whenever im over here visiting her like last summer and now since i know about the everbe she gives me five cents a day not to tell nobody you see instead of telling you like i slipped up and done if i had just went to her instead and said at five cents a day i can try not to forget but ten cents a day would make it twice as hard to but never mind i can tell her tomorrow that you know it too and maybe we both can who was aunt fittie i said i dont know he said folks just called her aunt fittie she might have been kin to some of us but i dont know lived by herself in a house on the edge of town until she taken bee in after bees maw died and soon as bee got big enough which never taken long because bee was already a big girl even before she got to be ten or eleven or twelve or whenever it was and got started started at what i said you see i had to i had gone too far to stop now like in jefferson yesterdayor was it yesterday last year another time another life another lucius priest what is pugnuckling he told me with some of contempt but mostly a sort of incredulous almost awed almost respectful amazement thats where i had the peepholea knothole in the back wall with a tin slide over it that never nobody but me knowed how to work while aunt fittie was out in front collecting the money and watching out folks your size would have to stand on a box and i would charge a nickel until aunt fittie found out i was letting grown men watch for a dime that otherwise might have went inside for fifty cents and started hollering like a wildcat standing now i was hitting him so much to his surprise mine too that i had had to stoop and take hold of him and jerk him up within reach i knew nothing about boxing and not too much about fighting but i knew exactly what i wanted to do not just hurt him but destroy him i remember a second perhaps during which i regretted from what ancient playingfieldsofeton avatar that he was not nearer my size but not longer than a second i was hitting clawing kicking not at one wizened tenyearold boy but at otis and the procuress both the demon child who debased her privacy and the witch who debauched her innocenceone flesh to bruise and burst one set of nerves to wrench and anguish more not just those two but all who had participated in her debasement not only the two panders but the insensitive blackguard children and the brutal and shameless men who paid their pennies to watch her defenseless and undefended and unavenged degradation he had plunged sprawling across the mattress on his hands and knees now scrabbling at his discarded trousers i didnt know why nor care not even when his hand came out and up only then did i see the blade of the pocketknife in his fist nor did i care about that either that made us in a way the same size that was my carte blanche i took the knife away from him i dont know how i never felt the blade at all when i flung the knife away and hit him again the blood i saw on his face i thought was his then boon was holding me clear of the floor struggling and crying now he was barefoot wearing only his pants miss corrie was there too in a kimono with her hair down it reached further than her waist otis was scrunched back against the wall not crying but cursing like he had cursed at ned what the damned hell boon said his hand miss corrie said she paused long enough to look back at otis go to my room she said go on he went out boon put me down let me see it she said that was the first i knew where the blood came from a neat cut across the cushions of all four fingers i must have grasped the blade just as otis tried to snatch it away it was still bleeding that is it bled again when miss corrie opened my hand what the hell were you fighting about boon said nothing i said i drew my hand back keep it closed till i get back miss corrie said she went out and came back with a basia of water and a towel and a bottle of something and what looked like a scrap of a mans shirt she washed the blood off and uncorked the bottle its going to sting she said it did she tore a strip from the shirt and bound my hand he still wont tell what they were fighting about boon said at least i hope he started it not half your size even if he is a year older no wonder he pulled a knife he aint even as old i said hes ten he told me he was twelve boon said then i found out what was wrong about otis twelve miss corrie said hell be fifteen years old next monday she was looking at me do you want just keep him out of here i said im tired i want to go to sleep dont worry about otis she said hes going back home this morning theres a train that leaves at nine oclock im going to send minnie to the depot with him and tell her to watch him get on it and stand where she can see his face through the window until the train moves sure boon said and he can have my grip to carry the refinement and culture back in bringing him over here to spend a week in a memphis you hush miss corrie said house hunting refinement and culture maybe he found it he might a hunted for years through arkansas catcribs and still not found nobody near enough his size to draw that pocketknife on stop it stop it miss corrie said sure sure boon said but after all lucius has got to know the name of where hes at in order to brag about where hes been then they turned the light out and were gone or so i thought it was boon this time turning the light on again maybe you better tell me what it was he said nothing i said he looked down at me huge naked to the waist his hand on the light to turn it out again eleven years old he said and already knifecut in a whorehouse brawl he looked at me i wish i had knowed you thirty years ago with you to learn me when i was eleven years old maybe by this time id a had some sense too good night good night i said he turned off the light then i had been asleep it was miss corrie this time kneeling beside the mattress i could see the shape of her face and the moon through her hair she was the one crying this timea big girl too big to know how to cry daintily only quietly i made him tell me she said you fought because of me ive had peopledrunksfighting over me but youre the first one ever fought for me i aint used to it you see thats why i dont know what to do about it except one thing i can do that i want to make you a promise back there in arkansas it was my fault but it wont be my fault any more you see you have to learn too fast you have to leap in the dark and hope that somethingit theywill place your foot right so maybe there are after all other things besides just poverty and nonvirtue who look after their own it wasnt your fault then i said yes it was you can choose you can decide you can say no you can find a job and work but it wont be my fault any more thats the promise i want to make you for me to keep like you kept that one you told mr binford about before supper tonight youll have to take it will you take it all right i said but youll have to say youll take it youll have to say it out loud yes i said ill take it now try to get back to sleep she said ive brought a chair and im going to sit here where ill be ready to wake you in time to go to the depot you go back to bed too i said i aint sleepy she said ill just sit here you go on back to sleep and this time boon again the moonshaped square of window had shifted so i had slept this time his voice trying at least for whisper or anyway monotone looming still naked from the waist up over the kitchen chair where everbe i mean miss corrie sat his hand grasping the backwardstraining of her arm come on now we aint got but a hour left let me go she whispered too its too late now let me go boon then his rasping murmur still trying for calling itself whisper what the hell do you think i came all the way for waited all this long for all this working and saving up and waiting for then the shape of the mooned window had moved still more and i could hear a rooster somewhere and my cut hand was partly tinder me and hurting which was maybe what waked me so i couldnt tell if this was the same time or he had gone and then come back only the voices still trying for whisper and if a rooster was crowing it was time to get up and oh yes she was crying again i wont i wont let me alone all right all right but tonight is just tonight tomorrow night when were settled down in possum no not tomorrow either i cantl i cant let me alone please boon please chapter weeverbe and boon and iwere at the depot in plenty of timeor so we thought the first person we saw was ned waiting for us in front of it he had on a clean white shirteither a new one or he had managed somehow to get the other one washed but almost at once things began to go too fast for anyone to learn yet that the new shirt was one of sams ned didnt even give boon time to open his mouth calm yourself he said mr sam is keeping lightning whilst i finishes the outside arrangements the boxcar has done already been picked up and switched onto the train waiting behind the depot right now for you all to get on when mr sam caldwell runs a railroad its run mon we done already named him tooforkid lightning then he saw my bandage he almost pounced what you done to it i cut it i said its all right how bad he said yes everbe said its cut across all four fingers he ought not to move it even nor did ned waste any more time there either he looked quickly about us wheres that other one he said that other what boon said whistlebritches ned said that moneymouthed runt boy that was with us last night i may need two hands on that horse who do you think is gonter ride that race me and you thats even twice as heavy as me lucius was going to but being as we already got that other one we dont need to risk it hes even less weight than lucius and even if he aint got as much sense as lucius hes at least old enough in meanness to ride a horse race and wrapped up enough in money to want to win it and likely too much of a coward to turn loose and fall off which is all we needs where is he gone back to arkansas boon said how old do you think he is what he looks like ned said about fifteen aint he gone to arkansaw then somebody better go get him quick yes everbe said ill bring him there wont be time to go back and get him now so ill stay and bring him on the next train this afternoon now you talking ned said thats mr sams train just turn whistlebritches over to mr sam hell handle him sure boon said to everbe thatll give you a whole hour free to practise that no on sam maybe hes a better man than me and wont take it but she just looked at him then why dont you wait and bring otis on and well meet you in parsham tonight i said now boon looked at me well well he said whats that mr binford said last night if here aint still another fresh hog in this wallow except that this ones still just a shoat yet that is i thought it was please boon everbe said like that please boon take him too and the both of you get to hell back to that slaughterhouse that maybe you ought not to left in the first place boon said she didnt say anything this time she just stood there looking down a little a big girl that stillness suited too then she turned already walking maybe i will i said right on back home neds got somebody else to ride the horse and you dont seem to know what to do with none of the folks trying to help us he looked glared at me a second maybe all right he said he strode past me until he overtook her i said all right he said is it all right all right she said ill meet the first train today if you aint on it ill keep on meeting them all right all right she said she went on i bet aint none of you thought to bring my grip ned said what boon said where is it i said right there in the kitchen where i set it ned said that goldtooth highbrown seen it miss corriell bring it tonight i said come on we went into the depot boon bought our tickets and we went out to where the train was waiting with people already getting on it up ahead we could see the boxcar sam and the conductor and two other men were standing by the open door one of them must have been the engineer you see not just one casual offduty flagman but a functioning train crew you going to run him today the conductor said tomorrow boon said well we got to get him there first the conductor said looking at his watch whos going to ride with him me ned said soon as i can find a box or something to climb up on gimme your foot sam said ned cocked his knee and sam threw him up into the car see you in parsham tomorrow he said i thought you went all the way to washington boon said who me sam said thats just the train im going to double back from chattanooga tonight on twoonine ill be back in parsham at seven oclock tomorrow morning id go with you now and pick up twooeight in parsham tonight only i got to get some sleep besides you wont need me anyhow you can depend on ned until then so did boon and i i mean need sleep we got some until the conductor waked us and we stood on the cinders at parsham in the first light and watched the engine there was a cattleloading chute here spot the boxcar properly this time and take its train again and go on clicking car by car across the other tracks which went south to jefferson then the three of us dismantled the stall and ned led the horse out and of course naturally materialised from nowhere a pleasantlooking negro youth of about nineteen standing at the bottom of the chute said howdy mr mccaslin that you son ned said whichaway so we left boon for that time his was the motion role now the doing to find a place for all of us to live not just him and me but otis and everbe when they came tonight to locate a man whose name ned didnt even know whom nobody but ned said owned a horse and then persuade him to run it race itone figment of neds imagination to race another figmentin a hypothetical race which was in the future and therefore didnt exist against a horse it had already beaten twice this likewise according only to ned or figment three as a result of which ned intended to recover grandfathers automobile all this boon must do while still keeping clear of being challenged about who really did own the horse wened and the youth and me were walking now already out of town which didnt take long in those daysa hamlet two or three stores where the two railroads crossed the depot and loading chute and freight shed and a platform for cotton bales though some of it has not changed the big rambling multigalleried multistoried steamboatgothic hotel where the overalled aficionados and the professionals who trained the fine bird dogs and the northern millionaires who owned them one night in the lounge in his ohio business with everybody elses under the damocles sword of the federally closed banks i myself heard horace lytle refuse five thousand dollars for mary montrose gathered for two weeks each february paul rainey also who liked our country enoughor anyway our bear and deer and panther enoughto use some of the wall street money to own enough mississippi land for him and his friends to hunt them in a hound man primarily who took his pack of bear hounds to africa to see what they would do on lion or vice versa this white boys going to sleep walking the youth said aint you got no saddle but i wasnt going to sleep yet i had to find out to ask i didnt even know you knew anybody here let alone getting word ahead to them ned walked on as if i had not even spoken after a while he said over his shoulder so you wants to know how do you he walked on he said me and that boys grandpappy are masons why are you whispering i said boss is a mason too but i never heard him whisper about it i didnt know i was ned said but suppose i was what do you want to belong to a lodge for unless its so secret cant hardly nobody else get in it and how are you gonter keep it secret unless you treat it like one but how did you get word to him i said let me tell you something ned said if you ever need to get something done not just done but done quick and quiet and so you can depend on it and not no blabbing and gabbling around about it neither you hunt around until you finds somebody like mr sam caldwell and turn it over to him you member that folks around jefferson could use some of him they could use a heap of sam caldwells then we were there the sun was well up now it was a dogtrot house paintless but quite sound and quite neat among locust and chinaberry trees in a swept yard inside a fence which had all its palings too and a hinged gate that worked with chickens in the dust and a cow and a pair of mules in the stable lot behind it and two pretty good hounds which had already recognised the youth with us and an old man at the top of the gallery steps above theman old man very dark in a white shirt and galluses and a planters hat with perfectly white moustaches and an imperial coming down the steps now and across the yard to look at the horse because he knew remembered the horse and so one at least of neds figments vanished you all buy him he said we got him ned said long enough to run him once anyway ned said he said to me make your manners to uncle possum hood i did so rest yourself uncle parsham said you all about ready for breakfast aint you i could already smell it the ham all i want is to go to sleep i said hes been up all night ned said both of us only he had to spend his in a house full of women hollering why and how much whilst all i had was just a quiet empty boxcar with a horse but i was still going to help stable and feed lightning they wouldnt let me you go with lycurgus and get some sleep ned said im gonter need you soon before it gets too hot we got to find out about this horse and the sooner we starts the sooner it will be i followed lycurgus it was a leanto room a bed with a bright perfectly clean harlequinpatched quilt it seemed to me i was asleep before i even lay down and that ned was shaking me before i had ever slept he had a clean heavy wool sock and a piece of string i was hungry now you can eat your breakfast afterwards ned said you can learn a horse better on a empty stomach here holding the sock open whistlebritches aint showed up yet it might be better if he dont atall he the sort that no matter how bad you think you need him you find out afterward you was better off hold out your hand he meant the bandaged one he slipped the sock over it bandage and all and tied it around my wrist with the string you can still use your thumb but thisll keep you from forgetting and trying to open your hand and bust them cuts again uncle parsham and lycurgus were waiting with the horse he was bridled now under an old used but perfectly caredfor mcclellan saddle ned looked at it we might run him bareback unless they makes us but leave it on we can try him both ways and let him learn us which he likes best it was a small pasture beside the creek flat and smooth with good footing ned shortened the leathers to suit not me so much as him and threw me up you know what to do the same as with them colts out at mccaslin let him worry about which hand hes on likely all anybody ever tried to learn him is just to run as fast as the bit will let him whichever way somebody points his head which is all we wants too you dont need no switch yet besides we dont want to learn a switch we wants to learn him go on i moved him out into the pasture into a trot he was nothing on the bit a cobweb would have checked him i said so i bet ned said i bet he got a heap more whip calluses on his behind than bit chafes in his jaw go on move him but he wouldnt i kicked pounded my heels but he just trotted a little faster in the back stretch i was riding a circular course like the one we had beaten out in cousin zacks paddock until i realised suddenly that he was simply hurrying back to ned but still behind the bit he had never once come into the bridle his whole head bent around and tucked but with no weight whatever on the hand as if the bit were a pork rind and he a mohammedan or a fish spine and he a mississippi candidate for constable whose baptist opposition had accused him of seeking the catholic vote or one of mrs roosevelts autographed letters and a secretary of the citizens council or senator goldwaters cigar butt and the youngest pledge to the ada on until he reached ned and with a jerk i felt clean up to my shoulder snatched his head free and began to nuzzle at neds shirt uhuh ned said he had one hand behind him i could see a peeled switch in it now head him back he said to the horse you got to learn son not to run back to me until i sends for you then to me he aint gonter stop this time but you make like he is just one stride ahead of where if you was him you would think about turning to come to me reach back with your hand and whop him hard as you can now set tight and stepped back and cut the horse quick and hard across the buttocks it leapt sprang into full run the motion not our speed nor even our progress just the horses motion seemed terrific graceless of course but still terrific because it was simple reflex from fright and fright does not become horses they are built wrong for it being merely mass and symmetry while fright demands fluidity and grace and bizarreness and the capacity to enchant and enthrall and even appall and aghast like an impala or a giraffe or a snake even as the fright faded i could feel sense the motion become simply obedience no more than an obedient hand gallop on around the back turn and stretch and into what would be the home stretch when i did as ned ordered one stride before the point at which he had turned to ned before i reached back and hit him as hard as i could with the flat of my sound hand and again the leap the spring but only into willingness obedience alarm not anger nor even eagerness thatll do ned said bring him in we came up and stopped he was sweating a little but that was all how do he feel ned said i tried to tell him the front half of him dont want to run he reached out all right when i touched him ned said i tried again i dont mean his front end his legs feel all right his head just dont want to go anywhere uhuh ned said he said to uncle parsham you seen one of them races what happened i saw both of them uncle parsham said nothing happened he was running good until all of a sudden he must have looked up and seen there wasnt nothing in front of him but empty track uhuh ned said jump down i got down he stripped off the saddle hand me your foot how do you know that horse has been ridden bareback before uncle parsham said i dont ned said we gonter find out this boy aint got but one hand uncle parsham said here lycurgus but ned already had my foot this boy learnt holding on riding zack edmondss colts back in missippi i watched him at least one time when i didnt know what he was holding on with lessen it was his teeth he threw me up the horse did nothing it squatted flinched a moment trembling a little that was all uhuh ned said lets go eat your breakfast whistlebritches will be here to work him this evening then maybe lightning will start having some fun outen this too lycurguss mother uncle parshams daughter was cooking dinner now the kitchen smelled of the boiling vegetables but she had kept my breakfast warmfried sidemeat grits hot biscuits and buttermilk or sweet milk or coffee she untied my ridingglove from my hand so i could eat a little surprised that i had never tasted coffee since lycurgus had been having it on sunday morning since he was two years old and i thought i was just hungry until i went to sleep right there in the plate until lycurgus half dragged half carried me to his bed in the leanto and as ned said mr sam caldwell was some sam caldwell everbe and otis got down from the caboose of a freight train which stopped that long at parsham a few minutes before noon it was a through freight not intended to stop until it reached florence alabama or some place like that i dont know how much extra coal it took to pump up the air brakes to stop it dead still at parsham and then fire the boiler enough to regain speed and make up the lost time some sam caldwell twentythree skiddoo as otis said so when the loud unfamiliar voice waked me and lycurguss mother tied the ridingsock back on from where she had put it away when i went to sleep in my plate and i went outside there they all were a surrey tied outside the gate and uncle parsham standing again at the top of his front steps still wearing his hat and ned sitting on the nexttobottom step and lycurgus standing in the angle between steps and gallery as if the three of them were barricading the house and in the yard facing them everbe yes she brought it i mean neds grip and otis and boon and the one who was doing the loud talkinga man almost as big as boon and almost as ugly with a red face and a badge and a bolstered pistol stuck in his hind pocket standing between boon and everbe whowas still trying to pull away from the hand which was holding her arm yep he was saying i know old possum hood and more than that old possum hood knows me dont you boy we all knows you here mr butch uncle parsham said with no inflection whatever if any dont its just a oversight and soon corrected butch said if your womenfolks are too busy dusting and sweeping to invite us in the house tell them to bring some chairs out here so this young lady can set down you boy he told lycurgus hand down two of them chairs on the gallery there where me and youhe was talking at everbe nowcan set in the cool and get acquainted while sugar boyhe meant boon i dont know how i knew ittakes these boys down to look at that horse huh still holding everbes elbow he would tilt her gently away from him until she was almost off balance then a little faster though still not a real jerk pull her back again she still trying to get loose now she used her other hand pushing at his wrist and now i was watching boon you sure i aint seen you somewhere at birdie wattss maybe where you been hiding anyway a goodlooking gal like you now ned got up not fast morning mr boon he said you and mr shurf want lucius to bring the horse out butch stopped tilting everbe he still held her though whos he he said as a general rule we dont take to strange niggers around here we dont object though providing they notify themselves and then keep their mouths shut ned william mccaslin jefferson missippi ned said you got too much name butch said you want something quick and simple to answer to around here until you can raise a white mushtash and goat whisker like old possum there and earn it we dont care where you come from neither all youll need here is just somewhere to go back to but youll likely do all right at least you got sense enough to recognise law when you see it yes sir ned said im acquainted with law we got it back in jefferson too he said to boon you want the horse no everbe said she had managed to free her arm she moved quickly away she could have done it sooner by just saying boon which was what butchdeputy whatever he waswanted her to do and we all knew that too she moved quickly for a big girl on until she had me between her and butch holding my arm now i could feel her hand trembling a little as she gripped me come on lucius show us the way she said her voice tense a murmur almost passionate hows your hand does it hurt its all right i said you sure youd tell me does wearing that sock on it help its all right i said id tell you we went back to the stable that way everbe almost dragging me to keep me between her and butch but it was no good he simply walked me off i could smell him nowsweat and whiskey and now i saw the top of the pint bottle in his other hind pocket he butch holding her elbow again and suddenly i was afraid because i knew i didntand i wasnt sure boon didknow everbe that well yet no not afraid that wasnt the word not afraid because we boon alonewould have taken the pistol away from him and then whipped him but afraid for everbe and uncle parsham and uncle parshams home and family when it happened but i was more than afraid i was ashamed that such a reason for fearing for uncle parsham who had to live here existed hating not uncle parsham doing the hating but me doing it it all hating all of us for being the poor frail victims of being alive having to be alive hating everbe for being the vulnerable helpless lodestar victim and boon for being the vulnerable and helpless victimised and uncle parsham and lycurgus for being where they had to couldnt help but watch white people behaving exactly as white people bragged that only negroes behavedjust as i had hated otis for telling me about everbe in arkansas and hated everbe for being that helpless lodestar for human debasement which he had told me about and hated myself for listening having to hear about it learn about it know about it hating that such not only was but must be had to be if living was to continue and mankind be a part of it and suddenly i was anguished with homesickness wrenched and wrung and agonised with it to be home not just to retrace but to retract obliterate made ned take the horse back to wherever and whoever and however he had got it and get grandfathers automobile and take it back to jefferson in reverse if necessary travelling backward to unwind ravel back into nobeing neverbeing that whole course of dirt roads mudholes the man and the colorblind mules miss ballenbaugh and alice and ephum so that as far as i was concerned they had never been when sudden and quiet and plain inside me something said why dont you because i could i needed only say to boon were going home and ned would have returned the horse and my own abject confession would have the automobile located and recovered by the police at the price of merely my shame because i couldnt now it was too late maybe yesterday while i was still a child but not now i knew too much had seen too much i was a child no longer now innocence and childhood were forever lost forever gone from me and everbe was loose again i had missed seeing how she did it this time only that she was free facing him she said something inaudible quick anyway he was not even touching her now just looking down at her grinning sure sure he said thrash around a little maybe i like that too makes it look a little better to old sugar boy too all right boy he said to ned lets see that horse you stay here ned told me me and lycurgus will get him so i stood next to everbe at the fence she was holding my arm again her hand still shaking a little ned and lycurgus led the horse out ned was already looking toward us he said quickly wheres that other one dont tell me you got two of them butch said but i knew what ned meant so did everbe she turned quickly otis she said but he was nowhere in sight run ned told lycurgus if he aint got into the house yet maybe you can cut him off tell him his aunt wants him and you stay right with him lycurgus didnt even wait to say yes sir he just gave the lead rope to ned and departed running the rest of us stood along the fence everbe trying for immobility since that was all she had to find effiacement in but too big for it like the doe is too big for the plum thicket which is all she has available for safety boon furious and seething restraining himself who never before had restrained himself from anything not from fear i tell you he was not afraid of that gun and badge he could and would have taken them both away from butch and in a kind of glory tossed the pistol on the ground halfway between them and then given butch the first step toward it and only half from the loyalty which would shield meand my family his family from the result of such a battle no matter who won it because the other half was chivalry to shield a woman even a whore from one of the predators who debase police badges by using them as immunity to prey on her helpless kind and a little further along dissociated though present uncle parsham the patrician he bore in his christian name the patronymic of the very land we stood on the aristocrat of us all and judge of us all hell butch said he cant win races standing still in a halter go on trot him across the lot we just sent for his jockey ned said then you can see him work then he said unlessen you in a hurry to get back to yourn my what butch said your law work ned said back in possum or wherever it is after coming all the way out here to see a race horse butch said all i see so far is a plug standing half asleep in a lot im sho glad you told me that ned said i thought maybe you wasnt interested he turned to boon so maybe what you and miss corrie better do is go on back to town now and be ready to meet the others when the train comes you can send the surrey back for mr butch and lucius and that other boy after we breezes lightning ha ha ha butch said without mirth without anything hows that for a idea huh sugar boy you and sweet thing bobbasheely on back to the hotel now and me and uncle remus and lord fauntleroy will mosey along any time up to midnight providing of course we are through here he moved easily along the fence to where boon stood watching boon though addressing ned i cant let sugar boy leave without me i got to stay right with him or he might get everybody in trouble they got a law now about taking goodlooking gals across state lines for what they call immortal purposes sugar boys a stranger here he dont know exactly where that state lines at and his foot might slip across it while his minds on something else something that aint a foot at least we dont call it a foot around here huh sugar boy he slapped boon on the back still grinning watching boonone of those slaps which jovial men give one another but harder a little too hard but not quite too hard boon didnt move his hands on the top rail of the gate they were too sunburned or maybe too ingrained with dirt to turn white but i could see the muscles yes sir butch said watching boon grinning all friends together for a while yet anyhow come one come all or come nonefor a while longer anyhow at least until something happens that might put a man not watching what he was doing out of circulation say a stranger that wouldnt be missed nohow huh sugar boy and slapped boon again on the back still harder this time watching him grinning and everbe saw boons hand this time too she said quick not loud boon like that boon so had uncle parsham here come the other boy he said otis was just coming around the corner of the house lycurgus looming almost twice as tall right behind him even knowing what was wrong about him didnt help otis much but ned was the one who was looking at him hard he came up gently strolling in fact somebody want me he said it was me ned said but i aint seed you in daylight before and maybe my mind gonter change he said to lycurgus get the tack so wetheytacked up and lycurgus and ned led the way back along the lane to the creek pasture we following even butch giving his attention to the matter in hand now unless as the angler does he was deliberately giving everbe a little rest to build up her strength to rush and thrash once more against the hook of that tin star on his sweaty shirt when we reached the pasture ned and otis were already facing each other about eight feet apart behind them lycurgus stood with the horse ned looked strained and tired as far as i knew he had had no sleep at all unless he actually had slept for an hour or so on the hay in the boxcar but thats all he was not exhausted by sleeplessness just annoyed by it otis was picking his nose still gently a knowboy ned was saying as knowing a boy as i ever seed i just hopes that when youre twice your age you will still know half as much much obliged otis said can you ride a horse ned said i been living on a arkansas farm for a right smart number of years otis said can you ride a horse ned said nemmine where you used to live or still does now that depends as the fellow says otis said i figgered i was going back home this morning that i would a long been in kiblett arkansas right this minute but since my plans got changed without nobody asking me i aint decided quite yet just what im going to do next how much you paying to get that horse rode otis everbe said we aint come to that yet ned said as gentle as otis the first thing is to get them three heats run and to be in front when at least two of them is finished then well git around to how much heh heh heh otis said not laughing either that is there aint going to be nothing to pay nobody with until you win itthats you and you cant even run at it without somebody setting on the horsethats me is that right otis everbe said thats right ned said we all of us working on shares so well have something to divide afterward your share will have to wait too like ourn yeah otis said i seen that kind of share dividing in the arkansas cotton business the trouble is the share of the fellow that does the sharing is always a little different from the share of the fellow that done the dividing the fellow that done the sharing is still waiting for his share because he aint yet located where its at so from now on ill just take the cashinadvance share and let you folks keep all the dividing how much do that come to ned said you cant be interested because you aint even run the first heat yet let alone won it but i dont mind telling you in confidence you might say itll be ten dollars otis everbe said she moved now she cried aint you ashamed hold up miss ned said ill handle it he looked tired but that was all without haste he drew a folded flour sack from his hip pocket and unfolded it and took out his worn snap purse and opened it hold out your hand he told lycurgus who did so while ned counted slowly onto the palm six frayed dollar bills and then about a cupful of coins of various denominations its gonter be fifteen cents short but mr hogganbeck will make it up make it up to what otis said to what you said ten dollars ned said you cant seem to hear neither otis said what i said was twenty dollars now boon moved god damn it he said just hold up ned told him his hand didnt even stop now returning the coins one by one from lycurguss hand and then the frayed bills back into the purse and closed it and folded it back into the flour sack and put the sack back into his pocket so you aint gonter ride the horse he said to otis i aint seen my price otis said mr boon hogganbeck there is fixing to hand it to you right now ned said whynt you just come right out like a man and say you aint gonter ride that horse it dont matter why you aint they looked at each other come on say it out naw otis said i aint going to ride it he said something else foul which was his nature vicious which was his nature completely unnecessary which was his nature too yes even finally knowing what it was didnt help with him by this time everbe had him she snatched him hard and this time he snarled he cursed her watch out i aint near done talking yetif im a mind say the word butch said ill beat the hell out of him just on principle i wont even bother with pleasure how the hell did sugar boy ever let him get this far without at least one whelp on him no everbe said to butch she still held otis by the arm youre going back home on the next train now youre tooting otis said id a been there right now except for you she released him go on back to the surrey she said you cant risk it boon said rapidly to her youll have to go with him he said all right you all go back to town you can send for me and lucius about sundown and i knew what that meant what decision he had wrestled with and licked but butch fooled us the confident angler was letting his fish have the backing too sure he said send back for us everbe and otis went on now that thats settled who is going to ride the horse this boy here ned said he a onehanded horse heh heh heh butch said he was laughing this time i seen this horse run here last winter if one hand can even wake him up it will take more hands than a spider or a daddy longlegs to get him out in front of that horse of colonel linscomfos maybe you right ned said thats what we gonter find out now son he said to lycurgus hand me my coat i had not even noticed the coat yet but now lycurgus had it also the peeled switch ned took both and put the coat on he said to boon and butch yawl stand over yonder under them trees with uncle possum where youll be in the shade and wont distract his mind hand me your foot he told me we did so i mean ned threw me up and boon and butch and lycurgus went back to the tree where uncle parsham was already standing even though we had made only three trips around the pasture this morning we had a vestigial path which lightning would remember whether i could see it or not ned led him out to what had been our old starting point this morning he spoke quiet and succinct he was not uncle remus now but then he never was when it was just me and members of his own race around that track tomorrow aint but a half a mile so you gonter go around it twice make like this is it so when he sees that real track tomorrow hell already know beforehand what to expect and to do you understand yes i said ride him around it twice he handed me the switch get him going quick and hard cut him once with this before he even knows it then dont touch him again with it until i tells you to keep him going as fast as you can with your heels and talking to him but dont bother him just set there keep your mind on it that youre going around twice and try to think his mind onto that too like you done with them colts out at mccaslin you cant do it but you got the switch this time but dont touch him with it until i tells you to he turned his back he was doing something now inside the shelter of his coatsomething infinitesimal with his hidden hands suddenly i smelled something faint yet sharp i realise now that i should have recognised it at once but i didnt have time then he turned back as when he had coaxed the horse into the boxcar this morning his hand touched caressed lightnings muzzle for maybe a second then he stepped back lightning already trying to follow him had i not reined him back go ned said cut him i did he leapt sprang out of simple fright nothing else it took a halfstride to get his head back and another stride before he realised we wanted to follow the track path again at full gallop now on just enough outside rein to hold him on the course i already heeling him as hard as i could even before the fright began to fade only there we were again just like this morning going good obedient enough plenty of power but once more with that sense that his head didnt really want to go anywhere until we entered the back stretch and he saw ned again on the opposite side of the ring it was the explosion again he had taken the bit away from me he had already left the path and was cutting straight across to ned before i got balance enough to reach my good hand down and take the rein short and haul wrench him angling back into the track going hard now i had to hold him on the outside to make the back turn and into the stretch where he could see ned again and once more reached for the bit to go straight to him i was using the cut hand too now to hold him onto the track it seemed forever until ned spoke cut him he said then throw the switch away i did so and flung the switch backward the leap again but i had him now since it only took one rein the outside one to keep him on the course going good now around the first turn and i was ready for him this time when he would see ned on through the back stretch still going into and around the last turn still going ned standing now about twenty yards beyond where our finish line would be speaking just exactly loud enough for lightning to hear him and just exactly as he had spoken to him in the boxcar door last nightand i didnt need the switch now i wouldnt have had time to use it if i had had it and i thought until then that i had ridden at least one horse that i called hot anyway a halfbred colt of cousin zacks with morgan on the bottom but nothing like this this burst surge as if until now we had been dragging a rope with a chunk of wood at the end of it behind us and neds voice had cut the rope come on son i got it so we were standing there lightnings muzzle buried to the nostrils in neds hand though all i could smell now was horsereek and all i could see was the handful of grass which lightning was eating ned himself saying hee hee hee so gentle and quiet that i whispered too what i said what but boon didnt whisper coming up ill be god damned what the hell did you tell him nothing ned said just if he want his supper to come on and get it and not butch either bold confident unconvinceable without scruple or pity well well he said he didnt draw lightnings head up out of neds hand he jerked it up then rammed the bit home when lightning started back lemme do it ned said quickly what you want to find out any time i need help handling horses around here ill holler butch said and not for you ill save you to holler for down in missippi he lifted lightnings lip and looked at his gums then at his eyes dont you know its against the law to dope a horse for a race maybe you folks down there in them swamps aint heard about it but its so we got horse doctors in missippi though ned said send for one of them to come and see if he been doped sure sure butch said only why did you give it to him a day ahead of the race to see if it would work thats right ned said if i give him nothing which i aint which if you knows horses you already knows sure sure butch said again i dont interfere with no mans business secretsproviding they work is this horse going to run like that again tomorrow i dont mean once i mean three times he dont need to do it but twice ned said all right butch said twice is he ask mr hogganbeck there if he hadnt better do it twice ned said i aint asking mr sugar boy butch said im asking you i can make him do it twice ned said fair enough butch said in fact if all you got is three more doses i wouldnt even risk but twice then if he misses the second one you can use the last one to get back to missippi on i done thought of that too ned said walk him back to the barn he said to me cool him out then well bath him butch watched that too some of it we went back to the barn and untacked and lycurgus brought a bucket and a rag and lycurgus washed him down and dried him with crokersacks before stalling and feeding himor had started to because butch said here boy run to the house and set the water bucket and some sugar on the front gallery me and mr sugar boy are going to have a toddy though lycurgus didnt move until uncle parsham said go he went then boon and butch following uncle parsham stood at the door of the stable watching them butch that isa lean dramatic old man all blackandwhite black pants white shirt black face and hat behind the white hair and moustache and imperial law he said he said it calmly with cold and detached contempt a man that never had nothing in it nohow one of them little badges goes to his head so fast it makes yourn swim too ned said except it aint the badge so much as that pistol that likely all the time he was a little boy he wanted to tote only he knowed all the time that soon as he got big enough to own one the law wouldnt let him tote it now with that badge too he dont run no risk of being throwed in jail and having it took away from him he can still be a little boy in spite of he had to grow up the risk is that pistol gonter stay on that little boy mind just so long before some day it gonter shoot at something alive before he even knowed he aimed to then lycurgus came back they waiting for you he told me the surrey its back from town already i said it never went to town lycurgus said it never left she been setting in it out there with thatere boy all the time waiting for you all she say to come on wait ned said i stopped i still had the ridingsock on and i thought he meant that but he was looking at me you gonter start running into folks now what folks i said that word has done got around to about this race how got around i said how do word ever get around he said it dont need no messenger all it needs is two horses that can run to be inside the same ten miles of each other how you reckon that law got here maybe smelled that white girl four or five miles away like a dog i know maybe i hoped like boon hogganbeck still believes that we could get these two horses together here all nice and private and run that race win or lose and me and you and him could either go back home or go any other place we wants providing its longer away than boss priests arm but not now you gonter start meeting them from now on and tomorrow they gonter be thicker still you mean we can run the race we go to now maybe we been had to ever since me and boon realised that boss had done took his hand off of that automobile for as long as twentyfour hours but now we sho got to run it what do you want me to do i said nothing im just telling you so you wont be surprised in advance all we got to do is get them two horses on the same track and pointed the same way and you just set there on lightning and do like i tell you go on now before they start hollering for you chapter ned was right i mean about word already being around there was nothing wrong with my hand when everbe took the ridingsock off i mean it felt like anybodys hand would that had been cut across the inside of the fingers yesterday i dont believe it had bled any more even when i used it against lightnings pulling this afternoon but not everbe so we stopped at the doctors first about a mile this side of town butch knew him knew where but i dont know how everbe persuaded him to take us there nagged him or threatened or promised or maybe just did it like a big girl trout so busy fussing around a child trout that she quit behaving like there was any such thing in existence as a barbed hook with a line fastened to it and so the fisherman had to do something even if only getting rid of the child trout or maybe it was not everbe but rather the empty flask since the next drink would have to be at the hotel in parsham because as i came around the house lycurguss mother was standing at the edge of the gallery holding a sugar bowl and a water bucket with a gourd dipper and butch and boon were just draining the two tumblers and lycurgus was just picking up the empty flask where butch had flung it into a rosebush so butch took us to the doctorsa little oncewhite house in a little yard filled with the kind of rankgrowing ranksmelling dusty flowers that bloom in the late summer and fall a fat irongray woman in pincenez like a retired schoolteacher who even fifteen years later still hated eightyearold children who came to the door and looked at us once ned was right and said back into the house its them racehorse folks and turned and vanished toward the back butch moving right on in before she could turn jovial already welcomeor somebody damn well better see that he was the badge again you see wearing it or simply being known to possess one to enter any house in any other manner would be not a mere individual betrayal but a caste betrayal and debasementsaying howdy doc got a patient for you to an irongray man too if the tobacco juice were bleached out of his unshaven whiskers in a white shirt like neds but not as clean and a black coat too with a long streak of day before yesterdays egg on it who looked and smelled like something also except it wasnt just alcohol or anyway all alcohol me and brother hogganbeck will wait in the parlor butch said dont bother i know where the bottles at dont worry about doc he said to boon he dont hardly ever touch whiskey unless he just has to the law allows him one shot of ether as a part of the cure for every patient that can show blood or a broken bone if its just a little old cut or broke finger or ripped hide like this doc divides the treatment with the patient he drinks all the ether and lets the patient have all the cure haw haw haw this way so butch and boon went that way and everbe and i you have doubtless noticed that nobody had missed otis yet we got out of the surrey it appeared to be butchs anyway he was driving it there had been some delay at uncle parshams while butch tried to persuade then cajole then force everbe to get in the front seat with him which she foiled by getting into the back seat and holding me by one arm and holding otis in the surrey with her other hand until boon got in front with butchand first butch then the rest of us were somehow inside the doctors hall but nobody remembered otis at that moment followed the doctor into another room containing a horsehair sofa with a dirty pillow and a wadded quilt on it and a rolltop desk cluttered with medicine bottles and more of them on the mantel beneath which the ashes of last winters final fire had not yet been disturbed and a washstand with a bowl and pitcher and a chamber pot that somebody hadnt emptied yet either in one corner and a shotgun in the other and if mother had been there his fingernails would have touched no scratch belonging to her let alone four cut fingers and evidently everbe agreed with her she everbesaid ill unwrap it and did so i said the hand was all right the doctor looked at it through his steelrimmed spectacles what did you put on it he said everbe told him i know what it is now the doctor looked at her howd you happen to have that handy he said then he lifted the spectacles by one corner and looked at her again and said oh then he said well well and lowered the spectacles again andyes he did it was a sighsaid i aint been to memphis in thirtyfive years and stood there a minute andi tell you it was a sighsaid yes thirtyfive years and said if i was you i wouldnt do anything to it just bandage it again yes exactly like mother he got the bandage out but she put it on you the boy going to ride that horse tomorrow he said yes everbe said beat that linscomb horse this time durn him well try everbe said how much do we owe you nothing he said you already cured it just beat that durn linscomb horse tomorrow i want to pay you something for looking at it everbe said for telling us its all right no he said he looked at her the old mans eyes behind the spectacles magnified yet unfocusable as irreparable as eggs until you would think they couldnt possibly grasp and hold anything as recent as me and everbe yes everbe said what is it maybe if you had a extra handkerchief or something he said yes thirtyfive years i had one once when i was a young man thirty thirtyfive years ago then i got married and it he said yes thirtyfive years oh everbe said she turned her back to us and bent over her skirts rustled it was not long they rustled again and she turned back here she said it was a garter beat that durn horse he said beat him you can do it now we heard the voicesvoice that is butchs loud in the little hall before we got there what do you know sugar boy wont take a drink no more all boys together give and take never snatch without whistling first and now he insults me he stood grinning at boon triumphant daring boon looked really dangerous now like ned all of us he was worn out for sleep too but all the load ned had to carry was the horse everbe and butchs badge were not his burden huh boy butch said now he was going to slap boon on the back again with that jovial force which was just a little too hard but not quite dont do it again boon said butch stopped he didnt retract the motion he just stopped it grinning at boon my names mister lovemaiden he said but call me butch after a while boon said lovemaiden butch butch said after a while boon said butch thats a boy butch said he said to everbe doc fix you up all right maybe i ought to warned you about doc they claim when he was a young squirt fiftysixty years ago he would a had one snatch at your drawers before he even tipped his hat come on boon said you paid him yes everbe said we went outside and that was when somebody said where is otis no it was everbe of course she just looked once and said otis quite loud strong not to say urgent not to say alarmed and desperate dont tell me hes scared of horses even tied to a gatepost butch said come on boon said hes just gone on ahead he aint got nowhere else to go well pick him up but why everbe said why didnt he how do i know boon said maybe hes right he meant butch then he meant otis for all hes as knowing a little son of a bitch as ever come out of arkansas or missippi either for that matter hes still a arrant coward come on so we got in the surrey and went on to town except that i was on everbes side about otis when you couldnt see him was a good time to be already wondering where he was and why i never saw anybody lose public confidence as fast as he could he would have had a hard time now finding anybody in this surrey to take him to another zoo or anywhere else and it wasnt going to be much longer before he couldnt have found anybody in parsham either only we didnt overtake him he wasnt on the road all the way to the hotel and ned was wrong i mean about the increasing swarm of horserace devotees we would be running into from now on maybe i had expected to mid the entire hotel veranda lined with them waiting for us and watching us arrive if so i was wrong there was nobody there at all in the winter of course during the quail season and especially during the two weeks of the national trials it would be different but in those days unlike london parsham had no summer season people went elsewhere to water or mountains raleigh near memphis or luka not far away in mississippi or to the ozarks or cumberlands nor for that matter does it have one now nor indeed does any place else either winter or summer season there are no seasons at all any more with interiors artificially contrived at sixty degrees in summer and ninety degrees in winter so that mossbacked recidivists like me must go outside in summer to escape cold and in winter to escape heat including the automobiles also which once were mere economic necessities but are now social ones the moment already here when if all the human race ever stops moving at the same instant the surface of the earth will seize solidify there are too many of us humanity will destroy itself not by fission but by another beginning with f which is a verbactive also as well as a conditional state i wont see it but you may a law compelled and enforced by dire and frantic socialnot economic socialdesperation permitting a woman but one child as she is now permitted but one husband but in winter of course as now it was different with the quail season and the grand national trials with the rich money of oil and wheat barons from wall street and chicago and saskatchewan and the fine dogs with pedigrees more jealous than princes and the fine breeding and training kennels only minutes away now by automobile red banks and michigan city and la grange and germantown and the namescolonel linscomb whose horse we assumed we were going to race against tomorrow and horace lytle and george peyton as magical among birddog people as babe ruth and ty cobb among baseball aficionados and mr jim avant from hickory flat and mr paul rainey just a few miles down colonel sartoriss railroad toward jeffersonhound men both who i suppose among these mere pedigreed pointers and setters called themselves slumming the vast rambling hotel booming then staffed and elegant the very air itself suave and murmurous with money littered with colored ribbons and cluttered with silver cups but there was nobody there now the quiet street empty with may dust it was after six now parsham would be at home eatingor preparing to eatsupper vacant even of otis though he could be probably was inside and what was even more surprising to me anyway vacant also of butch he simply drove us up to the door and put us out and drove away pausing only long enough to give everbe one hard jeering leer and boon one hard leering jeer if anything a little harder than everbes saying dont worry boy ill be back if you got any business still hanging better get it unhung before i get back or something might get tore and drove away so apparently he also had somewhere he had to be occasionally a home i was still ignorant and innocent not as much as i was twentyfour hours ago but still tainted but i was on boons side my loyalty was to him not to mention to everbe and i had assimilated enough whether i had digested all of it yet or not since yesterday to know exactly what i meant when i hoped that maybe he had a wife in itsome innocent ravished out of a convent whose friendless avengeless betrayal would add another charge to the final accounting of his natural ruthless baseness or better an ambidextrous harridan who could cope with him by at least recording into his face each one of his countermarital victories because probably half the pleasure he got out of fornication was having it known who the victim was but i wronged him he was a bachelor but otis was not inside either only the single temporary clerk in the halfshrouded lobby and the single temporary waiter flapping his napkin in the door of the completely shrouded dining room save for a single table set out for such anonymous passersby as we wereso far were that is but otis had not been seen i aint wondering so much where hes at boon said as i am about what the hell he has done this time that we aint found out about yet nothing everbe said hes just a child sure boon said just a little armed child when he gets big enough to steal stop everbe said i wont all right all right boon said find then find enough money to buy a knife with a sixinch blade in place of that twoinch pocketknife anybody that turns his back on him had sho enough better be wearing one of them oldtime iron union suits like you see in museums i got to talk to you he told her supperll be soon and then we got to meet the train and that tinbadge stallion will be neighing and prancing back here any time now he took her arm come on that was when i had to begin to listen to boon i mean i had to everbe compelled it she wouldnt even go with him unless i came too wetheywent to the ladies parlor there wasnt much time now we would have to eat supper and then go to the depot to meet miss reba in those days females didnt run in and out of gentlemens rooms in hotels as i am told they do now even wearing i am told what the advertisements call the shorts or scanties capable of giving women the freedom they need in their fight for freedom in fact i had never seen a woman alone in a hotel before mother would not have been here without father and i remember how i wondered how everbe without a wedding ring even could have got in theythe hotelshad what were known as ladies parlors like this one where we now werea smaller though still more elegant room most of it likewise shrouded in holland bags but i was still on boons side i didnt pass the doorway but stopped outside where everbe could know where i was within call even if she couldnt actually see me so i heard oh yes listened i would have listened anyway i had gone too far by now in sophistication and the facts of life to stop now just as i had gone too far in stealing automobiles and race horses to quit now so i could hear them everbe and almost at once she was crying again no i wont let me alone then boon but why you said you loved me was that just lying too then everbe i do love you thats why let me alone turn me loose lucius lucius then boon shut up stop now then nothing for a minute i didnt look peep i just listened no just heard if i thought you were just twotiming me with that god damned tinbadged then everbe no no im not then something i couldnt hear until boon said what quit what do you mean quit then everbe yes ive quit not any more never then boon howre you going to live what will you eat where you going to sleep and everbe im going to get a job i can work what can you do you aint got no more education than me what can you do to make a living i can wash dishes i can wash and iron i can learn to cook i can do something i can even hoe and pick cotton let me go boon please please ive got to cant you see ive got to then her feet running even on the thick carpet she was gone so boon caught me this time his face was pretty bad now ned was lucky all he had to frazzle over was just a horse race look at me boon said look at me good whats wrong with me what the hells wrong with me it used to be that i his face looked like it was going to burst he started again and why me why the hell me why the hell has she got to pick out me to reform on god damn it shes a whore cant she understand that shes in the paid business of belonging to me exclusive the minute she sets her foot where im at like im in the paid business of belonging to boss and mr maury exclusive the minute i set my foot where theyre at but now shes done quit for private reasons she cant no more she aint got no more private rights to quit without my sayso too than i got to quit without bosss and mr maurys sayso too he stopped furious and baffled raging and helpless and more terrified it was the negro waiter flapping his napkin in this doorway now boon made a tremendous effort ned with nothing but a horse race to win didnt even know what trouble was go tell her to come on to supper we got to meet that train her room is number five but she wouldnt come out so boon and i ate alone his face still didnt look much better he ate like you put meat into a grinder not like he either wanted it or didnt want it but it was just time to eat after a while i said maybe he started walking back to arkansas he said two or three times this afternoon that thats where he would have been by now if folks hadnt kept on interfering with him sure boon said maybe he just went on ahead to locate that dishwashing job for her or maybe he reformed too and theyre both going right straight to heaven without stopping off at arkansas or nowhere else and he just went ahead to find out how to pass memphis without nobody seeing them then it was time to go i had been watching the edge of her dress beyond the diningroom door for about two minutes but now the waiter himself came twooeight sir he said just blowed for one mile crossing so we went across to the depot not far the three of us walking together mutual overnight hotel guests i mean wetheywere not fighting now we theycould even have talked conversed equable and inconsequential everbe would have only boon would need to speak first not far merely to cross the tracks to reach the platform the train already in sight now the two of them boon and everbe shackled yet estranged alien yet indissoluble confounded yet untwainable by no more than what boon thought was a whim who boon for all his years was barely older than me and didnt even know that women no more have whims than they have doubts or illusions or prostate troubles the train the engine passing us in hissing thunder sparks flying from the brake shoes it was the long one the big one the cannonball the special the baggage cars the half jim crow smoker then the day coaches and the endless pullmans the dining car at the end slowing it was sam caldwells train and if everbe and otis had travelled to parsham in the caboose of a scheduled through freight miss reba would be in a drawing room if indeed she was not in the presidents private car the train stopping at last though still no vestibule opened no whitejacketed porter nor conductor though certainly sam would have been watching for us until boon said hell the smoker and began to run then we all saw them far ahead sam caldwell in his uniform on the cinders helping miss reba down someoneanother womanfollowing her and not from the smoking car at all but from the jim crow half of it where negroes travelled the trainit was the special for washington and new york the cannonball wafting the rich women in diamonds and the men with dollar cigars in suave

orifice where the gold one had been i knew now why otis had fled parsham even though he had had to do it on foot oh yes at that moment fiftysix years ago i was one with you now in your shocked and horrified unbelief until minnie and miss reba told us it was him minnie said i know it was him he taken it while i was asleep hell fire boon said somebody stole a tooth out of your mouth and you didnt even know it god damn it listen miss reba said minnie had that tooth made that way so she could put it in and take it outworked extra and scrimped and saved forhow many years was it minnie three wasnt

had cost her too much no more than you would put that god damned horse down somewhere thats probably cost you a damned sight more than a gold tooth and forget it i know i never minnie said i put it back as soon as i ate i remember only i was plumb wore out and tired thats right miss reba said she was talking to everbe now i reckon i was going good when you all come in last night it was daybreak before i come to my senses enough to quit and the sun was up when i finally persuaded minnie to take a good slug of gin and see the front door was bolted and go on back to bed and i went up myself and woke jackie and told her to keep the place shut i didnt care if every horny bastard south of st louis come knocking not to let nobody in before six oclock this evening so minnie went back and laid down on her cot in the storeroom off the back gallery and i thought at first maybe she forgot to lock that door course i locks it minnie said thats where the beers at i been keeping that door locked ever since that boy got here because i remembered him from last summer when he come to visit so there she was miss reba said wore out and dead asleep on that cot with the door locked and never knowed nothing until i woke up minnie said i was still so tired and wore out that i slept too hard like you do i just laid there and i knowed something felt a little funny in my mouth but i âjust thought maybe it was a scrap of something had done got caught in it no matter how careful i was until i got up and went to the looking glass and looked i wonder they never heard her in chattanooga let alone just in parsham miss reba said and the door still locked it was him minnie said cried i know it was he been worrying me at least once every day how much it cost and why didnt i sell it and how much could i get for it and where would i go to sell it at sure miss reba said thats why he squalled like a wildcat this morning when you told him he wasnt going back home but would have to come on to parsham with you she told everbe so when he heard the train whistle he run huh where do you figger he is because im going to have minnies tooth back we dont know everbe said he just disappeared out of the surrey about half past five oclock we thought he would have to be here because he aint got anywhere else to go but we havent found him yet maybe you aint looked right miss reba said he aint the kind you can whistle out you got to smoke him out like a rat or a snake the clerk came back all right now miss reba said yes mrs binford the clerk said miss reba got up ill get minnie settled down and stay with her until she goes to sleep then id like some supper she told the clerk it dont matter what it is its a little late the clerk said the dining room and its going to be still later after a while miss reba said it dont matter what it is come on minnie she and minnie went out then the clerk was gone too we stood there none of us had sat down sheeverbe just stood there a big girl that stillness looked well on grief too as long as it was still like this or maybe not grief so much as shame he never had no chance back there she said thats why i thought to get away even for just a week last summer and then this year especially after you all came too and as soon as i saw lucius i knew that that was the way i had been wanting him to be all the time only i didnt know neither how to tell him learn him and so i thought maybe just being around lucius even for just two or three days sure boon said refinement now he went to her awkward he didnt offer to put his arms around her again he didnt even touch her really he just patted her back it looked almost as hard his hand did as insensitive and heavy as when butch had slapped his this afternoon but it wasnt at all its all right he said it aint nothing see you were doing the best you knowed you done good come on now it was the waiter again your coachmans in the kitchen sir he said he says its important my coachman boon said i aint got a coachman its ned i said already moving then everbe was too ahead of boon we followed the waiter back to the kitchen ned was standing quite close to the cook a tremendous negro woman who was drying dishes at the sink he was saying if its money worrying your mind goodlooking im the man what and saw us and read boons mind like a flash ease your worry hes out at possums whats he done this time what boon said its otis i said ned found him i didnt ned said i hadnt never lost him uncle possums hounds did put him up a gum sapling behind the henhouse about a hour ago until lycurgus went and got him he wouldnt come in with me in fact he acted like he didnt aim to go nowhere right away whats he done this time we told him so shes here too he said he said quietly hee hee hee he said then he wont be there when i get back what do you mean boon said would you still be there if you was him ned said he knows that by this time that gals done woke up and found that tooth missing he must a been knowing that miss reba long enough by now to know she aint gonter stop until she gets her hand on him and turns him upside down and shake until that tooth falls out of wherever hes got it i told him myself where i was going on that mule and anybody there can tell him what time that train got in and how long it will take somebody to get back out there would you still be there if you had that tooth all right boon said whats he going to do with it if it was anybody else but him ned said id say he had three chances with it sell it or hide it or give it away but since its him he aint got but two sell it or hide it and if its got to just stay hid somewhere it might just as well be back in that gals mouth as fur as hes concerned so the best place to sell a gold tooth quick would be back in memphis only memphis is too fur to walk and to get on the train which would cost money which he likely is gotproviding he is desperate enough to spend some of hisn he would have to come back to possum where somebody might see him so the next best quick place to sell that gold tooth will be at that race track tomorrow if it was you or me we might likely bet that tooth on one of them horses tomorrow but he aint no betting man bettings too slow for him not to mention uncertain but that race track will be a good place to start looking for him its too bad i didnt know about that tooth whilst i had my hand on him tonight maybe i could a reasoned it out of him then if he belonged to me mr sam caldwell gonter be through here on that westbound train at sixfawty tomorrow morning and id a had him at the depot and turned him over to mr sam and told mr sam not to lift his hand offen him until the door shut on the first train leaving for arkansas tomorrow can you find him tomorrow everbe said ive got to find him hes just a child ill pay for the tooth ill buy minnie another one but ive got to find him hell say he hasnt got it he never saw it but ive got sho ned said thats what id say too if it was me ill try ill be in early tomorrow morning to get lucius but the best chance gonter be at that track tomorrow just before the race he said to me folks is already kind of dropping by possums lot like they wasnt noticing themselves doing it likely trying to find out who it is this time that still believes that horse can run a race so likely we gonter have a nice crowd tomorrow its late now so you go get some sleep whilst i takes that mule of possums back home to bed too wheres your sock you aint lost it its in my pocket i said be sho you dont he said the mate to it is the leftfooted one and a leftfooted sock is unlucky unlessen you wears both of them he turned but no further than the fat cook he said to her now unlessen my mind changes to staying in town tonight what time you setting breakfast goodlooking the soonest time after your jaws is too far away to chomp it the cook said good night all ned said then he was gone we went back to the dining room where the waiter in his short sleeves now and without his collar and tie brought miss reba a plate of the pork chops and grits and biscuits and blackberry jam we had had for supper neither hot nor cold now but lukewarm in deshabille like the waiter you might say did you get her to sleep everbe said yes miss reba said that little son of a and cut it off and said excuse me i thought i had seen everything in my business but i never thought id have a tooth stolen in one of my houses i hate little bastards theyre like little snakes you can handle a big snake because you been already warned to watch out but a little one has already bit you behind before you even knew it had teeth wheres my coffee the waiter brought it and went away and then even ifrat big shrouded dining room was crowdedj it was like every time boon and butch got inside the same four walls everything compounded multiplied leaving not really room for anything else hebutch had been back to the doctors or maybe in the tin badge business you knew everybody who didnt dare refuse you a free drink and it was getting late and i was tired but here he was again and suddenly i knew that up to now he hadnt really been anything and that we were only just starting with mm now standing in the door bulging brighteyed confident breezy and a little redder the badge itself seeming to bulge at us as with a life of its own on his sweaty shirt hebutchwearing it not as the official authorisation of his unique dedication but as a boy scout wears his merit badge as both the unique and hardwon reward and emblem of a specialisation and the preabsolution for any other activities covered or embraced by its mystic range at that moment everbe rose quickly across the table and almost scuttled around it and into the chair next miss reba whom butch was looking at bulging at now and that was when i rated boon down a notch and left everbe first for trouble all boon had was butch she had boon and butch both well well butch said is all catalpa street moving east to possum so that at first i thought he might be a friend or at least a business acquaintance of miss rebas but if he was he didnt remember her name but then even at eleven i was learning that there are people like butch who dont remember anybody except in the terms of their immediate need of them and what he needed now or anyway could use was another woman he didnt care who provided she was more or less young and pleasing no he didnt really need one he just happened to find one already in the path like one lion on ms way to fight another lion over an antelope that he never had any doubts about licking i mean licking the lion not the antelope would still be a fool not to try throwing in just for luck you might say another antelope if he happened to find one straying in the path except that miss reba turned out not to be an antelope what butch found was another lion he said this is what i call sugar boy using ms head whats the use of him and me being all racked up over one hunk of meat when heres another exactly like it in all important details except maybe a little difference in the pelt whos that miss reba said to everbe friend of yours no everbe said she was actually crouching a big girl too big to crouch please shes telling you boon said she aint got no friends no more she dont want none shes quit gone out of business soon as we finish losing this horse race shes going away somewhere and get a job washing dishes ask her miss reba was looking at everbe please everbe said what do you want miss reba asked butch nothing butch said nothing atall me and sugar boy was kind of bollixed up at one another for a while but now you showed up everything is hunkydory twentythree skiddoo he came and took hold of everbes arm come on the surreys outside lets give them a little room call the manager miss reba said quite loud to me i didnt even have to move likely if i had been looking i could have seen the edge of mm too beyond the door he came in is this man the law here miss reba said why we all know butch around here mrs binford the clerk said hes got as many friends in parsham as anybody i know of course hes from up at hardwick properly speaking we dont have a law officer right here in parsham we aint quite that big yet butchs rich and bulging warmth had embraced invited the clerk almost before he could enter the door as though hethe clerk had fallen headlong into it and vanished like a mouse into a lump of stillsoft ambergris but now butchs eyes were quite cold hard maybe thats whats wrong around here he told the clerk maybe thats why you dont have no progress and advancement what you need is a little more law aw butch the clerk said you mean anybody that wants to can walk in off the street and drag whichever one of your women guests he likes the looks of best off to the nearest bed like you were running a cathouse miss reba said drag who where butch said drag with what a twodollar bill miss reba rose come on she said to everbe theres a train back to memphis tonight i know the owner of this dump i think ill go see him tomorrow aw butch the clerk said wait mrs binford you go back out front virgil butch told the clerk it aint only four months to november some millionaire with two registered bird dogs might walk in any minute and there wont be nobody out there to show him where to sign ms name at go on were all friends here the clerk went now that thats all out of the way butch said reaching for everbes arm again then youll do miss reba said to butch lets me and you go out front or anywhere else thats private too i got a word for you about what butch said she didnt answer already walking toward the door private you say butch said why sure any time i cant accommodate a goodlooking gal private ill give sugar boy full lief to step in they went out and now from the lobby we couldnt see them beyond the door of the ladies parlor for almost a minute in fact maybe even a little more before miss reba came back out still walking steadily hard and handsome and composed then butch a second later saying is that so huh well just see about that miss reba coming steadily on to where we waited watching butch go on across the lobby without even looking at us all right everbe said yes miss reba said and that goes for you too she told boon she looked at me jesus she said what the hell did you do to him boon said nothing she said over her shoulder because she was looking at me thought i had see all the cathouse problems possible until i had one with children in it you brought one inshe was talking to everbe nowthat run the landlord off and robbed all the loose teeth and fourteen dollars worth of beer and if that wasnt enough boon hogganbeck brings one thats driving my damned girls into poverty and respectability im going to bed and you come on boon said what did you tell him whats that town of yours miss reba said jefferson boon said you bigtown folks from places like jefferson and memphis with your bigcity ideas you dont know much about jjaw you got to come to little places like this i know because i was raised in one hes the constable he could spend a week in jefferson or memphis and you wouldnt even see him but here among the folks that elected him the majority of twelve or thirteen that voted for him and the minority of nine or ten or eleven that didnt and are already sorry for it or damned soon will be he dont give a damn about the sheriff of the county nor the governor of the state nor the president of the united states all three rolled into one because hes a baptist i mean hes a baptist first and then hes the law when he can be a baptist and the law both at the same time he will but any time the law comes conflicting up where nobody invited it the law knows what it can do and where to do it they tell how that old pharaoh was pretty good at kinging and another old one back in the bible times named caesar that did the best he knew how they should have visited down here and watched a arkansas or missippi or tennessee constable once but how do you know who he is everbe said how do you even know theres one here theres one everywhere miss reba said didnt i just tell you i grew up in a place like thisas long as i could stand it i dont need to know who he is all i needed was to let that bastard know i knew there was one here too im going but what did you tell him boon said come on i may want to remember it nothing i told you miss reba said if i hadnt learned by now how to handle these damned stud horses with his badge in one hand and his fly in the other id been in the poorhouse years ago i told him if i saw his mug around here again tonight i would send that sheepfaced clerk to wake the constable up and tell him a deputy sheriff from hardwick has just registered a couple of memphis whores at the parsham hotel im going to bed and you better too come on corrie i put your outraged virtue on record with that clerk and now you got to back it up at least where he can see you they went on then boon was gone too possibly he had followed butch to the front door just to make sure the surrey was gone then suddenly everbe swooped down at me that big a big girl muttering rapidly you didnt bring anything at all did you i mean clothes you been wearing the same ones ever since you left home whats wrong with them i said im going to wash them she said your underthings and stockings your blouse and the sock you ride with too come on and take them off but i aint got any more i said thats all right you can go to bed ill have these all ready again when you get up come on so she stood outside the door while i undressed and shoved my blouse and underwear and stockings and the ridingsock through the crack in the door to her and she said good night and i closed the door and got into bed and still there was something unfinished that we hadnt done attended to yet the secret prerace conference the close grim fierce murmurous plotting of tomorrows strategy until i realised that strictly speaking we had no strategy we had nothing to plan for nor even with a horse whose very ownership was dubious and even unless ned himself really knew unknown of whose past we knew only that he had consistently run just exactly fast enough to finish second to the other horse in the race to be raced tomorrow exactly where i anyway didnt know against a horse none of us had ever seen and whose very existence as far as we were concerned had to be taken on trust until i realised that of all human occupations the racing of horses and all concerned or involved in it were the most certainly in gods hands then boon came in i was already in bed already half asleep whatve you done with your clothes he said everbes washing them i said he had taken off his pants and shoes and was already reaching to turn out the light he stopped dead still who did you say i was awake now but it was already too late i lay there with my eyes closed not moving what name did you say miss corrie is i said you said something else i could feel him looking at me you called her everbe i could feel him looking at me is that her name i could feel him looking at me so she told you her real name then he said quite gently god damn and i saw through my eyelids the room go dark then the bed creaked as he lay down on it as beds always do since there is so much of him as i have heard them ever since i can remember when i would sleep with him once or twice at home when father would be away and he would stay in the house so mother wouldnt be afraid and at miss ballenbaughs two nights ago and in memphis last night until i remembered that i hadnt slept with him in memphis it was otis good night he said good night i said chapter then it was morning it was tomorrow the day on which i would ride my first actual horse race and by winning it set boon and nedme too of course but then i was safe immune i was not only just a child i was kin to themfree to go home again not with honor perhaps not even unscathed but at least they could go back toward which all the finagling and dodging and manipulating and scrabbling around what other crimes subsequent todl right consequent tothe simple and really spontaneous and in a way innocent stealing of grandfathers automobile i didnt even know had been leading up to now it was here so she told you what her real name is boon said because you see it was too late now i had been half asleep last night and off my guard yes i said whereupon i realised that that was completely false she hadnt told me she didnt even know i knew it that i had been calling her everbe ever since sunday night but it was too late now but youve got to promise i said not promise her promise me never to say it out loud until she tells it first i promise he said i aint never lied to you yet i mean lied bad i mean i aint all right he said i done promised then he said again like last night gentle and almost amazed god damn and my clothes blouse stockings and underwear and the ridingsock were neatly folded laundered and ironed on a chair just outside our door boon handed them in to me with all them clean clothes you got to bathe again he said you just made me bathe saturday i said we was on the road saturday night he said we never even got to memphis until sunday all right sunday i said this is tuesday he said two days just one day i said two nights but just one day you been travelling since boon said you got two sets of dirt now its almost seven oclock i said were already late for breakfast you can bathe first he said i got to get dressed so i can thank everbe for washing my clothes bathe first boon said ill get my bandage wet hold your hand on your neck boon said you aint going to wash that nohow why dont you bathe then i said we aint talking about me were talking about you so i went to the bathroom and bathed and put my clothes back on and went to the dining room and ned was right last night there had been just the one table the end of it cleared and set up for us now there were seven or eight people all men but not aliens foreigners mind you in fact they were strangers only to us who didnt live in parsham none of them had got down from pullmans in silk underclothes and smoking upmann cigars we had not opened the cosmopolitan parsham winter sporting season here in the middle of may some were in overalls all but one were tieless people like us except that they lived here with the same passions and hopes and dialect enjoying butch tooour inalienable constitutional right of free will and private enterprise which has made our country what it is by holding a private horse race between two local horses if anyone committee or individual from no further away than the next county had come to interfere or alter or stop it or even participate beyond betting on the horse of his choice all of us partisans of either horse would have risen as one man and repulsed him and besides the waiter i saw the back of a maid in uniform just going through the swing door to the pantry or kitchen and there were two men one of them had the necktie at our table talking to boon and miss reba but everbe wasnt there and for an instant second i had a horrified vision of butch finally waylaying and capturing her by force ambushing her in the corridor perhaps while she was carrying the chair to mine and boons door with my laundered clothes on it but only for a second and too fantastical if she had washed for me last night she had probably doubtless been up quite late washing for herself and maybe miss reba too and was still asleep so i went on to the table where one of the men said this the boy going to ride him looks more like you got him taped up for a fist fight yes boon said shoving the dish of ham toward me asi sat down miss reba passed the eggs and grits across he cut himself eating peas last night haw haw the man said anyway hell be carrying less weight this time sure boon said unless he eats the knives and forks and spoons while we aint watching him and maybe takes along one of the fire dogs for a snack haw haw the man said from the way he run here last winter hes going to need a good deal more than just less weight but then thats the secret huh sure boon said he was eating again now even if we never had no secret we would have to act like we did haw haw the man said again they got up well good luck anyway that might be as good for that horse as less weight the maid came bringing me a glass of milk and carrying a plate of hot biscuits it was minnie in a fresh apron and cap where miss reba had either loaned or hired her to the hotel to help out with her ravished and unforgiving face but calm and quiet now evidently she had rested even slept some even if she hadnt forgiven anybody yet the two strangers went away you see miss reba said to nobody all we need is the right horse and a million dollars to bet you heard ned sunday night boon said you were the one that believed him i mean decided to believe him i was different after that god damned automobile vanished and all we had was the horse i had to believe him all right miss reba said keep your shirt on and you can stop worrying too boon said to me she just went to die depot in case them dogs caught him again last night and ned brought him in to the train or so she said did ned find him i said naw boon said neds in the kitchen now you can ask himor so she said yes s maybe you had better worry some after all miss reba got shut of that tin badge for you but that other onewhats his name caldwell was on that train this morning what are you talking about now miss reba said nothing boon said i aint got nothing to talk about now ive quit lucius is the one thats got tin badge and pullman cap rivals now but i was already getting up because i knew now where she was is that all the breakfast you want miss reba said let him alone boon said hes in love i crossed the lobby maybe ned was right and all it took for a horse race was two horses with the time to run a race within ten miles of each other and the air itself spread the news of it though not as far as the ladies parlor yet so maybe what i meant by crying looking well on everbe was that she was big enough to cry as much as she seemed to have to do and still have room for that many tears to dry off without streaking she was sitting by herself in the ladies parlor and crying again the third timeno four counting two sunday night until you wondered why i mean nobody made her come with us and she could have gone back to memphis on any train that passed yet here she was so she must be where she wanted to be yet this was the second time she had cried since we reached parsham i mean anybody with as many extra tears as she had still didnt have enough to waste that many on otis so i said hes all right ned will find him today much obliged for washing my clothes wheres mr sam i thought he was going to be on that train he had to take the train on to memphis and take his uniform off she said he cant go to a horse race in it hell be back on the noon freight i cant find my handkerchief i found it for her maybe you ought to wash your face i said when ned finds him he will get the tooth back it aint the tooth she said im going to buy minnie another tooth its that he never had no chance he did you promise your mother you wouldnt never take things too you dont have to promise anybody that i said you dont take things but you would have promised if she had asked you she wouldnt ask me i said you dont take things yes she said she said i aint going to stay in memphis i talked to sam at the depot this morning and he says thats a good idea too he can find me a job in chattanooga or somewhere but youll still be in jefferson so maybe i could write you a post card where im at and then if you took a notion yes i said ill write to you come on theyre still eating breakfast theres something about me you dont know you couldnt even guess it i know it i said its everbe corinthia i been calling you that two or three days now thats right it was otis but i wont tell anybody but i dont see why why a oldtimey countrified name like that can you imagine anybody in rebas saying send up everbe corinthia they would be ashamed they would die laughing so i thought of changing it to yvonne or billie or ken but reba said corrie would do shucks i said you mean its all right you say it i said it she listened then she kept on listening exactly as you wait for an echo yes she said thats what it can be now then come on and eat breakfast i said neds waiting for me and i got to go but boon came in first there are too many people out there he said maybe i shouldnt a told that damn fellow you were going to ride him today he looked at me maybe i shouldnt a never let you leave jefferson there was a small door behind a curtain at the back of the room come on he said it was another corridor then we were in the kitchen the vast cook was at the sink again ned was sitting at a table finishing his breakfast but mainly saying when i sugars up a woman it aint just empty talk they can buy something with it too and stopped and rose at once he said to me you ready time you and me was getting back to the country theys too many folks around here if they all had money and would bet it and the horse they bet on would just be the wrong horse and we just had the money to cover it and knowed the right horse to cover it with we wouldnt just take no automobile back to jefferson tonight wed take all possum too to maybe sugar back boss priests nature he aint never owned a town before and he might like it wait boon said aint we got to make some plans the onliest one that needs any plan is lightning ned said and the only plan he needs is to plan to get out in front and stay there until somebody tells him to stop but i know what you mean we gonter run on colonel linscombs track the first heat is at two oclock thats four miles from here me and lightning and lucius gonter show up there about two minutes beforehand you better get out there earlier you better leave here soon as mr sam gets off that freight train because thats yourn and his plan to get to that track in time to bet the money and to have some money to bet when you get there wait boon said what about that automobile what the hell good will money do us if we go back home without stop fretting about that automobile ned said aint i told you them boys got to go back home not much longer than tonight too what boys boon said yes sir ned said the trouble with christmas is the first of january thats whats wrong with it minnie came in with a tray of dirty dishesthe brown calm tragic hungry and inconsolable mask come on ned told her gimme that smile again so ill have the right measure to fit that tooth when i brings it back tonight dont do it girl the fat cook said maybe that missippi sugar will spend where it come from but it wont buy nothing up here in tennessee not in this kitchen nohow but wait boon said you wait for mr sam ned said he can tell you in fact whilst me and lucius are winning this race maybe you and mr sam can locate around amongst the folks for whistlebritches and that tooth he had uncle parshams buggy this time with one of the nves and he was right the little hamlet had changed ovcrni ht it was not that there were so many people in sight any more than yesterday it was the air itselfan exhilaration almost for the first time i really realised that i was going to ride in a horse race before many more hours and i could taste my spit sudden and sharp around my tongue i thought you said last night that otis would be gone when you got back from town i said he was ned said but not far he aint got nowhere to go neither the hounds give mouth twice during the night back toward the barn them hounds taken the same quick mislike to him that human folks does likely soon as i left this morning he come up for his breakfast but suppose he sells the tooth before we can catch him i done fixed that ned said he aint gonter sell it he aint gonter find nobody to buy it if he aint come up for breakfast lycurgus gonter take the hounds and tree him again and tell him that when i come back from parsham last night i said a man in memphis offered that gal twentyeight dollars for that tooth cash hell believe that if it had been a hundred dollars or even fifty he wouldnt believe it but hell believe a extra number like twentyeight dollars mainly because hell think it aint enough that that memphis man was beating minnie down and when he tries to sell it at that race track this evening wont nobody give him even that much so wont be nothing left for him to do but wait until he can get back to memphis with it so you get your mind off that tooth and put it on this horse race on them last two heats i mean we gonter lose the first one so you dont need to worry about that what i said why why not ned said all we needs to win is two of them but why lose the first one why dont we win that one get that much ahead as soon as we can he drove on maybe a half a minute the trouble with this race its got too many different things mixed up in it too many what i said too many of everything he said too many folks but mainly too many heats if it was just one heat one run off in the bushes somewhere and not nobody around but me and you and lightning and that other horse and whoever gonter ride him we would be all right because we found out yestiddy we can make lightning run one time only now he got to run three of them but you made that mule run every time i said this horse aint that mule ned said aint no horse ever foaled was that mule or any other mule and this horse we got to depend on now aint even got as much sense as some horses so you can see what your fix is we knows i can make him run once and we hopes i can make him run twice but thats all we just hopes so we cant risk that one time we knows i can make him run until we got to have it so the most we got at the best is two times and since we got to lose one of them no matter what we gonter lose the one we can maybe learn something from to use next time and thats gonter be the first one have you told boon that so he wont let him lose on the first heat providing he dont put up all the money them ladies scraps up for him to bet which from what i seen of that miss reba he aint gonter do that will make the odds that much better for them next two besides we can tell him all he needs to know when the time comes so you just i didnt mean that i said i meant bosss didnt i tell you i was tending to that he said now you quit worrying i dont mean quit thinking about the race because you cant do that but quit worrying about winning it just think about what lightning taught you yesterday about riding him thats all you got to do ill tend to all the rest of it you got your sock aint you yes i said only we were not going back to uncle parshams we were not even going in that direction now we got our own private stable for this race ned said a spring branch in a hollow that belongs to one of possums church members where we can be right there not half a quarter from the track without nobody knowing to bother us until we wants them lycurgus and uncle possum went on with lightning right after breakfast the track i said of course there would have to be a track i had never thought of that if i thought at all i reckon i simply assumed that somebody would ride or lead the other horse up and we should run the race right there in uncle parshams pasture thats right ned said a regular track just like a big one except its just a half a mile and aint got no grandstands and beerandwhiskey counters like anybody that wants to run horse racing right ought to have its right there in colonel linscombs pasture that owns the other horse me and lycurgus went and looked at it last night i mean the track not the horse i aint seen the horse yet but we gonter have a chance to look at him today leastways one end of him only what we want is to plan for that horse to spend the last half of two of these heats looking at that end of lightning so i need to talk to the boy thats gonter ride him a colored boy lycurgus knows him i want to talk to him in a way that he wont find out until afterward that i talked to him yes i said how lets get there first ned said we went on it was new country to me of course obviously we were now crossing colonel linscombs plantation or anyway somebodys big neat fields of sprouting cotton and corn and pastures with good fences and tenant cabins and cotton houses at the turnrow ends and now i could see the bams and stables and sure enough there was the neat white oval of the small track wenedturning now following a faint road on into a grove and there it was isolate and secure even secret if we wished a grove of beeches about a spring lightning standing with lycurgus at his head groomed and polished and even glowing faintly in the dappled light the other mule tied in the background and uncle parsham dramatic in black and white even regal prince and martinet in the dignity of solvent and workless age sitting on the saddle which lycurgus had propped against a tree into a sort of chair for him all waiting for us and then in the next instant i knew what was wrong they were all waiting for me and that was the real moment whenlightning and me standing in not to mention breathing it the same air not a thousand feet from the race track and not much more than a tenth of that in minutes from the race itselfwhen i actually realized not only how lightnings and my fate were now one but that the two of us together carried that of the rest of us too certainly boons and neds since on usdepended under what conditions they could go back home or indeed if they could go back homea mystical condition which a boy of only eleven should not really be called to shoulder which is perhaps why i noticed nothing or anyway missed what i did see only that lycurgus handed lightnings lead rope to uncle parsham and came and took our bridle and ned said you get that message to him all right and lycurgus said yes sir and ned said to me whynt you go and take lightning offen uncle possum so he wont have to get up and i did so leaving ned and lycurgus standing quite close together at the buggy and that not long before ned came on to us leaving lycurgus to take the mule out of the buggy and loop the lines and traces up and tie the mule beside its mate and come on to us where ned was now squatting beside uncle parsham he said tell again about them two races last winter you said nothing happened what kind of nothing ah uncle parsham said it was a threeheat race just like this one only they never run but two of them by that time there wasnt no need to run the third one or maybe somebody got tired tired reached into his hind pocket maybe ned said maybe uncle parsham said the first time your horse run too soon and the second time he run too late or maybe it was the whip whipped too soon the first time and not soon enough the second anyhow at the first lick your horse jumped out in front a good length and stayed there all the way around the first lap even after the whipping had done run out like it does with a horse or a man either he can take just so much whipping and after that it aint no more than spitting on him they they came into the home stretch and it was like your horse saw that empty track in front of him and said to himself this aint polite im a stranger here and dropped back just enough to lay his head more or less on colonel linscombs boys knee and kept it there until somebody told him he could stop and the next time your horse started out like he still thought he hadnt finished that first heat his head all courteous and polite about opposite colonel linscombs boys knee on into the back turn of the last lap where that memphis boy hit him the first lick not late enough this time because all that fulllength jump done this time was to show him that empty track again not too late to scare mcwillie lycurgus said skeer him how much ned said enough lycurgus said ned squatted there he must have got a little sleep last night even with the hounds treeing otis every now and then he didnt look it too much though all right he said to me you and lycurgus just stroll up yonder to that stable awhile all youre doing is taking your natural look at the horse you gonter ride against this evening for the rest of it let lycurgus do the talking and dont look behind you on the way back i didnt even ask him why he wouldnt have told me it was not far past the neat halfmile track with its whitepainted rails that it would be nice to be rich too on to the barns the stable that if cousin zack had one like it out at mccaslin cousin louisa would probably have them living in it there was nobody in sight i dont know what i had expected maybe still more of the overalled and tieless aficionados squatting and chewing tobacco along the wall as we had seen them in the dining room at breakfast maybe it was too early yet which i now realised was probably exactly why ned had sent us welycurgus lounging into the hallway whichthe stablewas as big as our dedicatedtoalittleprofit livery one in jefferson and a good deal cleanera tack room oa one side and what must have been an office on the other just like ours a negro stableman cleaning a stall at the rear and a youth who for size and age and color might have been lycurguss twin lounging on a bale of hay against the wall who said to lycurgus hidy son looking for a horse hidy son lycurgus said looking for two we thought maybe the other one might be here too you mean mr van torch aint even come yet he aint coming atall lycurgus said some other folks running coppermine this time whitefolks named mr boon hogganbeck this white boy gonter ride him this is mcwillie he told me mcwillie looked at me a minute then he went back to the office door and opened it and said something inside and stood back while a white man trainer lycurgus murmured name mr walter came out and said morning lycurgus where you folks keeping that horse hid anyway you aint ringing in a sleeper on us are you no sir lycurgus said i reckon he aint come out from town yet we thought they might have sent him out here so we come to look you walked all the way here from possums no sir lycurgus said we rid the mules whered you tie them i cant even see them maybe you painted them with some of that invisible paint you put on that horse when you took him out of that boxcar yesterday morning no sir lycurgus said we just rid as far as the pasture and turned them loose we walked the balance of the way well anyway vou come to see a horse so we wont disappoint you bring him out mcwillie where you can look at him look at his face for a change mcwillie said folks on that coppermine been looking at akrons hind end all winter but aint none of them seen his face yet then at least this boy can start out knowing what he looks like in front whats your name son i told him you aint from around here no sir jefferson mississippi he travelling with mr hogganbeck thats running coppermine now lycurgus said oh mr walter said mr hogganbeck buy him i dont know sir lycurgus said mr hogganbecks running him mcwillie brought the horse out he and mr walter stripped off the blanket he was black bigger than lightning but very nervous he came out showing eyewhite every time anybody moved or spoke near him his ears went back and he stood on the point of one hind foot as though ready to lash out with it mr walter and mcwillie both talking murmuring at him but both of them always watching him all right mr walter said give him a drink and put him back up we followed him toward the front dont let him discourage you he said after all its just a horse race yes sir lycurgus said thats what they says much oblige for letting us look at him thank you sir i said goodbye mr walter said dont keep them mules waiting see you at post time this afternoon no sir lycurgus said yes sir i said we went on past the stables and the track once more mind what mr mccaslin told us lycurgus said mr mccaslin i said oh yes i said i didnt ask what this time either i think i knew now or maybe i didnt want to believe i knew didnt want to believe even yet that at a mere eleven you could progress that fast in weary unillusion maybe if i had asked what it would have been an admission that i had that horse is bad i said hes scared lycurgus said thats what mr mccaslin said last night last night i said i thought you all came to look at the track what do we want to look at that track for lycurgus said that track dont move he come to see that horse in the dark i said didnt they have a watchman or wasnt the stable locked or anything when mr mccaslin make up his mind to do something he do it lycurgus said aint you found out that about him yet so weididnt look back we went on to our sanctuary where lightningi mean coppermine and the two mules stamped and swished in the dappled shade and ned squatted beside uncle parsham saddle and another man sat on his heels across the spring from themanother negro i almost knew him had known him seen him somethingbefore ned spoke its bobo he said and then it was all right he was a mccaslin too bobo beauchamp lucass cousinlucas quintus carothers mccaslin beauchamp that grandmother whose mother had described old lucius to her said looked and behaved just as arrogant just as ironheaded just as intolerant exactly like him except for color bobo was another motherless beauchamp child whom aunt tennie raised until the call of the outworld became too much for him and he went to memphis three years ago bobo used to work for the man that used to own lightning ned said he came to watch him run because it was all right now the one remaining thing which had troubled usme bobo would know where the automobile was in fact he might even have it but that was wrong because in that case boon and ned would simply have taken it away from himuntil suddenly i realised that the reason it was wrong was i didnt want it to be if we could get the automobile back for no more than just telling bobo to go get it and be quick about it what were we doing here what had we gone to all this trouble and anxiety for camouflaging and masquerading lightning at midnight through the memphis tenderloin to get him to the depot ruthlessly using a combination of uxoriousness and nepotism to disrupt a whole boxcar from the railroad system to get him to parsham not to mention the rest of it having to cope with butch minnies tooth invading and outraging uncle parshams home and sleeplessness and yes homesickness and me again not even a change of underclothes all that striving and struggling and finagling to run a horse race with a horse which was not ours to recover an automobile we had never had any business with in the first place when all we had to do to get the automobile was to send one of the family colored boys to fetch it you see what i mean if the successful outcome of the race this afternoon wasnt really the pivot if lightning and i were not the last desperate barrier between boon and ned and grandfathers anger even if not his police if without winning the race or even having to run it ned and boon could go back to jefferson which was the only home ned knew and the only milieu in which boon could have survived as if nothing had happened and take up again as though they had never been away then all of us were engaged in a makebelieve not too different from a boys game of cops and robbers but bobo could know where the automobile was that would be allowable that would be fair and bobo was one of us i said so to ned i thought i told you to stop worrying about that automobile he said aint i promised you id tend to it when the right time come you got plenty other things to fret your mind over you got a horse race aint that enough to keep it busy he said to lycurgus all right i think so lycurgus said we never looked back to see then maybe ned said but bobo had already gone i neither saw nor heard him he was just gone get the bucket ned told lycurgus now is a good time to eat our snack whilst we still got a little peace and quiet around here lycurgus brought ita tin lard bucket with a clean dishcloth over it containing pieces of corn bread with fried sidemeat between there was another bucket of buttermilk sitting in the spring you et breakfast uncle parsham said to me yes sir i said then dont eat no more he said just nibble a piece of bread and a little water thats right ned said you can ride better empty so he gave me a single piece of corn bread and we all squatted now around uncle parshams saddle the two buckets on the ground in the center we heard one step or maybe two up the bank behind us then mcwillie said hidy uncle possum morning reverend that was ned and came down the bank alreadyor stilllooking at lightning yep thats coppermine all right these boys had mr walter skeered this morning that maybe yawl had rung in another horse on him you running him reverend call him mr mccaslin uncle parsham said yes sir mcwillie said mr mccaslin you running him white man named mr hogganbeck is ned said we waiting on him now too bad you aint got something else besides coppermine to wait with that would maybe give akron a race mcwillie said i already told mr hogganbeck that myself ned said he swallowed without haste he lifted the bucket of buttermilk and drank still without haste mcwillie watched him he set the bucket down set down and eat something he said much obliged mcwillie said i done et maybe thats why mr hogganbecks late waiting to bring out that other horse there aint time now ned said hell have to run this one now the trouble is the only one around here that knows how to rate this horse is the very one that knows better than to let him run behind this horse dont like to be in front he wants to run right behind up until he can see the finish line and have something to run at i aint seem him race yet but id be willing to bet that the slower the horse in front of him goes the more carefuller he is not to get out in front where he aint got no companyuntil he can see the finish line and find out its a race hes in and run at it all anybody got to do to beat him is to keep his mind so peaceful that when he does notice hes in a race its too late some day somebody gonter let him get far enough behind to scare him then look out but it wont be this race the trouble is the onliest one around here that knows that too is the wrong one whos that mcwillie said ned took another bite whoevers gonter ride that other horse today thats me mcwillie said dont tell me uncle posum and lycurgus both aint already told you that then you oughter be talking to me instead ned said set down and eat uncle possum got plenty here much obliged mcwillie said again well he said mr walterll be glad to know it aint nobody but coppermine we was afraid we would have to break in a new one see yawl at the track then he was gone but i waited another minute but why i said i dont know ned said we may not even need it but if we does we already got it there you mind i told you this morning how the trouble with this race was it had too many different things all mixed up in it well this aint our track and country and it aint even our horse except just in a borried manner of speaking so we cant take none of them extra things out so the next best we can do is to put a few extry ones into it on our own account thats what we just done that horse up yonder is a thoroughbred paper horse why aint he in memphis or louisville or chicago running races instead of back here in a homemade country pasture running races against whoever can slip in the back way like us because why because i felt him last night and hes weedy like a horse that cant nothing catch for six furlongs but fifty foot more and hes done folded up right under you before you knowed it and so far all that boy mcwillie i said mcwillie has had to worry about is just staying on top of him and keeping him headed in the right direction hes won twice now and likely he thinks if he just had the chance he would run earl sande and dan patch both clean outen the horse business now weve put something else in his mind hes got two things in it now that dont quite fit one another so well just wait and see and whilst were waiting you go over behind them bushes yonder and lay down and rest words out now and folks gonter start easing in and out of here to see what they can find out and over there they wont worry you which i did though not always asleep i heard the voices i wouldnt have needed to see them even if i had raised onto one elbow and opened one eye past a bush the same overalls tieless the sweated hats the chewing tobacco squatting unhurried not talking very much looking inscrutably at the horse nor always awake because lycurgus was standing over me and time had passed the very light looked postmeridian time to go he said there was nobody with lightning now but ned and uncle parsham if they were all up at the track already it must be even later still i had expected boon and sam and probably everbe and miss reba too but not butch i hadnt even thought of him maybe miss reba had really got rid of him for good back up to hardwick or wherever it was the clerk said last night he really belonged i had forgotten him i realised now what the mornings peace actually was i said so havent they come yet aint nobody told them where to come yet ned said we dont need boon hogganbeck now come on you can walk him up and limber him on the way i got up the worn perfectly caredfor mcclellan saddle and the worn perfectly caredfor cavalry bridle which was the other half of uncle parshams somebodys military loot from that cause which the longer i live the more convinced i am your spinster aunts to the contrary that whoever lost it it wasnt us maybe theyre looking for otis i said maybe they are ned said its a good place to hunt for him whether they finds him or not we went on uncle parsham and ned walking at lightnings head lycurgus would bring the buggy and the other mule around by the road provded he could find enough clear space to hitch them in because already the pasture next to the track was filled upwagons the teams unhitched and reversed and tied to the stanchions and tail gates buggies saddlehorses and mules hitched to the fence itself and now weicould see the people black and white the tieless shirts and the overalls already dense along the rail and around the paddock because this race was homemade remember this was democracy not triumphant because anything can be triumphant provided it is tenderly and firmly enough protected and guarded and shielded in its innocent fragility but democracy working colonel linscomb the aristocrat the baron the suzerain was not even present as far as i knew nobody knew where he was as far as i knew nobody cared he owned one of the horses i still didnt know for certain just who owned the one i was sitting on and the dirt we were going to race on and the nice white rail enclosing it and the adjacent pasture which the tethered wagons and buggies were cutting up and the fence one entire panel of which a fractious or frightened saddlehorse had just wrenched into kindling but nobody knew where he was or seemed to bother or care we went to the paddock oh yes we had one we had everything a race track should have except as ned said grandstands and stalls for beer and whiskey we had everything else that any track had but we had democracy too the judges were the night telegraph operator at the depot and mr mcdiarmid who ran the depot eating room who the legend went could slice a ham so thin that his entire family had made a summer trip to chicago on the profits from one of them our steward and marshal was a dog trainer who shot quail for the market and was now out on bond for his part in participation in or maybe just his presence at a homicide which had occurred last winter at a neighboring whiskey still did i hot tell you this was free and elective willand choice and private enterprise at its purest and there were boon and sam waiting for us i cant find him boon said aint you seen him seen who ned said jump down he told me the other horse was there too still nervous still looking what i would have called bad but that lycurgus said ned said was afraid now what did this horse that damn boy boon said you said this morning he would be out here maybe hes behind something ned said he came back to me what did this horse learn you yesterday you was on a twicearound track that time too what did he learn you think i thought hard but there still wasnt anything nothing i said all i did was to keep him from going straight to you whenever he saw you and thats exactly what you want to do this first heat just keep him in the middle of the track and keep him going and then dont bother him dont bother nohow we gonter lose this first heat anyway and get shut of it lose it boon said what the hell do you want to run this horse race or do you want me to ned asked him ah right boon said but god damn it then he said you said that damn boy lemme ask you another way then ned said do you want to run this horse race and lemme go hunt for that tooth here they come sam said we aint got time now gimme your foot he threw me up so we didnt have time for ned to instruct me further or for anything else but we didnt need it our victory in the first heat we didnt win it it was only a dividend which paid off later was not due to me or even to lightning but to ned and mcwillie i didnt even really know what was happening until afterward because of my indubitable size and more than indubitable inexperience not to mention the unmanageable state toward which the other horse was now well on his way it was stipulated and agreed that we should be led up to the wire by grooms and there released at the word go which we did or were lightning behaving as he always did when ned was near enough for him to nuzzle at his coat or hand acheron behaving as i assumed having seen him but that once he always did when anyone was near his head skittering bouncing snatching the groom this way and that but gradually working up to the wire it would be any moment now it seemed to me that i actually saw the marshalmurderer fill his lungs to holler go when i dont know what happened i mean the sequence ned said suddenly set tight and my head arms shoulders and all snapped i dont know what it was he usedawl ice pick or maybe just a nail in his palm the spring the leap the voice not hollering go because it never had hollering instead stop stop whoa whoa which welightning and medid to see acherons groom still on his knees where acheron had flung him and acheron and mcwillie already at top speed going into the first turn mcwillie sawing back on him wrenching acherons whole neck sideways but he already had the bit the marshal and three or four spectators cutting across the ring to try to stop him in the back stretch though they might as well have been hollering at sams cannonball limited between two flag stops but mcwillie had slowed him now though it was now a matter of mere choice whether to come on around the track or turn and go back the distance being equal mcwillie or maybe it was acheron choosing the former ned murmuringrapidly at my knee now anyhow we got one extra half a mile on him this time youll have to do it yourself because them judges gonter they were they were already approaching ned said just remember this un dont matter nohow then they did disqualified him though they had seen nothing only that he had released lightnings head before the word go so this time i had a volunteer from the crowd to hold lightnings head mcwillie glaring at me while acheron skittered and plunged under him while the groom gradually worked him back toward position and this time the palm went to mcwillie you see what i mean even if nonvirtue knew nothing about backcountry horse racing she didnt need to all necessary was to supply me with sam to gain that extra furtherance in evil by some primeval and insentient process like osmosis or maybe simple juxtaposition i didnt even wait for lightning to come in to the bridle i didnt know why i brought the bit back to him and with no little in fact considerable help from the volunteer who was mine and lightnings individual starter held so fixed and sure enough i saw the soles of acherons grooms feet and acheron himself already two leaps on his next circuit of the track lightning and me still motionless but mcwillie was on him this time before he reached the turn so that the emergency squad not only reached the back stretch first but even stopped and caught acheron and led him back so ourmine and nedsnet was only six furlongs and the last one of them debatable though our main gain was mcwillie he was not just mad now he was scared too glaring at me again but with more than just anger in it two grooms holding acheron now long enough for us to be more or less in position lightning and me well to the outside to give them room when the word go came and thats all we were off lightning strong and willing every quality you could want in fact except eagerness his brain not having found out yet that this was a race mcwillie holding acheron back now so that we were setting the pace on around the first lap lightning moving slower and slower confronted with all that solitude until acheron drew up and passed us despite all mcwillie could do whereupon lightning also moved out again with companionship now around the second lap and really going now acheron a neck ahead and our crowd even beginning to yell now as though they were getting their moneys worth the wire ahead now and mcwillie giving acheron a terrific cut with his whip might as well have hit lightning too twenty more feet and we would have passed mcwillie on simple momentum but the twenty more feet were not there mcwillie giving me one last glare over his shoulder of rage and fright but triumph too now as i slowed lightning and turned him and saw it not a fight but rather a turmoil a seething of heads and shoulders and backs out of the middle of the crowd around the judges stand out of the middle of which boon stood suddenly up like a pine sapling out of a plum thicket his shirt torn half off and one flailing arm with two or three men clinging to it i could see him bellowing then he vanished and i saw ned running toward me up the track then butch and another man came out of the crowd toward us what i said to ned nemmine that he said he took the bridle with one hand his other hand already digging into his hip pocket its that butch again it dont matter why here he held his hand up to me he was not rushed hurried he was just rapid take it they aint gonter bother you it was a cloth tobacco sack containing a hardish lump about the size of a pecan hide it and keep it dont lose it just remember who it come from ned william mccaslin will you remember that ned william mccaslin jefferson missippi yes i said i put it in my hip pocket but what he didnt even let me finish soon as you can find uncle possum and stay with him nemmine about boon and the rest of them if they got him they got all the others too go straight to uncle possum and stay with him he will know what to do yes i said butch and the other man had reached the gate onto the track part of butchs shirt was gone too they were looking at us that it the man with him said yep butch said bring that horse here boy the man said to ned i want it set still ned told me he led the horse up to where they waited jump down son the man told me quite kindly i dont want you i did so hand me the reins he told ned ned did so ill take you bareback the man told ned youre under arrest chapter we were going to have all the crowd too presently we just stood there facing butch and the other man who now held lightning whats it for whitefolks ned said its for jail son the other man said thats what we call it here i dont know what you call it where you come from yes sir ned said we has that back home too only they mentions why even to niggers oh a lawyer butch said he wants to see a paper show him one never mind ill do it he took something from his hip pocket a letter in a soiled envelope ned took it he stood there quietly holding it in his hand what do you think of that butch said a man that cant even read wanting to see a paper smell it then maybe it smells all right yes sir ned said its all right dont say you are satisfied if you aint butch said yes sir ned said its all right we had the crowd now butch took the envelope back from ned and put it back in his pocket and spoke to them its all right boys just a little legal difficulty about who owns this horse the race aint cancelled the first heat will still stand the next ones are just put off until tomorrow can you hear me back there we likely cant if the bets is cancelled too a voice said there was a guffaw then two or three i dont know butch said anybody that seen this memphis horse run against akron them two heats last winter and still bet on him has done already cancelled his money out before he even got it put up he waited but there was no laughter this time then the voiceor anothersaid does walter clapp think that too ten foot more and that chestnut would a beat him today all right all right butch said settle it tomorrow aint nothing changed the next two heats is just put off until tomorrow the fiftydollar heat bets is still up and colonel linscomb aint won but one of them come on now we got to get this horse and these witnesses in to town where we can get everything cleared up and be ready to run again tomorrow somebody holler back there to send my surrey then i saw boon a head above them his face was quite calm now still bloodstreaked and somebody i had expected him to be handcuffed but he wasnt we were still democracy he was still only a minority and not a heresy had tied the sleeves of his torn shirt around his neck so that he was covered then i saw sam too he was barely marked he was the one who pushed through first now sam butch said we been trying for thirty minutes to step around you but you wont let us you damn right i wont sam said ill ask you again and let this be the last one are we under arrest are who under arrest butch said hogganbeck me that negro there heres another lawyer butch said to the other man i learned quite quick now that he was the law in parsham he was who miss reba had told us about last night the elected constable of the beat where butch for all his badge and pistol was just another guest like we were being butch just one more tenureless appointee from the nepotic files of the county sheriffs office in the county seat at hardwick thirteen miles away maybe he wants to see a paper too no the other man the constable told sam you can go whenever you want to then im going back to memphis to find some law sam said i mean the kind of law a man like me can approach without having his britches and underwear both ripped off if i aint back tonight ill be here early tomorrow morning he had already seen me he said come on you come with me no i said im going to stay here the constable was looking at me you can go with him if you want he said no sir i said im going to stay here who does he belong to the constable said hes with me ned said the constable said as though ned had not spoken there had been no sound who brought him here me boon said i work for his father i work for his grandfather ned said we done already fixed to take care of him just hold on sam said ill try to get back tonight then we can attend to everything and when you come back the constable said remember that you aint in memphis or nashville either that you aint even in hardwick county except primarily what youre in right now and what youll be in every time you get off of a train at that depot yonder is beat four thats telling them judge butch said the free state of possum tennessee i was talking to you too the constable told butch you may be the one that better try hardest to remember it the surrey came up to where they were holding boon the constable gestured ned toward it suddenly boon was struggling ned was saying something to him then the constable turned back to me that negro says you are going home with old possum hood yes sir i said i dont think i like thata white boy staying with a family of niggers you come home with me no sir i said yes he said but still really kind come on im busy theres somewhere you stops ned said the constable became completely motionless half turned what did you say he said theres somewhere the law stops and just people starts ned said and still for another moment the constable didnt movean older man than you thought at first spare quite hale but older who wore no pistol in his pocket or anywhere else and if he had a badge it wasnt in sight either youre right he said he said to me thats where you want to stay with old possum yes sir i said all right he said he turned get in boys he said what you going to do with the nigger butch said he had taken the lines from the man who brought the surrey up his foot was already on the stirrup to get into the drivers seat boon and sam were already in the back let mm ride your horse youre going to ride my horse the constable said jump up son he told ned youre the horse expert around here ned took the lines from butch and got up and cramped the wheel for the constable to get up beside him boon was still looking down at me his face battered and bruised but quiet now under the drying blood come on with sam he said im all right i said no boon said i cant i know possum hood the constable said if i get worried about him ill come back tonight and get him drive on son they went on they were gone i was alone i mean if i had been left by myself like when two hunters separate in the woods or fields to meet again later even as late as camp that night i would not have been so alone as it was i was anything but solitary i was an island in that ring of sweated hats and tieless shirts and overalls the alien nameless faces already turning away from me as i looked about at them and not one word to me of yes or no or go or stay whomewas being reabandoned who had already been abandoned once and at only eleven you are not really big enough in size to be worth that much abandonment you would be obliterated effaced dissolved vaporised beneath it until one of them said you looking for possum hood i think hes over yonder by his buggy waiting for you he was the other wagons and buggies were pulling out now most of them and all the saddled horses and mules were already gone i went up to the buggy and stopped i dont know why i just stopped maybe there was nowhere else to go i mean there was no room for the next step forward until somebody moved the buggy get in uncle parsham said well go home and wait for lycurgus lycurgus i said as though i had never heard the name before even he rode on to town on the mule he will find out what all this is about and come back and tell us hes going to find out what time a train goes to jefferson tonight to jefferson i said so you can go home he didnt quite look at me if you want to i cant go home yet i said i got to wait for boon i said if you want to uncle parsham said get in i got in he drove across the pasture into the road close the gate uncle parsham said its about time somebody remembered to i closed the gate and got back in the buggy you ever drive a mule to a buggy no sir i said he handed me the lines i dont know how i said then you can learn now a mule aint like a horse when a horse gets a wrong notion in his head all you got to do is swap him another one for it most anything will doa whip or spur or just scare him by hollering at him a mule is different he can hold two notions at the same time and the way to change one of them is to act like you believe he thought of changing it first hell know different because mules have got sense but a mule is a gentleman too and when you act courteous and respectful at him without trying to buy him or scare him hell act courteous and respectful back at youas long as you dont overstep him thats why you dont pet a mule like you do a horse he knows you dont love him youre just trying to fool him into doing something he already dont aim to do and it insults him handle him like that he knows the way home and he will know it aint me holding the lines so all you need to do is tell him with the lines that you know the way too but he lives here and youre just a boy so you want him to go in front we went on at a fair clip now the mule neat and nimble raising barely half as much dust as a horse would already i could feel what uncle parsham meant there came back to me through the lines not just power but intelligence sagacity not just the capacity but the willingness to choose when necessary between two alternatives and to make the right decision without hesitation what do you do at home uncle parsham said i work on saturdays i said then you going to save some of the money what are you going to buy with it and so suddenly i was talking telling him about the beagles how i wanted to be a fox hunter like cousin zack and how cousin zack said the way to learn was with a pack of beagles on rabbits and how father paid me ten cents each saturday at the livery stable and father would match whatever i saved of it until i could buy the first couple to start my pack which would cost twelve dollars and i already had eight dollars and ten cents and then all of a sudden too i was crying bawling i was tired not from riding a mile race because i had ridden more than that at one time before even though it wasnt real racing but maybe from being up early and chasing back and forth across the country without any dinner but a piece of corn bread maybe that was it i was just hungry but anyway there i sat bawling like a baby worse than alexander and even maury against uncle parshams shirt while he held me with one arm and took the lines from me with his other hand not saying anything at all until he said now you can quit were almost home youll have just time to wash your face at the trough before we go in the house you dont want womenfolks to see it like that which i did that is we unhitched the mule first and watered him and hung the harness up and wiped him down and stalled and fed him and pushed the buggy back under its shed and then i smeared my face with water at the trough and dried it after a fashion with the ridingsock and we went into the house and the evening meal supperwas ready although it was barely five oelock as country people farmers ate and we sat down uncle parsham and his daughter and me since lycurgus was not yet back from town and uncle parsham said you gives thanks at your house too and i said yes sir and he said bow your head and we did so and he said grace briefly courteously but with dignity without abasement or cringing one man of decency and intelligence to another notifying heaven that we were about to eat and thanking it for the privilege but at the same time reminding it that it had had some help too that if someone named hood or briggins so that was lycurguss and his mothers name hadnt sweated some the acknowledgment would have graced mainly empty dishes and said amen and unfolded his napkin and stack the corner in his collar exactly as grandfather did and we ate the dishes of cold vegetables which should have been eaten hot at the country hour of eleven oclock but there were hot biscuits and three kinds of preserves and buttermilk and still it wasnt even sundown the long twilight and even after that still the long evening the long night and i didnt even know where i was going to sleep nor even on what uncle parsham sitting there picking his teeth with a gold toothpick just like grandfathers and reading my mind like it was a magiclantern slide do you like to go fishing i didnt really like it i couldnt seem to learn to wantor maybe want to learnto be still that long i said quickly yes sir come on then by that time lycurgus will be back there were three cane poles with lines floats sinkers hooks and all on two nails in the wall of the back gallery he took down two of them come on he said in the tool shed there was a tin bucket with nail holes punched through the lid lycurguss cricket bucket he said i like worms myself they were in a shallow earthfilled wooden tray heno i i said lemme do it and took the broken fork from him and dug the long frantic worms out of the dirt into a tin can come on he said shouldering his pole passing the stable but turning sharp away and down toward the creek bottom not far there was a good worn path among the blackberry thickets and then the willows then the creek the water seeming to gather gently the fading light and then as gently return it there was even a log to sit on this is where my daughter fishes he said we call it marys hole but you can use it now ill be on down the bank then he was gone the light was going fast now it would be night before long i sat on the log in a gentle whine of mosquitoes it wouldnt be too difficult all i would have to do would just be to say wont think whenr ever it was necessary after a while i thought about putting the hook into the water then i could watch how long it would take the float to disappear into darkness when night finally came then i even thought about putting one of lycurguss crickets on the hook but crickets were not always easy to catch and lycurgus lived by a creek and would have more time to fish and would need them so i just thought wont think i could see the float plainer than ever now that it was on the water it would probably be the last of all to vanish into the darkness since the water itselfwould be next to last i couldnt see or hear uncle parsham at all i didnt know how much further he called on down the bank and now was the perfect time chance to act like a baby only whats the good of acting like a baby of wasting it with nobody there to know it or offer sympathyif anybody ever wants sympathy or even in fact really to be back home because what you really want is just a familiar soft bed to sleep in for a change again to go to sleep hi there were whippoorwills now and back somewhere beyond the creek an owl too a big one by his voice maybe there were big woods there and if lycurguss or maybe they were uncle parshams hounds were all that good on otis last night they sure ought to be able to handle rabbits or coons or possums so i asked him it was full night now for some tune he said quietly behind me i hadnt even heard him until then had a bite yet i aint much of a fisherman i said how do your hounds hunt good he said he didnt even raise his voice pappy uncle parshams white shirt held light too up to us where lycurgus took the two poles and we followed up the path again where the two hounds met us on into the house again into the lamplight a plate of supper with a cloth over it ready for lycurgus sit down uncle parsham said you can talk while you eat lycurgus sat down theyre still there he said they aint took them to hardwick yet uncle parsham said possum hasnt got a jail he told me they lock them in the woodshed behind the schoolhouse until they can take them to the jail at hardwick men that is they aint had women before no sir lycurgus said the ladies is still in the hotel with a guard at the door just mr hogganbeck is in the woodshed mr caldwell went back to memphis on number thirtyone he taken that boy with him otis i said did they get the tooth back they never said lycurgus said eating he glanced briefly at me and the horse is all right too i went and seen him hes in the hotel stable before he left mr caldwell made a bond for mr mccaslin so he can watch the horse he ate a train leaves for jefferson at nineforty we could make it all right if we hurry uncle parsham took a vast silver watch from his pocket and looked at it we could make it lycurgus said i cant i said i got to wait uncle parsham put the watch back he rose he said not loud mary she was in the front room i hadnt heard a sound she came to the door i already did it she said she said to lycurgus your pallets ready in the hall then to me you sleep in lycurguss bed where you was yestiddy i dont need to take lycurguss bed i said i can sleep with uncle parsham i wont mind they looked at me quite still quite identical i sleep with boss a lot of times i said he snores too i dont mind boss uncle parsham said thats what we call grandfather i said he snores too i wont mind let him uncle parsham said we went to his room his lamp had flowers painted on the china shade and there was a big goldframed portrait on a gold easel in one corner a woman not very old but in oldtimey clothes the bed had a bright patchwork quilt on it like lycurguss and even in may there was a smolder of fire on the hearth there was a chair a rocking chair too but i didnt sit down i just stood there then he came in again he wore a nightshirt now and was winding the silver watch undress he said i did so does your mother let you sleep like that at home no sir i said you aint got anything with you have you no sir i said he put the watch on the mantel and went to the door and said mary she answered bring one of lycurguss clean shirts after a while her hand held the shirt through the door crack he took it here he said i came and put it on do you say your now i lay me in bed or kneeling down kneeling down i said say them he said i knelt beside the bed and said my prayers the bed was already turned back i got into it and he blew out the lamp and i heard the bed again and then the moon would be late before it was very high tonight but there was already enough lighti could see him all black and white against the white pillow and the white moustache and imperial lying on his back his hands folded on his breast tomorrow morning ill take you to town and well see mr hogganbeck if he says you have done all you can do here and for you to go home will you go then yes sir i said now go to sleep he said because even before he said it fknew that that was exactly what i wanted what i had been wanting probably ever since yesterday to go home i mean nobody likes to be licked but maybe there are times when nobody can help being that all you can da about it is not quit and boon and ned hadnt quit or they wouldnt be where they were right now and maybe they wouldnt say that i had quit either when it was them who told me to go home maybe i was just too little too young maybe i just wasnt able to tote whatever my share was and if they had had somebody else bigger or older or maybe just smarter we wouldnt have been licked you see like that all specious and rational unimpugnable even when the simple truth was i wanted to go home and just wasnt brave enough to say so let alone do it so now having admitted at last that i was not only a failure but a coward too my mind should be peaceful and easy and i should go on to sleep like a baby where uncle parsham already was just barely snoring who should hear grandfather once not that that mattered either since i would be home tomorrow with nothingno stolen horses nor chastitystricken prostitutes and errant pullman conductors and ned and boon hogganbeck in his normal condition once he had slipped fathers leashto interfere with sleep hearing the voice the bawling two or three times before i struggled up and out into daylight sunlight uncle parshams side of the bed was empty and now i could hear the bawling from outside the house hellaw hellaw lycurgus lycurgus and leapt sprang from the bed already running across to the window where i could look out into the front yard it was ned he had the horse chapter so once again at two oclock in the afternoon mcwillie and i sat our his was anyway skittering mountswe had scared mr clapp enough yesterday to where we had drawn for pole position this time and mcwillie won itpoised for the stewardstarters the birddog trainermarket hunterhomicidists go a few things came before that though one of them was ned he looked bad he looked terrible it wasnt just lack of sleep we all had that lack but boon and i had at least spent the four nights in bed since we left jefferson where ned had spent maybe two one of the others in a boxcar with a horse and the other in a stable with him both on hay if on anything it was his clothes too his shirt was filthy and his black pants were not much better at least everbe had washed some of mine night before last but ned hadnt even had his off until now sitting now in a clean faded suit of uncle parshams overalls and jumper while mary was washing his shirt and doing what she could with his pants at the kitchen table now he and i eating our breakfast while uncle parsham sat and listened he said that a little before daylight one of the white men it wasnt mr poleymus the constablewoke him where he was asleep on some bales of hay and told him to take the horse and get out of town with it just you and lightning and not boon and the others i said where are they where them white folks put ran ned said so i said much oblige whitefolks and took lightning in my hand and why i said what do you care why all we need to do now is be up behind that starting wire at two oclock this afternoon and win them two heats and get a holt of bosss automobile and get on back to jefferson that we hadnt ought to never left nohow we cant go back without boon i said if they let you and lightning go why didnt they let him go look ned said me and you got enough to do just running that horse race why dont you finish your breakfast and then go back and lay down and rest until i calls you in time stop lying to him uncle parsham said ned ate his head bent over his plate eating fast he was tired his eyewhites were not even just pink any more they were red mr boon hogganbeck aint going anywhere for a while hes in jail good this time they gonter take him to hardwick this morning where they can lock him up sho enough but forget that what you and me have got to do is tell him uncle parsham said hes stood everything else you folks got him into since you brought him here what makes you think he cant stand the rest of it too until you manage somehow to come out on the other side and can take him back home didnt he have to watch it too right here in my yard and my house and down yonder in my pasture both not to mention what he might have seen in town sincethat man horsing and studding at that gal and her trying to get away from him and not nobody but this elevenyearold boy to run to not boon hogganbeck and not the law and not the grown white folks to count on and hope for but just him tell him and already the thing inside me saying no no dont ask leave it leave it i said what did boon do ned chewed over his plate blinking his reddened eyes like when you have sand in them he whupped that law that butch he nigh mint him they let him out before they done me and lightning he never even stopped he went straight to that gal it was miss reba i said it was miss reba no ned said it was that other one that big one they never called her name to me and whupped her and turned around he hit her i said boon hit ever miss corrie is that her name yes and turned around and went straight back until he found that law and whupped him pistol and all before they could pull him off boon hit her i said he hit her thats right ned said she is the reason me and lightning are free right now that butch found out he couldnt get to her no other way and when he found out that me and you and boon had to win that race today before we could dare to go back home and all we had to win it with was lightning he took lightning and locked him up thats what happened thats all it was uncle possum just told you how he watched it coming monday and maybe i ought to seen it too and maybe i would if i hadnt been so busy with lightning or maybe if i had been a little better acquainted with that butch i dont believe it i said yes he said thats what it was it was just bad luck the kind of bad luck you cant count against beforehand he likely just happened to be wherever he was just by chance when he seen her monday and figgered right off that that badge and pistol would be all he would need being likely used to having them be enough around here only this time they wasnt and so he had to look again and sho enough there was lightning that we had to depend on to win that race so we could get back bosss automobile and maybe go back home no i said no it wasnt her shes not even here she went back to memphis with sam yesterday evening they just didnt tell you it was somebody else it was another one no ned said it was her you seen it monday out here oh yes and on the way back in the surrey that afternoon and at the doctors and at the hotel that night until miss reba frightened him away wei anyway thought for good because miss reba was only a woman too i said why didnt somebody else help her a man to help her that man that man that took you and lightning that told sam and butch both they could be whatever they wanted in memphis or nashville or hardwick either but that here in possum he was the one i said cried i dont believe it yes ned said it was her that bought lightning loose to run again today i aint talking about me and boon and them others butch never cared nothing about us except to maybe keep boon outen the way until this morning all he needed was lightning only he had to throw in me and boon and the rest to make mr poleymus believe him because butch tricked him too used him too until whatever it was that happened this morningwhether that butch having done been paid off now said it was all a mistake or it was the wrong horse or maybe by that time mr poleymus hisself had added one to one and smelled a mouse and turned everybody loose and before he could turn around boon went and whupped that gal and then come straight back without even stopping and tried to tear that butchs head off pistol and all with his bare hands and mr poleymus smelled a whole rat and mr poleymus may be little and he may be old but hes a man mon they told me how last year his wife had one of them strokes and cant even move her hand now and all the chillen are married and gone so he has to wash her and feed her and lift her in and outen the bed day and night both besides cooking and keeping house too unlessen some neighbor woman comes in to help but you dont know it to look at him and watch him act he come in therei never seen none of it they just told me two or three holding boon and another one trying to keep that butch from whupping him with the pistol whilst they was holding himand walked up to butch and snatched that pistol outen his hand and reached up and ripped that badge and half his shirt off too and telefoamed to hardwick to send a automobile to bring them all back to jail the women too when its women they calls it fragrancy vagrancy uncle parsham said thats what i said ned said you call it whatever you want i calls it jail i dont believe it i said she quit then we sho better say much obliged that she started again ned said else me and you and lightning shes quit i said she promised me aint we got lightning back ned said aint all we got to do now is just run him didnt mr sam say he will be back today and will know what to do and then me and you and boon will be just the same as already back home i sat there it was still early i mean even now it was still only eight oclock it was going to be hot today the first hot day precursor of summer you see just to keep on saying i dont believe it served only for the moment as soon as the words the noise died there it still wasanguish rage outrage grief whatever it wasunchanged i have to go to town right away i said to uncle parsham if i can use one of the mules ill send you the money as soon as i get home he rose at once come on he said hold on ned said its too late now mr poleymus sent for a automobile theyve already left before now he can cut them off uncle parsham said it aint a half a mile from here to the road theyll be on i got to get some sleep ned said i know it uncle parsham said im going with him i told him last night i would im not going home yet i said im just going to town for a minute then ill come back here all right ned said at least lemme finish my coffee we didnt wait for him one of the mules was gone probably to the field with lycurgus but the other was there ned came out before we had the gear on uncle parsham showed us the short cut to the hardwick road but i didnt care i mean it didnt matter to me now where i met him if i hadnt been just about worn out with race horses and women and deputy sheriffs and everybody else that wasnt back home where they belonged i might have preferred to hold my interview with boon in some quick private place for both our sakes but it didnt matter now it could be in the middle of the big road or in the middle of the square either as far as i was concerned there could be a whole automobile full of them but we didnt meet the automobile obviously i was being protected to have had to do it in public would have been intolerable gratuitously intolerable for one who had served nonvirtue this faithfully for four days and asked so little in return i mean not to have to see any more of them than i had to which was granted the stillempty automobile had barely reached the hotel itself when we got there a sevenpassenger stanley steamer enough room even for the baggage of twono three minnie toowomen on a twoday trip from memphis to parsham which they would all be upstairs packing now so even horse stealing took care of its own ned cramped the wheel for me to get down you still dont want to tell me what you come for he said no i said none of the long row of chairs on the gallery were occupied caesar could have held his triumph there and had all the isolation boons and butchs new status required the lobby was empty and mr poleymus could have used that but it was a man mon they were in the ladies parlormr poleymus the driver of the car another deputy anyway in a badge butch and boon l fresh and marked from battle though only boon for me who read my face he had known it long enough or maybe it was his own heart or anyway conscience he said quickly look out now lucius look out already flinging up one arm as he rose quickly already stepping back retreating i walking at him up to him not tall enough by more than half and nothing to stand on either that ludicrous anticlimax of shame having to reach to jump even stretch the best i could to strike at his face oh yes i was crying bawling again i couldnt even see him now just hitting as high as i could having to jump at him to do so against his alphard alptall crags and cliffs mr poleymus saying behind me hit him again he struck a woman i dont care who she is and or somebody holding me until i wrenched jerked free turning blind for the door or where i thought i remembered it the hand guiding me now wait boon said dont you want to see her you see i was tired and my feet hurt i was about worn out and i needed sleep too but more i was dirty i wanted fresh clothes she had washed for me monday night but i didnt want just rewashed clothes i wanted a change of clothes that had had time to rest for a while like at home smelling of rest and quiet drawers and starch and bluing but mainly my feet i wanted fresh stockings and my other shoes i dont want to see nobody i said i want to go home all right boon said hereanybodywill somebody put him on that train this morning i got money can get it shut up i said i aint going nowhere now i went on still blind or that is the hand carried me wait boon said wait lucius shut up i said the hand curved me around there was a wall now wipe your face mr poleymus said he held out a bandanna handkerchief but i didnt take it my bandage would sop it up all right anyway the ridingsock did it was used to being cried into who knew if it stayed with me long enough it might even win a horse race i could see now we were in the lobby i started to turn but he held me hold up a minute he said if you still dont want to see anybody it was miss reba and everbe coming down the stairs carrying then grips but minnie wasnt with them the cardriving deputy was waiting he took the grips and then went on they didnt look toward us miss reba with her head mad and hard and high if the deputy hadnt moved quick she would have tromped right over him grips and all they went out ill buy you a ticket home mr poleymus said get on that train i didnt say shut up to him youve run out of folks sure enough now ill stay with you and tell the conductor im going to wait for ned i said i cant go without him if you hadnt ruined everything yesterday wed all been gone by now whos ned he said i told him you mean youre going to run that horse today anyhow you and ned by yourself i told him wheres ned now i told him come on he said we can go out the side door ned was standing at the mules head the back of the automobile was towards us and minnie still wasnt with them maybe she went back to memphis yesterday with sam and otis maybe now that she had otis again she wasnt going to lift her hand off of him until it had that tooth in it thats what i would have done anyway so mr poleymus finally caught you too did he ned said whats the matter aint he got no handcuffs your size shut up i said when you going to get him back home son mr poleymus said to ned i hope tonight ned said he wasnt being uncle remus or smart or cute or anything now soon as i get rid of this horse race and can do something about it have you got enough money yes sir ned said much oblige well be all right after this race he cramped the wheel and we got in mr poleymus stood with his hand on the top stanchion he said so you really are going to race that linscomb horse this afternoon we gonter beat that linscomb horse this afternoon ned said you hope so mr poleymus said i know so ned said how much do you know so mr poleymus said i wish i had a hundred dollars for my own to bet on it ned said they looked at each other it was a good while then mr poleymus turned loosed the stanchion and took from his pocket a worn snap purse that when i saw it i thought i was seeing double because it was exactly like neds scuffed and worn and even longer than the ridingsock that you didnt even know who was paying who for what and unsnapped it and took out two onedollar bills and snapped the purse shut and handed the bills to ned bet this for me he said if youre right you can keep half of it ned took the money ill bet it for you he said but much oblige by sundown tonight i can lend you half or three or four times this much we drove on theni mean ned drove on turning we didnt pass the automobile at all been crying again he said a racehorse jockey and still aint growed out of crying shut up i said but he was turning the buggy again on across the tracks and on along what would have been the other side of the square if parsham ever got big enough to have a square and stopped we were in front of a store hold him ned said and got out and went in the store not long and came back with a paper sack and got in and took the lines back toward homei mean uncle parshamsnow and with his free hand took from the big bag a small one it was peppermint drops here he said i got some bananas too and soon as we get lightning back to that private springbranch paddock we uses we can set down and eat um and then maybe i can get some sleep before i forget how to and meanwhiles stop fretting about that gal now you done said your say to boon hogganbeck hitting a woman dont hurt her because a woman dont shove back at a lick like a man do she just gives to it and then wken your back is turned reaches for the flatiron or the butcher knife thats why hitting them dont break nothing all it does is just black her eye or cut her mouf a little and that aint nothing to a woman because why because what better sign than a black eye or a cut mouf can a woman want from a man that he got her on his mind so once more in the clutch of our respective starting grooms mcwillie and i sat our skittering and jockeying mounts behind that wire thats right skittering and jockeying lightning too at least he had learnedanyway remembered from yesterdaythat he was supposed to be at least up with acheron when the running started even if he hadnt discovered yet that he was supposedhopedto be in front when it stopped this time neds final instructions were simple explicit and succinct just remember i knows i can make him run once and i believes i can make him run twice only we wants to save that once i knows until we knows we needs it so heres what i want you to do for this first heat just before them judges and such hollers go you say to yourself my name is ned william mccaslin and then do it do what i said i dont know yet neither he said but akrum is a horse and with a horse anything can happen and with a nigger boy on him its twice as likely to you just got to watch and be ready so that when it do happen you done already said my name is ned william mccaslin and then do it and do it quick and dont worry if it dont work and dont nothing happen im be waiting right there at the finish where i come in because we knows i can make him run once then the voice hollered go and our grooms sprang for their lives and we were off as i said we had drawn this time and mcwillie had the pole or mcwillie was off that is because i dont remember whether i had planned it or just did it by instinct so that when mcwillie broke i was already braced and lightnings first spring rammed him into the bridle all the way up to my shoulders bad hand and all acheron already in full run and three lengths ahead when i let lightning go but still kept the threelength gap both of us going now but three horses apart when i saw mcwillie do what you call nowadays a doubletake a single quick glance aside using only his eyeballs expecting to see me of course more or less at his knee then seeming to drive on at full speed for another stride or so before his vision told his intelligence that lightning and i were not there then he turned jerked his whole head around to look back and i remember still the whites of his eyes and his open mouth i could see him sawing frantically at acheron to slow him i sincerely believe i even heard him yell back at me goddammit white boy if you gonter race race the gap between us closing fast now because he now had acheron wrenched back and crossways until he was now at right angles to the course more or less filling the track sideways from rail to rail it looked like and facing the outside rail and for that moment instant second motionless i am convinced that mcwulies now frantic mind actually toyed with the idea of turning and running back until he could turn again with lightning in front nor no premeditation nothing i just said in my mind my name is ned william mccaslin and cut lightning as hard as i could with the switch pulling his head over so that when he sprang for the gap between acherons stern and the inside rail we would scrape acheron i remember i thought my leg will be crushed and i sat there the switch poised again in complete detachment waiting in nothing but curiosity for the blow shock crack spurt of blood and bones or whatever it would be but we had just exactly room enough or speed enough or maybe it was luck enough not my leg but lightnings hip which scraped across acherons buttocks at which second i cut again with the switch as hard as i could nor any judge or steward dog trainer market hunter or murderer nor purist or stickler of the most finicking and irreproachable to affirm it was not my own mount i struck in fact we were so inextricable at that second that of the four of us only acheron actually knew who had been hit then on i mean lightning and me i didntcouldnt look back yet so i had to wait to learn what happened they said that acheron didnt try to jump the rail at all he just reared and fell through it in a kind of whirling dust of white planks but still on his feet frantic now running more or less straight out into the pasture spectators scattering before him until mcwillie wrenched him around and they said that this time mcwillie actually set him quartering at the fence it was too late now to go back to the gap in it he had already made welightningwere too far ahead by this time as though he were a hunter but he refused it running instead at full speed along the rail but still on the outside of it the spectators hollering and leaping like frogs from in front of him as he cleared his new path or precedent that was when i began to hear him again hethey mcwillie and acheronwas closing fast now though with the outside rail between us lightning with the whole track to himself now and going with that same fine strong rhythm and reach and power to which it had simply not occurred yet that there was any horry about it in the back stretch now and acheron who had already run at least one extra fifty yards and would have to run another one before he finished already abreast of us beyond the rail around the far turn of the first lap now and now i could actually see me willies desperate mind grappling frantically with the rapidly diminishing choice of whether to swing acheron wide enough to bring him back through his selfmade gap and onto the track again and have him refuse its jumbled wreckage or play safe and stay where they were in the new track which they had already cleared of obstacles conservatism won as it should and does again the back stretch second lap now now the far turn second one also and even on the outside longer curve they were drawing ahead there was the wire and acheron a length at least ahead and i believe i thought for an instant of going to the whip just for the looks of the thing on our crowd was yelling now and who could blame them few if any had seen a heat like this before between two horses running on opposite sides of the rail on acheron still at top speed along his path as empty and open for him as the path to heaven two lengths ahead when welightning passed under the wire and acheron evidently he liked running outside already into his third lap when mcwillie dragged him by main strength away and into the pasture and into a tightening circle which even he could no longer negotiate and much uproar behind us now shouts foul foul no no yesl no heat no heat yes it was no it wasnt ask the judge ask ed what was it edthat part of the crowd which acheron had scattered from the outside rail now pouring across the track through the shattered gap to join the others in the infield i was looking for ned i thought i saw him but it was lycurgus trotting up the track toward me until he could take lightnings bit already turning him back come on he said you can stop you got to cool him out mr mccaslin said to get him away from the track take him over yonder to them locust trees where the buggys at where he can be quiet and we can rub him down but i tried to hold back what happened i said is it going to count we won didnt we we went under the wire they just went around it here i said you take him while i go back and see no i tell you lycurgus said he had lightning trotting now mr mccaslin dont want you there neither he said for me and you to stay right with lightning and have him ready to run again that next heats in less than a hour now and we got to win that one now because if this throws this one out we got to win the next one no matter what happens so he went on he lifted down a rail at the end of the track and we went through on to the clump of locust trees about two hundred yards away now i could see uncle parshams buggy hitched to one of them and i could still hear the voices from the judges stand in the infield and i still wanted to go back and find out but lycurgus had forestalled that too he had the pails and sponges and clothes and even a churn of water in the buggy for us to strip lightning and go to work on him so i had to get my first information about what had happened and was still happening too from hearsay what little lycurgus had seen before ned sent him to meet me and from others laterbefore ned came up the uproar vociferation of protest and affirmation oh yes even after losing two racesheats whatever they werelast winter and the first beat of this one yesterday there were still people who had bet on lightning because i was only eleven i had not learned yet that no horse ever walked to post provided he was still on his feet when he got there that somebody didnt bet on coming once or twice almost to blows with ned in the center of it in effect the crux of it polite and calm but dogged and insistent too rebutting each attack it wasnt a race it takes at least two horses to make a race and one of these wasnt even on the track and ned no sir the rule book dont mention how many horses it just talks about one horse at a time that if it dont commit fouls and dont stop forward motion and the jockey dont fall off and it cross the finish line first it wins then another then you just proved yourself that black won it never fouled nothing but about twenty foot of that fence and it sho never stopped forward motion because i myself seen at least a hundred folks barely get out from under it in time and you yourself seen it pass that finish line a good two lengths ahead of that chestnut and ned no sir that finish wire just runs across that track from one rail to the other it dont run on down into missippi too if it done that there are horses down there been crossing it ever since sunup this morning that we aint even heard about yet no sir its too bad about that little flimsy railmg but we was too busy running our horse to have time to stop and wait for that other one to come back when suddenly three newcomers were on the scene or anyway in the telling of it not three strangers because one of them was colonel linscomb himself and they all knew him since they were his neighbors so probably what they meant was that the other two were simply his guests city men too or very likely simply of colonel linscombs age and obvious solvency and likewise wearing coats and neckties whoone of themseemed to take charge of the matter coming into the crowd clamoring around ned and the harassed officials and saying gentlemen let me offer a solution as this man meaning nedsays his horse ran according to the rules and went under the wire first yet we all saw the other horse run the fastest race and was in the lead at the finish the owners of the horses are these gentlemen right here behind me colonel linseomb your neighbor and mr van tosch from memphis near enough to be your neighbor too when you get to know him better they have agreed and your judges will approve it to put this heat that was just run into what the bankers call escrow you all have done business with bankers whether you wanted to or not they said he even paused for the guffaw and got it and you know how they have a name for everything interest on it too a voice said and so he got that guffaw free and joined it what escrow means this time is suspended not abolished or cancelled just suspended the bets still stand just as you made them nobody won and nobody lost you can increase them or hedge them or whatever you want to the stake money for the last heat still stands and the owners are already adding another fifty a side for the next heat the winner of this next heat to be the winner of the one that was just run win this next heat and win all what do you say thats what iwelycurgus and meheard later right now we knew nothing just waiting for ned or somebody to come for us or send for us lightning cleaned and blanketed now and lycurgus leading him up and down keeping him moving and i sitting against a tree with my ridingsock off to dry out my bandage it seemed hours forever then in the next thinking it seemed no time collapsed condensed then ned came up walking fast i told you how he had looked terrible this morning but that was partly because of ms clothes his shirt was white or almost again now and his pants were clean too but it would not have been his clothes this time even if they were still filthy it was his face he didnt look like he had seen a simple and innocent hant he looked like he had without warning confronted doom itself except that doom had said to him calm down it will be thirty or forty minutes yet before i will want you be ready then but in the meantime stop worrying and tend to your business but he gave meusno time he went to the buggy and took his black coat out and put it on already talking they put it in what they calls escrow that means whoever loses this next one has done lost everything tack up but lycurgus already had the blanket off it didnt take us long then i was up ned standing at lightnings head holding the bridle with one hand his other hand in the pocket of the coat fumbling at something this one is gonter be easy for you we nudged him a little yestiddy then you fooled him bad today so you aint gonter trick him again but it wont matter we wont need to trick him now ill tend to this one myself all you got to do is still be on him at the finish dont fall off thats all you got to do until right at the last just keep him between them two rails and dont fall off of him remember what he taught you monday when you comes around the first lap and just before he will think about where i was standing monday hit him keep him going dont worry about that other horse no matter where he is or what hes doing just tend to yourn you mind that yes i said all right then heres the onliest other thing you got to do when you comes around the last lap and around the back turn into the home stretch toward that wire dont just believe know that lightning is where he can see the whole track in front of him when you get there you will know why but before that dont just think maybe he can or that by now he sholy ought to but know he can see that whole track right up to the wire and beyond it if that other horse is in front of you pull lightning all the way across the track to the outside rail if you needs to where there wont be nothing in the way to keep him from seeing that wire and on beyond it too dont worry about losing distance just have lightning where he can see everything in front of him his other hand was out now lightning was nuzzling his nose into it again and again i smelled that faint thin odor which i had smelled in uncle parshams pasture monday that i or anybody else should recognise at once and that i would recognise if it would only happen when i had time can you remember that yes i said then go on he said lead him on lycurgus aint you coming i said lycurgus pulled at the bridle he had to get lightnings muzzle out of neds hand by force finally ned had to put his hand back to his pocket go on he said you knows what to do lycurgus led on he had to for a while lightning even tried once to whirl back until lycurgus snatched him hit him a little lycurgus said get his mind back on what hes doing so i did and we went on and so for the third time mcwillie and i crouched our poised thunderbolts behind that wire mcwillies starting groom having declined to be hurled to earth three times and nobody else either volunteering or even accepting conscription they used a piece of cottonbagging jute stretched from rail to rail in the hands of two more democrats facing each other across the track it was probably the best start we had had yet acheron who had thought nothing of diving through a sixinch plank naturally wouldnt go within six feet of it and lightning though with his nose almost touching it was standing as still as a cow now i suppose scanning the crowd for ned when the starter hollered gol and the string dropped and in the same second acheron and mcwillie shot past us mcwillie shouting almost in my ear ill learn you this time white boy and already gone though barely a length before lightning pulled obediently up to mcwillies kneethe power the rhythm everything in fact except that still nobody bad told his head yet this was a race and in fact for the first time at least since i had participated been a factor we even looked like a race the two horses as though bolted together and staggered a little on into the back stretch of the first lap our relative positions in relation to our forward motion changing and altering with almost dreamlike indolence acheron drawing ahead until it would look like he really was about to leave us then lightning would seem to no tice the gap and close it it would even look like a challenge i could hear them along the rail who didnt really know lightning yet that he just didnt want to be that far back by himself on around the back turn and into the home stretch of the first lap and i give you my word lightning came into it already looking for ned i give you my word he whinnied going at a dead run he whinnied the first time i ever heard a horse nicker while running i didnt even know they could i cut him as hard as i could he broke faltered sprang again we had already made mcwillie a present of two lengths so i cut him again we went into the second lap two lengths back and traveling now on the peeled switch until the gap between him and acheron replaced ned in what lightning called his mind and he closed it again until his head was once more at mcwillies knee completely obedient but not one inch morethis magnificently equipped and organised organisation whose muscles had never been informed by their brain or whose brain had never been informed by its outposts of observation and experience that the sole aim and purpose of this entire frantic effort was to get somewhere first mcwillie was whipping now so i didnt need to he could no more have drawn away from lightning than he could have dropped behind him through the back stretch again and around the back turn again me still on lightning and lightning still between the rails so all that remained from here out were neds final instructions to pull ease him out presenting mcwillie again with almost another length until nothing impeded his view of the track the wire and beyond it helightningeven saw ned first the first i knew was that necksnapping surge and lunge as though helightninghad burst through some kind of invisible band or yoke then i saw ned myself maybe forty yards beyond the wire small and puny and lonely in the tracks vacancy while acheron and mcwillies flailing arm fled rapidly back to us then mcwillies wrung face for an instant too then gone too the wire flashed overhead come on son ned said i got it helightningalmost unloaded me stopping cutting back across the track acheron was somewhere close behind us tryingi hopedto stop too and went to ned at that same dead run bit bridle and all notwithstanding and simply stopped running his nose already buried in neds hand and me up around his ears grabbing at whatever was in reach sore hand too we did it i said cried we did it we beat him we dont this part of it ned said just hope to your stars its gonter be enough because i had just ridden and won my first race you see i mean a mansize race with people grown people more people than i could remember at one time before watching me win it and some of them anyway betting their money that i would also i didnt have time to notice remark anything in his face or voice or what he said because they were already through the rail and on the track coming toward us the whole moil and teem of sweated hats and tieless shirts and faces still gaped with yelling look out now ned said and still to me nothing only the faces and the voices like a sea thats riding him boy thats bringing him in but we not stopping ned leading lightning on saying let us through whitefolks let us through whitefolks until they gave back enough to let us go on but still moving along with us like the wave until we reached the gate to the infield where the judges were waiting and ned said again look out now and now i dont remember only the stopped horse with ned at the bit like a tableau and me looking past lightnings ears at grandfather leaning a little on his cane the goldheaded one and two other people whom i had known somewhere a long time ago just behind him boss i said what did you do to your hand he said yes sir i said boss youre busy now he said so am i it was quite kind quite cold no it wasnt anything well wait until we get home he said then he was gone now the two people were sam and minnie looking up at me with her calm grim inconsolable face for it seemed to me a long time while ned was still pawing at my leg wheres that tobacco sack i give you to keep yestiddy he said you sholy aint lost it oh yes i said reaching it from my pocket chapter show them miss reba told minnie they were in our i mean boonsno i mean grandfathersautomobile everbe and miss reba and minnie and sam and colonel linscombs chauffeur he was mcwillies father colonel linscomb had an automobile too theythe chauffeur and sam and minniehad gone up to hardwick to get miss reba and everbe and boon and bring them all back to parsham where miss reba and minnie and sam could take the train for memphis except that boon didnt come back with them he was in jail again the third time now and they had stopped at colonel linscombs to tell grandfather miss reba told it sitting in the car with grandfather and colonel linscomb and me standing around it because she wouldnt come in she told about boon and butch it was bad enough in the automobile going up there but at least we had that deputy let alone that little old constable you folks got that dont look like much but id say people dont fool around with him much either when we got to hardwick they at least had sense enough to lock them in separate cells the trouble was they never had no way to lock up corries new friends mouth and stopped and i didnt want to have to look at everbe either a big girl too big for little things to have to happen to like the black eye or the cut mouth whichever one she would have unless maybe she wouldnt couldnt be content with less than both sitting there having to without anywhere to go or room to do it even with the slow painful blood staining up the cheek i could see from here im sorry kid forget it miss reba said where was i you were telling what boon did this time grandfather said oh yes miss reba said locked them up in separate cells across the corridor and they were taking corrie and mesure they treated us fine just like ladiesdown to the jailors wifes room where we were going to stay when whatshisnamebutchpipes up and says well theres one thing about it me and sugar boy lost some blood and skin and a couple of shirts too but at least we got these excuse my french miss reba said memphis whores off the street so boon started in right away to tear that steel door down but they had remembered to already lock it so you would think that would have calmed him you know having to sit there and look at it for a while anyhow we thought so then when sam came with the right papers or whatever they wereand much obliged to you she told grandfather i dont know how much you had to put up but if youll send the bill to me when i get home ill attend to it boon knows the address and knows me thank you grandfather said if theres any charge ill let you know what happened to boon you havent told me yet oh yes they unlocked whatshisname first that was the mistake because they hadnt even got the key back out of boons lock before he was out of the cell and on butch i said butch miss reba said one good lick anyhow knocked him down and was right on top of him before anybody woke up so they never even let boon stop all the out he got was that trip across the corridor and back into the cell and locked up again before they even had time to take the key out of the lock but at least you got to admire him for it but she stopped for what i said what did you say she said what he did that were going to admire him for you didnt tell us that what did he do you think that still trying to tear that butch i said butchs head off before they even let him out of jail aint nothing miss reba said he had to do that i said ill be damned miss reba said lets get started we got to catch that train you wont forget to send that bill she told grandfather get out and come in colonel linscomb said suppers about ready you can catch the midnight train no much obliged miss reba said no matter how long your wife stays at monteagle shell come back home some day and youll have to explain it nonsense colonel linscomb said im boss in my house i hope youll keep on being miss reba said oh yes she said to minnie show them sheminnie didnt smile at us she smiled at me it was beautiful the even matched and matchless unblemished porcelain march curving outward to embrace almost with passion the restored gold tooth which looked bigger than any three of the natural merely white ones possibly could then she closed her lips again serene composed once more immune once more invulnerable to that extent which our frail webs of bone and flesh and coincidence ever hold or claim on invulnerability well miss reba said mcwillies father cranked the engine and got back in the automobile moved on grandfather and colonel linscomb turned and went back toward the house and i had begun to move too when the automobile horn tooted not loud once and i turned back it had stopped and sam was standing beside it beckoning to me come here he said miss reba wants to see you a minute he watched me while i came up why didnt you and ned tell me that horse was really going to run he said i thought you knew i said i thought that was why we came here sure sure he said ned told me you told me everybody told me only why didnt somebody make me believe it oh sure i never broke a leg but if id just had miss rebas nerve maybe i could have got that boxcar covered too here he said it was a tight roll of money bills this is neds tell him the next time he finds a horse that wont run not to wait to come and get me just telegraph me miss reba was leaning out hard and handsome everbe was on the other side of her not moving but still too big not to notice miss reba said i didnt expect to wind up in jail here too but then maybe i didnt expect not to neither anyway sam bet for me too i put up fifty for mr binford and five for minnie sam got three for two ii mean wewant to split fiftyfifty with you i aint got that much cash now what with this unexpected side trip i took this morning i dont want it i said i thought youd say that she said so i had sam put up another five for you you got sevenfifty coming here she held out her hand i dont want it i said what did i tell you sam said is it because it was gambling she said did you promise that too i hadnt maybe mother hadnt thought about gambling yet but i wouldnt have needed to have promised anybody anyway only i didnt know how to tell her when i didnt know why myself only that i wasnt doing it for money that money would have been the last thing of all that once we were in it i had to go on finish it ned and me both even if everybody else had quit it was as though only by making lightning run and run first could we justify not escape consequences simply justify any of it not to hope to make the beginning of it any less wrongi mean what boon and i had deliberately of our own free will to do back there in jefferson four days ago but at least not to shirk dodgeat least to finish what we ourselves had started but i didnt know how to say it so i said nome i dont want it go on sam said take it so we can go we got to catch that train give it to ned or maybe to that old boy who took care of you last night theyll know what to do with it so i took the money i had two rolls of it now the big one and this little one and still everbe hadnt moved motionless her hands in her lap big too big for little things to happen to at least pat her on the head sam said ned never taught you to kick dogs too did he he wont though miss reba said watch him jesus you man and heres another one that aint but eleven years old what the hell does one more matter aint she been proving ever since sunday shes quit if youd been sawing logs as long as she has what the hell does one more log matter when youve already cancelled the lease and even took down the sign so i went around the car to the other side still she didnt move too big for little things to happen to too much of her to have to be the recipient of things petty and picayune like bird splashes on a billboard or a bass drum just sitting there too big to shrink even shamed because ned was right her mouth puffed a little but mostly the black eye with her even a simole shiner was not content but must look bigger more noticeable more unhidable than on anyone else its all right i said i thought i had to she said i didnt know no other way you see miss reba said how easy it is thats all you need to tell us well believe you there aint the lousiest puniest bastard one of you providing hes less than seventy years old that cant make any woman believe there wasnt no other way you did have to i said we got lightning back in time to run the race it dont matter now any more you better go on or youll miss that train sure miss reba said besides shes got supper to cook too you aint heard that yet thats the surprise she aint going back to memphis she aint just reformed from the temptation business shes reformed from temptation too providing what they claim is right that there aint no temptation in a place like parsham except a mans own natural hopes and appetites shes got a job in parsham washing and cooking and lifting his wife in and out of bed and washing her off for that constable so shes even reformed from having to divide half she makes and half she has with the first tin badge that passes because all shell have to do now is shove a coffeepot or a greasy skillet in the way come on she told sam even you cant make that train wait from here then they were gone i turned and went back toward the house it was big with columns and porticoes and formal gardens and stables with lightning in one of them and carriage houses and what used to be slave quarters the still is old parsham place what remains of the plantation of the man family which gave its name to the town and the countryside and to some of the people too like uncle parsham hood the sun was gone now and soon the day would follow and then for the first time i realised that it was all over finishedall the four days of scuffling and scrabbling and dodging and lying and anxiety all over except the payingfor grandfather and colonel linscomb and mr van tosch would be somewhere in the house now drinking presupper toddies it might be half an hour yet before the supper bell rang so i turned aside and went through the rose garden and on to the back and sure enough there was ned sitting on the back steps here i said holding out the big roll of money sam said this is yours he took it aint you going to count it i said i reckon he counted it ned said i took the little one from my pocket ned looked at it did he give you that too miss reba did she bet for me its gambling money ned said youre too young to have anything to do with gambling money aint nobody ever old enough to have gambling money but you sho aint and i couldnt tell him either then i realised that i had expected him ned anyway to already know without having to be told and in the very next breath he did know because we never done it for money he said you aint going to keep yours either yes he said its too late for me but it aint too late for you im gonter give you a chance even if it aint nothing but taking a chance away from you sam said i could give it to uncle parsham but he wouldnt take gambling money either would he is that what you want to do with it yes i said all right he said he took the little roll too and took out his snap purse and put both the rolls into it and now it was almost dark but i could certainly hear the supper bell here how did you get the tooth back i said it wasnt me he said lycurgus done it that first morning when i come back to the hotel to get you it wasnt no trouble the hounds had already treed him once and lycurgus said he thought at first he would just use them put him up that gum sapling again and not call off the hounds until whistlebritches wropped the tooth up in his cap or something and dropped it but lycurgus said he was still a little rankled up over the upstarty notions whistlebritches had about horses mainly about lightning so since lightning was gonter have to run a race that afternoon and would need his rest lycurgus said he decided to use one of the mules he said how whistlebritches drawed a little old bitty pocketknife on him but lycurgus is gonter take good care of it until he can give it back to some of them he stopped he still looked bad he still hadnt had any sleep but maybe it is a relief to finally meet doom and have it set a definite moment to start worrying at well i said what i just told you the mule done it how i said lycurgus put whistlebritches on the mule without no bridle or saddle and tied his feet underneath and told him any time he decided to wrop that tooth up in his cap and drop it off he would stop the mule and lycurgus give the mule a light cut and about halfway round the first circle of the lot whistlebritches dropped the cap only there wasnt nothing in it that time so lycurgus handed the cap back up to him and give the mule another cut and lycurgus said he had disremembered that this was the mule that jumped fences until it had already jumped that fourfoot bobwire and lycurgus said it looked like it was fixing to take whistlebritches right on back to possum but it never went far until it turned around and come back and jumped back into the lot again so next time whistlebritches dropped the cap the tooth was in it only he might as well kept it for all the good it done me she went back to memphis too huh yes i said thats what i figgered likely she knows as good as i do its gonter be a long time before memphis sees me or boon hogganbeck either again and if boons back in jail again i dont reckon jefferson missippis gonter see us tonight neither i didnt know either and suddenly i knew that i didnt want to know i not only didnt want to have to make any more choices decisions i didnt even want to know the ones being made for me until i had to face the results then mcwillies father came to the door behind us in a white coat he was the houseman too though i hadnt heard any bell i had already washed changed my clothes too grandfather had brought a grip for me and even my other shoes so the houseman showed me the way to the dining room and i stood there grandfather and mr van tosch and colonel linscomb came in the old fat llewellin setter walking at colonel linscombs hand and we all stood while colonel linscomb said grace then we sat down the old setter beside colonel linscombs chair and ate with not just mcwillies father but a uniformed maid too to change the plates because i had quit i wasnt making choices and decisions any more i almost went to sleep in my plate into the dessert when grandfather said well gentlemenshall the guard fire first well go to the office colonel linscomb said it was the best room i ever saw i wished grandfather had one like it colonel linscomb was a lawyer too so there were cases of law books but there were farm and horsepapers too and a glass case of jointed fishing rods and guns and chairs and a sofa and a special rug for the old setter to lie on in front of the fireplace and pictures of horses and jockeys on the walls with the rose wreaths and the dates they won and a bronze figure of manassas i didnt know until then that colonel linscomb was the one who had owned manassas on the mantel and a special table for the big book which was his stud book and another table with a box of cigars and a decanter and water pitcher and sugar bowl and glasses already on it and a french window that opened onto the gallery above the rose garden so that you could smell the roses even in the house and honeysuckle too and a mockingbird somewhere outside then the houseman came back with ned and set a chair at the corner of the hearth for him and theywesat downcolonel linscomb in a white linen suit and mr van tosch in the sort of clothes they wore in chicago which was where he came from until he visited memphis and liked it and bought a place to breed and raise and train race horses too and gave bobo beauchamp a job on it five or six years ago and grandfather in the confederategray pigeontailed suit that he inherited i mean inherited not the suit but the confederate gray because he hadnt been a soldier himself he was only fourteen in carolina the only child so he had to stay with his mother while his father was a color sergeant of wade hamptons until a picket of fitzjohn porters shot him out of his saddle at one of the chickahominy crossings the morning after gainess mill and grandfather stayed with his mother until she died in and still stayed until general sherman finally eliminated him completely from carolina in and he came to mississippi hunting for the descendants of a distant kinsman named mccaslinhe and the kinsman even had the same baptismal names lucius quintus carothersand found one in the person of a greatgranddaughter named sarah edmonds and in married her now grandfather told ned begin at the beginning wait colonel linscomb said he leaned and poured whiskey into a glass and held it out toward ned here he said thank you kindly ned said but he didnt drink it he set the glass on the mantel and sat down again he had never looked at grandfather and he didnt now he just waited now grandfather said drink it colonel linscomb said you may need it so ned took the drink and swallowed it at one gulp and sat holding the empty glass still not looking at grandfather now grandfather said begin wait mr van tosch said how did you make that horse run ned sat perfectly still the empty glass motionless in his hand while we watched him waiting then he said addressing grandfather for the first time will these white gentlemen excuse me to speak to you private what about grandfather said you will know ned said if you thinks they ought to know too you can tell them grandfather rose will you excuse us he said he started toward the door to the hall why not the gallery colonel linscomb said its dark there better for conspiracy or confession either so we went that way i mean i was already up too grandfather paused again he said to ned what about lucius he used it too ned said anybody got a right to know what his benefits is we went out onto the gallery into the darkness and the smell of the roses and the honeysuckle too and besides the mockingbird which was in a tree not far away we could hear two whippoorwills and as always at night in mississippi and so tennessee wasnt too different a dog barking it was a sour dean ned said quietly dont lie to me grandfather said horses dont eat sardines this one do ned said you was there and saw it me and lucius tried him out beforehand but i didnt even need to try him first as soon as i laid eyes on him last sunday i knowed he had the same kind of sense my mule had ah grandfather said so thats what you and maury used to do to that mule no sir ned said mr maury never knowed it neither nobody knowed it but me and that mule this horse was just the same when he run that last lap this evening i had the sour dean waiting for him and he knowed it we went back inside they were already looking at us yes grandfather said but its a family secret i wont withhold it if it becomes necessary but will you let me be the judge under that stipulation of course van tosch has the first claim on it in that case ill either have to buy ned orsell you coppermine mr van tosch said but shouldnt all this wait until your man hogganbeck is here too you dont know my man hogganbeck grandfather said he drove my automobile to memphis when i take him put of jail tomorrow he will drive it back to jefferson between those two points in time his presence would have been missed no more than his absence is only this time he didnt have to even start to tell ned to begin bobo got mixed up with a white man ned said and this time it was mr van tosch who said ah and that was how we began to learn it from ned and mr van tosch both because mr van tosch was an alien a foreigner who hadnt lived in our country long enough yet to know the kind of white blackguard a young countrybred negro who had never been away from home before come to a big city to get more money and fun for the work he intended to do would get involved with it was probably gambling or it began with gambling that would be their simplest mutual meeting ground but by this time it was more than just gambling even ned didnt seem to know exactly what it wasunless maybe ned did know exactly what it was but it was in a white mans world anyway according to ned it was by now so badthe money sum involved was a hundred and twentyeight dollarsthat the white man had convinced bobo that if the law found out about it merely being fired from his job with mr van tosch would be the least of bobos troubles in fact he had bobo believing that his real trouble wouldnt even start until after he no longer had a white man to front for him until at last the situation crisis so desperate and the threat so great bobo went to mr van tosch and asked for a hundred and twentyeight dollars getting the answer whichvhe had probably expected from the man who was not only a white man and a foreigner but settled too past the age when he could remember a young mans passions and predicaments which was no that was last fall i remember that mr van tosch said i ordered the man never to come on my place again i thought he was gone you see what i mean hemr van toschwas a good man but he was a foreigner then bobo abandoned by that last hope which he had never really believed in anyway got up as he put it ned didnt know how either or perhaps he did know or perhaps the way in which bobo got it up was such that he wouldnt even tell a member of his own race who was his kinsman too fifteen dollars and gave it to the man and bought with it just what you might expect and what bobo himself probably expected but what else could he do where else turn only more threat and pressure having just proved that he could get money when driven hard enough but why didnt he come to me mr van tosch said he did ned said you told him no they sat quite still youre a white man ned said gently bobo was a nigger boy then why didnt he come to me grandfather said back where he should never have left in the first place instead of stealing a horse what would you a done ned said if he had come in already out of breath from memphis and told you dont ask me no questions just hand me a hundred and a few extra dollars and ill go back to memphis and start paying you back the first saturday i gets around to it he could have told me why grandfather said im a mccaslin too youre a white man too ned said go on grandfather said so bobo discovered that the fifteen dollars which he had thought might save him had actually ruined him now according to ned bobos demon gave him no rest at all or perhaps the white man began to fear bobothat a mere dribble a few dollars at a time would take too long or perhaps that bobo because of his own alarm and desperation plus what the white man doubtless considered the natural ineptitude of bobos race would commit some error or even crime which would blow everything up anyway this was when hethe white manbegan to work on bobo to try for a onestroke killing which would rid him of the debt creditor worry and all his first idea was to have bobo rifle mr van toschs tack room load into the buggy or wagon or whatever it would be as many saddles and bridles and driving harnesses as it would carry and clear out bobo of course would be suspected at once but the white man would be safely away by then and if bobo moved fast enough which even he should have the sense to do he had all the united states to flee into and find another job but ned said even the white man abandoned this one he would not only have a buggy or wagonload of horseless horse gear and daylight coming it would have taken days to dispose of it piecemeal even if he had had days to do it in so that was when they thought of a horse to condense the wagon or buggyload of uncohered fragments of leather into one entity which could be sold in a lump and if the white man worked fast enough and didnt haggle over base dollarswithout too much delay that is the white man not bobo believed that bobo was going to steal a horse for him only bobo knew if he didnt steal the horse he could see the end of everythingjob liberty allwhen next monday morning the crisis had reached its crux last saturday the same day boon and iand ned left jefferson in the automobile came and the reason for the crisis at this particular moment what made it so desperate was that there was a horse of mr van toschs so available for safe stealing that it might almost have been planted for that purpose this of course was lightning i mean coppermine himself who at the moment was in a sales stable less than half a mile away where as mr van toschs known groom it was bobo who had delivered the horse to the sales stable in the first place bobo could go and get him at any time for no more trouble than putting a halter on him and leading him away which by itself might have been tolerable the trouble was the white man knew ita horse bred and trained for running but which would not run and which in consequence was in such bad repute with mr van tosch and mr clapp the trainer that it was at the sales stable waiting for the first to come along who would make an offer for it in further consequence of which bobo could go and remove it and it would very likely not even be reported to mr van tosch unless he happened to inquire in still further consequence of which bobo had until tomorrow morning monday to do something about it or else that was the situation when ned left us in front of miss rebas sunday afternoon and walked around the corner to beale street and entered the first blind tiger he came to and found bobo trying to outface his doom through the bottom of a whiskey bottle grandfather said so thats what it was now im beginning to understand a nigger saturday night bobo already drunk and your tongue hanging out all the way from jefferson to get to the first saloon you could reach and stopped and said pounced almost wait thats wrong it wasnt even saturday you got to memphis sunday evening and ned sitting there quite still the empty glass in his hand he said with my people saturday night runs over into sunday and into monday morning too colonel linscomb said you wake up monday morning sick with a hangover filthy in a filthy jail and lie there until some white man comes and pays your fine and takes you straight back to the cotton field or whatever it is and puts you back to work without even giving you time to eat breakfast and you sweat it out there and maybe by sundown you feel you are not really going to die and the next day and the day after that and after that until its saturday again and you can put down the plow or the hoe and go back as fast as you can to that stinking jail cell on monday morning why do you do it i dont know you cant know ned said youre the wrong color if you could just be a nigger one saturday night you wouldnt never want to be a white man again as long as you live all right grandfather said go on so bobo told ned of his predicament the horse less than half a mile away practically asking to be stolen and the white man who knew it and who had given bobo an ultimatum measurable now in mere hoursall right grandfather said now get to my automobile were already to it ned said theyhe and bobo went to the stable to look at the horse and soon as i laid eyes on him i minded that mule i used to own and bobo like me was too young actually to remember the mule but also like me he had grown up with its legend so we decided to go to that white man and tell him something had happened and bobo couldnt get that horse outen that stable for him like bobo thought he could but we could get him a automobile in place of it now wait he told grandfather quickly we knowed as good as you that that automobile would be safe at least long enough for us to finish maybe in thirty or forty years you can stand on a jefferson street corner and count a dozen automobiles before sundown but you cant yet maybe then you can steal a automobile and find somebody to buy it that wont worry you with a lot of howcome and who and why but you cant now so for a man that looked like i imagined he looked i hadnt never seen him yet to travel around trying to sell a automobile quick and private would be about as hard as selling a elephant quick and private you never had no trouble locating where it was at and getting your hand on it once you and mr van tosch got started did you go on grandfather said ned did then the white man would ask what automobile and bobo would let me tend to that and then the white man would maybe ask what im doing in it nohow and then bobo would tell him that i want that horse because i know how to make it run that we already got a match race waiting tuesday and if the white man wanted he could come along too and win enough on the horse to pay back three or four times them hundred and thirteen dollars and then he wouldnt even have to worry with the automobile if he didnt want to because he would be the kind of a white man that done already had enough experience to know what would sell easy and what would be a embarrassment to get caught with so thats what we were gonter do until yawl come and ruint it let that white man just watch the first heat without betting yes or no which he would likely do and see lightning lose it like he always done which the white man would a heard all about too by now then we would say nemmine just wait to the next heat and then bet him the horse against the automobile on that one without needing to remind him that when lightning got beat this time he would own him too theygrandfather and colonel linscomb and mr van toschlooked at ned i wont try to describe their expressions i cant then yawl come and ruint it ned said i see mr van tosch said it was all just to save bobo suppose you had failed to make coppermine run and lost him too what about bobo then i made him run ned said you seen it but just suppose for the sake of the argument mr van tosch said that would a been bobos lookout ned said it wasnt me advised him to give up missippi cotton farming and take up memphis frolicking and gambling for a living in place of it but i thought mr priest said hes your cousin mr van tosch said everybody got kinfolks that aint got no more sense than bobo ned said well mr van tosch said lets all have a toddy colonel linscomb said briskly he got up and mixed and passed them you too he told ned ned brought his glass and colonel linscomb poured this time when ned set the untasted glass on the mantel nobody said anything yes mr van tosch said then he said well priest youve got your automobile and ive got my horse and maybe i frightened that damn scoundrel enough to stay clear of my stable hands anyway they sat there what shall i do about bobo they sat there im asking you mr van tosch said to ned keep him ned said folksboys and young men anyhowin my people dont convince easy why just negroes mr van tosch said maybe he means mccaslins colonel linscomb said thats right ned said mccaslins and niggers both act like the mixtry of the other just makes it worse right now im talking about young folks even if this one is a nigger mccaslin maybe they dont hear good anyhow they got to learn for themselves that roguishness dont pay maybe bobo learnt it this time aint that easier for you than having to break in a new one yes mr van tosch said they sat there yes mr van tosch said again so ill either have to buy ned or sell you coppermine they sat there can you make him run again ned i made him run that time ned said i said again mr van tosch said they sat there priest mr van tosch said do you believe he can do it again yes grandfather said how much do you believe it they sat there are you addressing me as a banker or a what grandfather said call it a perfectly normal and natural northwest mississippi countryman taking his perfectly normal and natural godgiven and billofrightsdefended sabbatical among the fleshpots of southwestern tennessee colonel linscomb said all right mr van tosch said ill bet you coppermine against neds secret one heat of one mile if ned can make coppermine beat that black of linscombs again i get the secret and coppermine is yours if coppermine loses i dont want your secret and you take or leave coppermine for five hundred dollars that is if he loses i can have coppermine for five hundred dollars or if i pay you five hundred dollars i dont have to take him grandfather said right mr van tosch said and to give you a chance to hedge i will bet you two dollars to one that ned cant make him run again they sat there so ive either got to win that horse or buy him in spite of anything i can do grandfather said or maybe you didnt have a youth mr van tosch said but try to remember one youre among friends here try for a little while not to be a banker try they sat there twofifty grandfather said five mr van tosch said threefifty grandfather said five mr van tosch said fourandaquarter grandfather said five mr van tosch said fourfifty grandfather said fourninetyfive mr van tosch said done grandfather said done mr van tosch said so for the fourth time mcwillie on acheron and i on lightning i mean coppermine skittered and jockeyed behind that taut little frail jute string mcwillie wasnt speaking to me at all now he was frightened and outraged baffled and determined he knew that something had happened yesterday which should not have happened which in a sense should not have happened to anyone certainly not to a nineteenyearold boy who was simply trying to win what he had thought was a simple horse race no holds barred of course but at least a mutual agreement that nobody would resort to necromancy we had not drawn for position this time wemcwillie and i had been offered the privilege but ned said at once nemmine this time mcwillie needs to feel better after yesterday so let him have the pole where he can start feeling better now which from rage or chivalry i didnt know which mcwillie refused bringing us to what appeared insoluble impasse until the officialthe pending homicide onesolved it quick by saying here you boys if you aim to run this race get on up behind thatere bagging twine where you belong nor had ned gone through his preliminary incantation or ritual of rubbing lightnings muzzle i dont say forgot to ned didnt forget things so obviously i hadnt been watching noticing closely enough anyway it was too late now nor had he given me any lastminute instructions this time either but then what was there for him to say and last night mr van tosch and colonel linscomb and grandfather had agreed that since this was a private running almost you might say a grudge match effort should be made and all concerned cautioned to keep it private which would have been as easy to do in parsham as to keep tomorrows weather private and restricted to colonel linscombs pasture sincea community composed of one winterresort hotel and two stores and a cattle chute and depot at a railroad intersection and the churches and schools and scattered farmhouses of a remote countryside any news let alone word of any horse race not to mention a repeat between these two horses spread across parsham as instantaneously as weather does so they were here today too including the nighttelegraphist judge who really should sleep sometimes not as many as yesterday but a considerable more than grandfather and mr van tosch had given the impression of wantingthe stained hats the tobacco the tieless shirts and overallswhen somebody hollered go and the string snatched away and we were off we were off mcwillie as usual two strides out before lightning seemed to notice we had started and pulled quickly and obediently up until he could more or less lay his cheek against me willies knee in case he wanted to near turn back stretch mine and mcwillies juxtaposition altering closing and opening with that dreamlike and unhurried quality probably quite familiar to people who fly aeroplanes in close formation far turn and into the stretch for the first lap i by simple rote whipping lightning onward about one stride before he would remember to begin to look for ned i took one quick raking glance at the faces along the rail looking for neds and lightning ran that whole stretch not watching where he was going at all but scanning the rush of faces for neds likewise in vain near turn again the back stretch again and into the far turn the home stretch i was already swinging lightning out toward the outside rail where acheron might be beating us but at least he wouldnt obstruct our view he could see but if he had seen ned this time he didnt tell me nor could i tell him look look yonder there he is because ned wasnt there only the vacant track beyond the taut line of the wire as fragilelooking as a filtered or maybe attenuated moonbeam mcwillie whipping furiously now and lightning responding like a charm exactly one neck back if acheron had known any way to run sixty miles an hour we would tooone neck back if acheron had decided to stop ten feet before the wire so would weone neck back but he didnt we went on still paired but staggered a little as though bolted together the wire flicked overhead mcwillie and i speaking again now that is he was yelling back at me in a kind of cannibal glee yahyahyah yahyahyah slowing also but not stopping going straight on i suppose to the stable he and acheron certainly deserved to i turned lightning and walked back ned was trotting toward us grandfather behind him though not trotting our sycophants and adulators of yesterday had abandoned us caesar was not caesar now come on ned said taking the bit rapid but calm only impatient almost inattentive hand what happened grandfather said what the devil happened nothing ned said i never had no sour dean for him this time and he knowed it didnt i tell you this horse got sense then to me theres bobo over yonder waiting hand this plug back to him so he can take it on to memphis were going home tonight but wait i said wait forget this horse ned said we dont want him boss has got his automobile back and all he lost was four hundred and ninetysix dollars and its worth four hundred and ninetysix dollars not to own this horse because what in the world would we do with him supposing they was to quit making them stinking little fishes let mr van man have him back maybe some day coppermine will tell him and bobo what happened here yesterday we didnt go home tonight though we were still at colonel linscombs in the office again after supper again boon looked battered and patched up and a considerable subdued but he was calm and peaceful enough and clean too he had shaved and had on a fresh shirt i mean a new shirt that he must have bought in hardwick sitting on the same straight hard chair ned had sat on last night naw he said i wasnt fighting him about that i wasnt even mad about that no more that was her business besides you cant just cut right off you got to got taper off grandfather said no sir boon said not taper off you quit only you still got to clean up the trash litter no matter how good you finished it wasnt that what i aimed to break his neck for was for calling my wife a whore you mean youre going to marry her grandfather said but it was not grandfather it was me that boon pounced almost jumped at god damn it he said if you can go barehanded against a knife defending her why the hell cant i marry her aint i as good as you are even if i aint eleven years old and thats about all about six the next afternoon we came over the last hill and there was the clock on the courthouse above the trees around the square ned said hee hee hee he was in front with boon he said seems like i been gone twp years when delphine gets through with you tonight maybe youll wish you had grandfather said or maybe not come back atall ned said but a woman got to keep sweeping and cooking and washing and dusting on her mind all day long i reckon she needs a little excitement once in a while then we were there the automobile stopped i didnt move grandfather got out so i did too mr ballotts got the key boon said no he hasnt grandfather said he took the key from his pocket and gave it to boon come on he said we crossed the street toward home and do you know what i thought i thought it hasnt even changed because it should have it should have jeen altered even if only a little i dont mean it should have changed of itself but that i bringing back to it what the last four days must have changed in me should have altered it i mean if those four daysthe lying and deceiving and tricking and decisions and undecisions and the things i had done and seen and heard and learned that mother and father wouldnt have let me do and see and hear and learnthe things i had had to learn that i wasnt even ready for yet had nowhere to store them nor even anywhere to lay them down if all that had changed nothing was the same as if it had never beennothing smaller or larger or older or wiser or more pityingthen something had been wasted thrown away spent for nothing either it was wrong and false to begin with and should never have existed or i was wrong or false or weak or anyway not worthy of it come on grandfather saidnot kind not unkind not anything i thought aunt callie would just come out whether shes carrying alexander or not and start hollering at me but nothing just a house i had known since before i could have known another at a little after six oclock on a may evening when people were already thinking about supper and mother should have had a few gray hairs at least kissing me for a minute then looking at me then father whom i had always been a little afraid is not the word but i cant think of anotherafraid of because if i hadnt been i think i would have been ashamed of us both then grandfather said maury not this time boss father said then to me lets get it over with yes sir i said and followed him on down the hall to the bathroom and stopped at the door while he took the razor strop from the hook and i stepped back so he could come out and we went on mother was at the top of the cellar stairs i could see the tears but no more all she had to do would be to say stop or please or maury or maybe if she had just said lucius but nothing and i followed father on down and stopped again while he opened the cellar door and we went in where we kept the kindling in winter and the zinclined box for ice in summer and mother and aunt callie had shelves for preserves and jelly and jam and even an old rocking chair for mother and aunt callie while they were putting up the jars and for aunt callie to sleep in sometimes after dinner though she always said she hadnt been asleep so here we were at last where it had taken me four days of dodging and scrabbling and scurrying to get to and it was wrong and father and i both knew it i mean if after all the lying and deceiving and disobeying and conniving i had done all he could do about it was to whip me then father was not good enough for me and if all that i had done was balanced by no more than that shaving strop then both of us were debased you see it was impasse until grandfather knocked the door was not locked but grandfathers father had taught him and he had taught father and father had taught me that no door required a lock the closed door itself was sufficient until you were invited to enter it but grandfather didnt wait not this time no father said this is what you would have done to me twenty years ago maybe i have more sense now grandfather said persuade alison to go on back upstairs and stop snivelling then father was gone the door closed again grandfather sat in the rocking chair not fat but with just the right amount of paunch to fill the white waistcoat and make the heavy gold watch chain hang right i lied i said come here he said i cant i said i lied i tell you i know it he said then do something about it do anything just so its something i cant he said there aint anything to do not anything i didnt say that grandfather said i said i couldnt you can what i said how can i forget it tell me how to you cant he said nothing is ever forgotten nothing is ever lost its too valuable then what can i do live with it grandfather said live with it you mean forever for the rest of my life not ever to get rid of it never i cant dont you see i cant yes you can he said you will a gentleman always does a gentleman can live through anything he faces anything a gentleman accepts the responsibility of his actions and bears the burden of their consequences even when he did not himself instigate them but only acquiesced to them didnt say no though he knew he should come here then i was crying hard bawling standing no kneeling i was that tall now between his knees one of his hands at the small of my back the other at the back of my head holding my face down against his stiff collar and shirt and i could smell himthe starch and shaving lotion and chewing tobacco and benzine where grandmother or delphine had cleaned a spot from his coat and always a faint smell of whiskey which i always believed was from the first toddy which he took in bed in the morning before he got up when i slept with him the first thing in the morning would be ned he had no white coat sometimes he didnt have on any coat or even a shirt and even after grandfather sent the horses to stay at the livery stable ned still managed to smell like them with the tray bearing the decanter and water jug and sugar bowl and spoon and tumbler and grandfather would sit up in bed and made the toddy and drink it then put a little sugar into the heeltap and stir it and add a little water and give it to me until grandmother came suddenly in one morning and put a stop to it there he said at last that should have emptied the cistern now go wash your face a gentleman cries too but he always washes his face and this is all it was monday afternoon after school father wouldnt let mother write me an excuse so i had to take the absent marks but miss rhodes was going to let me make up the work and ned was sitting on the back steps again grandmothers steps this time but in the shade this time too i said if wed just thought to bet that money sam gave us on lightning that last time we could have settled what to do about it good i did settle it good ned said i got five for three this time old possum hoods got twenty dollars for his church now but we lost i said you and lightning lost ned said me and that money was on akrum oh i said then i said how much was it he didnt move i mean he didnt do anything i mean he looked no different at all it might have been last friday instead of this one all the four days of dodging and finagling and having to guess right and guess fast and not having but one guess to do it with had left no mark on him even though i had seen him once when he not only had had no sleep he didnt even have any clothes to wear you see how i keep on calling it four days it was saturday afternoon when boon and iwe thoughtleft jefferson and it was friday afternoon when boon and ned and i saw jefferson again but to me it was the four days between that saturday night at miss ballenbaughs when boon would have gone back home tomorrow if i had said so and the moment when i looked down from lightning wednesday and saw grandfather and passed to him during which ned had carried the load alone held back the flood shored up the crumbling levee with whatever tools he could reachincluding meuntil they broke in his hand i mean granted we had no business being behind that levee a gentleman always sticks to his lit whether he told it or not and i was only eleven i didnt know how i knew that too but i did that you never ask anyone how much he won or lost gambling so i said i mean would there be enough to pay back boss his four hundred and ninetysix dollars and he still sat there unchanged so why should mother have a gray hair since i saw her last since i would have to be unchanged too because now i knew what grandfather meant that your outside is just what you live in sleep in and has little connection with who you are and even less with what you do then he said you learned a considerable about folks on that trip im just surprised you aint learnt more about money too do you want boss to insult me or do you want me to insult boss or do you want both how do you mean i said when i offers to pay his gambling debt aint i telling him to his face he aint got enough sense to bet on horses and when i tells him where the money come from im gonter pay it with aint i proving it i still dont see where the insult to you comes in i said he might take it ned said then the day came at last everbe sent for me and i walked across town to the little backstreet almost dollsize house that boon was buying by paying grandfather fifty cents every saturday she had a nurse and she should have been in bed but she was sitting up waiting for me in a wrapper she even walked across to the cradle and stood hand cm ms sttcyvmei vrtue we looked at it well she said what do you think i didnt think anything it was just another baby already as ugly as boon even if it would have to wait twenty years to be as big i said so what are you going to call it not it she said him cant you guess what i said his name is lucius priest hogganbeck she said
