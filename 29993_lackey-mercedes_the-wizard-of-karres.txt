the wizard of karres by mercedes lackey eric flint and dave freer chapter the shrill screaming from inside made captain pausert open the cabin door with some caution not that screaming was necessarily unusual around his present companyjust that it was a good idea to meet screaming with due care he ducked reflexively as something went whizzing past his head vermilion splattered all over the wall of the ventures secondbest stateroom it didnt make things look much worse the eggshell blue paint that goth had picked out with such care during their refit on uldune was scarred and splattered with mute testimony to the savageness of the battle that was going on inside in the center of what had once been an ankledeep pale cream carpet was the perpetrator of the ghastly destruction the leewit the younger of the two witch girls of karres aboard the ship stopped drumming her heels on the floor sat up and glared at him what are you doing here stupid she demanded weighing the next paint bottle in her hands like the sound of sunlight like seeing a scent he was aware of the insubstantial thing somewhere in the room a thumbsized vatch filling pauserts head with tinkling vatchgiggles then he saw it around the light a sheet of paper dragged by that tiny piece of impossible blackness fluttered like a demented moth throw it at the big dream thing squeaked the vatch inside his head its silvery eyes wide with delight throw throw shant said the leewit changing her mind spoilsport throw at me again then the vatch swooped down at her fluttering what had obviously been the leewits artistic endeavor inches from the leewits nose the leewit snatched at it furiously nearly dropping the paint bottle mine give it the vatch and the picture twitched away from her fingers and then disappeared and then reappearedin four different localities at the same time life with vatches was interesting so was life with karres witches life with both was complicated captain pauserts life had been very very complicated for some time now the leewit impotently threatened the dancing vatch quartet with the paint bottle then she turned on the captain you you can even handle a giant vatch get my picture back from the stinkin little thing seeing as you asked so nicely child i will captain pausert was careful to keep a straight face it amused him to see the leewit persecuted for a change since the leewit was ever so capable of doing a fair amount of persecuting herself still vatches were too capable of creating havoc for him to leave one on the loose here forming hooks of the invisible stuff that was klatha force pausert began to reach with them for the tiny vatch or vatches there were four of them and they all looked the sameless than an inch of blackness and a pair of slitty silver eyes they all seemed to have the leewits picture too that was confusing but vatches did odd things to time and space in human dimensions hed just try each one in turn he did to no avail its doing a lightshift captain that observation came from the leewits older sister goth from where she lounged in a formfit chair on the far side of the room splitting its image neat trick hadnt thought of that she said rubbing her sharp chin pausert stared at the four so where is it actually lightshifts were one of goths klatha skills got to be somewhere between them captain pausert felt with the klatha hooks encountered nonmaterial resistance suddenly there was only one tiny speck of whirling midnight and the leewits artwork fluttered towards the floor the little blond witch snatched it out of the air pausert was a vatchhandler hed taken on big windy the giant vatch he could pull them inside out and make them jump through hoops if he had to only there was one kind of these nonmaterial klatha creatures that was supposed to be unmanageableand unfortunately you couldnt tell which kind of vatch you had until you had it then it could be too late klatha was powerful but also dangerous tickles giggled the vatchlet pausert tried to make the little creature move it was like pushing smoke with a sinking feeling he realized that the silveryeyed mischief must be one of the kind of vatch that none of the witches of karres could make do anything i like this place its fun the vatchlet whizzed around his head theninto his chest pauserts heart stopped for a moment but nothing else happened and it restarted again well at least it hadnt turned on him and it sounded and acted awfully young hed suddenly the shipdetector alarms sounded through the intercom system pausert had set them up to do so when the venture had made her run through the chaladoor that region of dangerous space between emris and uldune hed never gotten around to undoing it the baby vatch and the leewit would just have to sort out their own problems this could be something far worse the captain left at a run with goth hard at his heels they nearly collided with vezzarn the old spacercumspy who was one half of their crew the other half hulik do eldel former imperial agent and citizen of the pirate planet uldune was barely moments behind the captain focused the viewscreens on the objectno objectsthe detectors had picked up they were still almost at maximum range but were coming in fast imperial cruisers captain said goth looking at the heavily armed spacecraft pauserts heart began doing complicated calisthenics pirates would have been preferable infinitely preferable there is another one up there coming in the upper quadrant said hulik pointing and another one dead ahead added vezzarn i think theyve got us boxed in captain they did indeed pausert realized that this meant that someone back at the governors palace in green galaine on emris must have passed on details of their plans including their exact trajectory this was not good and he had the feeling it was going to get a great deal worse do you want me to unseal the nova guns captain asked vezzarn nervously not sure itll do much good replied pausert grimly the guns were very effective when they worked but they were also old and erraticand sometimes downright dangerous to use nevertheless he nodded his head may as well though in the meantime hulik try the communicator the slim elegant miss do eldel set it to the empires general beam length a young man in the neatly pressed uniform of an imperial lieutenant stared out at them from under his regulation cap instructed to stop firing your thrust generators and allow us to match velocity and trajectory and board for inspection the man paused obviously about to repeat pausert leaned over and hit the send button this is captain pausert of the venture what are you looking for the officer looked faintly startled as if he hadnt expected them to reply ah captain pausert can you give us visuals please our visuals are on said pausert smoothly sorry we might be having a malfunction with the screens or perhaps you are but what seems to be the problem lieutenant what are you looking for were a civilian spacecraft on a course from the empire planet of emris to the provincial capital of the regency of hailie were not a pirate vessel i assure you in fact we have a letter of safe conduct with the seal of the empress hailie herself the lieutenant was definitely looking more respectful now but pausert was not going to drop his guard a good half of the people aboard the venture were persona non grata so far as the empire was concerned the last thing he wanted was to have any imperials aboard the imperial lieutenant hesitated for a moment then said ill give you to commodore fleser sir if youll just wait a moment hell answer your questions pausert flicked the toggle what do you think goth hulik better play along captain me and the leewit will get the sheewash drive ready goth headed for the hatch leading out of the control room we can outrun them if we have to but threbus said to keep a low profile hulik nodded we can outrun them but they do outgun us lets see what they want first the captain decided their advice was good and toggled on the buzzing communicator the screen now showed a jowlfaced grayhaired man with commodores insignia fleser of the imperial cruiser isn malorn reduce thrust or be fired on pausert realized that the imperials werent going to pussyfoot around he reached out and began cutting the thrust this is captain pausert of the venture why are you interfering with a vessel in the legitimate pursuit of business we have orders to investigate the possibility that you may be carrying a dangerous criminal as well as one of the infamous witches of karres said the commodore grimly cut thrust further captain youre within range of our guns now and theyre locked onto your ship any attempt at escape and you will be fired on out he cut the communicatorlink pausert shook his head at the blank screen great uncle threbus was dead wrong about one thing that commodore knew who we were and he was still prepared to fire on us looks to me like the empire doesnt plan to leave us alone after all he stood up theyre looking for our passengers im going to have a word with goth ought to be all right said goth i can hide myself in noshape you got that safeconduct signed by the empress hailie for the passengers and they wont be looking for the leewit at all i dont think letting them find hantis and pul is a good idea safeconduct or not you know smuggling them past any imperial security agents is what were supposed to do guess youre right captain i can try a shapechange on them except im still not really good enough at that to use any shape except one i already know well not and keep it up for more than maybe a minute like i did when i made myself and leewit look like hantis and pul on the worm world but any shape like that might also be in imperial records what about noshape goth could bend light around herself so she was invisible got to do that to yourself goth shook her head regretfully its too bad i cant do an ageshift yet like toll and threbus can pausert scratched his chin dubiously a youngeror olderhantis and pul would still look like a nartheby sprite and a grikdog that was too close for comfort still what about this could you do a shapechange that imitates an ageshift youd still be working with shapes you know well just changing their age that might be enough to fool the imperials if we combined it with disguises goth thought about it for a moment then smiled i think so thats a good idea captain well have to hope so i dont see anything better in the time weve got the imperials should be in boarding range in a few minutes you go and talk to hantis and explain things what about the leewit can look after myself scowled the leewit gray eyes peering up at him from under lowered brows so long as you keep that smelly little vatch away the captain couldnt rell the little silvereyed piece of klathablackness anywhere even if he couldnt detect it though he suspected it was still around somewhere i bet you can brat he rumpled the leewits hair which she hated and ducked around the doorway before she could purse her lips to form one of her supersonic whistles she could literally bust machinery with them back in the control room he found vezzarn returning from the nova guns theyre all ready captain they might be old but i wouldnt want to have them fire on me at this short range even if those are cruisers lets sight them on the nearest of the imperials it might remind them of their manners the little old spacer gave a crooked smile i kind of figured on that captain ive been tracking them in with the rear turret i reckon we could bring the forward turret to bear too once theyre alongside do that the communicator buzzed insistently it was commodore fleser of the isn malorn captain pausert you will deflect your guns from my ship he demanded angrily commodore fleser replied pausert in an even tone of voice weve had a lot of pirate trouble we do not in fact have any proof you are who you say you are so our guns will stay locked onto your vessel before we open our airlock well put the lockbar in place and seal up the access codes make a false move and you wont have a command any more at this rangeyou might destroy us but well take you with us the imperial officer looked like he was going to explode himself over and out said pausert before the man had a chance to reply what fun squeaked the vatch pausert groaned that was one complication he could have lived without you agree our papers are in order said pausert stiffly you are welcome to inspect our cargo none of our passengers or crew even resemble these descriptions and holoplates he handed back the pictures of goth the nartheby sprite hantis and the grikdog pul youve been misinformed and sent on a wildgoose chase commodore pausert was trying to keep calm to him the air in the cabin practically reeked of vatch he could rell that little quicksilvereyes in here somewhere bulldogfaced commodore fleser in his blueblack goldbraided uniform of course would not be able to see the vatch but he wouldnt be immune to its mischief at the moment the officer was rather off his stride knowing his vessel was locked by electromagnetic hull clamps into a deathgrip with the venture that could change in a vatchinspired instant though from what the commodore had said the imperials wanted karres witches even more than the supposed criminal hantis we have specific orders from iss headquarters said fleser equally stiffly to stop this ship they are absolutely certain you have these miscreants aboard pausert hoped the imperial commodore took the sudden widening of his eyes for a reaction to the mention of the dreaded imperial interservice security and not to the glass of water that the captain could see slowly lofting from his desk he shrugged go right ahead and search commodore but ill be making an official complaint to duke abelisson the empress comptroller the vatch was quite capable of creating trouble just for the fun of it likely to in fact vatches regarded human space as little more than an aspect of their dreams and they regarded people as dreamedup pieces in their games it hardly mattered to them what happened to the pieces when the game got boring the imperial hadnt seen the glass he turned towards the hatch humph my men will conduct a thorough search and pausert practically pushed him through it well you must see to them then a good commander always leads from the front sir let us take you to it water trickled down pauserts back there had to be some way of dealing with the little menace chapter sedmon the sixth daal of uldunesometimes called sedmon of the six lives by the witches of karreslistened silently to the communicator relaying the subradio report from his agent on emris sedmon bit his knuckle sedmon patted him on the back sedmon sighed in sympathy the fourth sedmon flicked the screen controls to show the star maps of the route between emris and the regency of haile the other two sedmons continued looking out of the oneway windows of the western tower of the mighty house of thunders the ancient castle in the highlands south of uldunes capital city of zergandol they knew what the others were doing and thinking anyway ruling the web of power hierarchies and fierce business interests that made up the former pirate planet of uldune was no sinecure in fact it would have been too much for most humans but the hexaperson was the best six people for the job the telepathically linked clones spoke only because words helped formalize their shared thoughts also it was a good habit whichever one was on public duty that day would have to speak to ordinary people a nartheby sprite it would help if we could contact the wisdoms of karres karres has done its disappearing trick again unfortunately no idea where or why none but the rumor of the worm world having destroyed them is almost certainly a falsehood emanating from the iss pausert is in great danger however the agandars fleet are certainly in hot pursuit the sedmon left unsaid the fact that captain pausert being in danger meant that a certain member of his crew was in danger also they all knew that they also knew that it had surprised them to discover just how upsetting that was not to mention the iss unfortunate about the subradio beeper it has been policy to have it fitted to all ships assuming new personalities here for near on a century it is the first time it has served us so ill the fact that the agandars pirates had discovered it and that the late jonalo had sold the information to the imperials is unfortunate but that is where things stand we must make the best of it were going to have to take action ourselves i suppose we are the only one we can trust two of the hexaperson got up and went to the door it was unnecessary to discuss the mission and who would go or to bid the others farewell they all knew that the nanite plague had to be stopped the other four would have to manage without them the sedmons ship thunderbird did not look like the vessel belonging to a wealthy powerful planetary ruler but then it wasnt supposed to the ship did have a number of features that were unusual even for a fullsize battleship and simply unthinkable in a scruffylooking cargo tramp right now what it had that was important was speed and also a subradio tracker fixed to the frequency of a certain signature transmission given out by the engines of the venture even at this range the signal and direction indicators were giving readouts emris the world from which the venture had lifted was three dangerous weeks travel from uldune across the zone of space called the chaladoor to go around took the better part of a year however the ventures course headed her inward towards the empires heart at a tangent which the sedmons ship could intersect in little more than two months the hexaperson could only hope that that would be soon enough chapter a full platoon of imperial marines were busy with the search they were being impeded at full volume by the leewit the marines did not know quite how to deal with this miniature empress in a lacy girls partydress the leewit looked to be a little blond girl of somewhere between three and four with her stuffed fluffy stifflegged toy puppy under one arm she stood in the center of the cabin and berated them at the top of her voice how dare they make such a mess of her room her nursemaid was stooped over as she had been since the marines entered trying to put everything in order she was a skinny old woman with sharp features wearing a baggy ships suit her head was covered in something like a turban even her ears and eyebrows if any of the marines had noticed something oddly young looking about the nursemaids very large grassgreen eyes the ruckus being caused by the leewit had distracted their attention commodore fleser looked at the carnage he turned to the saluting sergeant what happened here he demanded the nco gestured helplessly honest sir i dont know it was like this when we came in i swear was not squealed the leewit her accusing finger swept across the squad of marines they did it my best stateroom bellowed pausert there is going to be trouble about this i gave you permission to search not to destroy the place we have to find the criminal and the witch we will take whatever steps we need to but even fleser looked a bit aghast at the paintsplattered walls and the tumbled furniture and i will lodge an official complaint with duke abelisson be sure of it another one pausert scowled ferociously miss seltzer take the young lady into the empty stateroom next door you have finished with that one sergeant er yessir one moment said the bulldogfaced fleser these people he pointed to the leewit with her stuffed toy and the nursemaid pausert just hoped he didnt put a hand on them goths lightshift illusions didnt stand up to touch they are not listed by the officials at green galaine who are they captain pausert looked at the sergeant and his marines i will explain commodore but confidentially please it is an imperial matter the commodore drew himself up i am an officer of the imperial space navy sir you can trust me good said pausert cheerfully then ill reserve it for your ears only sergeant escort miss seltzer and her charge next door please to his horror he began to rell vatch again vatcherly there is a good explanation he added goth cloaked in noshape would rell the vatch also but hantis might not be able to best give her some warning that mischief was around all but the commodore and one rather slimylooking individual in plain black coveralls left pausert looked questioningly at the man and you are this is micher said the commodore imperial interservice security ah now i understand pauserts tone was decidedly frosty what i have to say is not for his ears commodore this is my assignment said the iss man in a rather whiny voice pausert knew the type a bully to those below him and a bootlicker to those above there was something odd about him though pausert couldnt quite put his finger on it but the man gave him an uneasy feeling i have orders from the regional chief of imperial security about this commodore said pausert firmly goodbye micher micher blinked but my orders the commodore propelled him firmly out of the door and closed it now what is this about pausert whatever it is the iss is not going to like it his expression made clear his own low opinion of the iss fleser was an officer in imperial service and thus had to put up with them yet here was pausert ostensibly on imperial service himself chasing them away the commodore was plainly fascinated by such apparently contradictory behavior pausert glanced uneasily at the door this is strictly between ourselves commodore a very important imperial ladys honor hangs on it now the commodores curiosity looked about ready to sit up and beg of course you can trust me pausert did his best to look even more uneasy it wasnt hard ask yourself just how a nursemaid and a child could get onto a ship in green galaine without being on any passenger list commodore without being observed by security cameras in total secret just who has the influence to do that it was the commodores turn to look uneasy something like that could be organized captain but not to keep it secret from the iss they have agents everywhere pausert bit his lip and said nothing just raised his eyebrows and drew the charter and seal of haile out of his pouch tapped it meaningfully the commodores mouth fell open you mean the iss doesnt handle quite everything the royal familys security is handled by but i never said a word commodore fleser and if you take my advice you wont either the little girl is very imperious though isnt she he smiled allowing the commodore to put his own interpretation on that smile the iss is very jealous about the situation speaking personally id be quite happy to hand the whole thing over to them the girls a little monster frankly i dont doubt for an instant that your marines were just grossly slandered he drew himself up stiffly however thats not my decisionnor yoursand duty is what it is but thats what this is all about commodore not some hogwash about mythical witches of karres and criminals the iss is trying to cause embarrassment within a pregnant pause here designed to make the commodore even more uneasy certain quarters someone knocked and then entered the stateroom without waiting for a reply it was the security agent his moist eyes were alive with suspicion a message for you commodore the chief engineer from the malorn has come across he insists on seeing you the iss agent looked as if he would have liked to kiss the engineer hes waiting wont let me pass the message on as he spoke the burly engineer gave up waiting and came in anyway commodore the malorns air recycler is not working he said bluntly even captain pausert was stunned by this news air recyclers never failed never they were the most reliable piece of equipment on any ship without them space travel would be impossible the commodore looked as if someone had kicked his legs out from under him all the bulldoggy bluster was gone in an instant can you fix it he asked the chief engineer looked at him gloomily its mostly solidstate engineering sir thats why they dont go wrong ive got my men busy stripping what can be stripped but we cant get to a lot of it he took off his cap and ran fingers through closecropped gray hair the auxiliary plant is running sir but you know that only gives us thirtysix hours at least they had a standby of some sort thought pausert but of course military craft did have in case of combatdamage the venture didnt suitbottles he said thinking back to his own military training with the nikkeldepain space navy youve got marines on board they must have aircylinders at least a couple of hours each and the other cruisers must have the same the engineer looked gratefully at him i hadnt thought of that we could transfer all but a skeleton crew to the other ships too the commodore nodded were still six days from base well have to move sergeant harris he bellowed the sergeant came at a run blythe rifle at the ready sir he took in the scene and realized that he wasnt being called to arrest anyone or shoot it out with a dangerous criminal he lowered the barrel of the rifle round up your men and get them back onto the malorn at the double but the search protested the iss man the witches must have done this thats enough of that rubbish snapped the commodore move micher before i leave you behind im not abandoning my new command for the isss bit of spite besides if these socalled witches can put my air recycler out of order then i certainly dont want to fight with them unfortunately the sergeant had left open the door leading to the next cabin as they passed by in the corridor pausert got another scent of sunlight and the sound of violets he glanced in and saw that the little vatch was hereand was playing lightshift with the leewits head making it look like she was wearing an imperial crown even more unfortunately the commodore had glanced through the floor also fleser stopped in his tracks that enough fooling around my little lady said pausert sternly he shouldered the commodore aside and stalked into the cabin obscuring flesers view that thing is supposed to stay out of sight pausert readied his klatha hooks for the little brute even if he couldnt catch it he could maybe squelch it long enough behind him he heard the commodore mutter something it sounded like glad i dont have to deal with the spoiled flesers heavy footsteps led away down the corridor pausert sighed with relief alas his klatha hooks once again seemed to be able to nothing worse than reduce the little vatch to giggles a few moments later the outer locks clanged when captain pausert arrived back in the control room the communicator beebled insistently the commodores red face was glaring at him damnation pausert can you deflect your guns oh yes certainly good luck commodore after pausert deflected the guns he saw that the vatchy patch of darkness was now above the coffee dispenser in the control room what was it going to do this time he began the klathareach it darted away ive got to go big dream thing but ill be back back baaaack that was really not what he needed to hear but at least he could see in the screens that the imperial flotilla was receding quite rapidly in fact i hope he said to the indentation on the couch that youll give them back their piece of air recycler that was cruel i think you frightened the commodore out of ten years of life being stuck in deep space without air is enough to terrify anyone ive teleported it back already when they try it again itll be working and it served them right you told some awful fibs he tried to look innocent just false suggestions the commodore fooled himself goth laughed just so long as the leewit doesnt find out she was supposed to have imperial blood shes already impossible just like that little vatch he grimaced that had been a near thing and the vatch hadnt even been trying to create mischief it had said it would be back without a doubt it would return at the worst possible moment goth appeared out of noshape theyre hunting for us pretty hard captain she said seriously yes its not what threbus led to me expect i guess this must be more important than they told us said goth biting a strand of hair the captain took it gently out of her mouth i guess youre right girl and i dont like being kept in the dark the leewit and the grikdog trotted into the control room pul was looking even more sourfaced than usual my legs are still stiff growled the grikdog posture like thats unnatural you complain sneered the leewit try holding yourself up sometime pretending youre a third your real size im the one had to do all the work fatso that information said the nartheby sprite making a small moue and wrinkling her foxy brows is available strictly on a needtoknow basis and i dont think you need to know captain well i beg to disagree snapped pausert and as the captain of this ship pausert felt something close on his leg just firmly but with a hint of immense unused strength shall i gnaw his leg off hantis asked the grikdog out of the corner of his mouth do that and ill swing you around my head by your tail pul said goth crossly the captain has to know what hes dealing with hantis even if you dont tell him everything you have to tell him something the nartheby sprite laughed musically and twitched her long pointed ears very well to save my puls tail and the captains leg i will tell you some of it not all of it mind i cant there is a mindblock so i dont remember parts of it and wont until i speak to the empress it cant even be tortured out of me we grikdogs bite people who swing us by the tail gruffed pul he had however released the captains leg and the look he gave goth was a tad uneasy lets just have the story said the captain peaceably but it goes no further than you and goth understand we dont want to cause alarm and panic that would serve them better than us i give you my word very well she sat down arranged her graceful legs and began my kind are the last remnant of an old old civilization nartheby is our homeworld where almost all of our kind now live but once we roamed widely even to your yarthe itself there are stories about our people visitingalthough as you were a young and developing culture we largely left you alone then we were afflicted by a plague it wrecked our culture our colonies and our star travel we only saved ourselves by retreating to nartheby and destroying any ships that came near our world for a period of five centuries then it appeared that the danger was over but the only sprites that survived were on nartheby she pinched her fine nostrils now the plague has resurfaced it is spreading fast through the empire pausert and goth stared at her the captain was the first to find his tongue but surely we shouldnt be keeping it a secret we should be quarantining the infected areas hantis had always seemed to be smiling now as she shook her head she just looked sad its not that kind of plague captain thats what we thought it was too at first its an invasion the invaders are just very small although weve never determined their exact nature they are at least partly klatha creatures and seem to have a collective mind they attack the way a plague would but theyre intelligent they invade a host breed billions of operatives and then take over their hosts and control them no quarantine can stop an intelligent disease does karres know of this asked goth hantis nodded yes thats why theyve gone into hiding there are no karres witches out in the empire at all right now except those on this ship but why demanded pausert why have they just run off and left us to deal with this hantis shook her head they havent but they have to be very careful the nanite plague feeds on and uses klatha energy klatha energies are also the only way to fight them that makes karres and her witches the greatest danger in human space to the nanites theyve been trying to get karres destroyed so karres is preparing a number of defensesbut after the fight with the worm world theyre pretty battered goth nodded threbus and maleen both kind of hinted at this so what is it you have to do hantis yes agreed pausert why is getting you to the empress haile so important because of pul pul him captain pausert looked at the bluefurred animal with its impressive mouthful of teeth hantis patted the grikdog affectionately yes grikdogs were bred to smell out nanite exudates pul here can tell if someone has been infested no nartheby sprite would ever consider leaving home without one and i can tell you that iss agent from the imperial cruiser had been invaded and taken over growled pul it was all i could do not to bite him grikdog fangs can inject a venom that kills nanites unfortunately it kills the host too and also takes quite a long time hantis looked even sadder which means that anyone who is infected cant be saved pausert felt very cold suddenly the empress haile is going on her procession through her territories and dependencies soon weve learnedsuspect at leastthat there is a nanite plot designed to reach fruition when she returns to the imperial capital it is essential that pul and i get there before then unfortunately the nanites have obviously taken over some of our own agents they know who i am and where we are going they will stop at nothing to prevent us from getting there chapter captain that fleet is still following us said vezzarn worriedly theyd be out of detector range if you hadnt had that new stuff fitted on uldune captain pausert looked at the small blips on the detector screen one large and fifteen smaller spots of light traveling in formation the fleet was still outside the range of the visual screens he wished he could see them lets try stepping up the powerslowly so it isnt obviousand changing vector slightly this is the most direct route to the sheris system it is possible that they arent actually following us i suppose two hours later they were able to say for certain the fleet was following them moreover the fleet could also follow them despite their slow increase in speed to the ventures maximum i dont like it goth i think you and the leewit should get ready to use the sheewash drive said pausert finally getting rid of their followers was worth the risk goth nodded good idea captain lets lose them while we can ill go and get the leewit and i am going back to my cabin announced vezzarn witchstuff made the old spacer nervous if it couldnt be explained in terms of spacetime physics he wanted to be elsewhere when it was happening a few minutes later a globe of orange fire danced above some twisted black wires in the control cabin outside the viewscreens showed that space suddenly blurred captain pausert eyed the process with interest during the ventures last voyage vezzarn hulik do eldel and laes yangowho had also gone by the name of the agandar and had commanded a fleet of pirates that were fast becoming a navyhad all wanted to steal the sheewash drive they had all thought that it was something technological and could be stolen what they hadnt known was that it didnt work without a witch all they had known was that it was really really fast the sheewash drive wasnt something pausert had mastered yet and with klatha powers you had to be ready or you could get hurt you could even be killedor as one witch had said darkly worse pausert wasnt prepared to contemplate what worse could mean though sometimes he had uneasy images of being turned insideout for trying but the pattern of the sheewash seemed to be almost in his grasp the two witch sisters kept it up for about a minute but that would be enough to make the venture disappear from tracking screens as the wire collapsed and the globe of orange fire winked out of existence the captain was already setting another coursevector and pulling the engines back to normal cruising speeds this detour would avoid their next scheduled stop the sheris system and take them on a rather odd tangent to the alpha dendi stars instead that was quite a dense cluster which ships in a hurry avoided there was a lot of intersolar dust there and that would make visual tracking difficult captain pausert relaxed and went to fix the two young witches some food using klatha energies especially for something as powerful as the sheewash drive left the young witches exhausted and starving so it had to be used judiciously neither goth nor the leewit could do the sheewash drive again too soon it was two days later just as they were entering the first of the dustveils around the alpha dendi cluster when hulik do eldel paged the captain he got up and still sleepy headed into the control room vezzarn told me about our followers captain she pointed an elegant finger at the detectorscreen there was one large and fifteen smaller blips in the same formation looks like theyre still behind us pausert blinked at them this was only a couple of hours into his sleep period and he wasnt at his brightest it certainly looked like the same pattern but how could the imperials possibly have caught up with them or even followed them at all shall i try hailing them captain pausert shrugged tiredly and flopped into the command chair it cant do any harm i suppose but i dont think theyre chasing after us to buy councilor rapports tinklewood fishingpoles there was no response on the empire general beamlength but as hulik flicked the dials they picked up a jabber of some unknown language shiptoship communication over there i think said hulik theyve obviously forgotten to switch over to narrow beam pausert had already hit the ships intercom what is it captain goth we need the leewits translation skills down here fast weve got ships on our tail and theyre talking to each other on broadbeam were coming im recording captain said hulik also trying to get visuals but theyre at long range goth and the leewit tumbled into the control room the leewit besides her equipmentshattering whistles was also a klathatranslator she could instantly translate any language even robot and machine tongues she started immediately they say tubes overhot this pace very much longer cannot be kept to she paused before continuing obviously only the communication officer of the ship in trouble with its tubes had forgotten to set his equipment to narrow beam they were only getting half the conversation the one who spoke earlier says it matters not if their tubes blow they will get none of the agandars loot anyway she paused again oh he says he hopes beelzit im not going to translate that filthy mind should wash his mouth out with soap she reached for the transmitterswitch without a doubt to give the comofficer a lesson hastily captain pausert slapped his hand over it easy now lets save it they dont know we know their shipchannel that could be useful the leewit scowled at him spose so she said reluctantly but i was looking forward to it that was really filthy hulik shook her head in amazement the agandars loot but what loot captain did he leave anything on the ship pausert tried to think well there was his personal gear and the crate the sheem robot was in we dumped the crate i think his gear is stashed in the corner of the hold with a few bales of unsold cargo ive got a few of those educational toys some tinklewood fishing poles and those allweather cloaks left over from the cargo i loaded on nikkeldepain he saw that hulik goth and the leewit were all heading for the door go and look then he said crossly itll be nothing more than his clothes and toiletries you cant hide a ton of loot in a couple of holdalls he did raid the star diamond concession on coolums world pointed out hulik goth grinned at the captain i remember wansing that crook of a jeweler you rescued me from on porlumma talking about it they found some topquality stones there as big as your head and if you do find them there ill return them to their owners he called after them irritably there were times that he felt at a distinct disadvantage being an honest man then he rather determinedly turned to face the screens again the twenty or so suns in the cluster marked on the charts were never all visible at one time planetoids asteroids and intersolar dust hung in gravitywhirled skeins it was the captain admitted the perfect place for an ambush hed been planning on being wellslept and alert when they went into it but thanks to huliks call when shed spotted the following ships and the excitement that followed with searching the agandars gear hed never gotten it ha some treasure no alien crowns or headsize diamonds toiletries and clothes as hed predicted a few personal items the most exciting thing was a pack of cards with handpainted facecards that the leewit had appropriated to play with the captain supposed that it was all right for her to do so after all the late agandar still owed him for damages his warrobot had done to the ship a pack of cards was a pretty cheap exchange what was worrying pausert far more was that theyd had to cut speed here in order to dodge all the spacedebris and theyd lost sight of the agandars fleet the captain had tried every dodge in the book to make sure that they werent actually being followed but the dust rocks and moonlets made this a perfect place for the enemy to hunt rather than the venture to hide the pirates had a number of ships to cover the possible routes through the lenticular cluster the captain had gambled on the most difficult route also being the one least likely for them to encounter an ambush so far hed been right but it was slow going and the trip was taking a toll on the ships crew even at reduced speed they had very little time to react to obstacles the ship simply couldnt run on automatic systems one of the senior shiphandlers either vezzarn or pausert himself had to be there pausert had been teaching goth and hulikeven when he could get her attention the leewitbut none of them were good enough yet for this kind of seatofyourpants flying with all the instant decisionmaking it took on the other hand the leewit was bidding fair to become a superb shot with the nova guns she seemed to have a gift for anticipation which considering her witch background could actually be real precognition starting to develop looking ahead pausert realized he might just need her gun skills that was definitely a ships drive registering on the detectors some of the agandars fleet must have gotten in front of them perhaps taking a course that had less debris to avoid a few seconds later there was a second blip from the detector pausert decided hed had enough he was tired and angry the venture had her nova guns and more speed and maneuverability than they would expect he held to his course a third set of blips appeared that was too much in the maze of dustwalls and drifting asteroids and moonlets there had to be a way of avoiding the pirates the captain turned the venture running back the way they had come the detectors began squalling again more ships this time coming up the ventures course i thought space was supposed to be empty groused pausert hitting the communicator switch weve got bandits with all the obstacles the sheewash drive couldnt get them out of trouble but using it for a few seconds could make a lot of difference to their success in evading their enemies an opportunity in the shape of a lightsecondwide gap in the drifting debris presented itself off to the starboard the captain took it the ships had all been at extreme detector range they might still be able to lose the pursuing bandits its impossible wherever we go they seem to follow us or get there before we do it is almost as if they know our vectors and theyre anticipating us hulik do eldel grimaced captain i think we must have a leech a leech imperial security hooks them onto suspicious ships if they get a chance i suspect these pirates must have got hold of one and put it onto the ventures hull somewhere its a simple subradio transmitter all they have to do is follow their signalstrength indicators how do we find it and get rid of it we search the outside of the ship pausert chewed on his lip which we cant really do while were running and we cant stop running because theyre nearly on top of us vezzarn looked thoughtful i could use the spare communicator unit and a couple of directional aerials to pinpoint it captain when we get the chance he added a bit lamely the communicator buzzed again empire hailing frequency commented goth not touching it want to talk to them captain pausert shrugged why not we might convince them to leave us alone if we drop the agandars gear out of an airlock he clicked the communicator on an officer in the uniform of the imperial space navy appeared in the screen this is isn patrol vessel saraband you are ordered to halt and be searched captain pausert gaped at the speaker then recovered not a chance pirate were not being fooled that easily the empire takes a hard line on those who impersonate her officers now it was the other mans turn to gape how dare you sir pausert snapped the communicator off that told the fraud where to get off except that was no fraud captain said hulik do eldel wryly i did my imperial security marksmanship course with that man he was a pompous prig then and it doesnt sound as if hes improved she smiled he was a terrible shot too lets hope that that hasnt improved either exclaimed the captain i suppose id better try and explain balls of purple fire exploded in space to portside i think its too late for that great patham those ships ahead are also firing on us captain goths eyes widened look at the size of that thing it must be the agandars flagship said pausert hastily programming in evasive action he boasted about how big it was its terrifying the crew of the imperial ships must have had a similar reaction a hasty what ship what ship came over the general hailing frequency that pausert had been about to use to call the isn saraband on the captain snapped his fingers what was that frequency that you got the shiptoship talk from the pirates g said hulik but pausert had already changed to it he put a hand on the leewits shoulder tell them it must be a trap an ambush that the quarry has led them into the empires clutches she nodded seizing the microphone and began jabbering away the captain recognized one word beelzit she said it with great satisfaction pausert had the feeling that it was just as well he couldnt translate or hed have had to go through a lot of kicking and biting to wash her mouth out with soap pausert wished hed managed a better landing the venture stood at an awkward angle on the icemoonlet which was now following its orbit away from the combat zone still things could be worse great patham theyre clumping well giving it to each other arent they said goth in delight the leewit pounded his shoulder see what i did she said proudly it was true enough when orders came pouring out of the agandars flagship shed added to them in the resulting confusion the firefight had spread between the pirates themselves as well as between the imperials and the pirates neat idea of yours landing here captain said vezzarn itll fool their massdetectors anyway and itll give us a chance to suit up and go out and look for this leech pausert rose to his feet just as soon as i know weve slipped away safely and dont need to blast off immediately hulik nodded they certainly seem to have lost us or lost interest in us it could be that the leech is one of the kind that doesnt have a powerpack and relies on drawing its current from the ship they used to use those once upon a time but they found it meant that they could lose ships coasting on inertia i guess id better suit up too ive placed a few leeches and i know what to look for how big are they miss do eldel the do eldel made motions with her hands about like this captainsay the size of three fists and theyre hullmetal color theyre usually put somewhere near the drive tubes where the area is too hot to spend long looking makes sense pausert looked at the viewscreens and detector array and it appears that we have one that relies on our power because we seem to have escaped notice the fight is definitely moving off wed better suit up take radiation meters and go hunting its going to be a big job but wed better leave vezzarn in the command chair and the leewit on the nova guns the rest of us can go out ahunting the leewit rubbed her hands in glee hope they find us pausert didnt feel that way about it at all there were an awful lot of ships out there the moonlet was made up of grayblue waterice imbedded with rock fragments the surface was jagged with impact craters and tricky to walk on being either uneven or glassy smooth with shards of sharp rock sticking up like daggers out of it true the suits were tough but if someone went sliding in among those rockswell those rockedges looked very sharp the rock seemed to be volcanic glass and there was no atmosphere here to erode the splintered edges pausert hulik and goth roped and suited made their way cautiously onto the surface from the ramp gravity was perhaps a hundredth of shipnormal they had to be careful not to make sudden moves or even to step too high as they edged their way cautiously along the hull the captain had a blaster at the ready it wasnt likely that the planetoid would have any dangers but the one thing humans had learned since leaving old yarthe was that life in space took myriad forms and cropped up in the most unexpected places however other than the fact that the surface was difficult to move on with low gravity and very little friction there were no problems only there seemed to be a trace of vatch around pausert could rell it somewhere though he couldnt say exactly where the thing was they searched patiently and carefully around the tubes suddenly the ground shuddered pausert fell they all did tumbling on the ice among blades of rock the airless space above the moonlet was full of flying shards too looking upwards as he spun across the ice the captain saw to his horror that the venture was toppling off her unstable landing point towards him he was on his back slithering and skidding helplessly closer the bulk of the hull would squash him like a bug there was a terrible helpless inevitability about it all the rope linking him with hulik and goth suddenly went taut hulik and goth wrapped around a stone monolith were hauling at it it was a small icelump moon theyd landed on there was not much gravity here the venture was falling over in a kind of ultraslow motion and hulik and goth were exerting a terrific pull on the rope a pull that would have dragged him on karres or nikkeldepain or even old yarthe here it sent him flying hurtling between the stone edges steering frantically with his feet and arms whizzing past goth and hulik and right up a steep ridge and into space the venture coughed the briefest flicker of her laterals vezzarn must have taken action to stop her fall he must have desperately weighed up frying them or crushing them pausert realized that his flight had had a rather unexpected consequence hed plucked the other two into space after him well there had been pretty little holding them down on the moonlet they were quite safe except they were going one direction and the venture and the moonlet and a number of asteroid fragments other directions theyd just have to use reaction pistols to get back then with a sickening feeling the captain realized it wasnt going to be that simple theyd set out to walk around the ventures hull walk not spacewalk still there should have been a reaction pistol at his belt there wasnt just a completely recoilless and useless blaster and the moonlet along with the venturewas proceeding on its merry way they were heading in the opposite direction three tiny sparklefigures in the vastness of space the vatch giggled what fun drifting away from them dark against the dust veils captain pausert saw three reaction pistols vatches thought of the human universe as a sort of dreamgame with humans as pieces the fun lay in challenging the pieces so there had to be a solution besides the little vatch seemed more inclined to mischief than anything more malicious goth seized the initiative the guns were well within her weight limit and she teleported them back the vatchlet squeaked indignation its not supposed to be that easy quick before it thinks of something else back to the ship the leech search was abandoned in their flight back to the venture pausert studied the screens it looks like our landing jarred this little moonlet a bit offcourse in a crowded zone of space like this it only takes a tiny fraction of a degree to cause other collisions wed better abandon the search because this iceball is almost bound to hit something else id like to take off before that happens and not after the leewit scowled captain i was listening in to the piratestheyd lost us but they picked up the signal the moment that vezzarn kicked the engines hulik bit her lip the leech must definitely draw its power from the ships drive then pausert shrugged we have to use them sometimes we could use the sheewash drive pointed out goth not all the time you and the leewit would get too tired and we couldnt use it very well here anyway in this part of space there are too many obstacles yes but we could hop for the edge of this cluster now even if they follow us theyre too far off to catch up before we get there and ohoh vatch it wasnt the little silvereyed mischief this time it was a much bigger vatch almost the size of big windy pausert wasnt surprised the venture had drawn much klatha force to her and vatches were attracted by klatha the captain had a feeling of big slitty eyes peering at them in delight he hastily formed the pattern in his mind of a vatch lock which would at least stop the creature reading his mind a blocked one and such a situation such potential and then go way mine mine the tiny vatch was not amused the words were almost glowing in pauserts mind you are far too young for this game puny one pausert could see the tiny blackness dancing in front of the greater bulk of nothingness am not theyre mine go way play your pathetic games elsewhere i am going to send these back the venture moved abruptly to the center of the conflict the hull shuddered and rang like a bell as the venture took a hit with an effort of will pausert forced himself to ignore the terrifying noise and formed his klatha hooks he reached for the bigger vatch hooking great lines of force into it and pinning it down the internal spinning maelstrom of blackness seethed it began yowling yaaah the monster the vatch desperately strained against the bonds the captain pulled out pieces of it flinging them at the pirate vessels let me go let me go i begthis is killing me pausert thought sternly at the squalling creature we need to be outside this cluster do that and you can be free the venture knew a moment of disturbed reality which left them sitting outside the cluster can i go pleaded the creature this hurts dream creature i have done nothing to you yet said pausert but be gone and dont come back the captain reeled in his klatha hooks and the big vatch fled bravo the little one squeaked triumphantly go you bully and dont come back the big vatch didnt pause to reply in fact it fled in such haste that the captain was left with a whirling black fragment of vatch stuff still attached to the klatha hooks well from previous experience pausert knew that this stuff could be useful it could be set to work the little vatch moved towards it the vatches could reabsorb the stuff at will though pieces also seemed to survive outside of them mine said pausert suppose so said the little vatch amiably this is fun big dream thing the big ones always chase me away now ive got you all to myself pausert wondered if he should have waited just a little bit longer weve got trouble still captain vezzarn said wringing his cap in his hands that hit we took straight bad luck sir it damaged the outer airlock were losing pressure its a slow leak but a steady one well never reach a planet with atmosphere to set down on before we asphyxiate or before the other ships catch up with us goth pointed back at the cluster its time for the sheewash drive captain pausert could only nod chapter the two sedmons looked at each other thoughtfully the choice of courses available to captain pausert from the alpha dendi cluster were just too numerous without some sort of clue to guide the sedmons ship they would have difficulty in guessing the best interception course if the venture had made it out of the alpha dendi cluster the signal had stopped then briefly just for a second it had registered again there had been nothing since of course pausert might be using the witches of karres to move the ship or pausert might really be a witch himself when the venture had come to uldune the sedmons had been of the opinion that captain pausert and goth were threbus and toll doing an ageshift when the agent on green galaine on emris had later reported threbus and toll meeting pausert and goth the sedmons had realized that they had been mistaken but it was still not clear if pausert was a karres witch himself or not it seemed as if the captain was nothing more than a citizenwith a price on his head to be surefrom a small and stuffy republic called nikkeldepain but the witches could do that kind of substitution very successfully you couldnt trust superficial appearances when dealing with them and now the sedmons realized they had a problem even when they were far off well have to go to the alpha dendi system just to check itll lose us time cant be helped i think wed better try to slow them down if theyre ahead somehow they still bank with the daals bank back on uldune we could intervene there that could be a bit awkward for pausert we could set it up so that when credit checks are run the account comes up as requiring our clearance well that would make for a delay which is what we want after all subradio messages were sent the sedmons ship turned to the alpha dendi cluster chapter above the twisted truncated cone of black wires a ball of orange fire danced captain pausert looked intently at it wishing not for the first time that generating it was one of his klatha powers but his klatha abilities had been slowly developing growing and changing almost as hed needed them perhaps one of these days he would draw this skill from inside his mind too squinting with concentration he looked at the sheewash drive on the floor between the two young karres witches the pattern almost made sense almost the wires fell inward and the ball of fire winked out goth pushed back her brown fringe and blinked tiredly at him whats up captain came to see how you were doing said pausert carefully he didnt want his worry to upset them the leewit scowled fiercely were not it feels like were pushing this crate through clumping toffee goth nodded its not like anything weve encountered before captain its as if the venture was as big as a dreadnaught she just seems to be dragging a whole weight of klatha force pausert checked the readings so it seems were doing about twice our normal drive speed but nothing like the velocity weve gotten under the sheewash drive before i wonder whats wrong you arent feeding us enough said the leewit grumpily i need breakfast pausert waved at the door its waiting for you how is the oxygen supply holding out captain asked goth getting slowly to her feet that wasnt like goth she was normally as lithe and springy as a junglemiffel pausert shrugged weve done what we can to the lock but the seals are damaged beyond repair theyll have to be replaced so we have another thirty hours or so we should make it at this rate but not with a lot to spare the sheewash drive had brought them this far far far from the pursuit in the crowded space of the alpha dendi cluster goth and the leewit had taken three bursts at it but the two little witches were exhausted the leewit had actually fallen asleep during the last session which seemed to have severely sapped goth but now even if goth and the leewit had been in a fit state to do it they could go no closer to planetfall without advertising the sheewash drive they really didnt need to show that ability to all and sundry in this region of the spiral arm so despite the leaking airlock they would have to proceed by more conventional means of course that meant that those who followed by the leechs signals would be able to get on their trail again pausert just hoped hed have a chance to find and detach the device on their next planetfall on the world of pidoon if they could get in do repairs fuel up get rid of the leech and head out before the pirates caught up with them theyd show them all a clean pair of heels pidoon was a busy trading hub with a number of landing ports set into its rolling plains in fierce competition with each other the planet didnt have a lot to offer except for being conveniently on the way to everywhere and having a good supply of raw materials for rocketfuel manufacture it was a sort of filling station and trading depot hulik goth and the captain peered at the map on the screen hulik pointed if we land here at gerota town its just big enough to justify a single iss operative he or she will be a nohoper farmed out somewhere they cant do too much harm the major cities will have dozens of operatives and one of the smaller places is more likely to be watched here wed just have one to deal with its a popular choice for that reason sir vezzarn said wryly i went there twice when my former boss wanted more information on one of the smuggling routes its a small city with nothing but a lot of prairie for a thousand miles all round it the customs officials are so sleepy they put pillows on their desks sounds good to me eh goth goth wrinkled her forehead she should have been asleep pausert knew but something was plainly troubling her i wish we had someone who could premote she said uneasily i wish we didnt have to land at all but weve got to pausert pointed at the fuel readout which was distressingly close to empty im afraid were quite low on choices around here now he pointed to the display charts within range before we run out of recyclable air theres pidoon or theres the dictat of telmarand every second person there is supposed to be a spy or right on the edge of our fuel range never mind air imperial sector headquarters pidoon does so well because this sector of space is quite empty of habitable worlds what about this one goth pointed to the chart and a beacon number right on the margin it was out of their way but within range the captain called up the star map there was just one habitable world on that beacon in among a cluster of red dwarfs and dead suns vaudevillia he read hulik began to chuckle whats so funny asked vezzarn who had stepped across to check some readouts they were suggesting going to vaudevillia said hulik trying to smother her laughter vezzarn grinned your home this nikkeldepain place is pretty far away eh captain i threatened to run away to vaudevillia when i was ten said hulik its the circusworld captain pausert all the old showboats go there pausert blinked just one of the fabulous lattice ship showboats had ever come to nikkeldepain in his youth he could still remember it clearly however it had seemed so bright and so wild and exciting compared to life on stuffy nikkeldepain hed thought of running away to join the show himself the nikkeldepain council had turned down the next ones landing permit apparently a number of councilors had lost quite a lot of money when the first one had abruptly departed vezzarn grimaced especially when theyre broke no port chargesbecause there is no proper port mind you its a bad place to try to buy fuel captain cash money only and at a twentyfive percent premium the fuelsellers have had so many bad debts they wont provide fuel on any other terms it sounds very romantic to kids but believe me captain its a dump its barely habitable cant even grow its own food and it rains nonstop the captain looked at goth who was looking very speculative well were not going there and we dont need to tell the leewit about this place do we lets stick to pidoon and this gerota town goth shrugged im too tired but it doesnt feel right gerota town was seedy and rundown not the kind of place youd want to buy a used flyer in said vezzarn with a sly grin the captain looked at the shabby sprawl of two and threestory buildings that stretched out towards a flat horizon its a whistlestop for us so long as the fuel is okay and we can find that leech and do some repairs on the airlock within the day we should be out of here they soon found out that this was not to be the case the fuel available in gerota town was empire standard but captain pausert could you please come across to our offices asked the elegantly coiffured platinumblond secretary of pidoon fuels and lubricants there was a faint furrow between her brows and her tone was quite unlike her earlier obsequious one goth looked tiredly at the captain and rubbed her nose tip feels like trouble captain probably papers that need filling in i dont think so said goth rubbing her eyes now ill go with you youre exhausted ill take the leewit she slept the last bit goth nodded ten minutes later captain pausert and his towheaded niece walked towards the cluster of offices at port control above them the sky was a cloudless and chilly blue their reception in the offices of pidoon fuels and lubricants was even colder the secretary ushered them in to a sumptuous office from behind the flamewood desk a man with a baggy face glowered at them he didnt bother to stand up captain pausert there seems to be some problem with your banking account pausert leaned over the halfacre of flamewood desk i happen to know that account is at least a half million maels in the black sir if you dont want our business well take it elsewhere not on pidoon you wont said the jowlfaced executive grimly weve already put out a credit warning to the other companies in case you took off and put in a landing elsewhere but were very solvent jowlface leaned back in his formfit chair it groaned quietly in protest oh youve got the money all right but your account is blocked you cant draw as much as a single mael of those illgotten gains pausert gaped illgotten gains dont try to come the innocent with us captain pausert jowlface smirked triumphantly cocking his head hearing something outside it sounded suspiciously like the squeal of groundcar tires the iss informed the pidoon police of your nefarious crimes we were told to delay you here as long as possible i have electronically locked the door and i have a blaster here he raised a glassite from beneath the desk dont even think of attempting to escape there were shouts outside thatll be the troopers now the leewit gave an earsplitting whistle just as someone pounded on the outer door yelling open up in the name of the law an entirely satisfactory shattering of glass and small electronic components followed that whistle jowlface looking in alarm at the trickle of dust flowing from where his blasters trigger mechanism had been just moments before pressed a remote doorkey frantically smoke curled up from the button havta break it down sergeant bellowed the voice outside pausert realized just how right goths feelings had been the captain hauled the jowled executive out of his seat is there another way out he demanded the man had gone from unpleasant triumph to quivering terror since hed discovered that he was trappedand now disarmedin here with the two of them he had a lot of jaw to tremble it made his speech unintelligible but they could follow the shaking pointed finger to the door beside the cabinets while the shoulders of pidoons finest pounded against the managers office door pausert and the leewit crammed their way out of the bathroom window it was only after the captain had landed awkwardly on his feet that he realized that the leewit wasnt whistling or calling a warning because she was too busy biting an oversized uniformed mans hand and there were ten more of them in the alleyway bruised with a swelling eye and a bloody nose gagged and with his hands forcecuffed the captain sat between two huge guards in the back of the groundcar hed seen the leewit similarly gagged and forcecuffed dragged kicking into the second vehicle they seemed to be heading out across the landing field back towards the venture the two vehicles pulled up beside the venture along with a third transporter which was painted in the colors of the imperial customs and immigration inspectorate one seldom had trouble with them deep inside the empire but their orangeandgray vehicles always inspired caution the pidoon troopers threw open the doors of the groundcars and pushed the prisoners out march them in front of us snapped the customs official the agandars accomplices are desperate men but theyre not likely to shoot his chief lieutenant clearly imperial interservice security had woven quite a net of lies around them the leewits eyes were as wide with outrage as pausert felt his mouth would like to be if he hadnt been gagged he noticed that the troopers while making the leewit into a very small human shield were being extremely careful to keep their shins away from her obviously someone in the venture was watching the damaged airlock opened thats spacegun damage said one of the customs men pointing to the ragged burn in the hullmetal this is the ship were after all right they paused waiting for the ramp to finish extending better keep her out here snapped one official pointing at the leewit we dont want to end up as captives and hostages on their ship the leewit managed to kick two of the policemen and very nearly squirmed free but she was pushed back into one of the groundcars and pausert had to continue into the venture without her they were met by goth hulik and vezzarn the captains heart fell when he saw goth hed been hoping shed have hidden in noshape what is going on sirs asked hulik were acting on information received said the customs official who seemed to be in charge seize them we need to conduct a thorough search for the other two you cant do this protested hulik we have rights and this ship is acting under charter from the empress hailie the official tapped the folder under his arm your little fraud has gone on long enough we have information that this ship was involved in setting up an ambush of an imperial patrol in the alpha dendi system as part of the pirate fleet of the infamous agandar honest officer we had nothing to do with that said vezzarn it was an accident we were just caught up in the middle of it and got our ship damaged look at our crew sir no desperados a couple of children a young woman and me im just an old spacer sirs not a pirate shut your gab snapped the official forcecuff these peoples hands and search the ship bring them with us i want to observe them closely for any possible reactions i want every conceivable place searched and all personnel seized the customs man in his orangeandgray uniform saluted smartly as his men hastily grabbed goth vezzarn and hulik do eldel yessir this will put gerota town on the map this is our lucky day captain pauserts heart sank closer to his boots this certainly wasnt his lucky day no matter what shape change goth had managed on pul and hantis theyd be hauled out of here if only he could talk to goth they were shepherded along the ventures passages as the customs men displayed their expertise they inspected absolutely everything vibrosensors probing the walls for hidden chambers the officers peering everywhere even into drawers too small to hide an infant let alone a person at length they came to the stateroom which the nartheby sprite had occupied with her grikdog there was no sign of either hantis or pul but the customs men began with searching under the beds chairs and cupboards something the captain felt was odd about this room it was only when he glanced upwards that he realized what it was the elegant central lightfittings were offcenter the room was not quite the right shape goth must be creating an illusionary bulkhead pausert did his level best not to look at the wall but what would it help goths illusions could fool the eye but the vibrosensors in the custom inspectors hands would see right through them so to speak the inspectors began on the first wall when they reached the end of it pausert saw goth calmly nudge hulik the do eldel stepped with all her weight on one spikeheeled foot onto the toes of the obnoxious customs officer hulik do eldel was a slimly built aristocraticlooking woman it was still a lot of weight to concentrate on one small square halfinch of heel yow the customs officer yelled and pushed her off huliks look of surprise and her apology were masterful i am so sorry sir its these heels i was just getting ready to disembark and after wearing ship boots for weeks i just lost my balance i really am sorry i do hope your foot is all right with a performance like that if hulik had actually run away to that showboat planet shed have been the queen of the galactic stage by now naturally all the customs officials and police officers had turned to look facing as he was pausert had to keep a pokerface as the wall theyd been about examine appeared to slide around to the wall that they had just finished with you did that on purpose grumbled the customs officer massaging his foot through his polished shoe you wont distract us check that next wall carefully they did very carefully eventually they finished and began on the next and to his absolute horror captain pausert began to rell vatch little silver sliteyes and vatch laughter troubles never came singly he could see goth knew about it too the illusionary bulkhead began to develop a window none of the customs officials were looking at it just then concentrating their attentions on the opposite wall but they would be sure to turn any moment now and the window in the illusion revealed the startled face of hantis with pul in her arms it was a charming cottage window complete with leaded diamond panes and lace trimmed chintz curtains neatly framing the fugitives faces as captain pausert stared unable to tear his eyes away two things happened first he felt the forcecuffs on his wrists vanish the field that had held them disappeared and the small metal forcegenerator fell to the floor and second looking at the window that the mischievous little vatch had createdall pausert saw briefly were the nartheby sprites elegant boots moving rapidly upwards and out of view plainly the little vatch thought it would have some fun with the captain trying to fight his way free before the imperial customs officials saw the window it had created in goths lightshift illusion well he wouldnt do what the vatch expected and it looked as if the nartheby sprite had helped him to avoid having to do so she obviously had klatha skills of her own or had goth lifted her with her teleportation skill no goth could manage objects of a few pounds in weight but despite her delicate elfin appearance the nartheby sprite must weigh far more pausert hastily concentrated on finding the vatch he couldnt catch or control this little one with his klatha hooks but it did seem that he could tickle and distract it his resistance to taking the course that the little vatch had tried to trick him into had saved them from a fight it had also caused one of the customs officials to squint at the fading window it was a good thing the official couldnt hear the vatchlet giggling and squeaking stop it big dream thing the man rubbed his eyes and then very deliberately turned away shaking his head pausert went on tickling furiously the last thing they needed now was more complications with any luck the vatch would go away pausert was so intent on tickling that he had to be herded out of the room by his captors who werent gentle about it but he had his reward the relling of vatch presence grew fainter and then vanished the search went on relentlessly the customs men got very excited about the big safe and the secret compartment in the engine room and became very disappointed when both proved absolutely empty of people they did confiscate the totisystem toy inside it it was a very badly designed educational toy which pausert and goth had fitted there in the vain hope of fooling spies the spies who had tried to steal the spacedrive for the empire or the agandars pirates had not been taken in the customs officials however were more gullible pausert grinned through his gag if he hadnt been so mad at gerota town customs men he would have felt sorry for them he just hoped that the totisystem toy didnt explode on them as the rather fiendish educational device was inclined to do the toy was another one of the odd unsellable items that his onetime abouttobe fatherinlaw councilor onswud had dumped on pausert in lieu of a decent cargo looking back pausert could see that hed been set up to fail well hed succeeded beyond their wildest dreamsand gotten lucky too he could have ended up married to the insipid illyla instead shed married councilor rapport while he was away that was real luck although it hadnt seemed like it at the time but right now in the back of a smelly paddy wagon bouncing over the cobbles towards what would doubtless be an even smellier jail pausert didnt feel all that lucky hantis and pul were still hidden on the ship but the rest of them were being taken away from the venture and pausert still hadnt had a chance to talk to goth maybe theyd put them all into one cell together and nobody had noticed yet that his hands werent forcecuffed that wasnt too surprising since forcecuffs just didnt fall off pausert wondered if he could gain any advantage from his free hands but it didnt seem so the others had been transported together but he was apparently considered more dangerous he had a transport all to himself it seemed unfair it was hardly his fault that the leewit had somehow got her guards to take her gag off the destruction that shed caused with her whistles had wrecked the groundcar and had meant that the customs officers had had to call for another the captains gag was only taken off after he had been transported from the jail to the courthouse the judge wasnt particularly interested in hearing their side of the story but the prisoners had to answer when their names were read onto the record ungag him officer ordered the judge he was a lean man whose face seemed to have been colonized by a rampaging tribe of thick black eyebrows the eyebrows crawled together and the judge peered at pausert now have you been correctly identified this judge looked very different from the one who had soaked him for the release of maleen goths sister in what seemed another lifetime yes your honor but those charges are a pack of trumpedup lies the judges heavy eyebrows seemed to twitch upwards of their own accord when i wish to hear from you captain pausert i will ask you to speak be silent or be silenced he peered more closely why is this man not forcecuffed it was some time later and after some consternation in the court that the judge cleared his throat ahem now let us consider the first of the charges brought against you youve got quite a list to answer to call the first witness athon laag the jowlfaced laag was the local manager for pidoon fuels and lubricants when he wasnt being first witness oh yes your honor hes a desperate rogue i wrestled with him for vital minutes until the police miz snodder had called got there clearly he intended to commit fraud on my company as well as his unprovoked brutal assault on an honest businessman when he discovered the law was outside he finally overpowered me and fled lies yelled pausert he threatened me with a blaster and accused me of being a pirate the judge waved a threatening gavel at the captain i told you that you would be silenced and if you speak without permission again you will be captain continue laag how did you decide he was attempting to commit fraud the selfproclaimed honest businessman continued after a fearful look at the captain his credit statement your honor his account has been blocked he has an account with the daals bank on uldune the onetime pirateworld your honor the judge steepled his fingers i am aware of uldunes unsavory history laag nodded well when we got the order for fuel and the banking details we sent a notification to iss headquarters in pidoon city its routine imperial security looks carefully at money coming from that source the judge snorted hardly surprising yes your honor nodded laag we got a call from them about three minutes later revealing that that manhe pointed to pausertwas one of the notorious agandars closest associates we were asked to delay them as much as possible as it was believed that he had two wanted and dangerous assassins on board his ship the judges caterpillarlike eyebrows did a rapid crawl inward and out again bankrupt charged with assault attempted fraud consorting with criminals well captain pausert now you may speak captain pausert didnt think it would help him much your honor i am not one of the agandars associates in fact we are being pursued by his fleet because we were responsible for his death you can confirm that with the governor of green galaine province on emris the prosecutor stood up waving a piece of paper your honor we have here a transcript of a report from captain benit of the imperial space navy cruiser saraband it states clearly that one captain pausert of a ship identified as the one now on gerota town landing field did not only refuse to halt but decoyed them into a pirate ambush the judge looked sternly at the captain did you or did you not disobey a lawful order from an imperial navy vessel to halt yes but pausert was right being allowed to talk wasnt helping much at all within twenty minutes he was being herded away to start his fiftyfiveyear sentence the extra three years that hed gotten for the injury of a customs official because of the totisystem toys selfdestruction was merely the most unfair of a number of injustices he wondered what theyd do to the others and just how they could get out of this mess he had noticed that hulik do eldel wasnt with the others in the holding pen at the back of the courtroom but hed had no chance to find out why or even to exchange a word with them the captain explored his cell very carefully that used up half a minute only fiftyfour years eleven months thirty days twentythree hours fiftynine minutes and some change to go after that he alternated between pacing staring at the bars while sitting on the bed and staring at the bars while standing up it went well with his mental state which alternated between fuming about how theyd been caught worrying about the others worrying about their mission and worrying about hantis and pul left sitting inside the venture his worrying was interrupted by the click of heels coming down the concrete floor of the passage with any luck it would be some food and maybe a chance to ask the jailor about the others good evening captain captain pausert sat down on the bed gaping at hulik do eldel in a freshly pressed iss uniform you you you traitor she supplied turncoat she casually flicked a folded piece of paper into his cell i suggest you keep your temper and cooperate with me was that the flicker of a wink what was going on i think rat was the word i was looking for said the captain grimly and as for cooperate great pathams seventh hell ill see you rot first do eldel she smiled coolly come now captain pausert mind your temper and your language youre the one who will rot in hereunless you cooperate we want the two alien passengers you have hidden on the venture you are going to tell us captain you or one of the others now the captain was sure that it had been a wink hulik had known where the nartheby sprite and the grikdog had been hiding well if hulik wanted him to play along hed do his best he shook the bars furiously what have you done with the others you devils where are my nieces you know that these are ridiculous trumpedup charges you know we should be back on our ship and on our way when word of this gets back to the empress hailie heads are going to roll even heads within the iss hulik curled her lip disdainfully your threats while you and your companions are behind bars are not exactly terrifying captain ill leave you with the thought that you are a bankrupt prisoner unable to pay landing fees and your ship has been impounded if it is not redeemed within thirtysix hours itll be towed out into space and used as a target hulk by the imperial space navy even if we cant find the villains were looking for well destroy them along with their hiding place think about that for a while ill be back in an hour or so to see if youve decided to cooperate she turned and left and captain pausert went on clinging to the bars it was a good thing hed been holding on when shed told him about the venture that had helped to keep him on his feet did their troubles only ever seem to get worse it took him a few minutes to let go of the bars and remember the tiny piece of folded paper hulik had flicked so casually into his cell he walked over towards it pretended to stumble and picked it up lying on his bed with the paper hidden in a flap of his gray prison blanket and masked by the lumpy pillow captain pausert read you are under constant observation by a spy ray that didnt surprise him but could he really trust her she was apparently an agent of imperial security after all how else could she have gotten her liberty restored the next line of the tiny message was more startling v and i will be coming for you at midnight be ready destroy this v vezzarn but the little spacer had been with the other prisoners hulik had plainly talked her way free but vezzarn was sure to be imprisoned well he could only wait and see it was a long wait he got a bowl of prison stew which he ate even though the gray chewy lumps werent very appetizing and the wooden spoon looked as if might give him a dangerous disease it still tasted better than the piece of paper hed swallowed earlier yum yum he said to the jailor he got no more reply to that than hed gotten to his query about the others if the man could talk he certainly showed no interest in doing so later hulik came back with another iss agent by his flat nasal accent he was a local man and this was plainly the biggest thing that had ever happened in his career he cracked his outsize knuckles while attempting an intimidating stare you will tell us where theyre hidden he yelled abruptly your customs men searched my ship from stem to stern said pausert there is nothing and no one hidden on it lieutenant do eldel get me the keys for this cell im going to beat it out of him the captain looked at the iss agent the fellow was big but he was definitely pudgy maybe now would be good time to depart from this cell especially if hulik was ready to help pausert put his hands on his hips you and which army hulik hadnt moved lieutenant do eldel snapped the iss man yes district officer hulik asked cocking her head in polite enquiry he held out his hand the cell key sir we know that the officer commanding in pidoon city has sent an aircraft to fetch this man its a long flight but theyll be here by three am and theyll be questioning him i know that snapped local officer in annoyance but i want to get the answers i advise against it sir the agandars lieutenant is a notorious killer reputed to be very skilled at unarmed combat i believe he is trying to provoke you into going into his cell the local iss man snatched back the hand hed been holding out for the key as if it had been burned he tried to look nonchalant and only succeeded in looking foolish humph consider yourself lucky he told pausert or unlucky the fellows from headquarters will bring tools that will make you sing all right they left and the evening wore on there were no lights in the cell and the passage lights had long been switched off pausert had nothing by which to judge the passage of time theyd confiscated his chronometer along with his belt and his boots time did seem to be passing exceptionally slowly pausert became increasingly convinced that hulik had either been caught or hadnt been able to come once the iss men came to take him to their headquarters escape would be even more difficult and hed be a long way from the venture and then he began to rell vatch like the sound of a scent like the smell of music youre in trouble again big dream thing the familiar little silvereyed vatch seemed quite delighted pausert was desperate enough even to be pleased to see it you dont know where the others are do you he thought at the vatchlet theyre in a cell in the next passage they asked me where you were the vatch apparently found this quite funny even the little one asked nicely youre not going to tickle me again are you can you get me out of here yes but i cant stay and i want to watch please i chased the big one for you didnt i and theyre coming to take me away i wont be able to save hantis and pul or my ship if they take me off to pidoon city that would finish your fun the little slitty quicksilver eyes considered him oh all right if you give me that piece of vatch stuff you took from the big one its not doing well on its own pausert had forgotten about the fragment of vatch stuff the tiny piece of blackness was still there in his pocket a black fragment of nothingness was not something that the warders who had confiscated the rest of his property would have seen or been able to move or touch ill lend it to you kay the vatch took it the silveryeyed little thing grew a tiny fraction have fun big dream thing ill see you later and the vatch was gone to wherever small vatches went he was about to curse it for a rotten cheat when the lock on the cell door clicked open captain pausert was freeand on his own in the darkened passages of gerota town prison free without boots belt or any real idea of where to go he stood in the passage listening straining his ears for the sound of patrolling warders instead he heard faintly the leewits voice when she was yelling like that faintly and faroff was the best way to hear it but the sound still cheered the captain immensely he set off to see if he could find them chapter pausert found himself blessing the leewit her voice was very easy to followand the passages were dark he also found himself cursing the loss of his boots hed been very proud of those boots theyd come from the hands of mister hildo of hildo and naugaf nikkeldepains finest cobblers back in the days when it had seemed he was going to be the first of nikkeldepains miffelfur millionaires right now what he missed most about them was the fact that they protected his feet not only was the concrete floor of the jailblock brutally cold but he had stubbed his toes a couple of times already bare feet did make him walk a lot more quietly than the jailor who was also heading down the passage which was still echoing with the leewits voice if you dont shut up youll get no food in the morning threatened the jailor angrily when he reached the leewits cell he rapped on the bars of the cell with his nightstick as he shone his torch around the cell some of us are trying to sleep the leewit blew him a magnificent raspberry the warder was lucky at least she didnt whistle at him and she did shut up pausert knew the leewit too well by now to believe that was likely to be without reason so he shrank back into the shadows and waited for the warder to head back towards the desk he had been sleeping at he was dead right the man had hardly been gone a minute when the captain heard a clink of keys and goths whisper here you try the door only unlocks from outside and your hands are smaller than mine youll have to reach through the bars he walked quietly over to the cell door let me help you itll be easier from this side he whispered captain both girls squeaked hush we dont want the guard coming back here now that you have teleported his keys do we pausert took the key from the leewit and opened the door the girls piled out of the cell knew you were coming said goth gruffly squeezing his arm do either of you have any idea of the time no said goth they took our watches before they put us in the cell i thought it must be pretty late so we got the leewit to call the guard they took mine too pausert worried a little that he might have misestimated the time did hulik come to see you yeah with that creep of a local iss officer friend of hers shed better hope we never catch up with her said the leewit nastily its not as simple as all that said the captain im not too sure what game shes playing she was supposed to come and let us out at midnight the iss have sent their agents from the capital of this mudball to come and fetch us they should be here around about three in the morning wed better get out of here then captain said goth decisively its got to be well after midnight by now i suppose so im inclined to trust her myself but there are so many things that could have gone wrong i reckon we should head for the old venture theyre planning to use her as a target hulk leaky airlock low fuel or not i think wed better run are you two rested enough to do the sheewash drive again yep count on us its a pity you cant help captain youre a hot witch believe me said pausert you cant want me to do it any more than i do i feel as if im almost getting it you can try too hard with klatha stuff said goth sternly sometimes it comes when you need it rather than when you want it that sounded like her mother tolls pattern talking rather than goth herself the young karresborn witches had a guiding pattern a nonmaterial partial replica of the personality of an adult similar in nature to help and steer them the instructor resident in their minds took a hand when they were ready to learn new klatha skills captain pausert wished that he also had one but he simply had to muddle along on his own and some of the klatha manipulation was dangerous if you got it wrong it could dismind you or burn you up make you burst into flames and combust yourself do you have any idea what happened to vezzarn asked the captain changing the subject back to their immediate problem i think hulik meant to bring him along with her he could know more about what is going on he got a twelve year sentence for aiding and abetting dangerous criminals said the leewit seeming to relish the words thats us you know he was put into a cell about three down but when they got there the cell was empty the door just ajar there was a pillow and a rolledup blanket under the covers roughly shaped like a man but of the little old spacer there was no sign well i guess wed better get going without him said goth who knows he might be back on the venture already or trying to spring us said pausert nope he knew where we were just as well as we knew where he was said the leewit i guess he decided to rat pausert couldnt help thinking that when the agandar and his sheem warrobot had been hunting them vezzarn had decided to betray them the little man had seemed genuinely remorseful and reformed afterwards but it did indicate the potential for that kind of behavior maybe he did either way we havent got the time to go and look for him lets see if we can find our way out before the iss agents arrive to find us gone moving quietly through the corridors they tried to find their way out without awakening any warders after a while they came to double metal swingdoors in the dim light of various indicator globes pausert surveyed what could only be the prison kitchensa gloomy hall of squareedged shadows and great cauldronssmelling of grease and old boiled greens and full of things that skittered and chittered from the dark corners he began regretting that he hadnt stuck to just eating huliks piece of paper i suppose there might be a back door he whispered he could just make out goths nod the first door proved merely to be a coldroom but the next door they came to was invitingly ajar a cool night breeze licked into the smelly kitchen pausert peeped around the door it opened into a shadowy little courtyard full of garbage cans that the air from out there could smell sweet spoke ill of the prison kitchen true the courtyard would probably be locked but with the girls klatha powers they should manage to get through them hopefully they crept out the captain waiting for a powerful searchlight and the howl of sirens with each wary step it never came and the heavily chained gate was open someone had sheered the links of the chain the cut links gleamed in the wan moonlight hulik must have prepared this he swung the gate open just wide enough for them to slip out too late pausert smelled a huge rat even above the garbage stench but as he realized that something was wrong the waiting men had already dropped a paralyzer web over them someone was also standing by with a hypodermic darter the captain was just aware of being hastily loaded into a groundcar like a sack of meal before oblivion took him hulik do eldel fumed her cover as a loyal iss agent was blown now and all for the want of a few minutes she looked at the unconscious body of the iss district officer well she had had to do it hed have raised the alarm for certain shed better get down there find captain pausert and get him vezzarn goth and the leewit into the iss van she planned to take them to the spaceport in she glanced up at the monitors from the spyeyes and realized that it wasnt going to be quite that simple the infrared showed the girls trying to unlock their cell hastily she turned the sound gain on that spy circuit back up the leewits shrieks had persuaded officer jayelo to turn the sound off and stopped him noticing the captains breakout until it was too late she was just in time to hear captain pausert say im not too sure what game shes playing she was supposed to come and let us out at midnight hulik took a deep breath it was still ten minutes short of that she listened further well shed just have to find them at vezzarns cell opening that would hold them up a bit but when she got there theyd already left hulik was left to play a silent kind of hide and go seek with them trying to guess where they might have gone she was dismayed to find the prison warders at the central desk dead for a moment she was horrified that pausert could have been so brutally efficient it wasnt as if the warders of this sleepy little prison in this sleepy little town on this sleepy little planet had posed any real threat then she realized that someone had blasted the far door the remains of it showed unmistakable blaster burns a mark cannon to judge by the damage where would the captain have got a militarygrade blaster cannon from was this karres witchcraft or was this something else or maybe someone else not bothering about quietness now hulik ran down the passage her own issue blaster in her hand as she went into the kitchen she heard a strangled yell from outside that was goths voice she was just in time to see a black groundcar speed away from the forced gates she took aim bracing her arm dont shoot hissed vezzarn from the walltop she nearly shot him instead he dropped down onto the dustbins and into the courtyard phew that was close id have stopped the vehicle at least if you hadnt interfered snapped hulik how are we going to track them now great patham i had it all organized and then the captain broke out ten minutes early vezzarn pointed there was a second vehicle in the alley if you had fired theyd have got you this was very professional hulik theyve been monitoring the cells with a spy ray hulik shook her head that was us vezzarn the local iss man and myself vezzarn gave her a crooked little grin i took my tools in with me hulik imperial security on these backwater planets is pretty sloppy there was more than one spy ray being worked i mirrored it out of my cell before i went to work on the lock and then i was just doing a little pathfinding snoop when the guys with the heavy artillery broke in i was really worried at first until i overheard them saying that they needed all of them alive well thats a relief alive for now anyway once they get what they want out of the captain there will be no point in keeping him or the little girls hulik took a deep breath wed better get hunting then vezzarn if youre coming the little wizened old man nodded i still owe the captain besides were free for now but this planet isnt big enough for us to hide from the kind of trouble weve ended up in hulik if these guysll break into the jail and kill warders theyll hunt us down and kill us sooner or later hulik holstered the issue blaster and the iss agents from pidoon city will be here soon theyll make it even hotter vezzarn stretched his short legs to match her stride besides ten to one the authorities will blame the captainand usfor murdering the prison warders hulik nodded i think you could bet on that at one hundred to one so we should get offworld as fast as possible which means weve got find where theyve taken the captain goth and the leewit i got a tracer on the spy ray it was sending back between us and the spaceport about a mile off ive been here before remember thats porttown ive got a contact we can try hulik do eldel was expecting to be taken to a seedy bar but vezzarns smuggler contact was not the proprietor of some portside dive she was the very highnosed keeper of a little gift shop obviously aimed at propitiating the wives of longabsent spacers vezzarn must have given some special signal because they were invited to look at some special merchandise for the discerning customer they stepped through the door into a second little room with more expensive knickknacks on the crowded shelves this place is about as well shielded as possible said the lady proprietor looking worried what brings you here illa we havent had any consignments moved through here for months i havent seen you for years hulik was not surprised at the assumed name vezzarn was known by she had several herself vezzarn shrugged im on another run these days thora i just need some information in a hurry thora raised an eyebrow hulik knew that they were on dangerous ground i just need to know who some people are and where to find them said vezzarn reassuringly you know im trusted i wont bring any trouble to you that would be more than my lifes worth ask then the giftshop proprietress said guardedly vezzarn described the groundcars that had taken part in the snatch of the captain goth and the leewit fullbricht she said the second vehicle is pretty distinctive but you really dont want to find him illa he runs most of the crime in this town these days he started off as an informer for someone but hes moved up hes got control over several of the other small towns you really dont want to cross him vezzarn grimaced hes bad news huh the giftshop proprietress pulled a face no its worse he wants to be bad news hes a smalltime operator who wants to be thought big hell go too far one day but at the moment hes like a killmad miffel his trademark is making statues hulik blinked statues thora regarded her with a jaundiced eye thats what theyre called around here statues humans cast in ferroplast she said dryly then they get dropped into the lake hulik took a deep breath we need to find him anyway thora the woman looked at the two of them well the fake iss uniform might help she conceded his headquarters are in the myamosa building but thats just the front office the place where they do most of their business is in an old hazardous materials warehouse off thirteenth street chapter pausert awoke with a stunning headache when he tried to cradle his head in his hands he very rapidly realized that a headache was the very least of his problems he was in a barrel that came to just below head height the barrel had been filled up to his chest with fastsetting ferroplast the stuff was already in the thick and glutinous stage and his hands were tied behind his back inevitably his nose began to itch twitching his nose desperately he looked around the cavernous room the twitching did nothing to alleviate the irritation of his nasal membranes he realized that the sensation wasnt entirely psychological the smell in here would make any selfrespecting nose itch the air was ammoniacal that could be why the people standing between him and the two other barrels were wearing rebreather masks the masks hid most of their faces but pausert didnt think that they were worried about being identified they were carrying between the seven of them enough heavy weaponry for a regiment well a platoon anyway one of the biggest men pausert had ever seen was carrying a mark blaster cannonthe kind of weapon normally mounted on sandscouts this man had it slung across his back as if it were an ordinary rifle two of their captors were busy cutting one of the other barrels shorter with a steelgrinder with the metal screaming if that was the level of noise accepted around here then shouting for help was not going to do any good one of the masked men noticed that pausert was starting to look around hes stirring captain elin pausert had expected the big man with the mark to turn but instead a short stocky woman did she had one of the most perfect gamblers faces that pausert had ever seen absolutely and totally expressionless pausert realized that that could be even more frightening than someone who looked either threatening or mad captain pausert her tone too was nearly expressionless a casual greetyouwithoutpleasureinthestreet tone of voicenot ihaveyouboundanduptothechestinferroplast nasty somehow that was even more intimidating and she knew who he was obviously we need some information out of you you are going to tell us another figure bustled up a wristphone pressed to his ear a big plump sloppylooking man but nothing like the size of the giant with the mark the prison is crawling with cops ive got two of my men monitoring the iss channels theyre planning to set the launching of his ship forward itll be in space as a target hulk within two hours if the information is on the ship itll be space dust soon youve got to get it out of him weve got to get out of here there was both fear and greed in the whiny voice shut up fullbricht youre a pennyante bungler dont let your delusions of local importance let you think that you can give orders to me its all very well for you captain elin he said sullenly youll be out of here ill be left to carry the can your men used my vehicles someone is bound to have seen them then youll have to leave your comfortable little nest here fullbricht how likely are they to know of this place should we move the captives to our ship no one comes here it was a radioactive materials store before the mines played out then they used it for guano until that was exhausted well that explained the ammonia smell thought pausert but a radioactives store would be built like a fortress no wonder they werent worried about noise the men who had been cutting the drum hauled the cut section off to reveal a tousled blond head sticking out above the ferroplast the leewit was obviously still unconscious and pausert was pretty certain that the third barrel contained goth the woman referred to as captain elin turned back to pausert her eyes were inhumanly cold pausert thought how fond are you of the two children captain a vibroknife appeared in her hand she walked over to the unconscious leewit do you want her to have a quick death or a slow and painful one its your choice we want the agandars codes and we want them now codes pausert tried to sound less dumbfounded than he felt she slapped the unconscious leewit hard access codes to his vaults in the daals bank on uldune fury boiled up in captain pausert incandescent anger it was all the worse for being helpless shes a child ill youll tell us what we wish to know we know you have drawn funds from his accounts pausert forced himself to be calm he hadnt done anything of the kind he had to think his way out of this dilemma someone had set this up someone who was out to destroy the venture and her crew or passengers stubborn eh she said well you have that reputation captain she slowly raised the vibroknife the blade glittered and shimmered in the harsh factory lighting of the storehouse pausert wished desperately for some way to protect the unconscious leewit if only she was conscious if only there was some kind of klatha shield he could raise around her olimy the top karres witch theyd transported from uldune to emris had been protected like that olimy had disminded himself protected himself from the horror of the worm world with a kind of stasis if only a complex klatha pattern came to his mind unbidden what was it that goths toll pattern had said when you need it not when you want it but what would it do dismind him that could only be reversed with difficulty on karres or dismind the leewit the glittering knife drew closer to the leewits face there was no time for doubts now the captain traced the klatha pattern with his mind it was an intricate one full of strange dimensionturning twists which made him feel both giddy and cold he directed it at the leewit and had the satisfaction of seeing the pirate captain pull her knife hand back as if stung the watching fullbricht hissed witchcraft and backed off fearfully captain elin turned towards pausert her eyes glittering so youre also one of those karres witches we were told it was just them that we just had to keep them doped they told you wrong said pausert with a confidence that he didnt feel he didnt know that he could reverse what hed done on the leewit or how good a protection it was for that matter he didnt really even know exactly what hed done it had certainly left him feeling physically drained youd better let us go or else keth blast her to his horror pausert saw that the huge man with the mark bring his weapon to bear on the leewit before pausert had a chance to protest the man let loose with it it should have blown her head off her ferroplastencased shoulders it didnt a puff of wind might have had more effect the glittering eyes of captain elin didnt blink lets see how good you are with machinery witch fullbricht set the pourer running the man wildeyed backed up against the wall and pressed a green button high above them machinery clanked and whirred to life riding along a roofrail came a mechanical bucket pausert didnt need to be told that the bucket was full of ferroplast this was presumably a leftover machine from when this place processed radioactives for shipping hed bet that the machine had been set up to seal these drums what should he do now if he sealed himself and goth in with the pattern they might be unreachable and unhurtable but theyd be unreachable in a state from which there might be no return at alland certainly in a state in which they could neither help hantis pul nor themselves indecision nearly paralyzed pausert as the suspended bucket rolled closer pausert was very aware that the mark was now pointed at himself better there than at goth but what was he to do he tried focusing his newly discovered klatha shield on the suspended bucket it had no effect at all perhaps it needed something living or something he cared about the bucket clanked closer well there was nothing for it but to shield goth the chest of the big man with the mark disappeared in a sear of blaster fire the lights went out witchcraft yelled someone in a huge voice and cackled maniacally hulik watched as vezzarn tickled the lock at the back of the hazardous materials warehouse with a tool from his tiny set it clicked open most obligingly and they slipped inside and up the stairs to the office that overlooked the warehouse looking down at captain pausert goth and the leewit each trapped in their barrel with the hardbitten heavily armed captors surrounding them hulik did not see how they could get them out ive found the switch box said vezzarn quietly just as the captain successfully created a klatha shield to protect the leewit hulik had found a switch too for the intercom she switched it on in time to hear someone below exclaim witchcraft that would do that would just have to do have you got a gun vezzarn he shook his head no they took it away to be honest im not a very good shot anyway i am well just have to chance it the captain and the girls will be quite well protected in those barrels ill take out the guy with the mark twenty you cut the power to the bucket and the lights and see if you can cause some panic with the intercom microphone then cut the lights back on so i can get some more shooting in vezzarn grinned wryly its a pity that the little wisdom cant be here to give them some of her whistles ill do my best hulik do eldel the shrieks and blasterfire prompted pausert to go right ahead and shield goth he put a lot of force into that klatha pattern he wanted it strong and big he gave it his everything there was the sound of tearing metal then a hideous metallic whine and an explosive crashing sound the lights came on again captain pausert saw goth no longer in a barrel and no longer encased in ferroplast slowly topple over like a roundbottomed skittle she lay about two armslength above the floor on nothing and there was a substantial hole in the side of the building as blasterfire from the roofsuspended office hissed down into the warehouse pausert realized what he must have done the shield around goth was so thick that it had torn the barrel seam and exploded it some of the pirates had fled and at least one was dead but most of them had sought cover behind the vehicles at the main door except for two who were crouched beside the barrel that held the leewit one of them began firing at the stanchions that held the office if they could burn through it then the rescuers up there would fall pausert concentrated on the klatha shield around the leewit hoping that hed be protected by his own barrel he concentrated his effort on the lower part of her shield suddenly the bottom half of the leewits barrel split with a tortured metal scream even the leewit herself would have been proud of barrel shards and ferroplast flew all over like shrapnel the eruption killed the two pirates beside the barrel instantly and it was enough to send the remaining ones scrambling towards one of the groundcars or racing towards the heavy double door someone obviously had a remote door control because the doors opened as they reached it then swung shut behind them hulik and vezzarn came running down the stairs in the distance pausert heard the sound of police sirens captain are you all right vezzarn attempted to haul pausert out of the barrel well im alive am i glad to see you two how did you get here hulik had now taken the other shoulder and the two of them hauled she was slightly built but lithe and strong slowly he began to move we followed you not without difficulty captain you bolted the coop ten minutes before i was ready for you captain pausert was grateful to be hanging over the edge of barrel it helped to hide his embarrassment they took my chronometer i thought you must have been captured just as well in a way said hulik as pausert half fell was halfdragged out onto the floor dripping ferroplast wed all have been captured these guys were watching your cell too vezzarn went to work on the captains bonds with the vibroknife now all weve got to do is get out of here captain whats up with the little wisdoms he was using the uldune term for the karres witches i put them into some kind of shield i just hope i can get it off with difficulty and with the support of vezzarn and hulik the captain struggled to his feet partly his weakness came from having been tied up in the ferroplast partly he was just dead tired he knew now how goth and the others felt after the sheewash drive as goth said it sure took it out of you im not very experienced at this karres witchery i think wed better try and get them back to the venture i might need to find another karres witchand that could be difficult seeing as how the ship isnt likely to be going anywhere without these two hulik shook her head its worse than that captain we may already be too late to save the venture or the lives of pul and hantis ive been listening in on the communications on the iss band as soon as the team arrived to pick you up they discovered that the prison warders were dead dead exclaimed pausert yes dead said hulik grimly you were captured by some local hoodlum called fullbricht and some of the agandars pirates added pausert they definitely considered this fullbricht as a sort of bungling minor functionary yes he was probably a local spy for the agandar once well that explains the heavy weapons and the brutality anyway they murdered the prison warders but the local police and the iss are blaming you so theyve sent an order to have enough fuel run into the venture for a takeoff then theyre going to use her as theyd planned for a naval training exercise and blow her apart pausert shook himself scattering gobs of ferroplast come on lets get goth and the leewit into that groundcar ill have see what i can do wed better try to get to the venture ill bring the groundcar over here captain as hulik moved across to the showy groundcar pausert looked around how do we get out of here can we just crash through those doors vezzarn shook his head this is a hazardous material store captain those will be especially hardened doors guess i better go to work on the locks pausert tried to shake more ferroplast off himself while he reflected that having an expert safebreaker and lockpick in your crew could be very useful he set his mind to work undoing whatever it was that hed done to goth and the leewit he had no idea on how or where to start hulik brought the car over shed picked up vezzarn someone is trying to open the doors i guess vezzarn wasnt the only one who could trail fullbricht back here by the cars captain but i think that hole the exploding barrel made in the wall over there is big enough for this groundcar they loaded the slickly smooth invisible eggs containing goth and the leewit into the car hulik eased the vehicle forward and they bumped out through the hole in the side wall the warehouse plainly hadnt been used for some time there were plenty of weeds and some rusting stacks of a very familiar barrel as they drove further the reflection of flashing lights on the surrounding concrete wall revealed that gerota towns finest were at work on the warehouse door hulik clicked the groundcar lights off by the light of pidoons moons they quietly edged away from the building following the trail cleared by goths flying barrel pausert realized just what an intensely fast and powerful reaction he must have caused by his klatha use the barrel had finally smashed into the concrete wall the wall was only partially flattened but short of going out past the gerota town police there was no other escape route shall we charge it asked hulik making the groundcars motor growl lets just try pushing said vezzarn it looks weakened it was and a section fell in they bumped and bounced their way down onto the deserted adjoining street and turned the powerful vehicle towards the spaceport as they did so they listened in on huliks ississue communicator to the reports coming in concerning the search for them apparently the agandars pirates had done them something of a favor as the vehicle theyd fled in had been spotted and was being pursued there were also reports from the iss man and the local spacepilot theyd rounded up to get the venture into space the iss man had had some trouble getting fuel out of pidoon fuels and lubricants pausert despite the fact that he was having absolutely no luck in reversing his klatha shield around goth and the leewit found that that was worth laughing about the spaceport was bustling as bustling at least as the spaceport of a small town of a minor backwater planet could be just before dawn there were seven vehicles in the groundcar park one was an issliveried loader at least there were no police waiting perhaps they assumed that now that the iss men were aboard the venture and that she was getting ready for take off there would be no need for them to watch the spaceship any more how will we get onto her asked vezzarn as they drew into the parking lot borrow the iss loader said pausert hulik contact the agent to let him know that weve got a load of explosives intended to make doubly sure that the venture is totally destroyed hulik looked at him in surprise thats not like you captain pausert shrugged i dont like to break the law but im wanted here already for murders i didnt do stealing an iss vehicle cant add more than another execution to the list if we live through this and get to explain we can always pay for it provided we get to use the ventures money again vezzarn was already out of the vehicle working on the door lock of the loader breaking in took him barely a minute the captain and hulik manhandled goth and the leewit out of fullbrichts groundcar and onto the lowbed of the loader there was a tarpaulin which he and vezzarn tossed over the top of the girls pausert would have sworn goths eyes were now open but the light was bad and time was pressing hulik was already on the communicator agent sboro weve dispatched a load of explosives to make sure that the vessel is completely destroyed see that your pilot doesnt attempt to leave before its aboard snapped hulik into her iss communicator there was a pause yes maam i will open the cargo hatch agent sboro sounded a little breathless thought pausert as they drove across the concrete to the old venture pausert looked lovingly but fearfully at her if he couldnt work out how to get goth and the leewit out of the trap hed put them into then they were in even more trouble it seemed right now that the venture and her crew had only been lurching from disaster to disaster since the beginning of their mission they hastily unloaded the leewit and goth then because it was quickest way to do it rolled the transparent egg shapes up into the cargo hatch the captain saw the flaw in his plan there was no way out of the cargo hold into the shipunless like the agandar you had a sheem war robot that could cut through the bulkheads the ship intercom crackled get off the ship were about to launch weve got a confidential message for you it must be delivered in person said pausert smoothly we cant get off until it is delivered orders i repeat get off if youre not out of the cargo hatch by the count of five im sealing it and well blast anyway one two it is essential three four we have information about the hidden passengers we know where they are the hatch began to close im coming down youre about to take a ride into space line up against the back wall with your hands away from any weapons what do we do asked hulik vezzarn and pausert looked at each other hulik was a fine marksman and a good companion but she was no spaceman pausert shrugged cooperate he said we have to strap in on acceleration couches for launch oh if this agent sboro is humane enough to let us pausert looked at goths definitely open eyes well just stand behind goth and the leewit we know that the shield can stop even a mark twenty blaster bolt he felt guilty about it all the same put your gun on the floor hulik if need be you can drop and shoot goth was awake in there was she all right could she breathe or was it like traveling by the egger route did she need to the door to the hold opened cautiously a figure with a blythe gun in hand stepped though hantis smiled foxily i couldnt be really sure it was your voice captain hantis exclaimed the captain she bowed slightly pul is in the control room with the prisoners were in trouble captain pausert the captain pointed to goth and the leewit youre telling me ive put them into some kind of shield if i cant get them out then we cant use the sheewash drive hantis drew her brows together that actually makes it worse but the problems immediate the iss heard your call to sboro about the explosives they just attempted to contact him on the ship communicator rather than his iss device they warned him that they think that there may be fake iss operatives trying to board this ship i think we can be sure that atmospheric craft have been scrambled and are on their way here pausert pushed wearily off the wall well lets get everyone into acceleration couches and show them what the old venture can do well go down fighting if we cant get away come on we need to carry goth and the leewit shes moving around in there said vezzarn looking at goth do you think the little wisdom will be able to free herself we havent got time to find out right now said hulik if we use a blanket we can make it into a stretcher of sorts that will be quickest up in the control room they found an iss agent and a nervouslooking pilot on the floor pul was standing over them with a long piece of iss uniform collar in his jaws the churls called me a dog hantis can i rip their throats out its no use lady said the pilot looking nervously at the grikdogs powerful jaws i wont fly this craft not even if you kill me dead men dont pilot spaceships anyway said pausert tiredly tie them up we can go and dump them in their loader two to a prisoner they hastily carried the pilot and agent out to the iss vehicle and tossed them onto the loadbed vezzarn hopped into the cab engaged the vehicles engine and leaped out at a run they sprinted back to the venture a bolt of blasterfire licked out at them adding impetus to their pace once into the control room pausert scrambled for the control chair and began initiating the blastoff sequence sorry goth this is an apology in advance this is going to be one of my bad takeoffs it was but it was also too fast for the two atmospheric craft that came racing in from an airfield several thousand miles off the venture staggered into space farther and farther from pidoon as the planet dropped away below them pausert felt relief but he was aware that the fuel gauges were dropping fast they were already using the reserve tanks the detectors started to bleep imperial navy ships captain said vezzarn grimly they didnt even make an effort to hail the venture they were already firing even yelling that there was an iss man on board helped not at all pausert pushed the thrust down to maximum the ventures drive surged and stuttered a wall of navy fire fell just short the three imperial vessels that were racing towards them would be in range for their next salvo the nova guns captain the venture suddenly surged again leaping as if a wasp had stung her pausert felt the wonderful familiar surge of the sheewash drive looking across at goth he saw the acceleration nets still covered her couch covered an invisible cocoon in fact but inside that cocoon the twisted black wires and strange orange fire of the sheewash drive danced he was almost too tired to wish he knew how it worked reliefand exhaustion coming like a waveovercame him chapter when he awoke with a start the captain found that someone had covered him up with a blanket he was still sitting in the command chair in the ventures control room looking out of the forward viewscreens showed nothing but an emptiness of space so theyd gotten away away in a leakinghulled vessel with absolutely no fuel there might be a drop or two in the lateral rocket tanks but other than for docking those were next to useless he looked sideways goth was still lying above the acceleration couch surrounded by a layer of nothingness i see you are awake captain said hantis good we must try to undo this shield you have put around goth and the leewit she looked curiously at him i was not told that you were such a powerful klatha operative im not i seem to learn how to do things by accident admitted pausert i dont know what ive done or how to undo it he looked at the nartheby sprite goth said you were klathaskilled too hantis can you get her out of there hantis shook her mane of foxy hair no it is very difficult for one klatha operative to undo the work of another each persons skills seem to be unique even if they sometimes achieve the same thing my skills anyway lie with levitation truth hearing and music they would be of little help to you but perhaps goth herself can help pausert sat up hastily and looked at goth but how i mean the same way she got the wires necessary to run the sheewash drive she teleported them across the barrier she can do that with notes even if she cant talk to you and the leewit asked pausert hantis smiled impishly has been awake and by her expressions whistling and screaming we cant hear her of course oh and shes been showing you a number of rude signs your little vatch came earlier too even it cant get into the shield anyway the leewit is asleep again pausert blinked again have i been asleep long about fifteen hours hantis said most klatha use is demanding on the users energy it looks like you came pretty close to burning yourself out captain pausert sometimes new klatha users die like that you must be careful i only did it because there seemed no alternative i feel as if i havent eaten for a week never mind slept for fifteen hours ill just see to goth and then its food goth smiled up at him from her shield cocoon she held up a sheet of paper shed prepared it read hello captain pausert started to reply realized what he was doing and looked for writing materials they were sitting ready on the console next to goth painstakingly he wrote down what he had done and asked for advice he waited goth was plainly consulting with her inner teacher the pattern of her mother toll she wrote you could try doing it backwards captain see the pattern and then trace it backwards he nodded and took a deep breath she scrawled something hastily eat first then when hed seen that she scrawled dangerous pausert realized she was right using klatha in ways that you werent sure about could be very dangerousand it certainly wasnt something he should try when lack of food made him feel quite lightheaded besides he just couldnt visualize the pattern so he ate he also took a quick shower and changed into fresh clothes he cursed the loss of his best boots and dug a spare pair out of his locker they didnt fit as well as the his old ones but he supposed hed just have to live with it he wasnt going to get back to nikkeldepain and hildo and naugaf for another pair ever not while his erstwhile abouttobe fatherinlaw lived anyway on the positive side he consoled himself illfitting boots were more comfortable than life with illyla would have been pausert still wasnt taking seriously goths placid assumption that theyd eventually get married once she was old enoughwell not very seriously anywaybut the time hed spent in the girls company had made clear to him just how utterly unsuitable a wife illyla would have made for him illyla was ultimately just plain boringsomething that could never be said about goth pausert could see that now a bit of distance lent clarity and maybe that would work here too he thought the captain forced himself to try to visualize not the details of the klatha pattern but the whole thing all of a sudden it burned clearly in his minds eye so walking back to the control room by habit and feel he concentrated on it until he got back to goth now he traced it backwards erasing it carefully precisely goth fell to the couch the cocoon of force around her was gone she scrambled to her feet and hugged pausert fiercely youre a hot witch captain thats powerful klatha that pausert blushed that was not from modesty so much as his recent thoughts contrasting goth to illyla the girl was still much too young for him to be thinking about such things as how she might compare to anyone as a wife on occasion though that was hard not to do and he suddenly realized uneasily that the occasions seemed to be coming more often of late he shook his head forcefully i didnt know what i was doing and i nearly got us all killed because of it thank goodness you thought of teleporting the wires for the sheewash drive that was smart goth she gave him that sly little gothsmile that he had come to know so well neat trick huh it worked too at first there was that drag weve been getting with the sheewash drive and then it was back to normal she suddenly started giggling look the leewit is awake and shes mad yelling her head off by the looks of it shall we pretend we havent noticed im tempted but i guess wed better let her out pausert concentrated a few moments later the leewit fell to the couch still yelling she jumped up waving a small finger threateningly under the captains nose what you do clumping idiot what did you do to us only saved your life said hulik who had come into the control room that shield of the captains stopped a mark twenty blaster bolt you were lucky he did it and he only did it in the first place to stop your face getting sliced up with a vibroknife the leewit had the grace to look embarrassed well i didnt know i just woke up trapped in that that stupid cocoon hulik smiled coolly at her you can hear about it later but right now we have other problems she turned back to pausert im glad youre up and have the little wisdoms out captain hantis had pul on guard at the door we werent allowed to wake you she reckoned if you didnt rest you might not wake up at all and that only you could ever get goth and the leewit out but the doorseal is still leaking were going to have to go somewhere with an atmosphere pretty quick and weve no fuel goth made a face we got a real problem captain maleen was the only one of us who could handle the sheewash drive for landings it takes really fine control the sheewash drive is just too powerful and fast we need fuel to land pausert scratched his chin which reminded him that he needed a shave i guess well just have to get around it how much fuel have we got hulik in the main drive tank captain maybe a few seconds worth thats all the tank for the lateral rockets is about half full we could pipe it to the main tank but that still wont give us very much not enough to land on thats for sure then we either take to piracy find a space refueling point or if worse comes to worst hitch a ride hulik wrinkled her forehead hitch a ride what do you mean captain pausert stood up i dont much like the idea of piracy unless we find the agandars fleet and cut a ship out of that and space refueling is pretty rare in the empire most inhabited worlds outlaw it because if ships can bypass landing it cuts down on trade that leaves hitching a ride so youll have a chance to find out first hand hulik he clapped goth and the leewit on the shoulders we need the sheewash drive to take us to vaudevillia were going to join a circus if we can find one coming in to land the idea so distracted the leewit that she entirely forgot that she was mad with him they got the charts up on the display consol and worked out where they were and where they needed to go sheewash weve lost them said sedmon to his self not so much as a blip since the ship left pidoon there was no hiding the anxiety in his voice the other understood only too well anyway they could be using the secret drive they have done so before weve always picked them up on the detectors within a few hours neither said what they both feared that one of the other parts of the pursuit might have caught up with the venture first it wouldnt be easy for anyone to catch them said one of the selves doubtfully we all know just how fast the venture can be with its secret drive wed better land on pidoon and see what we can find out vezzarn is likely to send them to the port at gerota town remember that one of the smuggling networks we have taken over goes through there at least we have contacts between the selves they knew exactly who was involved in the gemstone smuggling ring vezzarn had so painstakingly investigated for them it was now quite a profitable sideline for uldune even after the unrewarding search in the alpha dendi cluster they were catching up on the venture the two sedmons on the ship had been sure theyd finally reach pausert and his companions on pidoon especially after they received word from their selves back on uldune that a query on the ventures credit status had been made by pidoon fuels and lubricants theyd thought that there would be a day or two of subradio queries and negotiations before the daals bank would allow the account to be accessed but it appeared that pausert must have had other funds the venture had been tracked leaving pidoon since then nothing they decided to set the ship down in gerota town into a hornets nest in the typical fashion of officialdom the galaxy over the customs officers and the police of gerota town were now on high alert well after the fact of course but no one wanted to look as if they could have been the slackers and sluggards who had allowed such a notorious criminal as the infamous captain pausert to escape my papers are in perfect order said the sedmon who was on public duty which of course they were the very best members in the daals extensive staff of forgers on uldune had worked on those papers as for finding the secret compartment in which the second sedmon sat patiently that was unlikely one of the side effects of running an extensive smuggling ring into the empire as a state enterprise was that the empires customs techniques and equipment were well known to the sedmons and well countered the vibrosensors captain pausert had feared would certainly not reveal the second sedmons chambers the search was still exhaustive and still found nothing although while sedmon stood patiently watching the chief customs officer called the iss offices in pidoon city to inform them how suspiciously heavily armed and cargoless the thunderbird was the sedmons didnt much care they intended a very brief stop anyway while the one in hiding monitored the detectors still searching for the signaltrace from the venture the other would make an unobtrusive visit on foot to a nearport gift shop unfortunately he made a simple error the sedmons had all walked lightly disguised around the environs of zergandol but they knew zergandol knew what the streets looked like knew where they were going the sedmon wandering around the seedier parts of gerota towns port area got lost the sedmon then got a firsthand experience of the difference between being the allpowerful and slightly sinister daal of uldune where his word was life or death and his spies and secret police were remarkably efficient and being an arbitrary spaceman in a foreign port there were certain elements in common any of the sedmons going out incognito on the winding hilly streets of zergandol had a number of the daals secret police watching here too the sedmon was being watched by the secret police however there the similarity ended the daals agentsthe sedmon was quite sure of itwere never as clumsy and obvious as this idiot and he had never been shadowed by just one man the sedmon stepped around a corner and slid into a convenient alleyway toggling a button on his collar the pale blue suit he was wearing became a strident green and he raised himself up a further two inches with platform soles his dark complexion he could not alter as easily but with the addition of a curling beard and moustache he had become a different person none of which helped him at all he hadnt walked more than twenty feet farther down the alley before someone hit him very expertly across the base of the skull when the sedmon awoke he was aware that the other hexaperson on the ship was already locking certain key aspects on the thunderbird and coming to his assistance he also realized that his wallet shipkey and chronometer were all missing being as it were one with the sedmon who was leaving the thunderbird he discovered he was in something of a predicament there too the ship must have been under close observation because he hadnt even crossed the tarmac when a groundcar with five heavily armed iss agents screeched to a halt in front of him the five heavily armed agents grabbed and forcecuffed the sedmon whats this all about demanded the sedmon who had just emerged from the ship shut up said the iss officer he held the sedmon at blasterpoint as two others systematically searched and removed various items from his person that the customs officials had not discovered in their search the part of the hexaperson who was attempting to get up in the alley borrowed from his other selves to control his feet back on uldune in the house of thunders the daal got up abruptly from where he had been presiding over a court hearing in the little court he went hastily to join his brothers in the tower at times like this physical closeness was comforting if not necessary in the office in the port building that the iss had appropriated for their own use one of the hexaperson was being strapped into a chair equipped with electrodes the daal had such a chair too the hexaperson had never anticipated being strapped into it however it administered shocks when the instrumentation detected the telltale signs of a lie it was a very effective way of getting the truth out of a suspect we want to know just how you managed to get back to your ship after you had evaded our agent stated the iss interrogator if you lie this is what will happen agony washed through all six of the sedmons chapter the air in the venture was getting thin the trip had taken longer than theyd thought even with the sheewash drive whatever was dragging at us is back captain said goth tiredly maybe we should try using that shield you put us in again that seemed to work no way shouted the leewit not never i couldnt stand it i wont help if you do that again ill whistle at you so theyd plodded on by the time they got to vaudevillia they were gasping almost constantly the space around vaudevillia was fairly crowdedeverything from great lattice ships to small tramps no planetary control greeted them and the space traffic seemed to be left to look after itself its a pretty chaotic place captain said vezzarn theres no planetary authority nor any real ports no defenses neither it doesnt need none even the most desperate bunch of raiders wouldnt waste their time on vaudevillia its nothing more than a giant gypsy encampment there are no real towns you land anywhere it rains so much that wherever you choose would be muddy and flat sir well lets try and get some fuel to land with before we try doing it the hard way lets try the communicator were low on air and fuel surely someone will help they might as well have shouted into space no one was coming near them although by the way some of the tramps were hovering they were just waiting for the ventures crew to die well if no one will help well have to help ourselves said captain pausert the lattice ship looked far more like an umbrella that had lost all of its fabric than a spacecraft and it was big huge was a better word gigantic pausert remembered the excitement of one of the great lattice showboats landing on nikkeldepain standing watching in delight as the great metal skeleton became covered in tinsel bright synthasilk as the showboat transformed an empty fifteen acre field into a paradise of stages freak shows and strange stalls he could almost hear the music again but now he had to concentrate it was difficult when you were gasping this was a seriously tricky bit of shiphandling it had been something theyd done in his navy time with oneman interceptors on empty tanker ships but the venture was a lot bigger and less maneuverable than a oneman interceptor the timing was crucial pausert had come as close as he dared to the spiderweblike lattice showboat that they were planning to catch a ride on there were the remains of several other spacecraft hung around in the lattices skeletal arms they werent the crashed hulks of other ships that had tried to ride down on her rather they were cobbled onto the latticestores props extra living quarters an old ship made a convenient airtight addition to the giant lattice the lattice showboat began its descent pausert used the laterals to begin the drop after it he closed in on the upper stage gravity began to tug at the venture stand by the magnetic locks vezzarn he snapped they were falling fast now there were squawks of protest from the lattice showboatbut it was too big and cumbersome to take evasive action now it loomed large and terribly terribly close atmosphere was beginning to buffet the venture too making steering even more difficult plainly the lattice ship was trying to drop faster to get away from a potential collision everyone was in the control room if they failed now they could kill themselves pausert held that last bit of fuel in the ventures tanks in reserve against the possibility of impacting the lattice showboat but of course those on board the lattice ship wouldnt know that at the last possible momentjust when collision seemed inevitablepausert swung the venture over on the laterals now vezzarn with a barely audible click the venture was magnetically locked onto the upper stage of the lattice showboat never had anything on that stage been quite so enthusiastically applauded the lattice ship continued her descent right said captain pausert acceleration couches everyone were going to have to leave our host in a hurry theyre going to be plenty mad at us well skip as soon as were a hundred yards above ground level full thrust weve got a tiny bit of fuel and were going to use every drop we really dont want to land right next to them vezzarn chuckled thats for sure judging by the language coming out of that speaker the captain wants to do some very interesting things to us i didnt even know some of those words said the leewit gleefully i dont think they even really exist except as cuss words in his own mind they must be really filthy if you use so much as one of them i wont even wash out your mouth with soap said pausert sternly ill put you into my shield cocoon again she stuck her tongue out at him and made a very rude noise but she didnt use the words two minutes later in rain and sheeting lightning captain pausert gave the venture full thrust she took off like a damp squib then the drive coughed and flung them forward pausert frantically tried to see where the hiccupping drive was sending them then it died using the laterals and the detectors the captain set the venture down vezzarn was right it was pretty flat and yes it was muddy the storm hissed and poured rain down at them but at least there was breathable air out there even if it was rather moist i can see why no one wants this place much said hulik gazing into the gloom to think i actually wanted to come here it does slack off sometimes said vezzarn chuckling i came here with a smuggling consortium they thought an unpoliced planet sounded just perfect well we were here a week at the end of that the captain said it was one of the best planets in the universe to leave the old spacer scanned the area the lattice showboats dont mind its a place where there are no port fees and no debt collectors and theyve got a few acres of dry inside them more than a few but no one actually lives here the fuel companies send in mobile tankers and sell fuel at a cashinadvance premium and thats about all there is but every planet has some permanent residentseven glorified filling stations like pidoon vezzarn shrugged the showboats recruit they tried to recruit from us twice the second time was an armed standoff i know the world of the lattice showboats is where every kid in the galaxy thinks theyll run away to but the truth is they want the showboats and not vaudevillia and along the way some people go off to live more normal lives i guess pausert looked out at the rain it was easing slightly well we might need to get recruited weve got air now but weve got no fuel no money and no way out of here he patted the console of the old venture affectionately almost apologetically he loved her and he hated the idea of leaving his ship here to rust what were all those tramps and other little vessels doing around the planet vezzarn food and fuel and drink i suppose captain you can get fish here but not a lot else a small operator can turn a pretty tidy profit out of it if hes lucky but its quite risky to land with no groundcontrol and bad weather unless youre a big lattice ship even the showboats dont land here more often than they really need to picking up atmospheric craft on the detectors captain said hulik warily they could come from the ship we caught a ride down on they should be here in about three minutes pausert looked at the display great patham i never thought of them having atmospheric craft on board i suppose it makes sense and i suppose if i were that captain id be out looking for the idiots who endangered my ship too i hate the idea of shooting at them but wed better get the nova guns ready we could always hide said goth where asked pausert i mean what we can see of this place doesnt offer much cover there doesnt even seem to be any vegetation never mind a nice deep valley lightshift said goth theyll be searching hullmetal on their detectors when they get closer theyll try for a visual examination lets see if i can fool them that this is just an old wreck pausert nodded it does seem fairer than blowing them out of the sky a few minutes later two aircars dropped through the clouds pausert could dimly make out the craft circling the venture see if you can pick them up on the communicator hulik put the communicator on search and a few moments later they heard a voice seems to be an old wreck weve got the position marked down you can send a team out later to bring it in well go on searching outside the fliers cut their way away through the misty rain the captain took a deep breath you can stand down on the guns well have to get the venture up on her laterals and move her excuse me captain but why you heard them theyve got the position and theyre sending a team out later we dont want to be here perhaps we do said hulik slowly perhaps that would solve our problems they want the wreck well let them have it you saw what they do with themweld them into the lattice theyre always recruiting so we should be able to get ourselves a berth we can get ourselves and the venture off this world there was a silence it could work said the captain grudgingly it hurt to think of the old venture being welded onto the lattice like so much scrap but it did make sense its brilliant said goth and the leech wont work because the drive wont be running pointed out vezzarn were going to join the circus yay the leewit bounced cheerfully off the walls pausert took a deep breath all right what are we doing here and how long have we been here and what are we going to do when they find the venture isnt a wreck goth grinned i can keep the lightshift up the captain shook his head not indefinitely goth he sighed what do you think hantis this mission is about you she gave him her enigmatic smile her pointed ears twitched the most important thing is getting to the empress hailie actually getting there not being killed trying if that means pul and i must take roles in a human freak show then we will do that too if we can get away with it that is the men on that lattice ship were very angry and the captain is right goth cannot keep the lightshift going indefinitely we can do a little disguise work said hulik and make sure that the venture wont fly until we take a few pieces out of the safe and maybe deal with the communicator so it wont function we could claim to have been here for weeks have you got any plausible cargo for this place captain tinklewood fishing poles and some really ugly allweather cloaks and a few totisystem toys theyre whats left of the cargo i set off from nikkeldepain with i couldnt sell them anywhere hulik held up her hands perfect this would be the ideal place to bring both it has got fish in the streams and it has got rain pausert knew he was beaten besides he didnt have any better ideas there is some paint in the stores plenty of mud out there we can make it look like weve been here a while im going to make it look as if we have fuel and also that the systems wont work and somebody find me a lump of ash to put into the spot where i take the main transponder out of the communicator and we need to think about the story we all need to sing the same tune about when we got here where were from and why you let us deal with that said hulik youre too honest and truthful captain i guess someone has to be said pausert sourly he got to work on the communicator how do we know that these showboat people wont try any funny stuff slaves are still legal in the empire a hot set of witches like us should be able to deal with that said the leewit with a grin and skipped off by the time a dilapidated lifter from the lattice showboat arrived nearly twelve hours later the venture looked like a pretty genuine wreck that had been lying there for a fair while she wasnt called the venture any more either since theyd used that name while theyd been in orbit around vaudevillia appealing for help shed gone back to being the evening bird a name uldunes masters of ships paper fakery had provided for her run into the chaladoor the lifter like some gigantic longlegged insect settled over the body of the venture except for vezzarn who was sitting quietly at the nova guns they all trooped out into the rain and waved at the lifter the two people in the lifter gaped at them they flicked the cockpit open captain pausert noted that the short rotund glisteningfaced one had a blythe rifle pointed at them what are you doing here the skeletally thin pilot demanded his sharpplaned face taut with suspicion his voice harsh this is our ship we crashed here a couple of weeks ago said the captain as sincerely as he could the thin man relaxed visibly youre not from one of the other showboats no were traders with a load of tinklewood fishing rods and allweather cloaks we had a systems malfunction while we were landing we havent been able to fix it our communicator got trashed too hmm mind if we come on board asked the thin man still sounding suspicious captain pausert shrugged sure if your friend stops pointing that rifle at us the rifle muzzle shifted not one micron it makes me feel more secure said the plump man his face scintillating oddly in the cloudfiltered light there aint much law here on vaudevillia captain pausert shrugged again suit yourself he pointed up at the nova gun turret which was locked onto them it does seem a bit pointless though the glisteningfaced one nearly dropped his rifle its a trap pausert held up his hands pacifically no we are just being careful like you are you leave the blythe rifle there and well get vezzarn to deflect the turret all right we just want to call our ship first huh you try anything and the guys from the petey byrum and keep will fix you sure go ahead said hulik we have some allweather cloaks and fishing rods for sale or to trade for some extra rations a brief call to the lattice ship and the two men disembarked and came out of the rain and into the venture viewing them now in good light captain pausert thought that if hed been some alien captain meeting these members of the human race for the first time hed have been inclined to think that they were from two different species the thin man was so thin you could see every strap of sinew across his bones he was not actually particularly tall he just looked that way with the stiff bluedyed upright comb of hair on his head the short plump man was entirely hairless and his skin seemed to shimmer with different colorpatterns gleaming coming and going the leewit stared admiringly at him how does it work how does your skin go like that that broke the ice he bowed and winked im mannicholo the chameleon man he said with a grin halflizard halfman thats me the strangest creature in the universe i bet i could do it said the leewit firmly if i knew the trick go on tell me how it really works please she cocked her head and tried to look cherubic trade secret dearie mannicholo chuckled revealing rainbow striped teeth hes tattooed with various temperaturesensitive crystals explained the blue cockscombed man superciliously and he has tiny bits of reflective stuff imbedded in his dermis as the crystals get warm they change color and that color radiates heat better so they change color back again then he ducked folding himself under the swing of mannicholos arm with almost boneless ease and he hates me telling people ill fold you into shapes even you cant get into timblay growled mannicholo impossible said the man with the blue cockscomb bowing to them as you may have gathered from my compatriot mannicholo i am timblay otherwise known as the incredible folding man he looked around the control room there were parts of one of the panels artistically strewn about along with an array of tools you do seem to have something of a problem main drive firing sequencer wont work said vezzarn having gotten up from the nova gun controls we had a massive lightning strike just as we were trying to touch down it fried that and fried our communicator ah that can happen here said timblay understandingly this your first trip to vaudevillia pausert nodded he noted that timblay had eased over to the fuel gauges he flicked a glance down at them before asking casually repairable with a few spares were not carrying said hulik she pointed to the electronic components on the floor weve tried cannibalizing other stuff but so far it hasnt worked ah well maybe we can help each other exchange things as it were we have allweather cloaks to offer very good line remarkably effective im sure the outside crews will buy some said timblay smoothly but that doesnt really get around your problem does it youve got a fried communicator and drive sequencer and here you are stuck on a planet where you just cant buy spare parts no im afraid we cant sell them to you not even in exchange for your truly magnificent allweather cloaks but he smiled all teeth we can perhaps still reach an accommodation with each other help each other out get you off this damp spot and benefit us too what do you mean asked pausert suspiciously well this ship is useless to you its not going anywhere youre stuck on one of the wettest planets in the galaxy now in exchange for the shipwhich well use as a storeand some shorttime labor contracts well take you to another world with a spaceport pausert was surprised to see the glisteningskinned mannicholo who was standing behind timblay shake his head warningly well when it came down to it pausert had absolutely no intent of agreeing too easily anyway and while he was a reasonably skilled trader he had a pastmaster in his crew goth could get the better of anyone it doesnt sound like much of a bargain to me said pausert were just short a few electronic components were armed weve got a locally valuable cargo and weve still got our laterals firing well be able to start moving around on them find a fuel seller and arrange for the parts we need for the communicator at least after that well have to fight off customers sooner or later well get the spares we need no i dont think youve got a deal now if youd like to give us a lift back to pidoonfor a small fee of courseim sure wed be grateful timblay waved his hand dismissively i dont think wed be very interested pidoons not on the itinerary but why dont you come and talk to master himbo maybe he can reach a more mutually equitable deal with you well transport your craft there pausert shook his head well come but under our own steam im not having you claim salvage on the evening bird timblay pinched his narrow mouth up to every trick in the book are we captain aron from mulm well captain aron i see you have damage around your main airlock you arent the first wouldbe salvagers admitted captain pausert the venture proceeded to follow the lifter to the lattice showboat on the last dregs of fuel in her laterals in the gray driving rain the showboat loomed like a small dark mountain the lattice skeleton of triangular hullmetal girders was covered over not with the bright synthasilk of pauserts memories but a utilitarian black a small yellow digger was busy trenching and a work team was repairing a small exposed section of the lattice the showboat looked very workaday ordinary except it was very very big had it been a solid hullmetal thing it would have dwarfed a fair number of battledreadnaughtsand cost a small fortune in fuel to fly as it was the round plump half dome ringed with attendant smaller halfdomes could take crowds of thousandsand fly between planets at minimal cost the venture set down in front of the entry portal here on their homeworld with no customers to draw the showboat hadnt bothered to clad the two towers and arch in bright bunting and flags instead a guard with a disrupter cannon huddled in the small metal box above the rippling array of colors that formed fifteenfoothigh redandgold ornate letters petey byrum and keep the greatest show in the galaxy clumping awesome said the leewit chapter vezzarn stayed to man the guns mere fabric and ibeams would be a poor defense against the unpredictable might of the nova guns yes they could be taken hostage but the captain had made sure hed said loudly in earshot of their two escorts vezzarn if they try to take us captive just blow the lattice apart until they let us free theyre in a weaker position than we are weve got guns on petey b too you know snapped timblay more than a match for those antiquated novas pausert snorted at this range vezzarns only got to hit a couple of ibeams and the whole thing would fall over and were not threatening its just better being careful eh mannicholo definitely gave him a wink and a glance of amusement at timblay they formed a very small procession coming in out of the rain into the great cavernous interior where are all the levels where are all the stalls demanded the leewit dont put them up here on vaudevillia little un said mannicholo with a wry grin the stageshe pointed to several stages hung on girders higher up in the structureare there for rehearsals and practices but whats the use in setting out the bleachers for no one to sit on but the leewit blinked a tear away showing she was not as old or as tough as she pretended to be i thought it would be like like id seen it oh look she pointed across the space various of the shows animals were being exercised telebars cute mannicholo chuckled you should try mucking out their cages theyll probably get a chance to said timblay sourly and strode off ahead the rotund colorshifting man spat never mind him hes just sour because he never suckered you miserable fellow hes an artiste he said sarcastically doesnt like working with mere freak show folk like me youll be all right dealing with himbo petey hes mean but fair timblay would have tied you into a manual labor contract for the circus section if he could thats the hardest work any of you have an act thats best money we werent planning on joining the show we just wanted a lift offworld said hulik mannicholo grinned making colors dance and sparkle across his cheeks thats the only way off vaudevillia honey and himbo will never agree to a onestop hitch the showboat boss was a small dapper man with a little goatee and a pair of elegantly curled mustachios that pausert secretly envied he plainly loved his own appearance and had several fulllength mirrors in his office he paced as he spoke and paused occasionally to admire himself especially when he made dramatic gestures but no one he said calmly is a passenger on the greatest show in the galaxy in fact no one does just one job i myself am ringmaster i do a magic show in the sideshows i am the accountant and chief navigator and i play certain roles in the thespian section i also stand in on the harpsicordium from timetotime even our leading ladyand dame ethulassia is an exacting womancontrols the costumery we simply cant afford passengers well take your ship along but shell also have to work her passage props is in desperate need of more storage space you can have her back when your contracts expireprovided you replace her with a spacetight hulk of similar size but if you want off vaudevillia its as part of the troupe or not at all pausert shrugged hiding his thoughts a spacetight vessel even a derelict from a scrap merchant was going to cost at least a hundred thousand maels they could manage that easily enough if they could draw on their funds but as the experience on pidoon had revealed right now they couldnt that was a lot of money to try to earn otherwise and then theyd still have to refuel and to repair the venture theyd have to earn as much as they possibly could were multiskilled too for instance my niece dani here does great stage magic and is a skilled negotiator master petey shell dicker with you about our worth and how long well travel with you and at what rate himbo petey was plainly amused amateur stage magic isnt good enough for the greatest show in the galaxy captain aron i dare say the thespians will want you for crowd scenes and the animal trainers will want you for grooming and mucking out the lady with the pointed ears and the doggiepul growledarent even weird enough for the freak show goth sat down crosslegged on the office floor clapping her hands a ball of flames suddenly balanced on the upstretched fingertips of each hand she flicked them and they leapt from hand to hand captain pausert knew that it was just a lightshift but it certainly was very impressive then she clapped her hands again the balls disappeared in midair on her palms rested a paperweight from the showboat boss desk himbo petey grinned i take it back thats very good the flameballs are a neat one great distraction i almost didnt see you slip my paperweight from your sleeve and i am a professional can you juggle more than two flameballs how do you get them to go out when you clap goth shook her head trade secret but timing is pretty important ah himbo nodded misdirection excellent well get you a stall of your own or include you into one of the bigger shows do any of the rest of you have acts he called me a doggie can i bite him hantis just once ha a ventriloquist a good one too we dont have a talking dog act at the moment any more talents pul stalked forward youre a dead man churl now pul said hantis hes never met a grikdog before she gave the showboat boss an enigmatic smile i believe we are strange enough for your socalled freak show after all at this point the door was flung open a woman with a vast upstanding coif of brassy hair paused in the doorway making a grand entrance it was plainly something she did often and well himbo her voice was a rich contralto so strong it seemed to make the walls vibrate he sighed yes ethulassia youll get some of them youve told me you need them oh several hundred times already youll get even more staff though the thespian section gets far more resources than its financial contribution justifies it was plainly a wellrehearsed argument and by the way she was drawing breath about to become a loud one pausert began to rell vatch things could get worse after all the witches all stiffened hello big dream thing this is a fun place this he hardly heard dame ethulassias salvo something about adding quality and real worth to a tawdry show and drawing punters to the stalls that they would never visit otherwise he cleared his throat as himbo puffed himself up for the return volley and stepped between them i um have an act too when we came to vaudevillia we thought we might join one of the shows he sent a quick thought at the little silvereyed vatch this will be far more fun if you actually help me all right big dream thing both the showmaster and the leading lady stopped perhaps surprised that anyone would dare to interrupt them but with that little mischievous destructive vatch around it was a case of ride the direbeast or be devoured by it in a moment of madness pausert had chosen to ride the thing now as the two most powerful figures on the showboat stared at him he wondered if he might not have been better off letting the vatchlet just do its worst dame ethulassia surveyed him rather like a housewife choosing a piece of meat from a butchers counter she looked him up and down very slowly pausert felt himself blushing she raised a perfectly curved eyebrow then her expression seemed to soften considerably and just who are you sweetie she purred giving him the benefit of the full outthrust expansion of her frontage pausert felt himself blush some more captain aron at your service no sooner had he said this than pausert wished hed chosen some other phrase service is it that sounds intriguing youve got talent i can see youve felt the call of the stage havent you she had very red lips and long nails that matched by the look on her face goth didnt think much of dame ethulassia that could get even worse than the little vatch on the rampage oh yes i have often wanted to be on the stage but my real skills are in in escapology at the moment he wished he could escape from here ethulassia seemed be some sort of magician herselfthe incredible expanding bosomand goths expression had gone from sour to that blankfaced look which meant she was already plotting and scheming in ways that pausert really didnt want to think about i do some stage magic too pausert said hurriedly he pointed at the two girls with my nieces as assistants the leewit stuck her tongue out at him im a clown i dont assist the showboat boss had plainly recognized pauserts intervention for what it was even if he thought pausert was saving him from the leading lady and not vatchtrouble after all as a stage magician himself himbo knew the importance of distraction he shifted his cigar well show us something then er ill need some props himbo stepped across and opened a locker it was a large walkin locker meticulously arrayed with everything a conjurer might desire what can i offer you forcecuffs strong rope chains a lockable chest i ill skip the chest ill take the ropes forcecuffs and chains you sir and the good lady would you be good enough to tie my hands and feetattach the cuffs as welland then wrap the chains around me and padlock them and then put the keys in your pocket he sat down on the office floor and offered his hands and feet himbo and ethulassia tied and chained captain pausert up with considerable showmanshipand a speculative gleam in the leading ladys eyes which made him still more uneasy goths face now had that utterly blank expression which meant the little witchs brain had gone into overdrive it was a pretty fiendish brain when it wanted to be himbo displayed the ten feet of rope carefully engaging in a little tug of war with the leading lady ethulassia clicked the locks closed and then challenged hantis to open them displaying that they were indeed locked as they appeared to be and himbo insisted on tying his hands behind him there is no science to escaping if theyre in front of you he said cheerfully then he wrapped rope around pauserts chest in some seven or eight turns captain pausert thought having his hands behind him was a poor idea but he couldnt exactly say so and he wasnt too concerned about it anyway the little vatch had proved able to undo forcecuffs and locks before now if you could just drape two of those allweather cloaks over me dani he was covered from head to toe in voluminous allweather cloaks and sure enough the keys for the locks and the forcecuffs were in his hands a moment later thanks to goths teleportation skills the little vatch was giggling furiously and so pausert realized was everyone else well hed show them even if the vatch was not going to cooperate he had the keys now pausert began realizing that having the key in your hand was not the same as actually being able to get it into the lock of a forcecuff behind your back especially when your hands were tied he strained and twisted his hands and finally got the key to the keyhole it didnt fit it must fit the one on his feet with difficulty he managed to exchange keys he was concentrating fiercely by this time and was hardly aware of the laughter it was only when hed just managed to reach the lock the second timeand the key somehow twitched out of his fingers with more vatchy laughterthat he realized that while the rest of him was stifling and hot his back and hands were cold by the breeze blowing on their sweatiness they werent covered up no wonder everyone was laughing cringing with embarrassment with no thought except to get out of there captain pausert stood up clumsily as a man whose hands are manacled behind his back will the hot allweather cloaks falling away it was only when he was on his feet that captain pausert realized that his feet were no longer manacled or tied or even chained brilliant misdirection boy brilliant i didnt even notice you doing the legs pausert blushed this had gone so wrong he brought his hands up to hide his face it was only when the length of chain still on his wrist hit him on the head that he realized that his hands were free too all that remained of his bonds were the loops around his chest he realized that the little vatch had kept its promise after all he was free well almost there were just the loops of rope around his chest if he could pretend it was all planned he sent begging thoughts at the little vatch all he got was the tinkle of laughter he strained desperately at the rope strained and strained he felt the veins stand out on his forehead the ropes stayed as tight as ever pausert wilted im afraid something has gone wrong with this stage ill have to ask you to undo the knot or cut it he said lamely himbo got up from his perch on the edge of his desk and walked across never mind a fine performance anyway as good as any ive seen youll just have to practice that part and well need to find something better in the way of a cloak than those silly things turn around a moment later ho ho very clever very good indeed pausert wished that he knew just what piece of naughtyminded witchery had again sent everyone from that pestilential little vatch to dame ethulassia into gales of laughter of course he couldnt see it with a sinking heart pausert knew that just as pul and hantis had to sacrifice their dignity to being part of the freak show he would have to make a fool of himself in front of audiences across the empire well at least they probably wouldnt be going to nikkeldepain he was too gloomy at the thought to pay any real attention to the rope falling around his ankles or the little twist of flowers where the knot had been pausert sat in the control room talking to goth the venture was safely snugged into the latticework on the second tier her hold was now full of an assortment of ropes screens fake treasure chests featherlight swords and an eclectic collection of bricabrac furniture ranging from ornate ancient chairs to stools some showperson might just have stolen from an ultramodern bar somewhere you got us a good deal said goth hugging her knees and grinning youre a hot witch captain i wouldnt have thought of that trick with the flowers and i nearly died when the back of the allweather cloak lifted up so that we could see you and the keys she started laughing again it was so neat you had them all fooled actually goth i didnt plan any of that it was that dratted little vatch it was playing its tricks on me we were just lucky i guess lucks a klatha thing too captain pausert sighed were going to need it goth everything has gone haywire on this trip we expected an easy voyage and look at it weve lost our money weve nearly lost our ship ive even lost my best boots im getting used to these new ones now but theyre not the same goth examined the boots theyre pretty spiffy ones captain looks like lambidian iguana leather the captain looked at the boots in question they were smarter looking than he remembered theyre a spare pair ive had for years i certainly never had the money for lambidian iguana even my best pair were just tanned miffelhide but made to measure anyway i think boots are going be the least of my problems ill have to try to get that bit of vatch stuff i gave to the little one back i might be able to rely on that i cant rely on the little vatch ill be all chained up on stage and itll think it a capital joke to disappear i wonder if i can talk dame ethulassia into being chained up in one of your performances asked goth innocently you stay away from her pausert said sternly you do the same then goth growled even if im not marriageable age yet i dont want you fooling around with anybody else the captain rolled his eyes great not only does it seem ive gotten myself a pintsized fianceeand how did that happen exactly i dont remember anybody asking mebut shes jealous as medea to boot dont need to ask not on karres goth replied firmly whats bound to happen is bound to happen besides fairs fair im not fooling around with anybody else either of course youre not youre only twelve years old still fairs fair chapter well dame ethulassia said archly surveying pausert and the rest of his crew i suppose you want to know why i asked youhere she waved her hand at the rows and rows of theater seats beyond the stage at least pausert thought there were rows and rows of seats out there he could only see the first few goth was paying no attention to the dame at all instead she was peering into the darkness whos that she suddenly demanded richard cravan replied a rich and powerful voice from the darkness the voice seemed to echo as if in a great cavern sir richard cravan said dame ethulassia the founder and director of our theatrical company to the captains surprise she dimpled the smile made her seem a lot younger a lot more attractive too than her earlier great vamp performance for a moment the incredible bosom even seemed to belong to a real woman poor himbie he thinks i make all the decisions about casting but if he knew it was sir richard hed never let us have half the resources he gives me my dear lassia chuckled the voice you make as many decisions as i but you are the heart and soul of the company dame ethulassia replied pausert would have expected her to simper but she simply seemed serious almost reverent miss hulik would you step to the front of the stage please with a look of surprise hulik did so as she did pausert saw words appearing in the air between them and the theater this is a lovespeech miss hulik said the voice the lady in question is very young and so is her lover they just met this evening and fell instantly in love even though their families are involved in a deadly feud he has come to see if she feels as strongly as he doesas you do miss hulik he stands below you beneath your balcony let me hear you speak to him please hulik stepped forwardand to pauserts delight and surprise seemed to shed years and become someone else altogether he had known of course that the do eldel was an agent of the empress and as such was capable of many roles what he had not really understood was that she could act hulik started reading her lines from the words projected in the air without seeming even to pause what man art thou she whispered that thus bescreend in night so stumblest on my counsel by a name the voice replied sounding impossibly adolescent breathless and excited all at once i know not how to tell thee who i am my name dear saint is hateful to myself because it is an enemy to thee had i it written i would tear the word hulik clasped her hands before her gasping with mingled consternation and delight my ears have yet not drunk a hundred words of thy tongues uttering yet i know the sound art thou not romeo and a montague pausert listened and watched holding his breath and he was not the only one goth and even the leewit were doing the same the grikdog actually lay down and was gazing up at hulik soulfully and when he looked out of the corner of his eye at the dame expecting to see her eyeing hulik with jealousy he was shocked to see a tear trickling down her cheek and an odd little smile playing on her lips then hulik finished a very long speech that ended and not impute this yielding to light love which the dark night hath so discovered the voice said enough miss hulik thank you my dear lassia i believe you are correct historically it should be the handsome young lady beside captain aron of course butno there are some things it is better not to be accurate about and allowing juliet to be portrayed by a young adolescent is one of them its been too long dear richard since our little troupe has been able to stage romeo and juliet the dame said with a passion that surprised pausert i am many things and capable of many roles but i will no longer attempt to play a fourteenyearold girl it would be foolish and you are no fool captain aron sir pausert stepped forward may i ask if you have ever handled a sword as it happened he had fencing was one of the sports provided at school on nikkeldepain and hed tried it out of curiosity hed kept it up in the nikkeldepain navy since swordsmanship was something of a tradition there i fence a bit sir he replied cautiously well you surprise me pleasantly a captain who actually knows how to use a sword i thought that was illegal these days in fact the voice did sound extremely pleased but given that whoever the voice belonged to was obviously a consummate actor pausert didnt know if he was or not come captain step forward you are romeos best friend mercutioolder something of a bullyboy and just a little mad it was a favored role of mine but alas i have accumulated too many years for it now our hero has not met his juliet at this pointhe believes himself in love with another girl and his friend mercutio is trying to jolly him out of his depression by coaxing him to go to a party the voice changed somehow sounding again like that younger self that had spoken with hulik give me a torch i am not for this ambling being but heavy i will bear the light pausert had been looking at the words in the air and tried to put on a jollying tone nay gentle romeo we must have you dance not i believe me you have dancing shoes with nimble soles i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i cannot move romeo sounded like a moping little teenaged fool if i were his older friend what would i sound like when hes in a mood like this pausert wondered he made himself sound impatient more than a little tired of this theatrical depression you are a lover borrow cupids wings and soar with them above a common bound the voice was finished with him much quicker than with hulik good good youll do youre no barrymore mindbut if you can handle a sword at all youre head and shoulders above anyone else we might use for the part now misshantis is it please step forward new words appeared in the air you are something very different my dear your appearance suits you ideally for a creature known as puck he is not human is in fact a sort of magical spirit hes also exceedingly mischievous begin please hantis threw herself into the part with more enthusiasm than pausert had expectedmore enthusiasm than talent perhaps but the voice did not interrupt her too quickly good good that will do your appearance is half the thing and when ive explained what all that seeming nonsense youve been reciting actually means i believe youll do very well and the grikdog i believe he is called with jaws like that it behooves me not to offend him pul growled pul so it is pul indeed i mean to have you play one of titanias attendants and perhaps if you do well a much larger role in another play later on you might make an interesting caliban pausert hadnt a clue what all that meant but the dame clapped her hands with glee wonderful and miss hantis for ariel that was my thought now let me see what the others can do the voice ran through the rest of them in fairly short order goth did not seem to be at all unhappy that she was dismissed with a fairy an attendant on juliet and some crowd scenes i think but then she wouldnt be goth took a sly pleasure in being overlooked by people as long as the captain wasnt one of them the leewit of course scowled when she wasnt picked for a larger role but she didnt make any open protest her lips didnt even start to purse for a whistle pausert would have been surprised since the leewits selfesteem normally fell in the mistress of the universe range but there was something immensely authoritative about the voice that even seemed to affect her vezzarn however completely declined to even audition the voice be damned not me he declared redfaced couldnt recite at school wont do it now finally house lights said the voice the lights came up beyond the stage showing a tall grayhaired man sitting in the fourth row back as he stood it was clear that he had a couple of inches on pausert and that he had the sort of face that people would remember miss hulik i hope you understand just what dame ethulassia is sacrificing here he said gravely she is giving over the title role to you a newcomer not even a classically trained actress when it is she who has been the leading lady of our company pausert wondered if he had been the only one to hear the emphasis on the word classically clearly richard cravan was well aware that hulik was an actress even if he wasnt sure just what sort of actress she was believe me im grateful hulik said sounding as if she were piff said ethulassia with an exaggerated wave of her hands i still have titania lady macbeth and portia and lady capulet is not so bad a role anyway the great vamp returned alas and the incredible bosom underwent another suprahuman transformation ethulassia eyed pausert through lowered lashes i shall be able to play her with that hint of suppressed passion that ive always wanted to do cravan laughed well captain i believe that i can assure himbo petey that your crew is going to fully pay its way without anyone being relegated to roustabout or janitorial duty too frequently dame ethulassia will see to it that you all have copies of the four plays we will be doing with my explanations and annotations so that you can understand some of the archaic languages there will be a prompter in your ear and as you saw we have litetitles to be sure that if you forget your lines they will appear before you they can be adjusted so the audience cant see them our first rehearsal will be tomorrow morning that seemed to be a dismissal and pausert set at example by turning and exiting the stage he was followed by goth and then belatedly by the others commanding sort isnt he pausert remarked goth wrinkled her nose he didnt even consider that any of us might not want to be in his plays of course he didnt said hulik with a smile coming up behind them ive seen his type before born actors and he simply cant even imagine that anyone in his right mind wouldnt wish to be on the stage goth didnt seem put out though as long as it means less sweeping ill learn to like it well enough if it means less playing the fool ill definitely like it said pausert when the petey b lifted off pausert scarcely noticed he was used to the roar and acceleration of his own ship but of course a delicate structure like the lattice ship could not take such stresses and so was using obsolete but still perfectly functional orrisjawl engines the petey b simply elevated as gracefully and slowly as a puffseed slowly was indeed the hallmarkno fast getaways here they took hours to get into space with the ground of vaudevillia slowly growing farther and farther away pausert would have liked to watch but he was too busy when he wasnt learning his parts for the plays or rehearsing them he was practicing his escapism or he was dragooned into any one of a number of odd jobs that called for strength over the course of the petey bs return to space for instance he could have been found moving and stowing cargo bracing a ladder for one of the riggers in the big top or helping that same rigger haul up the net for the aerialists that experience was enough to convince him that actor was indeed the best job he could ask for on the ship truth to tell he was hoping he wouldnt even have to spend too much of his time on sideshow alley so he was pleased to discover that he had parts in all four of the new plays that cravans company was going to perform he was a character called bottom in a midsummer nights dream mercutio in romeo and juliet a servant called launcelot in merchant of venice and king duncan in macbeth goth and the leewit were particularly taken with macbeth for with some amusement sir richard had cast them at their own request as two of the three witches he had no idea why they wanted to play witches until at the first rehearsal goth played more of her lightshifts and levitated the potion ingredients into the huge cauldron adding a very interesting bit of business to the scene cravan said nothing more than hm but he agreed that they could have the coveted roles and added hantis as the third witch since this also meant that none of them would be doing as much muckingout for the animaltrainers they were delighted pul wasnt delighted at all true no one expected him to do any muckingout work but he was beginning to darkly suspect that hed soon be consigned to the mucking end of the businesslocked in a stall himself as if he were a mere animal fortunately for the limbs of all concerned he stopped growling and baring his teeth after sir richard allowed that the bards sacred work could be tweaked enough to permit one of the witches to have a familiar pausert was sorely puzzled by the dame she was almost two people one flamboyant and flirtatiousand still making sly innuendos regarding serviceoutside the theater the other when inside the theater was serious careful and clever treating everyone with respect and sir richard with nearveneration he said as much to goth and hantis shes an actress hantis replied immediately as if the answer was selfevident actress with a capital a well yes but so she doesnt confine her acting to the stage he thought about it but which one is the act hantis smiled but didnt answer the question goth just sighed shook her head and started muttering pausert didnt quite catch it all but some of it sounded like stupid useless klatha oughta be a way to get older quicker its not fair the leewit joined the clownsor joeys as they called themselvesfitting in as if she had been one all her life a group of four alike as clones took her into their tumbling act making her into a kind of human ball that they tossed about oddly enough the leewit didnt seem offended by the business the captain was surprised as a rule he would have thought the mistress of the universe does not take well to finding herself the beach ball of the galaxy himbo petey was certainly much happier about it a little girl being tossed about he could understand real witches he couldnt but however much himbo was puzzled by pausert and his companions it soon became obvious to the captain that he didnt understand the thespians at all he truly didnt understand the plays that sir richard was putting on or what motivated them to do it pausert walked in on the tail end of one of his argumentshis because it was entirely onesided sir richard might look as if the showmaster was about to drive him mad but he clearly wasnt going to budge but the audiences wont like it if the lovers are dead in the end himbo protested unhappily theyll walk out wait and see by the time they walk out the play will be over himbo so i hardly see where it matters but why cant you change the ending because then it wouldnt be a tragedy would it cravan waved a playbill under himbo peteys nose look thereits in four colors and full process the greattragedyofromeo and juliet i hardly think that the audience is going to arrive expecting jokes and thats another thingyouve got clowns in this play of yours but they arent wearing theyre only called clowns himbo cravan said wearily pausert got the feeling this was something that himbo petey had been told many times before ive explained this to you in the past they are not circus clowns they do not wear paint or clownsuits or red noses or big shoes it is a term that means well if it means dunces and fools then why dont you call them that petey asked resentfully oh never mind i still think you should rewrite the ending of that julioff and rominette thing people arent going to like it i tell you and not even all those sword fights are going to appease them after himbo petey bounced off indignation in every step cravan put his head in his hands one of the greatest classical tragedies of all time and he wants me to rewrite the ending bad enough that ive changed the language to something less archaic to satisfy him now he wants me to rewrite a masterpiece pausert felt he understood why himbo petey was so upset it was clear enough the showmaster really didnt understand any plays much less these petey couldnt grasp why people would be willing to sit for hours and watch live actors on a stage with limited effects and scenery when they could see the same story on holo replete with special effectsand with no human actors who might forget their lines in truth pausert wasnt sure he understood it either no matter how many times dame ethulassia tried to explain it to him petey was certain that displaying something that was going to make people cry instead of laugh was a bad idea and while pausert didnt agree with him entirely he wondered just how many people would be willing to watch something so primitive and so full of archaic language he reminded himself that fortunately the petey b didnt often set down on sophisticated worlds where there were holotheaters and threedee parlors and a vidscreen for every room in your house so maybe the audiences wouldnt have any objections certainly the staged sword fights were exciting things richard cravan plotted every single one of the moves and had all of the participants learn them to background music so that it was all like a complicated dance with the music telling you what to do and if something happened and you missed a move you didnt have to think about what was coming next all you had to do was pick it up at the next beat when he wasnt worrying pausert was enjoying that part far more than hed expected to but he was certain that his other act the escapist act wasnt going to come up to himbo peteys standards he hadnt relled vatch in days and while he thought hed probably be able to replicate what the vatch had done with goths help he was afraid by this time that not relling vatch meant that the wretched little creature would turn up at the worst possible moment he was worried about a lot of other things too the iss for one this new nanite plague that hantis had told them about for another the pirates why karres had disappeared again if he was ever going to get the venture back meanwhile hulik was also enjoying the situationfar more in his personal opinion than she should be she had thrown herself into her four roles with astonishing enthusiasm but it was the role of juliet that she was really reveling in she seemed to have forgotten all about their plight the poor old venture and the urgent need to get to the empress with whatever information that hantis had as for hantis herself well pausert never had been able to tell what the sprite was thinking anyway he hoped she was as worried as he was because everyone else even goth and the leewit was acting as if they really were children who had run away to join the circus even vezzarn he didnt have an act at all and as a consequence didnt have much choice but to muck out animal cages to earn his way but when pausert asked him in the middle of shoveling out several tons of fanderbag manure if he wasnt nearly dying with eagerness to get the venture fueled and fixed and get gone he looked up with astonishment what captain and give up show business pausert could only throw up his hands and walk away their first planetfall after vaudevillia was a little agroworld called hansons reach pausert was a little astonished by the backwardness of the place once you got a few miles from the port people actually used animals for transportation not farming though that was business and animals couldnt do the work that an allpurpose combine could do but the precious and expensive fuel was saved for farm machines no one wasted it on the unimportant matter of getting people from here to there the petey b set down just outside the port landing as slowly as shed taken off from vaudevillia her descent was announced by a shower of brightcolored leaflets as they drifted over the landscapeor to be more precise while the landscape drifted by underneath the petey b using the lattice ships inertial drives meant that hansons reach rotated under them and they slowly matched up to the planetary rotation the leaflet were vivid bits of butterflybright paper that were cut and shaped to fly like little wings in all directions they spread the word that the petey b home of petey byrum and keep the greatest show in the galaxy was beginning a limited engagement on hansons reach setting down by special arrangement just outside the main center of population and commerce limited pausert asked since hed heard of no set departure date mannicholo shrugged limited to as long as their money holds out the petey b certainly provided a spectacle that was as good as a parade as they set down and once they were down the setup was a show in and of itself if pausert hadnt been busy helping hed have wanted to watch it looked as if every man woman and especially child that could possibly get to the showboat was standing out there gawking stages were deployed the stays and struts that held up the synthasilk of the tents popped open tents were hauled up canopies unfolded bleachers and benches arrayed rigging rigged and ropes winched tight bunting and flags strung out to flap and snap in the breeze and lastly the huge banners depicting all the delights to be found within were dropped down to hang from every vertical surfaceand all of it was done to a chant of push em back haul em back take em back ho what that was supposed to mean nobody seemed to know but it was effective because it wasnt all autowinches and robotpulleys that did the work it was muscle and sweat of people and beasts the huge fanderbags were hitched in teams to pull up the biggest tentpoles grumbling and complaining the humpities did the same for the smaller poles and every hand that might be useful was put on a rope for the several hours it took to get the showboat up and running and when they were all finished the petey b looked very like the showboat of pauserts memories all brightcolored flags and banners and synthasilk veiling the workaday exterior of the lattice ship so that it hardly looked like a thing that could go to space at all and for the first time since theyd hitched up with the petey b pausert began to feel a tingling sensation of dread and fear and excitement that had nothing whatsoever to do with all of the predicaments that had brought them here chapter the free sedmon still in the portside alleys of gerota town had to pause and lean against the wall to cope with the nausea and the pain whats up chum said one of a pair of crophaired spacers who had just turned the corner too much of the local rotgut the sedmons were now very wary of even the most innocuous seeming encounter the free sedmon watched these two with some caution just stomach cramps i ate some dodgy local food the other spacer grinned stick to the grog next time at least youve got a decent excuse for being sick you need any help the sedmon was still far from trusting the two of them were coming a little too close and something in the second fellows voice sounded a bit off just trying to find the rest of my crew there are ten of us off the vanel have seen a bunch of guysone of them the size of two of metrundling around theyre probably looking for me by now or do you know where voyager smiles is its a posh little giftshop we were heading for if they had been thinking of any funny stuff the two werent anymore thoras place its just around the corner to your left said the first speaker tugging at his friends arm come on merk weve got things to do sure enough the sedmon found what hed set out to look for the gift shop was an expensivelooking establishment in a considerably more respectable street a mere two blocks from the spaceport a much safer street too from its appearance inside the sedmon gave the haughty proprietress a near heartfailure the daals agents did have certain code recognition symbolsindividual ones so not a bit of good came of torturing or drugging them out of someone the words that thora herrkin heard from the lips of the slightly shakylooking man were not something she was prepared for but she knew that shed better give him the best cooperation and help possible the sedmon in the truthshock chair on the other hand was giving his captors as little help as possible it was possible for him to do that because now that he was aware of what was coming he could split the electroshock between the selves of the hexaperson the sensation made all of them feel more than a little ill but it was bearable so he just resigned himself to a period of unpleasantness indeed he was almost serene about the whole matter one of the great advantages of being a hexaperson was that he had complete and total confidence in his closest associates and why not they were him after all evening and the local iss headquarters were both close for the sort of money the daal had on call recruiting a few extroopers willing to do a great deal with no questions asked had been an easy enough task and from thora who was now very eager to oblige the sedmons knew of the disastrous happenings on pidoonand that the venture had once again abruptly and mysteriously disappeared some of them are still on the run sir its a bit confusing but a woman reputedly called captain elin and a couple of her men are hiding out somewherealong with a local hoodlum called fullbricht the iss cant find them but my partners know where they are theyre in a small farm just outside town next to the lake fullbricht keeps a boat there he uses for dropping ah ferroplast statues into the water the sedmon scowlednot at the ruthlessness involved in submerging corpses but at the pettiness of the whole situation local criminals and their pitiful attempts at being murderous bah in times past the daals of uldune had terrified entire star sectors they were momentsnot often but this was one of themwhen the sedmons regretted their modern civilized ways the hexaperson cheered himself up with the thought that on the other hand they still werent all that civilized well arrange a visit then he said coldly just as soon as we have the matter in hand dealt with a shiftylooking man in spacers clothes was ushered into the back office of the gift shop where the sedmon had set up his makeshift temporary headquarters the man handed over a spaceship lockkey and a chronometer the chronometer got brought to the hockshop about twenty minutes back one of the boys extracted the key from slick wullie ah said the gift shop proprietress do you want him dealt with the free sedmon winced his captive clone was being tortured again no there is no point in drawing attention to the matter any further is my ship still being watched not since about ten minutes back said the everefficient thora good let us proceed then the sedmon along with thora and the hired mercenaries went back to the thunderbird in a nondescript van a few minutes later they set off for iss headquarters with a cutter and two cylinders one had a highly illegal anesthetic in it it was nearly odorless and fast acting the other was a rather unpleasant standby but the sedmons were rather tired of taking the pain and theyd never been fond of the iss to begin with there was a small basin in the corner of the iss rooms where a fastidious torturer could wash his hands between beatings the drainage pipe from the basin bubbled as the gas was pumped through but as sedmon inside was cued by sedmon outside his screams hid the noise quite well the hexaperson encountered the strange sensation of having one of themselves gently pass out somewhat regretfully the sedmon satisfied himself with simply extracting his clone if hed had the time and the additional space in his vehicle a number of iss agents would have become ferroplast statues providing shelter for fish at the bottom of a lake but he simply left them there he consoled himself with the thought that recovering from that particular anesthetic was an excruciating experience if you didnt possess the antidoteof which he had enough for his clone but no one else that was partly why hed picked it well that was mainly why hed picked it not all that civilized even the modern daal of uldune fifteen minutes later the plain van and two other vehicles were making a visit to a small farm by the lakeside one of the exsoldiers a former sergeant in the imperial naval infantry studied the place through his nightscope then he offered the device to the awake sedmon while the clone in the car went through waking up with the help of a wellpaid medical assistant if thora thought the two looked remarkably alike she was sensible enough not to say anything or question the money in her account the sedmon using the nightscope examined the farm carefully the incredibly expensive devices sophisticated thermoimaging even allowed him to study the farms inhabitants quickly he was able to determine that there were three people in the building the crew of the ventureincluding the one the sedmons were particularly concerned aboutwere not among the inhabitants the sedmons would have been surprised if they had been but having the assumption confirmed caused a momentaryand most disconcertingspike of anguish across lightyears the hexaperson issued a collective sigh not because of the disappointment so much as the simple fact of it they had lived a life of splendid isolation after all and the recognition that they now intended to give it upif at all possibleproduced very mixed feelings the sedmon watching through the nightscope didnt personally recognize the trio in the farm but the sedmons back in the tower at the house of thunders had access to a great many records they found her and her associates the sedmon turned to thora there is an imperial bounty on her head a million maels i believe her real name is nairdoo sheyan among other things shes wanted for the mass murder of the miners on coolums world the second one henry bagr is worth a mere fifty thousand the third i believe is your local fullbricht fellow hell be worth something too i imagine though not much do we get a cut inquired thora she looked as if she regretted the words almost as soon as she said them but sedmon smiled at her you can have it all thora youve been most efficient and helpful and i believe in rewarding those of my subordinates who are your talents are clearly wasted anyway just smuggling and spying and selling expensive trinkets a thought came to him although before i leave the planet ill want to purchase a suitable trinket for ah someone a young lady i have just the thing good and now lets finish this business the smile was still on the sedmons face but it had become a very grim sort of thing he had no way of knowing it but at that moment thora had no doubt at all that her boss was in the direct line of descent from the daals of uldune who had committed far worse crimes than even such as nairdoo sheyan the reward specifies dead or alive he murmured make that dead if you please the sheyan creature has been threatening certain ah interests of mine and im not in a charitable mood chapter whos that pausert asked mannicholo sharply pointing to a sausage vendor strolling among the audience the man looked perfectly ordinary with his hotbox of sausages slung over his shoulders and not a sign of manner costume or oddity to mark him that was suspicious for it meant he was too ordinary to be one of himbo peteys people eh oh local petey has all the real food here sold and made by locals locals but i thought we sold mannicholo shook his head vigorously so that his facial colors swirled like oil on the water all we sell are carnisnax that come straight out of the replicators carnicorn carnifluff carnipops carnicreme carnibars carnibites and carnislurps fat sugar starch water and salt is all thats in them one hundred percent artificially flavored and nutritionally null packed with enough preservatives that if you pick up a pak in a thousand years it still wont have passed its sellby date the stuffs pure garbage but its guaranteed not to poison any sapient in the known universe real food gets sold by the locals and we take a cut that way we dont have to store and cook real food for more than the crew and if anybody gets poisoned or wants to claim he has been he has to take it up with one of his own people pausert eyed the vendor with disfavor it was going to be hard enough to try and pick out possible crooks iss agents freelance spies and piratical agents out of the crowd as it was with a lot of loose locals being given carte blanche to run around backstage for the purpose of selling sausage rolls and funnel cakes it was going to be even harder you could hide almost any sort of spying mechanism in one of those food boxes and you could hide weapons too he tried to convey his concern to the rest of the ventures crew as they waited for the stagehands to set things up for a final dress rehearsal hulik just gave him an opaque look saying it will be just as hard for any spies to find out who we are captain we are part of the showboat family now and they are notoriously close mouthed around strangers especially when someone has come around asking questions about one of their own hantis said nothing i can smell a spy a mile away growled pul dont you worry about that the leewit looked positively bored were smarter than they are she said with the absolute confidence of a sevenyearold mistress of the universe they havent caught us before and they wont now pausert decided not to remind her that being encased in ferroplast didnt fall in with his definition of not being caught goth at least looked as worried as he felt i dont like it either she admitted but we cant keep them off the ship well just have to be careful that didnt fit his definition of a solution either pausert worried about it so much that all through rehearsal he kept missing cues and his marks hed have thought that richard cravan would be so angry with him that hed be fired from the thespians outrightbut nothing whatsoever was said in fact cravan looked guardedly pleased pausert couldnt figure out why and said so aloud alton morrisey the male romantic lead who was playing romeo to huliks juliet looked up from his script bad dress good opening he said abruptly it took pausert a moment to decipher that he decided that it must be another of the thespians superstitions like never whistling in the theater and always referring to macbeth as the scottish play and richard the third as dick threeeyes presumably it meant that a bad dress rehearsal resulted in a good opening performance he hoped that was right although for someone like himself who had been trained as a space pilot the logic was downright bizarre but pausert decided not to worry about it he was feeling more relaxed anyway since now that every single one of them was in stage makeup most of the time he realized that theyd inadvertently stumbled across an splendid antispy technique he was certain that not even his own mother would recognize him done up in a foxycolored wig as mercutio nevertheless despite all of his other worries the moment the curtain came up somehow he forgot all of them he watched raptly from the wings as sampson and gregory who were capulet servants complained that they would not put up with insults from the montague family then abram and balthasar montague servants appeared and the four started quarreling benvolio lord montagues nephew appeared and tried to break up the quarrel but tybalt lady capulets nephew appeared and picked a fight with benvolio that was pauserts first cue himbo petey had enforced his will on richard cravan at least to this extent he insisted on melees of the largest possible size whenever there was supposed to be a sword fight so the captain rushed onstage to join the action here richard cravans cleverness showed itself every pair of fighters had only four moves to memorize two attacks and two parries the secret was that each pair had different combinations so that it looked like an amazingly complex and very realistic fight in fact out in the audience pausert could hear cheering and bets being placed every actor who knew how to handle a sword was doing soeveryone else was waving or wielding foam batons disguised as clubs or singlesticks even goth the leewit and hantis were doing so while pul put in his bit by lunging into the melee andcarefullyseizing the leg of one of the actors it was a wellrehearsed bit of business pul dragged the fellow offstage while he screamed at the top of his lungs at length officers tried to break up the fight even while lord capulet played by cravan and lord montague played by himbo petey began to fight one another the prince of verona finally appeared and stopped the fighting proclaiming sentences of death to any that dared to break the peace of the city again pausert could then retire from the stage with everyone elseand to his amazement he found himself shaking with excitement the cheers of the crowd had acted on him like a drug and it was a drug he wanted more of but he could not have any just then for the curtain fell and came back up on montagues house and there were two more scenes before his next entrance in scene four he got to observe hulik then in her first real stage appearance as juliet even though he had watched her in rehearsals her full performance left him blinking he would have sworn on his life that she was hardly more than a young girl in her midteens at most maybe some of that was makeup but the rest was acting hed seen her act the seductress often enough but it was a revelation to see her play the complete innocent and do so convincingly her performance left him vowing to make his mercutio alive and real to those people out there so when he swaggered onstage he threw himself into his part with everything he had he had to stay onstage in the background for the rest of the party scene and great patham if he wasnt half in love with young juliet himself before it was over and he knew her when he finally made his exit to gratifying applause he felt almost drunk it was wonderful wonderful who would have guessed that he had the makings of an actor in him who would have guessed that it was so intensely satisfying he began to wonder if perhaps when this was all over maybe he could come back to the petey b and resume his place here and that was when he relled vatch oh no he breathed and looked frantically about for it but it was not his nemesis the little silvereyed one it was another big one and he didnt even wait for it to announce itself or start in on mischief while juliet and romeo played out their first love scene he closed his eyes and made klatha hooks and tore into the thing ow stop ow it shouted at him shocked and dismayed stop it dream thing this is my dream stop it right now go away he thought back at it this isnt your dream its mine and i dont want you in it ow spoilsport the vatch whined vicious beast see if i ever dream about you again it took itself off to wherever vatches went leaving behind little black patches of vatch stuff pausert collected it all up and that was when he relled vatchagain this time it was the little silvereyed vatch hee hee it crowed with glee you got him good suddenly he smelled a rat a vatchyrat you lured that vatch here didnt you he thought at it suspiciously you wanted me to beat him up sure i want to get bigger and you can help me and you know what im not sure youre a dream thing at all i think you might be a real thing coming into my dreams like another vatch suddenly pausert felt very cold all over here was something he had worried about for a long time staring him in the face the vatches were some sort of interdimensional beings who thought of pauserts universe as nothing more than a dream and good only for entertainment value so they were inclined to meddle and make trouble for the amusement of it but that also meant that they didnt take any of what they saw and did too seriously but if they actually realized that all of this was as real as their own universe what would they do try and destroy it for instance oh dont be such a fraidy the vatchlet said scornfully i wont tell you help me big maybereal thing and ill help you how he asked skeptically give me that vatch stuff so i can get bigger im tired of being little they pick on the little ones im not sure thats a good idea pausert reminded himself forcefully that he couldnt actually control this sort of vatch only distract it even as little as it was the thing had been something of a nightmare grown big and powerful ill help you the vatchlet countered i promise if you give me the pieces of vatch stuff ill only do what you ask me to well pretty much please he wanted to ask goth for advice but there wasnt time and this vatch while full of mischief had never actually done anything malicious unlike the big windy for instance now there was a vatch that could stand having a few more bits pulled out of it all right he agreed pulling the vatch stuff out of his pocket but you have to ask me before you go luring any more vatches here for me to beat up and if i dont have the time right then youll just have to wait it absorbed the shadowy patch of vatch stuff before it answered and even as it grew bigger it also seemed to become a little more serious all right i promise you must be a real thing i finally figured out this place has linear time i wouldnt dream something as silly as linear time so youve got to be real anything you want me to do oh my he thought not only more serious but more intelligent it made him wonder just what the vatches actually were and how they normally got big not right now he said hastily his next cue was coming up just er watch and enjoy the show this isiskind of awakedreaming that we realthings do to tell a story to each other is it what fun oooo pausert sensed it somehow looking over the audience its just a story like a dream but theyre excited like its all real yes and some of them already know what the ending will be but theyre still excited he was pleased to have given it a new sort of diversion watch them watching us and youll see then his cue came and he swaggered back onstage by now the audience had decided that they liked him especially when he played his bawdy tricks on juliets nurse they were laughing at the slapstick humor of it and even though half of his attention was on the vatch he thought he had completed the job that richard cravan had set himto make the audience care about him so that when tybalt killed him well that was for later he took his exit and realized that the little vatch was gone he heaved a sigh of relief one less thing to worry about for now and that was when it stopped well acting like a vatch he concluded as goth and the leewit stared at him or at least like the vatches ive run into before we always knew there were some vatches that couldnt be controlled even by a really good vatchhandler like you what im wondering now is whether thats just because the vatches we usually run into are just well vatchstyle village idiots the leewit scowled but it was her thinking sort of scowl you did all right captain she said finally i think maybe goths right its not a new sort of vatch but just one you dont run across too often you think if it eats vatch stuff and keeps getting smarter maybe someday itll get smart enough to leave us alone pausert shrugged as long as its willing to play nice i dont care im not going to give it too much vatch stuff though what if it gets smart and big then decides to really mess with us by that point itd be so big i couldnt distract it anymore by tickling it with klatha hooks good thinking the leewit agreed just as her chrono chimed oops got to get to the big top she scampered out of the dressing room so fast she might just as well have teleported to the circus side of the ship pausert glanced at his own chrono she had about half an hour to get into her clown costume and makeup before the entrance parade it was the first time hed ever seen the leewit making sure she was on time for anything that worried him she was enjoying her role in the circus maybe enjoying it too much were fitting in here entirely too well said goth in an echo of his own thoughts pul shouldered his way into the dressing room growling back over his shoulder at the nartheby sprite and hulik who were following him and youre liking this too much he said what about our mission what about the nanite plague what about the empress hulik smiling faintly leaned back against a wall and started removing the long wig she wore as juliet hantis folded herself into a chair i am liking this but i havent forgotten pul she said seriously the trouble is there are entirely too many people trying to find us the agandars pirates not to mention the iss for all i know the sedmons might even be looking for us one at a time we could evade but until we shake some of the hunters off every time we start to run were only going to run into someone else and the only way we can shake them is by doing what were doing going to ground not poking our noses up until weve lost some or all of them were going to ground the grikdog said blinking i thought we were earning fuelmoney repairmoney our passage and buying the venture free were also in hiding in the best way possible way said hulik were not hiding pul shook his head rapidly his ears flapping like a pair of frantic wings hiding not in hiding you two are making my head hurt mine too said pausert and i have to agree with puli think you all like this life too much if we tried to actually hide anywhere chances are that wed be found hulik insisted believe me its the hardest thing in the world trying to stay underground you have to eat you have to drink and sooner or later you nearly go crazy for a bit of open space around you and people will always be looking for you and looking at you if you act as if you dont want to be seen but if you do what were doingwhy were not in hiding are we were some of the most visible people on the petey b three shows a day for most of us two shows in the freak show or the big top and one on stage out in front of thousands and thousands of people obviously were not trying to hide but she held up a finger as hantis nodded do we look like the people that the iss and the pirates are trying to find do we act like them well no admitted pul goth was apparently rethinking the matter if we do witchery here people will just assume its tricks she admitted and theyll figure were working on something new for the acts nobody believes in karres witches on the petey bi know ive nosed around they think its all misdirection and mirrors hulik spread her hands you see she said to pul and pausert theres something else i dont think youve noticed outsidepeople are always asking personal questions about youwho are you where are you from where are you going who do you know whats your business hadnt you noticed not even himbo petey asked very much about us well said pausert slowly his brow wrinkling as he thought back i guess youre right ive been monitoring his dataaccess captain said goth he just did superficial checking on us to make sure we werent wellknown violent criminals or something after that he didnt seem to care he doesnt care hulik said firmly showboat people are often people hiding something or running from something trying to live something down or trying to forget something thats why nobody goes poking their noses in where theyre not invited i expect if i ran full security checks on everyone on the petey b there wouldnt be more than a handful of people who would pass everybody has a secret and in order to keep their own secrets they protect the secrets of everyone else in the family were part of the family now and if any outsiders come poking around asking questions theyll get as many stories about us as there are people they ask and not one of those stories will be anything like the truth at that goth started to chuckle that explains why mannicholo was telling the clown master that the captain and the leewit and me are all cousins that ethulassia talked himbo petey into hiring away from a big important theater company on rellart where we were all stars hulik echoed goths chuckle and last i heard you pul are actually a weredog from kolatteand youre the real ventriloquist because hantis is a mute she smiled and began to comb out her wig the stories will only get wilder and less believable everyone will make a up a different one to help protect us without any of us even hinting that we need protecting so were as safe here as we could be anywhere outside of the empress palace that may be true pausert said grudgingly but what about our mission the mission is only going to end badly if we get caught pointed out hantis so well just have to be patient and do what we can when we can until we can break away without being chased and right now i think that means doing your escapist show over on sideshow alley said goth looking meaningfully at his chrono pausert left shaking his head they were probably right but he didnt like it if anything he was even more worried because the longer they stayed here the harder it would be to leave after all wasnt this a dream come true didnt everyone want to run away to join the circus the trouble was running away was the last thing he wanted to do pausert woke up in the darkness and relled vatch hello big real thing it saluted him cheerfully for once he was happy to salute it back hello silvereyes he thought at it i have a question for you oh a question now i know youre a real thing dream things dont ask questions he thought about asking the vatch if it was different from other vatches but realized that was a stupid question and would deserve a stupid answer after all if the vatch had asked him if he was different from other humans hed answer yes of course any human would do all vatches get bigger and smarter when they eat vatch stuff he asked instead silvereyes laugheda new difference it used to giggle bigger sure not always smarter though a lot of the big ones are really stupid but you do get smarter and bigger of course thats why i want more vatch stuff being smarter is a lot more fun than being stupider are there more vatches who can do that if he was going to run into a plague of uncontrollable vatches he wanted to know about it not many and when we get smart enough we can go to the place the thought of seemed untranslatable but the clear sense pausert got was that it was a place that was very desirableand very much not here he decided not to ask silvereyes any more questions about it it probably wouldnt mean anything to him and it just might be one of those strange klatha things that would turn his head inside out if he did understand it ive thought about something you can do for me then id like it if you can make trouble for the dream things that start to make trouble for us not the ones that only pretend to make trouble he added hastily like the ones in that showstory that the others and i play in or the way the clowns toss the leewit around i mean real trouble like when you were trying to hide little and teeth that was a neat trick the way you twisted light around i never would have thought of it myself until i saw you do it what pausert got along with the words little and teeth were impressions of hantis and pul that concentrated on the nartheby sprites relative height and puls formidable jaws pausert thought about trying to get the vatch to identify them by their names but it was probably a lost cause yes if that sort of person is going to make trouble id like you to make their lives as difficult for them as possible for once he reflected he was not going to have to worry about people seeing impossible things this was a circus and anything that appeared impossible would without a doubt be chalked up to smoke and mirrors and stagetrickery i might agreed the vatchlet since that was probably the most he was going to get out of the creature the captain left it at that it had already promised not to make trouble for them which was more than he had ever gotten out of a vatch before this feed me can you bring me something to feed you with he countered think so its presence faded away and he started to drift back to sleep again when he suddenly relled something big and right on top of him with a muffled startled yell he formed klatha hooks and sank them into the thing the vatch was almost as startled as he was even more so when it knew it had been caught it literally ripped itself off his hooks and vanished silvereyes appeared the instant it was gone and he sensed it dancing with impatience when it saw the bits of vatch stuff clinging to his hooks feed me once again pausert realized silvereyes had lured a big vatch into the area he was irritated at the little vatchit could have at least given some warningbut he gave it what it wanted and once again saw it growing just a tiny bit bigger ill watch it said then in a voice that seemed a bit more mentally resonant then it faded away again unable to make up his mind if he had done a good or a bad thing pausert turned over and finally got back to sleep there seemed to be no immediate fallout from the agreement the next day which was just as well since the theatrical company was now in rehearsal for a second play in the morning while continuing the performances of romeo and juliet in the evening and one of the works theyd already had in their repertoire in the late afternoon that one was called twelfth night and required a much smaller cast contrary to himbo peteys glum predictions the audiences here seemed to have no objections to a play that ended in tragedy but richard cravan decided that the second play put into performance with his augmented cast should be a comedy he chose a midsummer nights dream in order to use hantis and pul pul goth and the leewit were creatures called fairies with fairly extensive speaking roles hantis was the puckcreature that cravan had mentioned by name and hulik played one of the two romantic parts a girl by the name of helen as usual cravan himself acted as well as directed playing king oberon ethulassia was titania his queen even vezzarn was pressed into service this time this was a play with an enormous cast even bigger than romeo and juliet and cravan recruited people from all over the showboat for nonspeaking roles if they were able to come in on cues and hit their spots had interesting faces or could dance a little they would find themselves filling a place in crowd scenes and pausert found himself playing the clown bottom against dame ethulassia now that put him in an extremely uncomfortable position for ethulassia was supposed to fall in love with him thanks to a magical love potion administered by puck he couldnt tell if her flirtatious manner onstage was part of her act or some notsosubtle attempt to get his attention offstage maybe he was enjoying his performances as mercutio a little too much and this was the fates way of getting back at him and the more he as bottom tried to evade ethulassias cooing caresses the more she pursued him cravan found this interpretation to be hilariously funny so evidently did almost everyone else in the company for many of the cast members congratulated him on an original take on the character goth simply gave him sidelong opaque looks saying nothing the leewit on the other hand taunted him with scathing remarks under her breath whenever he was just within earshot hantis and hulik were amused vezzarn couldnt understand why he wasnt following up on ethulassias flirtations only pul seemed to sympathize with him and he had not forgotten silvereyes either though if the little vatch was around it was staying so far out of his way that he couldnt rell it at all he finally cornered both the girls and told them what had happened the last time it had come around so now i think maybe ive gotten us deeper in trouble than we were before he said worriedly the leewit shook her head i dont know she began but goth let out her breath in a hiss huh she said i just thought of something captain what if the vatches we see are alloh in a coma or something they arent stupid theyre just braindamaged thats why they think were dreams and the ones like silvereyes are the ones that are going to wake up if they can just get enough vatch stuff put together maybe they need it to get their brains back online now pausert felt guilty as well as worried thats horrible he replied if thats true then im beating up on goth waved her hand at him we dont know that she reminded him we dont really know anything much about vatches and anyway they dont have any guilt over making our lives miserable so i dont see why you should feel guilty about what youre doing maybe itll teach some of them not to mess us up besides the leewit said firmly silvereyes is one of the kind that you cant control the sooner you get it out of our universe and into some place else the better well he could agree with that but it just didnt make him feel any better chapter sedmon the sixth daal of feared and bloodsoaked uldune looked at the exquisite little jewel box inset with chalcosites and pieces of peacockblue lepida pua nacre it was a pretty little trinketnot to mention a very expensive one but would the intended recipient like it with that person it was hard to know and more to the immediate point where was she where were the rest of them for that matter he knew the venture had had little air a leaking airlock and very little fuel when it had evaded destruction at the hands of the imperial navy off pidoon despite these rather unpromising circumstances he was fairly certain theyd have gotten away in the hexapersons youth sedmon had once made the mistake of taking karres lightly threbus and toll had given the daaland a goodly portion of his space fleeta polite but firm lesson two witches and he almost hadnt had much of a fleet left ever since uldune had bent over backwards not to irritate the witches and ever since sedmon had been careful not to underestimate them and to wear his telepathy disturbing skullcap when they were around it had been made abundantly plain to him that if worse came to worst the witches could do without spaceships or even spacesuits hulik do eldel couldnt neither could his former spy vezzarn though that did not trouble him much and he privately suspectedalthough he had no proofneither could captain pausert but pausert might be one of the karres witches you never could be absolutely sure sedmon hoped notbecause he was very sure that the little wisdom with pausert would not abandon him which would probably mean keeping hulik alive too but there was no trace of the blasted ship if theyd only used the drives inside an atmospheric envelope the detectors wouldnt have picked that up unless they were dead or had used some form of karres witchery lightyears away on uldune the other sedmons concurred they used the house of thunders elaborate astrography equipment to look for possible destinations for ships low on air and fuel vaudevillia came up on top of the probability list since they had no better leads the thunderbird left for the planeton the same day as it happened when the pidoon vidcasts were trumpeting the demise of the infamous nairdoo sheyan pirate murderer of coolums world along with two of her criminal associates the trail might have run cold on vaudevilliaexcept that a lucrative offer got a freighter captain to remember that someone had been trying to scrounge fuel and air the captain also recalled some radiosqualling about a vagabond hitching a ride on a very unwilling lattice ship for the first time in many days the sedmons smiled they were aware of the habit of lattice ships of using old hulks for airtight holds such a maneuver would confound most of the people pursuing the venture sure enough for a time at least sedmon nodded to sedmon pausert hes a cunning one well need a trace on as many lattice ships as possible uldune and her operations had many agents and subradio meant the news could be sent fast two days later the sedmons were in pursuit of the petey b chapter by the time that cravan had all four of the new plays in production most of the free money on hansons reach had found its way into the coffers of petey byrum and keep the silvereyed vatch had lured two more victims within the reach of pauserts klatha hooks and had gotten fed twice more despite pauserts feelings of lingering guilt then the petey b took to space again and pausert felt that he was finally going to be able to relax for a while well from having to look for spies and agents around every corner at any rate he suspected that with more free time on her hands dame ethulassia was going to become a bit of a problem as indeed she did but pausert was able to evade that danger in a generally satisfactory manner although on one occasion he apparently didnt extract himself from her company quite quickly and smoothly enough at least the captain assumed that it had been goth who teleported a still alive and wriggling jellysnail into his soup they set down again on another agroworld this time not quite as primitive as the lastwhich was not in pauserts opinion an advantage tornam was not backwards and isolated it had a real spaceport that saw more than the occasional slowfreighter and desperate trader there were five other spaceships already on the field when the petey b set down on it tornam also had an iss office hulik tried to reassure him that it was just a little backwater of a place and that even if the agents in charge had even heard of the venture and its crew they would hardly look for them snugged into a showboat they would expect such desperate criminals to be trying to hide not starring in a play it didnt help in truth the only reason pausert wasnt starting at every sound and looking over his shoulder constantly was that irrational as it was he had begun to trust the little silvereyes or perhaps he just trusted that the vatch had come to realize that there was great deal more amusement to be had from helping pausert and his crew than from trying to trip them up at every turn but he still had the nervous certainty that disaster of some sort was just around the corner a feeling of a metaphorical storm just below the horizon yet when disaster came it had nothing to do with pausert and the others it didnt even happen in or around the showboat itself it happened when the second lead of cravans company ken kanchen was in bevenford the largest town on the planet kanchen took the part of tybalt in romeo and juliet of horatio in hamletpretty much any male part that required a handsome face athletic ability solid if not inspired acting and the ability to memorize a part in two days he wasnt even there to do anything that could have conceivably gotten him into trouble he was running a simple errand visiting a local bookshop unfortunately he stepped back into the street just at the wrong time traffic laws on tornam were haphazard kanchen ended up under a floater and then in a hospital with more broken bones than anyone wanted to think about he was just lucky that he was still aliveand that his handsome face was still untouched not even sir richard could manage to act the part of tybalt in a full body cast himbo petey had kanchen brought back aboard the petey b as soon as possible of course a ship the size of a showboat usually had a sick bay as good or better than anything a provincial planet could provide and the petey b was no exception to that besides the showboats had a long tradition of taking care of their owneven people not as wellliked as kanchen was by virtually everyone in the company and crew the poor man was guaranteed better roundtheclock nursing as well as superior medical care his problem would not be a lack of care and company but a surfeit of it but the thespians were without their second male lead they were stretched so thin now that there was no understudy cravan was beside himself theres no help for it he said at last after a meeting of the full company determined that there wasnt anyone able or ready to step into kens shoes ill have to call for outside auditions youll all have to help me otherwise well never find someone we can lick into shape in any reasonable period of time a groan went up dick cried alton youre going to kill us the last time we had to hold a cattle call on plankelm i was ready to slit my wrists before it was over yes but that cattle call netted us trudi cravan countered and shes the best female character ive seen inwell longer than i care to think pausert glanced over at the plump middleaged woman who played juliets nurse she shrugged but smiled tornam is more populous than plankelm trudi commented a lot double the population in this city alone double the number of clueless idiots who think they can act alton groaned it could be worse cravan pointed out ruthlessly we could be looking for a juvenile then wed have stagemothers to contend with if you dare inflict that on us i will slit my wrists alton started clawing at the prop dagger at his waist right i want panels of four cravan continued ignoring him each one headed by an experienced lead which miss hulik i regret to say does not include you alton lassia trudi myself hembert doeen and killary thats six for initial auditions with my panel making final judgment panel heads pick your teamsyou newcomers please do not be offended if we dont select you we need people who are dedicated thespians who are going to be living with this actor for a very long time and we all know very well here he bestowed a kindly smile on pausert hulik and hantis that as soon as you can barring that you decide differently you are leaving us was it that obvious pausert sighed not that he wanted to be on any blasted panels listening to people stumble their way through speechesnot after the way that alton had been carrying on for two days during which the theater was dark the panels held nonstop auditions in any little space that would hold a table and four chairs the pickings were thin though the applicants were legionin two days only three candidates were passed up to cravans panel waiting in the theater at the end of the two days however about the time that the panel members were beginning to look haggard and despairing vonard kleesp appeared trudis panel passed him on to cravan after only five minutes of audition by the time he took his place on the stage in front of cravans panel rumor had spread through the showboat like wildfire in pure oxygen everyone who could get away was trying to get into the theater to see him pausert was no exception though by the time he got there vonard had already gone through two major soliloquies with impressive ease what he saw up on the stage as he squeezed in between hulik and vezzarn was a man who like cravan had a very memorable face it was not strictly speaking handsome the face was too saturnine for that there was too much of an ironic lift to his eyebrows and a cynical twist to his lips but it was memorable which was what a second lead needed and the man moved like a cat just as pausert got there he was demonstrating that he even knew how to use a sword properly well master vonard said cravan after a moment familiarity with the very plays we are putting on acting experience something of a swordsman you seem almost too good to be true well sir richard under most circumstances i would agree with you said vonard with a lift of his lip that was not quite a sneer except that i come to you laden with some personal baggage which is the reason why i am here on this backwater dirtball in the first place ah cravan said weaknesses nearfatal ones im afraid the first the one that all too many of our profession are prey to here he mimed a man pouring and drinking not to put too fine a point on it i drink to excess im a very devil when drunk and i never drink without getting drunk cravan leaned forwards over his steepled hands and why do you drink he all but purred vonard laughed my other weakness sir and the one that sent me here putting all of the distance between us that my pocket could bear here to drink until what was left in my pocket was gone ah cravan said leaning back in his chair the female of the species deadlier than the male agreed vonard insofar as i was thinking at all which was not a great deal between the madness and the wine i had intended to commit slow suicide fortunately both my money and my resolve ran out at the same time surely not just when we arrived asked himbo petey vonard laughed of course not i have been driving produce floaters the localthespianshere his lip curledwere not inclined to welcome an outsider into their ranks especially not one who by this time had the reputation as an ugly drunk i was attempting to budget my drinking to allow me to put enough away to get me off this benighted rock i didnt even know there was a showboat onplanet until one of my employers told me i took a twoday leave to get here hoping i could sign on for anything like an acting job i didnt even know about the cattle call until i walked through the gate and can we trust you to stay off the bottle if we take you on that was trudi pausert recognized her voice while im working yes i have never missed a rehearsal a gig or a line because of drink and i dont intend to start now when i am not working however he shrugged i cant promise or at least i can promise only that i will confine myself to quarters so that no one is inconvenienced but me pausert watched as the panelwith the additions of trudi and peteyput their heads together it seemed that they spoke together for a very long time and it if seemed long to him surely it seemed even longer to vonard finally they all sat back in their chairs master vonard said sir richard pending completion of a threeplanet probationary period i believe you can consider yourself one of us vonard bowed and most of the company including pausert broke into applause and if there was as much relief as acceptance well that was only to be expected whatever else vonard kleesps joining of the thespian troupe solved one problem for pausert ethulassia left off her aggressive flirtation with the captain the dames enthusiasms in that direction became entirely diverted onto the newcomer in their midst sure sniffed goth after pausert made it a point to mention it to her you dont stand a chance captain youre not a romantic alcoholic drowning his romantic woes in a bottleand only to be saved by an even greater romance pausert was relieved and decided to say nothing when the next day he spotted goth examining the level of the bottles in the ventures liquor cabinet its a day for new crewmates it seems said vezzarn when they caught up with him at dinner and told him about the audition in addition to the usual run of locals looking for adventure himbo petey just snugged in a new tramp freighter that ran out of luck fourman crew already assigned a new roustabout whos doubling as a barker a wiring techand you can bet hell be all over the shipa new cook and a cargomaster goth looked up sharply and hulik and pausert exchanged a glance every planet a showboat visited invariably produced a few local people who hired on but the crew of a tramp freighter supposedly down on their luck that seemed oddly coincidental i dont like it growled pul think ill go sniff them over hantis nodded and raised an eyebrow at hulik and pausert it does seem a bit too convenient doesnt it very said hulik i believe ill go do some of my own sniffing what do you think pausert asked the girls the leewit scowled might be coincidence she said very grudgingly i suppose ships come up short of fuel and cash pretty often in ports like this but you dont like it said pausert both the leewit and goth shook their heads good that makes it unanimous so as soon as i rell a certain something and in the meantime said goth looking innocent as a flower girls can get awfully hungry when were still growing well just see how good a cook the new one is and she and the leewit strolled off hand in hand hulik looked after them with an expression of reluctant admiration ah to be young and reckless again she said now hulik said pausert daring to reach out and pat the back of her hand you were never that young his theater training was paying off he managed to duck just in time all of them growled pul all four of them i could smell spy from yards off you ought to let me bite them hantis when you were being spied on it was always better to keep on doing things that youd made habitual the crew of the venture always got together for breakfast and supper everybody knew theyd arrived together and still intended to leave together if they ever could so nobody thought anything of the habit you ate with your friends nothing mysterious about that and the noisy mess tent provided plenty of chatter to cover anything they were talking about pausert shook his head much as i sympathize pul its better to know who your enemies are and have them under your eye if we get rid of these four whoever their boss is will only send new agents and this time we might not spot them we ought to find out who their boss is dont you think captain asked goth he nodded do you think if we got into the ventures control cabin you might be able to find out if theyre communicating with someone believe so theyre not real brighttheyre all even on the same shift which means i only need to listen when theyre offshift theyll probably use a code though she shrugged a codes a language too captain we may not have tried it but i bet the leewit can use klatha to translate a code you think asked the leewit looking suddenly alert we havent anything to lose by trying pausert agreed and the ventures still our ship vezzarn said a little aggressively we still use our staterooms dont we weve a right to get into everything there but the holds no reason why a couple of us couldnt be tinkering with the com to see if we cant get it working either it wasnt as if they werent still living in the venture after brief forays into the accommodations provided for the unmarried players and workers on the petey bwhich were essentially bunkhousestheyd all decided they wanted their own cabins back even if that meant having their sleep interrupted by props heaving and bumping bits and bobs in and out of the holds at all hours hmm said pausert vezzarn how are your scrounging skills the old spacer grinned the best of course and i think i know where youre going you want me to start scrounging com parts so it looks like were trying to repair on the cheap and slow which will give us a good reason to be in the cabin and even monitoring chatter if somebody walks in at the wrong time said the leewit with enthusiasm clumping brilliant hulik smiled he has his moments and so do i if our watchers happen to be iss ill probably know their code anyway she sniffed this far out theyre probably still using codes cracked and abandoned a long time ago the only problem with the plan was that it left everyone but hantis and pul with exactly no spare timeand hantis and pul were watching the agents in their own ways pausert rapidly began to feel like a man holding down three jobs which in point of fact he was he was an actor a sideshow operator and now a comtinkerer because it was possible that the agents wouldnt be using standard channels to talk to their boss the young witches were doing just as much if not more but at least they seemed to be buoyed up on the excitement of it all that was a good thing because the leewit in particular was difficult to manage if she began to get the least bit bored the silveryeyed little vatch elected at this point to be absent which was aggravating pausert could have used the help even from a vatch or maybe especially from a vatch that one big vatch pausert had halfshredded had neatly translocated the ship and everyone in it not once but twice when they were caught between the iss and the pirates it hadnt been hugely far but then he hadnt specified where he wanted to be what were a vatchs upper limits on teleporting he wondered if he found a vatch big enoughor silvereyes got big enoughcould he torment or talk the vatch into taking them all the way to the empress on the other hand would a vatch even understand time and space as pausert was used to it he recalled belatedly silvereyes being intrigued by the notion of linear timewhich it apparently considered silly pausert shuddered to think that even the bestintentioned vatch might teleport them into the distant past or futureor what might be even worse into the recent past where they already existed probably not a good idea he had a vague impression of being toldperhaps on karresthat if you violated time and space by being two places at the same time something very bad would happen to you he made a mental note to ask goth about it at some point when they werent heavily involved in keeping their own skins intact the captain had come to have a great deal of trust in the girls judgment and no longer undertook any major change in plans without consulting her in the meantime it was moderately amusing to be watching their watchers im sure they havent yet decided if were the ones theyre looking for hulik said on the day that a midsummer nights dream went into the repertory and they started rotating it with romeo and juliet that had made a welcome change for hulik she hadnt nearly the pressure on her as third romantic lead that she had as first romantic lead helena was an easy part really mostly confusion and hysteria she opined and a catfight of course there wasnt a catfight in the original script or at least not the mudwrestling match that hulik and meren dall were required to perform the catfight was himbo peteys idea sir richard had put it in but not without a fight of his own but like the extended sword fights the public loved it theres no fights in this thing so you are going to have to have something in place of a melee himbo had shouted i say mudwrestling and mudwrestling it is just because your precious birdbart whateverdidnt put in mudwrestling in the first place that doesnt mean he wouldnt have if hed known there was such a thing i mean it even fits the script and i suppose you want me to put a blythe gun battle in the scottish play sir richard had shouted backand had then gone pale with horror at the speculative look on himbo peteys face no forget i said that you can have your wretched mudwrestling just do not ask me for one more change not one hulik didnt mind she thought it was funny and meren was enough of a trouper that she would have mudwrestled the entire female cast if that was what the part had called for why are you so sure they havent spotted us pausert asked there were bits of what appeared to be the com strewn all over the floor in front of the unit and he was pretending to repair it pretending because the com was working just fine and the bits were nothing more than the results of vezzarns scrounging acting as camouflage while the leewit listened to chatter on headphones and goth worked out whether the chatter was coming from inside the petey b or was just the usual sorts of traffic outside of it because theyre spreading themselves too thin hulik said firmly and ill tell you something elseeven if they have our descriptions or some of us anyway that doesnt mean theyre going to trust those descriptions i wouldnt because i would know that any smart quarry would have already changed as much about himself as he could so they are basically looking at everyone well that was comforting hmm so a really smart quarry wouldnt change himself at all or would do exactly what weve done put ourselves into a position where our appearances change constantly she nodded at him pausert was still wearing his mercutio hair because it was perfectly comfortable to wearquite naturalseeming really but a royal pain to take off and put on tomorrow the makeup specialist would take off the foxy hair and replace it with bottoms unruly haystack and hed wear that all day for the same reason rehearsals had just started for play number three the scottish play and as king duncan hed have gray hair that worked for both the part of the king and of the kings ghost most of the other actors did the same only when they doubled a part as alton did with romeo and the prince of verona did they use true oldfashioned wigs that could be put on and taken off quickly but were horrible and itchy to wear great patham we must be driving them mad he exclaimed gleefully hulik nodded we couldnt have picked a better place even if theyre looking for two young karreswitch girls they cant be sure that they have the right girls or even that they should be looking for girls at all there are dozens of families here with children the right age the little wisdoms could be posing as boys as midgets or as even as something in the freak show the little wisdoms were freakish enough as it was anyway he thought he didnt say it out loud though well good i want them as confused as possible that can only be to our benefit he thought of something else so how are they fitting in it would be very awkward if these people were used to being with a showboat the tall tales spun about every member of a showboat crew would not distract them too much and once they got themselves oriented it wouldnt be long before they got onto the truthor figured out that if nothing else signon dates and the identity of the ships welded to the frame would be found in himbo peteys own records according to pul like desertcats in a swamp which argues for them being iss agents i would think that the pirates would know betteror would have operatives that spent time on a showboat in the past the iss isnt stupid no but this far out in the hinterland what you get are agents that were put out here because they werent good enough to be entrusted with truly important postings or were stupid enough to do something that made it necessary to transfer them where they couldnt do much harm if they arent ambitious theyre going to be unhappy because their comfortable paperpushing existence has been interrupted by a tedious possibly dangerous job if they are ambitious theyre going to be blundering about doing plenty of wrong things because they dont know that what they need to be good undercover agents wont be found in a book hulik sighed they get posted out to places like this because at least theres a smaller chance that theyll get themselves killed or do something to anger someone important pausert hesitated then asked the question that had been lurking in the back of his mind ever since hantis told them about the plague hulik what are the odds do you think that someone high up in the iss is infected by hantis nanites she leaned back in her chair and licked her lips you do know how to ask the nasty ones dont you truth to be told i think its quite likely odds of up to fifty percent ive thought that ever since that iss goon overrode your safeconduct from the empress she began ticking things off on her fingers whoever it is knows about karres witches believes in them and wants them whoever it is does not have the empress best interests at heart and does not want whatever information it is that we carry to get to the empress whoever it is knows about hantis and pul and possibly wants them disposed of as well she shrugged now that could cover both someone high up in court circles who has ambitions for becoming emperor himself or working for someone who doesbut it covers someone in the iss infected by the plague equally well pauserts heart sank but then he too shrugged i suppose it doesnt make much difference at this point does it no whoever is behind this is high enough up in iss circles that if hantis cant do anything were on our own for the moment she looked pensively at a poster on the wall advertising romantic getaways on beta caeleen goth had been sticking them up to cover the paint splatters from the first appearance of the little silvereyed vatch it seemed an eternity ago i used to like being a lone operative she said sounding oddly plaintive in fact i used to like being an operative period i must be getting old it isnt fun anymore i find myself wishing i had a lot of people at my back and that i was doing things using my brain rather than a gun things with a lower chance of getting me killed a desk has begun to look a lot more attractive than it used to pausert stared at her you arent actually thinking about settling down are you it has its merits she said wistfully then she shook her head no not really you know how it is everyone wants what they dont have and then if they get it half the time they discover they dont want it after all pausert wasnt fooled she was thinking about it he tried to imagine it hulik do eldel in a little house behind a desk maybe even married and with children great patham what would any children she raised be like worse than young witches even probably wreaking havoc on their kindergarten playing pirates and hostages with real blythe guns breaking into the creche offices at night to rifle through the teachers desk looking for blackmail material it wouldnt suit you he said firmly youd be bored before the first day was over youre probably right she replied still sounding wistful still with the right set of circumstances the right job and the right partner chapter were getting closer said sedmon to sedmon at hansons reach we missed them by weeks maybe we can catch up finally on tornam provided we dont have to clean up any more messes along the way cautioned the second sedmon eliminating imperial agents is a dangerous pastime the first sedmon shrugged he was too curious as to why we wanted descriptions of the cast of the petey byrum and keep the lattice ships do get watched theyre good cover mind you i think we need to look into investing in one someday the sedmons back on uldune nodded the records here indicate that several of them are considerably indebted to our bank and the one were following is in financial difficulty the records weve looked at indicate this to be the norm theyre potentially profitable of course but its usually the debt load that cripples them and a lot of the showmen seem to have the financial acumen of a humpity but this himbo petey seems a cut above most our contact with the imperial bank of credit and commercial ventures does indicate that hes been trying to bring it under control all of the sedmons knew they were avoiding thinking about how they would deal with meeting up with hulik do eldel like almost all of the daals citizens she was blissfully unaware that shed actually met physically four different bodies the same mind of course at one stage when theyd first begun considering a personal liaison with the imperial agent the hexaperson had assumed they would conduct it the same way as they dealt with the people of uldunewith one of them on display and the rest in reserve in hiding but as time went on and the do eldel grew more central to their thoughts the thought of deceiving her became distasteful besides as intelligent and capable as hulik was it would probably be futile as well even though the daal had kept a certain distance from her in the past he suspected that she had already guessed at least part of the truth but theyd deal with that issue once they caught up with her first they had to do that chapter at long last pausert relled vatch and he could tell that this was a vatch that he had relled before goth relled it at the same time and looked up sharply is that our old friend captain a patch of misty black blinked silverslitted eyes at him i believe it is hello real thing are you going off to be stories for the wakingdreamers now as a matter of fact we are he did not ask where the vatch had been truth to tell he wasnt sure he really wanted to know good are you planning on luring more victims here he asked cautiously not now time goth he said and goth put away her headphones with a sigh they looked as if they were plugged into her personal player they were and they werent because one of the channels on her personal player was set to scan all the com that was coming from inside the petey b as relayed from the venture still nothing she complained cheer up after this show we liftand even if theyve been reporting to someone in person they wont be able to do that anymore they now had the third of their plays the scottish play in production and sir richard had elected to put off beginning rehearsal for the fourth until they were back in space the new man was working out well enough true to his word vonard kleesp was awake and ready for first rehearsal and he never showed the least bit of unsteadiness from that moment until final curtain though as vezzarn said with reluctant admiration what he drinks in a night would kill five men presumably hed gotten to that stage of alcoholism where the alcoholic could not function without liquor in his system besides pausert had overheard cravan saying to ethulassia one night they only needed vonard kleesp until ken kanchen was all healed up you wont fire him ethulassia had asked anxiously hes a superb actor whatever else her voice seemed to get a little dreamy quite a charming and handsome man too for that matter and he doesnt really drink as much as people think with my personal intervention no i certainly wont fire him cravan had replied hell be useful if pausert leaves us he can take those roles for that matter he could double and standin on just about every male lead we do but he wont be indispensable and when something happens to him it wont leave us short when well cravan was right to use that word drinking like that a mans liver would only last so long and his heart would probably go even sooner medics could give you artificial organs but if you collapsed with heart or liver failure out in space or some backwater world in the middle of nowhere you might not live to make it to a place where they could install one well little wisdom pausert said teasingly time to go be a witch very well your majesty she mocked him back oh good a story i havent seen it was a good thing that pauserts time on stage as king duncan was limited the vatch was full of questions some of them pausert couldnt answer such as the very reasonable question of if the witches were so powerful why didnt macbeth keep them around to show him the future all the time i dont know i guess its just the way the storymaker wanted it was all he could say the vatch didnt seem to mind that he didnt know and best of all it behaved like a mannerly child at a grownup party but as the play hurtled towards its conclusion he began to get a prickling at the back of his neck then vonard kleesp appeared at his side coming from the direction of the dressing rooms somethings amiss i think he whispered into pauserts ear i was just coming out of my dressing room and saw a man i dont recognize going into yours i dont believe he was alone either i notified some of the stagehands but you might want to look into it yourself trouble said the vatch suddenly and with great glee thisll be fun and it vanished standing backstage as he was pausert could hear the vatchs fun as a series of crashes and muffled shouts things were falling overor being knocked overonto several people who had been he suspected trying to sneak around backstage the vatch had put paid to that particular plan though and now even as the shouts got louder pausert saw several burly stagehands converging on the area fortunately by that point the final sword fight between macbeth and macduff was in full swing you could probably have staged a barfight backstage without anyone in the audience noticing the noises stopped at the point where macduff killed macbeth and the stagehands returned dusting their hands in satisfaction so did the vatch the altercation had not escaped the notice of sir richard however as soon as the last of the curtain calls was over he came striding backstage with fire in his eye the first thing his eye lit on was pausert what was the meaning of that ruckus he began but the chief rigger interrupted him he didnt have nothing to do with it boss the rigger said we caught those four new guys trying to sneak into the dressing rooms kleesp gave us the warning sneak sir richard snorted that didnt sound like sneaking to me one of the lighting techs sniggered they had some bad luck boss the old man told sir richard gleefully bad luck and lots of it and if i find out what they was smoking before they got here im buyin a pound swore up and down that the props and stuff was getting thrown at em and jumpin on em thats what most of the noise was huh sir richard lost most of his wrath and the rest of the noise oh said the chief rigger attempting to look innocent and failing utterly that was them falling down a lot while we was helping em find their way out helping who find their way out himbo petey asked having arrived with the rest of the cast the rigger helpfully explained while the techs snickered trying to get into the dressing rooms hmm asked petey his jaw tightening which dressing rooms well the rigger said with a shake of his head i almost feel sorry for em normally fans try to get to the leading ladys room and thieves too these guys were such losers they were trying his he pointed at pausert cravan blinked have you got something in there youre not telling us about aron pausert shook his head not that i can think of hed have to think quickly here and just hope the girls could adlib along with whatever story he came up with unless he rubbed his jaw well someone might have been prepared to pay someone to take my older niece back to her stepfather theres a pretty large family estate involved and nothing much dani or anyone can do about it until shes of age to sign the documents treggerthats her stepfatherwould undoubtedly like to have her back under his eye im the girls guardianand i have the papers to prove it but if i had an accident then theyd go back to tregger ask the girls how theyd like that please dont let the captain get hurt said the leewit sniffing treggers mean he used to beat us and momma she died and the captain took us away huh said goth the captaind have dealt with them just like he did with the last one it was a superb piece of acting what did these guys tell you growled petey to the riggers some cockandbull story about being friends from way back and wanting to give the new showfolk a surprise the rigger said we didnt buy it you dont need a prybar for that or a cosh and forcecuffs that was why they fell down a lot on the way out petey turned to goth and the leewit who were wideeyed just for the record do you and your sister know any of the new people any sausage sellers from way back they both shook their heads vigorously only people im friends with outside of the company and my uncles crew are the fellows in clown alley the leewit said in a very small voice goth shook her head dont even know what the new guys look like sir i dont tolerate people interfering with my thespians said cravan stormily you get no argument from me sir richard theyre working members of the petey bs company we look after own girls peteys face was flushed he looked to the techs you can identify them of course huh we marked em good said the rigger with satisfaction uh that is they got marked pretty good falling down a lot petey reached inside the huge sleeve of his doublet and pulled out a wristcom he tapped out a sequence and spoke into it hey rube backstage theater the thespians all seemed to know what was coming for they cleared back against the walls and scrims dame ethulassia grabbed pauserts elbow and pulled him back along with the rest while some of the others did the same for hulik goth and the leewit suddenly there was a thunder of running feet and backstage became very very crowded as the biggest meanestlooking and strongest members of the circus converged on cravan and petey if goths and the leewits eyes had been big before they were dinnerplatesize now himbo petey spoke to them in a very low very angry voice explaining what had just happened an animal growl arose from several of the throats and postures went rather beyond tense these boys will help you identify them he finished gesturing to the riggers and the techs i want them off the ship off the grounds bag and baggage keep em off and spread the word were lifting early i want us derigged packed up and gone weve got most of the loose money on this planet anyway before pausert could blink they were gone petey looked around his eyes lighting on the little witches we take care of our own he said again reassuring them in a surprisingly gentle voice they nodded though their eyes were still enormous good miss hulik would you and the rest of your crew take them to their cabins on your old ship and when you get there close and dog down the airlock dont come out until were out of orbit girls dont bother to change out of your costumes until youre in your own cabins just bring them back at rehearsal tomorrow yessir they said in chorus cravan looked around as well you heard the showmaster he said firmly break and stow were lifting early quicktime pausert joined the girls and they all started to move away cravan shot a look at them quicktime mister pausert he barked they ran are we in trouble asked goth quietly when the lock had been secured with the show i mean oh no hulik replied no not at all however your wouldbe kidnappers are you think they were going to kidnap us the leewit asked looking more interested than frightened hulik shrugged its what i would do if i were the kind of wretched scum that they are she replied kidnap you and use you to get the rest of us without a fight that is if i hadnt bothered to look into the reports of the last lot of iss agents who tried to take us do you think we should tell himbo petey whats really going on pausert asked feeling guilty again no said hulik and hantis at once and very vehemently they exchanged a look and hulik elaborated look captain petey has a perfectly good explanation for what those men were going to do those men can claim to be iss until theyre blue in the face and it wont do them any good because you and the little wisdoms would have convinced me and i know the truth goth blushed a little the leewit looked so innocent that it seemed as if a halo might descend on her head at any moment pausert rubbed his jaw well yes he said but they werent if you can explain to me how planning to kidnap two children and use them to get their friends and guardians to surrender possibly torturing one or both girls to make us frantic to do what they asked is any different id like to hear it there was more than a touch of frost in hantis voice anyway its all done with now said hulik she turned to pausert you know we might as well go open all the com channels and find out whats going on that sounds like a good idea what was going on was a lot of frantic work apparently when petey said quicktime he meant it all of the decorations the bunting and banners and synthasilk sheathing were already stowed away and the full breakdown was impossible though it seemed half over goth put the viewscreen on channelflick so they could see what every camera that was broadcasting was showing look said goth suddenly freezing the view the four new men were being ungently escorted to the other side of the showboats gates with some of their escorts carrying what must have been everything the men owned once they were tossed beyond the perimeter their belongings were unceremoniously dumpeda fair amount of it on them there was no sound on this particular camera but it was obvious from the gesticulations that there was a lot of angry shouting going on but the escortparty wasnt moving and those who hadnt been carrying baggage were handing out clubs to those who had been the four men seemed to come to their senses sullenly they shut up and began loading themselves with their baggage then dragged it out of the cameras view what about their ship the leewit asked i mean peteys still got their ship wont the law come after him for that goth unexpectedly grinned nope im the one that worked our contracts remember theres a clause in there that says that if any of us break the code of conduct petey can throw all of us off and take our ship bet thats in their contract too and i betcha peteys transmitting the contracts to the police right this minute if they want the law after us theyll have to break coverand remember they got no proof that were anything but what we say we are so i betcha the law wont move until they can prove theyre iss and then itll be too late but what if we break the code pausert asked now more worried than ever goth rolled her eyes oh please captain its all heavy stuff murder or attempted murder theft or attempted theft kidnap or attempted kidnap that kind of thing believe me i looked at it hard peteyll call it attempted kidnapping and the local lawll probably agree its a bit rough on four incompetents said pausert the empires judges dont look kindly on the kidnapping of minors i dont know if it is that harsh hulik said grimly iss agents can be cashiered to the hinterlands for other reasons than just sheer incompetence and it would take a certain sort of mind to think that kidnapping and torturing a little girl is a good way to get a job done you should have let me bite them growled pul from the floor chapter whoever the wouldbe kidnappers had been working for they were either unsuccessful in persuading the authorities of their wrongs or else they decided not to even try involving the locals for there was no pursuit and not even a query from the law the petey b lifted and got into and out of orbit with no more trouble than usual and things went back to normal pausert was left to ponder something remarkable their little silvereyed vatch of the untamable sort was not only behaving itself it was cooperating and making itself very useful he was not at all used to thinking of a vatch as useful the petey b was well out of orbit and into interstellar space when silvereyes caught up with them again pausert just had time to notice it was there when it announced itself i deserve feeding it said cheerfully that you do pausert agreed if you can lure something big dumb and juicy here the vatchlet vanished but it wasnt gone long and the vatch it brought with it was exceedingly big slow and evidently not much brighter than a cow pausert felt not a trace of guilt over tearing a couple of headsized chunks out of it before it fled protesting silvereyes feasted growing a bit in size i like you silvereyes announced ive decided that helping real things i like is more fun than playing tricks on dream things maybe thats because just playing tricks is too easy for you pausert suggested the vatchlet seemed to think that over for a while it didnt go away it just floated in the middle of the control cabin like a puff of shadow while its slitty eyes winked and blinked what are you doing it finally asked im resting and thinking no i meant you have something important to do i can feel it i think thats why you get in so much trouble so what is it should he tell the vatch well why not it wasnt as if it would be able to blab things to anyone else who didnt already know only a klatha practitioner would be able to even sense a vatch was there much less hear it on the other hand if he told the vatch what was going on it just might be more inclined to help because hed answered its question so he explained it all the nanite plague the disappearance of karres needing to get the information to the empress then he had to explain what the empress was traitors in the issand then he had to explain what the iss was that the pirates who had followed the agandar were inexplicably convinced that they had the agandars treasure and were also trying to find them and naturally he had to explain what pirates were and who the agandar had been and so forth there was a lot of explaining to do the vatch was quiet for a much longer time then pausert had never really gotten the impression that vatches thought much about anything before this but he sure got that feeling now i dont understand most of this the vatch said finally id like to help anyway but im not very big youre bigger now than you were when we met you pausert pointed out true thats because you feed me i think thats a good thing id like to think so also pausert told it believe me i appreciate the help youve been giving us the bigger i get the more i can help you and when im big enough i will be able to go to the place i think thats probably a good thing too so do i said pausert and he meant it not that it wasnt a grand thing in some ways having a vatch around that was making its business to be helpful but on the whole pausert would be relieved to know that the one vatch he couldnt actually control had gone somewhere else and wouldnt come back i wouldnt be a friend if i asked you to stay any longer than you have to what is a friend it asked and then the captain had another long explanation to make it was one he was very careful with emphasizing that one of the things that friends did not do was to indulge in mischief that caused each other harm and that the thing they tried to do all the time was to make each other happy and help each other like feeding you he finished and like you keeping those unfriends from hurting us and no matter how far friends are from each other they always remember what they did for each other and they remember how good it was to be friends i like that okay i will be your friend big real thing and you will be mine and that will be true even after i go to the place goth came in then and the vatch vanished as vatches were inclined to do goth stared at the place where it had been and then at pausert all right captain she said putting her hands on her hips just what have you been up to when he finished telling her goth continued to stare at him now that was not at all unusual what was unusual was the kind of stare she was giving him im not entirely sure youre a witch anymore captain she said slowly youre doing things no witch i ever heard of can do or has ever tried to do he felt himself flush oh come on he scoffed i cant use the sheewash drive yet goth interrupted firmly i cant use the egger route yet and you are a vatchtamer and now youre making friends with the things youre no kind of a witch i ever heard of all right he replied just what am i then he didnt really expect a reply but he should have known better this was goth after all she canted her head to the side a wizard maybe she said rubbing the tip of her nose hmm maybe that a wizard of karres a vatch that wants to be friends hantis shook her head ive never heard of such a thing but it certainly beats the alternative you do have a way with the oddest creatures captain he does agreed pul i only want to bite him a very little now and again ill take that as a compliment coming from you pausert replied does anyone know where were going next a mining world pul told him i overheard cravan and petey talking about it mining pausert was surprised i wouldnt think miners would appreciate anything we do and with that he went to find one of the more experienced members of the troupe to get his opinion the first one he found was mannicholo who was trying out a new juggling act with glowing wands which set off the reflective colors of his dermis wonderfully pausert didnt interrupt him since it looked as if the chameleon man was finally getting some success with it when mannicholo caught all of the wands he offered up some sincere applause thanks the chameleon man said cheerfully by the time we hit ground again it might even be ready to show what can i do for you ive found out were going to a mining world and i wouldnt have thought that wed have much of a chance of an audience there hmm depends on the world one thats being mined by a major concern no youre right most of the mining there is automated and the big companies tend to keep their workers well fed and entertained because working those machines is skilled and dangerous work but there are plenty of worlds where the big deposits have been mined out even though there isnt enough left there to interest the big companies theres plenty to go around for wildcatters mannicholo tossed one of his wands idly from hand to hand and youd be surprised at what they like things that remind them of when they were kids and carefreelike the circus part of the show and a lot of them are better educated than youd guess its selfeducation often as not but they can be pretty bright boys and girls stupid wildcatters tend to die quickly you see the littler mining machines are powerful and tricky to run and a wildcatter uses explosives nearly as often as he uses a mining machine and you cant be stupid and know how to handle explosives properly that still doesnt explain why theyd like the thespians well they all tend to listen to stuff while they tend the mining machines mannicholo explained and heres kind of what happens everyone that comes out here has his own set of personal recordings but its expensive to bring in anything new so when a miner gets tired of his own stuff he starts trading around pretty soon he runs out of stuff he knows he likes then he gets desperate and starts trading for anything so the longer a miners been out here the more different stuff hes tried and hell have listened to practically anythingevery kind of music lectures plays educational recordings spoken books you name it so a miner can have a taste for things you wouldnt expect then theres the last thingand that is that wildcat miners work alone for the most part so the one thing they really crave is company light color and sound and lots of it all so no matter how bad our acts were chances are theyd come to see us for a while but if the acts are really sad it wont be for long oh he hadnt considered that andyou said they arent stupid thats right so thats why if a showboat wants to really make money the acts have to be good funnily enough i have always found that the one set of acts that consistently makes money on a mining world is the thespians and people like them people who rely as much on whats heard as whats seen and people who do things that open up the imagination mannicholo winked which is why i am very grateful to you for tipping me off before anyone else ive got a songandcomedy act id better dust off before we hit ground believe me pausert when miners like you they really like you and when they really like you theyve got some fine ways of showing it all right he had one set of questions answered only to give rise to another setbecause what mannicholo could have meant he had no clue until he got to rehearsal that is ladies and gentlemen said cravan summoning them all to the stage our next destination is the mining world altim four there was much excited murmuring among the older members of the thespians cravan waved his hand my old troupers please allow me to explain what this means to the newer members the murmuring died we have done some investigation cravan said with satisfaction the last time a showboat passed this way altim four a world with nothing more sophisticated than lower vertebrates was being mined by one of the major mining companies they have since taken what they wantedwhich was heavy radioactivesand left that was five years ago the wildcatters moved in immediately and as those of you who are familiar with heavymetal worlds know altim four would have been rich in gold shouted someone cravan nodded graciously and other precious metals the consortium didnt even bother to look for gemstones needless to say since it was a heavymetal world the conditions are hazardous and everything needs to go through decontamination which has meant there was no rush to speak of when it was opened to wildcatters nevertheless those who dared are profiting richly what this means to us my friends is that if these people decide that they like us they are going to give ample evidence of that and what that means is that if these miners wish to offer an accolade beyond applause there probably will not be flowers thrown on stage at the end of a performancethere probably will be pouches of gold dust and rough gemstones for a moment pausert was not sure hed heard that correctly but dame ethulassias eyes shone with enthusiasm pausert sucked in a breath while one of the other cast members whistled why if something like that happenedthey could all get enough extra to buy the venture free and get her fixed and fueled cravan interrupted the buzz now before we ever make planetfall i want it understood that this sort of thing is provided for in your contracts it probably isnt anything you even looked at too closely at the time but i want the terms understood from the beginning provision one for accolades that are tossed onto the stage no matter who is the assumed person being rewarded one third goes to the general fund for the petey b along with ticket receipts and two thirds is shared out among all the members of the company on an equal basisone share each no matter how junior or senior you are he looked quite stern but pausert could not help but notice that the techs and riggers brightened up considerably at that no doubt why either otherwise theyd have had no chance at getting such bonuses provision two for gifts delivered backstage to a specific artist one half the artist may keep for his or herself and one half is shared out among all the members of the company while i realize that this may not seem fair to those of you who are leads let me remind you that although you are the apex of a pyramid of talent without those beneath you you would swiftly find yourself plummeting ask yourself if you could have earned such accolades without the carpenters and techs good lighting good sound makeup hair and costuming and the support of all of the extras before you feel yourself wronged im grateful sir richard not complaining said hulik into the silence on any other world wed get a bunch of flowers and applause and be happy for that and were lucky to have himbo petey for our showmaster smart enough to find this place before anyone else did here here said alton and im with you sweetheart said trudi and that seemed to settle it for everyone rehearsal went forward in a cheerful glow afterwards pausert caught up with goth whats on the contract for solo acts he asked in an undertone half to the general fund half to you she replied without needing to think about it and the circus side is similar to the thespians so you betcha theres going to be a lot of extra stalls and people trying to think up a hot solo or small ensemble act to run on the side she was right of course which led himbo petey to insist that all such solo acts pass an audition if they werent already on the bill just as well that he did or sideshow alley would have been neckdeep in exotic dancers furthermore petey would not permit anyone to have an act in direct competition with someone who had an established stall if for instance someone wanted to set up an exotic dance turn they had better not only be good they had better have a different theme than anyone else pausert was the comedy escapeartist which meant that anyone new had to go for the dangerous and hazardous escapes not surprisingly no one did the thrillescapes needed someone who was a superb athlete and very very practiced in his art anything less got people killed not in my show youre smart you can do better than that was the roar often heard coming from peteys office and it was ethulassia surprisingly who met the crestfallen at the door took them off for tea and sympathy in her stateroom and usually was able to suggest something that petey would approve or if she couldnt vonard kleesp usually could kleesp was often to be found in the dames stateroom these days lounging on one of her overstuffed divans dame ethulassias campaign of personal intervention seemed to have succeeded at least to some extent the man had become ethulassias paramour in a manner of speaking pausert suspected the dames passion for the fellow was a considerably more casual thing than she professedshe was an actress after all given to public flamboyancebut he was simply relieved to be spared her aggressive flirtations himself for all of vonards selfprofessed reputation as a mean drunk he was actually never more than moderately pickled these days and seemed rather inclined to sardonic humor than anything nastier and his checkered past had given him insight into a thousand clever little scams and hustles any number of which could be adapted to these circumstances if pausert hadnt had that little discussion with mannicholo he probably would have been surprised by some of the acts that people came up with there were several singing acts for instance ranging from opera to folk ballads several solo instrumental musicians and four different instrumental groups among all of the exotic dancers there was a ballet act adagio dancers staged by two of the acrobats mannicholo wasnt the only one doing comedy there were three fortunetellers each one doing a different sort of supposed divination and a mentalist act but no one absolutely no one is going to run a clairvoyant act petey decreed in a companywide meeting i am not having anyone duping these poor people by pretending to speak to their dead thats not only fraud its obscene i wont have it under my tent and no games of chance eitherthough without a doubt members of the company were going to run covert card games anyway but if they ran a dirty game and got caught well it would be their own skin they risked and nothing to do with the company as a whole it wasnt that himbo petey objected to gambling nor to fleecing the miners with the usual house edgeit was just that miners were generally large strong people with short tempers and they had a habit of wrecking places and people that they thought were cheating them soon enough someone would come and set up a casino here and take that chance petey was too conservative to risk it goth and the leewit decided to perform a variation on pauserts comedic escapeact by putting together a comedy magicact goth would fumble the tricks and her assistant the leewit would in the process of putting the equipment away or getting it ready on stage do them flawlessly and with just enough exasperation to make it funnier when they presented the idea to petey for his approval the showmaster hesitated there was already a comedymagic actaltons whose persona was a gentlemanly drunk assisted by a pretty little acrobat in a scanty maids costume he would produce all manner of unlikely objects from hat coat pocket and thin air seeming as baffled and surprised by their appearance as the audience was but petey decided that the novelty of having two young sisters work together along with the siblingrivalry theme was sufficiently original to let them go ahead even vezzarn got into the mix with a novelty target actthrowing everything from styluses to meat cleavers and doing so well at it that pausert was glad that the little spacer was on their side how did you get so good at this he asked in surprise vezzarn shrugged and lobbed another fork into the target when youre as short as i am and as puny and you find youve gotten into a fight you dont want to get too close to the other guy if you can help it its a good thing if you can stick him full of things from the other side of the room and make him think about something other than hitting you and when youre in that situation you usually dont have a lot of time to choose what youre going to use to throw at him hulik alone among their group wasnt going to have a solo actbut then she was hardly going to need one if there were going to be pouches of gold dust being sent backstage thought pausert she was going to be the person most likely to receive them he just hoped that she would at least think about contributing some of it to getting the venture back and spaceworthy he thought about asking her directly about that but she seemed to have something else on her mind altogether and as far as he could tell it didnt have anything to do with the potentials of this next planetfall he caught her more and more often gazing off into space with a puzzled and wistful expression and he wasnt the only one in fact she was acting very oddly one minute her old self then the next someone softer and so unlike her normal self that he wouldnt have recognized her but it was dame ethulassia who finally put an end to his bemusement with whathe was surewas the right answer they were both offstage waiting for their cues during a rehearsal of romeo and juliet watching hulik pour out her feelings into the waiting ears of romeo ethulassia said suddenly that woman is in love with someoneand she hasnt even realized it for herself yet what he replied but who not me he thought in half a panic not that hulik wasnt stunningly beautifulbut he really didnt want anyone that dangerous in love with him oh no one in your crew or even on the petey b i dont think which is why she hasnt yet realized that shes in love with whoever it is ethulassia rubbed her finger along the side of her nose and continued to watch hulik with narrowed eyes if i know that young woman at all and i think i do shes the kind that gets what she goes after and she would leave hulikshaped holes in anything that got between her and the one she loved whoever he is he may be the luckiest or the unluckiest man in the universedepending on how he feels about her since that was a perfectly accurate description of the former iss agent pausert nodded agreement and he was quite relieved to hear that the object of her affections was someone other than himself but of course that left the question openwho was it and what was hulik going to do when she figured it out chapter the judge facing sedmon pursed his lips ive had a wellplaced official request to dismiss the case the witnesses have left the charges may not stand up to a serious perusal attempted kidnapping is a vague sort of thing after all sedmon smiled at him on the other hand your honor fraud is usually not a vague sort of thing certain people might be very interested in the arimann trust the judge went absolutely white sedmon continued breezily and i do have certain knowledge that if not child kidnapping all of the prisoners have potential murder dockets the evidence will be with you this afternoon i trust the case will be handled then the daal had some of the best forgers in galaxy on his staff but it had proved unnecessary to use them iss agents were used to being above the law breaking it was just too easy on sensitive cases like this the daal knew they didnt carry id just a communicator number in their heads and with a little leaning hed have that senior officer and just who did this wellplaced official request come from your honor uh a certain colonel pasker hes a part of the imperial governors staff said the judge nervously er about the arimann trust it was just to tide me over and so it shall said sedmon just as soon as these cases are dealt with then he left to go and arrange an accidentof reasonably long durationfor a certain colonel pasker and then to get aboard the thunderbird and head finally towards altim four i do wish that pausert was tidier about these things said sedmon plaintively chapter vaudevillia had been in pauserts opinion one of the ugliest mudballs in the universe altim four made vaudevillia look like a pleasureplanet at least it wasnt a swamp the vegetation was limited to the local versions of mosses and lichens the local fauna was lower reptiles and whatever was swimming in the oceans and a lot of insects fortunately none of them found any of the invaders at all tasty but they were a nuisance anyway all the heavy metals made it dangerous to drink the water without a lot of processing eating anything grown here except what was grown hydroponically was out of the question the water was a curious green colorcopper salts pausert thought and while the air was breathable it left a faintly bitter taste in the back of the throat if altim wasnt a swamp it was nonetheless warm humid and overcast most of the time that was above ground of course a place where the miners mostly werent every man woman and neuter among them was spending most waking hours trying to dig out a fortune without poisoning themselves the ones who had it easiest were the ones who had staked their claims to emcorps tailings that ore was already out of the ground and processed it didnt need mining equipment to dig it out again it just needed more processing to extract whatever else was lurking in thereand a decontamination unit to clean out residual radioactives those machines could run themselves the hard part of their job was that in return for the stakes by the terms of their charter these miners also served as reclamation techs turning poisonous tailings into something benign and restoring the landscape what there was of it still no telling what might evolve or what might turn up one day to take them to task for ruining the place better to be safe than sorry the spaceport was huge built to take emcorps enormous freighters and lots of them now it was mostly empty which meant the petey b was able to come in set down and set up on real tarmac without inconveniencing anyone better yet since altim four was still officially emcorps private property that meant that there was not an iss presence what passed for law around here was emcorps security service they acted pretty much like local police and enforced what little law there was lawbreakers were brought up in front of a magistrate and either fined or booted off the planet since being booted off the planet was the last thing any of the miners wanted it was a simple but effective form of justice the miners were all rugged individualists who didnt give a damn about government anyway they paid emcorp for their stake emcorp kept the spaceport running and utter mayhem from breaking loose and everyone seemed reasonably satisfied with the arrangement emcorp didnt even try the usual heavyhanded tactics of unrestrained giant corporations dealing with wildcat miners that could be risky himbo petey did not do a leaflet drop as they came in with most of the miners underground that would have been a wasted effort and for the same reason few people saw the showboat come in to land instead he did something that a showboat almost never did he bought advertising time on the news comchannel there was only one and probably all of the miners listened to it at least once a day it was just about the only way these farscattered and reclusive people could keep track of what was going on with the rest of the universe and there wasnt much else here that needed to purchase advertising everyone knew every single bar eatery and entertainmentparlor there was that would change of course as other merchants got wind of the place and decided it was worth the chance of poisoning to set up shop here but for now porttown was the only center of population and it was pretty much as it had been when emcorp moved out only four locals appeared to watch the setup and they were all viding for the local newsfeed pausert was surprised usually there were lots of folk turning out for what amounted to a free show but miners he was told by other members of the slowships company were always an odd bunch it would be like them to figure they could get a better view on the vid during their downtime and meanwhile they could be making money himbo petey realized that this amounted to free advertising of course and immediately sent out mannicholo for the exotic look the most articulate of the clowns for the comedic aspect and the prettiest of the female aerialists to give the vidcrew the full tour and the best shots of the setup mannicholo extolled the wonders of sideshow alley and acted as the clowns straightman the clown cracked some excellent jokes and the girl waxed eloquent over the delights under the big top and on the stage of the theater pausert watched some of it himself it was a good show and if the cameraman spent a lot of time with the lens focused on the aerialist well that was hardly a shock since the population ran to seventyfive percent male and given the usual programming availablemostly educational programs which the station could get for freeit wasnt surprising that the show got a major chunk of the broadcasting day with one initial play and two replays to cover all three workshifts no doubt about it the petey b was big news so far as altim four was concerned pausert expected that given all the coverage himbo petey would want things up and running immediately if not sooner but no the whole first day the showboat was dark running extra dress rehearsals for every act even the sideshows pausert learned later from mannicholo that this was for two reasons petey wanted the chance for every miner to have seen the cast and he wanted anticipation to build on both sides of the equation it was smart thinking as pausert had long since realized just one more example of himbo peteys shrewd business sense which lurked beneath his sometimes buffoonish exterior appearance all four of the new plays were now in production macbeth romeo and juliet a midsummer nights dream and the merchant of venice for the moment the previous four hamlet othello twelfth night and as you like it were out although dame ethulassia told pausert confidentially that if the miners responded with enthusiasm to these plays from old yarthe cravan would probably put all four of the old ones back in performance and have the ventures crew understudy for parts already held by the original cast maybe being a witchor a wizardmade memorization a lot easier than it was for most people pausert was mildly surprised to realize that the idea of memorizing four parts or more if he was going to understudy more than one in each play didnt bother him that much before the petey b set down himbo petey had delivered a cautionary speech to the entire crew warning them not to expect that the miners had made fabulous strikes and were laden with wealth even though the conditions were right for such a thing that did not mean it had happened but when the first of the crew actually made it into town and saw the hideously inflated pricesset out in weights and karats rather than maelsthere was no mistaking the feverish look in the eyes of anyone with an act and that was when pausert got an idea he went into the bowels of the ship looking for engineers he had the feeling that these the people who kept the ship and not the show running might be the forgotten ones in all of the hurlyburly and that although they were getting crewshare of the new profits they were probably feeling a bit resentful that they were not going to be able to make more how many of you dont have an act he asked the chief engineer bluntly the grizzled old man rubbed the back of his head thoughtfully most of us he admitted good i have a proposition for you then theres no rule that stalls cant sell things in fact there are souvenir stalls salted all through sideshow alley and i have a hold full of tinklewood fishing poles and allweather cloaks theres fish here you know even if you cant eat them theres still sport in catching them and it certainly rains here plenty enough all you have to do is make them into souvenir fishing poles and allweather cloaks just slap petey byrum and keep the greatest show in the galaxy on them and you lot can take turns offshift in the stall selling them the chief engineer brightened hed seen the prices of merely ordinary objects here a souvenir of the showboat could be marked up a bit more than that still he was cautious sowhat do you get out of this i need my ship fixed pausert said bluntly i know you patched her to keep her from leaking too much but i need her fixed right you boys get the poles and the cloaks and anything else that used to be in the holds to peddle as souvenirs and in your offshift time you fix my ship right and tight butoh youd better not try to do anything with those educational toys he added hastily they tend to explode can we take em apart and do something with the bits the chief engineer asked so long as you dont get blown up youre welcome to pausert replied wondering if he was finally going to get rid of the wretched things after all is it a deal let me get the crew together and you can put it to them the chief said but on the surface of it i like it and ill get my niece with goth doing the negotiating an agreement was soon reached that was satisfactory for both sides even himbo petey approved when he was approached for permission thats a cut above fluffy clowndog toys and whirligigs he said rubbing his hands with pleasure with no children on this planet i was wondering what we were going to do for souvenirs in fact i ought to canvas the rest of the ship to see if anyone has any more ideas besides programs they did recordings of the circus music banners to brighten up spartan quarters cut from spare synthasilk and printed with the same images as the posters and fliers badges for coveralls of animals and clownfaces carryalls and cups and drinkbottles with petey byrum and keep blazoned across them copies of the scripts of the plays with holos of the performers in costume the showboat began to buzz with frenzied activity as those who hadnt come up with acts or whose acts were marginal at best began working frantically to produce souvenirs aimed at adult pockets rather than childrens and in the meantime there was a showboat crammed full of thingsunused or duplicate personal items stuff that was still in the holds of the ships that had been bought and incorporated into the frame forgotten bits and bobs that people had brought aboard and discovered they didnt needmuch of which could be branded with the showboat name and logo and put into a stall until the real souvenirs were ready himbo petey beamed with approval upon it all for the ship got a cut of the profits from every stall and he got a cut of the ships portion in fact he elected to keep the show dark for an unprecedented second day to allow the merchandise stalls to take the place of those who decided that they would rather peddle souvenirs than compete on talent alone meanwhile the rumors outside the gates continued to swell curious and increasingly impatient miners began to show up at the ticket office to demand schedules and ask about advance tickets for particular shows so when the gates did open at last at dawn on the third day there was a gratifyingly large crowd which pausert didnt see of course because he was in morning rehearsal but when the cast broke for lunch he was gratified to see several of his allweather cloaks and one or two of those dratted fishing poles going past in the possession of new owners he inhaled his food and headed for sideshow alley the stalls were never actually empty the morning shift in his stall was being maintained by one of the aerial contortionists from the big top who was part of the curtain act and the spanish web ensemble here she performed solo contortion and balancing on the tiny stage as pausert entered the stall from the back she passed him dressed in her street clothes with a friendly wave no accolades yet she said cheerfully but im getting a full house every turn excellent he replied and ducked inside there was just enough room behind the stage for him to change into his escapist costumein his case a skintight shirt in silvery synthasilk and looser breeches in electric blue as he put his own props up on the stage he heard the talker outside running his pitch talking up the act sometimes when things were slow acts would come out in front for a freesee pausert had the feeling that would not be the case here then he relled vatch do you need me asked silvereyes are you willing to be my assistant the way second littlest is usually sure you dont even need to feed me unbelievable a cooperative vatch at least for as long as it wasnt bored but maybe the reactions of the audience would keep it from being bored he could hope anyway the persona he had cooked up for this act was in truth based a bit on the way he used to think of himself and a lot on some of the overinflated egos of his superiors on nikkeldepain he waited a bit nervously behind the curtain for the talker to give him the signal that the stall was as full as it was going to geta flashing red light just above his head then it was his turn to toe the control that set the automated lights and his recorded music going and the curtain to rise then he struck a pose as the curtain came up the stage lights brightened and the house lights dimmed the audience of miners saw a fellow in flamboyant costume in an exaggerated strongman pose he took a couple moreequally exaggeratedposes while his recorded music played until the audience began to chuckle realizing that he was playing someone who was altogether too full of himself then his talker came in and began doing the spiel and he went into his act the first couple of escapes were done straight though with a ridiculous amount of flourish then came the comic sequence he wasnt altogether certain that the vatch was going to helpuntil practically on cuehe felt the cool breath of air on his hands that told him that silvereyes was doing goths job exactly the roar of laughter as he struggled while the talker pretended consternation came as a relief and a surprise there were a lot of people in here he finished the act exactly as scripted and went into the blowoff poses to gales of laughter as the curtain went down perfect he thought at the vatch that was fun replied silvereyes with enthusiasm i like the watchers but what was that noise they were making its called laughing and it means that they are having fun too will the next ones laugh too as long as we do the act right pausert kept part of his attention on the barker outside as he cleaned up and replaced all of his props for a while he had been unhappy with this act until hed hit on the idea of creating a kind of character to play it might have been silly but once the audience was laughing at the pompous character rather than at him it became a lot more enjoyable to put on the shows then we have to do the act right the vatch sounded quite determined on that score can we change it when we get tired of doing the same thing i think thats a good idea he told it cautiously but you need to talk to me beforehand about the changes you want to make or they might not laugh when you do them he sensed its agreement and then the light flashed and it was time to do the show again three shows an hour with a break for fifteen minutes for four hours that was his shift in the stall and every show was full up the tent stall held fifteen or twenty people at a timeprobably fifteen the size of the miners hed been seeingand it seemed as if the audience was completely new each time it was astonishing even without tips or accolades he was earning a good pile of cash this afternoon his talker with whom he split the take since the talker was as important in a way as the act had never ever been able to fill the stall at every show before every time the audience laughed the vatch giggled with pleasure the little thing was actually enjoying performing by the third hour it was suggesting small cosmetic changeslike holding the drape down when hed freed his hands so that he had to fight his way out of itthat increased the comedic impact of the blowoff when his turn in the stall was finally over and he made way for an exotic dancer who was one of the glamourriders with the fanderbag act the vatch was practically glowing with happiness as it popped away and it was a littlejust a littlebigger now that was interesting he hadnt fed it so how had it gotten bigger could it be that something about strong human emotions also fed it he was going to ask goth about that when they met for dinner but the four little heavy knots of scrap cloth that the leewit thunked down on the table in front of him drove the question right out of his head lookee here captain she crowed tips we arent the first to get themthe dancers are starting to get a lot goth added judiciously but a couple of the miners got all sentimental about our siblingrivalry business i guess sentimental will work if you dont have a pair of big fewmets exclaimed hantis plopping herself down in her usual place at the table and here i thought i was going to be the one to surprise you she added a couple of knots of her own to the small pile the buzz is that the merchants are doing all right and that those benighted fishing poles and cloaks are about half gone already what passes for fish around here concentrates metal in its skeleton its only copper iron and some sulfur but its pretty like peacock ore some of the engineers are trying to figure out how to clean the meat from the bones and use the things for jewelry no point in trying to peddle it here but maybe our next stop the big top was full and everybody seemed to be enjoying the show a lot said goth makes me wonder what these miners are going to think about the play pausert had been wondering that too were their tastes as sophisticated and eclectic as mannicholo seemed to think or would the old yarthe plays be beyond them but as he opened his mouth to ponder the question aloud hulik appeared and her agitation caught the attention of everyone around their table pausert couldnt recall ever having seen her look this wayit wasnt upset exactly but it was disturbed and excited andunsettled enough so that everyone stared at her until hantis broke the little pool of silence at their table by asking the obvious hulik she said urgently whats happened its the daal she whispered sedmon hes here are you sure was all pausert could think of to say and he knew it was a stupid thing the moment the words were out of his mouth hulik gave him a withering glance of course im sure captain she said i talked to him you what that came out of several mouths simultaneously and hulik waved at them frantically to keep them from all talking at once its all right hes not chasing us not exactly butoh let me begin at the beginning she paused took a deep breath and settled herself i had no idea he was here until i got a message asking if i would meet with him just before lunch i wouldnt have believed it was sedmon except that the message came with certain recognition signs pausert nodded that was only the smart thing to do and i agreed to meet him at one of the public food stalls anyway she was regaining her composure and now in contrast pausert realized just how flustered she had looked we didnt have a lot of time to talk but we both agreed that the meeting was more for the purpose of identifying ourselves he says he has a lot of information for us and a lot of warnings i told him wed already figured that virtually everyone in known space is after us again and that our safeconducts were worth exactly nothing right now and we agreed to meet again after the play tonight at the venture you think theres any chance hes setting us up asked goth no hulik replied indignantly then as if trying to cover her vehemence said more calmly no firstly he doesnt really have anything to gain by turning us over to anyone whos after us what could they offer the daal he already rules an entire system thats a point goth acknowledged and secondly ive never known sedmon to be in the least inclined to do anything to aggravate the witches of karres and i cant see that starting now you all must admit that interfering with us and what were doing would seriously aggravate karres hulik raised an eyebrow and the leewit laughed have to admit youre right there too goth agreed but it must be something pretty pressing for the daal of uldune to have come after us personally hulik didnt say anything but pausert thought she seemed to be a little flushed and she was staring off into the distance as if her eyes werent focused a sudden wild surmise came to him goth started pounding him on the back with a look of concern are you okay captain she asked clumping stupid scoffed the leewit choking to death on this goop hadnt got a bone in it chapter sir richard had debated long and hard about which of the new plays to present first romeo and juliet had a strong story of course and was full of both action and pathos the scottish playodd how even pausert now could hardly bring himself to even think of it by its proper titlehad plenty of fighting too not to mention the added attraction of the magic and all those murders twelfth night on the other hand though a comedy wasnt really all that funny of the four it was probably the one least likely for a new audience to appreciate which was why cravan had added it into the repertoire last a midsummer nights dream was a lot funnier even if you didnt altogether understand the language and there was that ladies mudwrestling scene in the end that was what had decided cravan of all of the plays a midsummer nights dream was probably the most accessible and with the mining population heavily weighted in favor of men the mudwrestling much though he abhorred it himself was probably going to please even the densest of them the miners proved just as pleasantly intelligent and appreciative as had been suggested they laughed at most of the right places ooohd and ahd at the fairylights provided by the leewit and goth and yes were very enthusiastic about the mudwrestling scene enough so that when the curtain came down and the cast came out for final bows there was a pleasant pattering of those little knots of golddust on the stage at huliks feet and those of her costar dame ethulassia got a share of them too interestingly enough pausert had to admit that she was a regal figure in the elven queens elaborate costume and if she was more than a few years huliks senior the exaggerated makeup that went with the costume went a fair way to hiding that mostly though pausert suspected that it was the incredible bosom which did the trick even hantis got a knot or two under other circumstances pausert would have been the first to suggest staying to find out just how much had been collected not tonight though hulik managed to put on a veneer of graceful modesty when cravan asked if she wanted to stay on with the company accountant and shook her head if i cant trust you and himbo petey to deal fairly with us all i doubt my being there in person would make much difference besides its been a very long day and there are going to be a lot more of them ahead of us id rather stare at the inside of my eyelids than an accounting page and speaking of accounting pausert said in a low voice as they all hurried towards the venture i for one would like to find out just why our bank account was frozen if it hadnt been for that we might be at our destination right now im sure hell have a good explanation hulik said though she sounded uncertain i clumping well hope so the leewit said ominously or it just might be sedmon of the five lives pretty soon the daal of uldune chose that moment to step out from the ventures airlockjust in time to hear that pintsized bloodcurdling threat he smiled serenely please little wisdom have mercy that ploy was never meant to do more than create a day or twos delay in order that we could catch up with you you were all in grave danger and heading into still more from her scowl the leewit was not much mollified neither was pausert well by the time the trouble your delaying tacticcaused us was over he said with some heat wed been shot at thrown into prison kidnapped shot at again sunk into ferroplast shot at some more and were running short on air and fuel with help like that who needs enemies i can explain said the sedmon smoothly he gestured regally inviting them to enter their spaceship as if it was his own palace oddly he managed to pull it offeven after introducing his twin once they reached the ships salon hulik looked a little smug more than a little in fact you are not entirely surprised i gather one of the sedmons asked her cocking his head his twins head was also cocked although in the opposite direction to pausert the look both of them were giving the do eldel seemed oddly intense no not really hulik looked back and forth from one to the other i was always curious about that of the six lives business and did a little discreet investigation on my own the timing of your public appearances is not im afraid always up to professional standards quite good mind you for a monarch but from my vantage point a bit on the sloppy side there have been occasional reports of these odd overlaps not many and i doubt if anyone except me has ever really put it together perhaps in the future a little expert advice indeed said both of the sedmons simultaneously almost eagerly the leewit interrupted she was almost crosseyed staring at them you mean youreyoure she gave her older sister an exasperated glance whats the word goth sextuplets but i dont think thats it here i mean i think theyre clones the sedmons nodded again simultaneously that is correct although even that does not fully encompass the reality the witches of karres are not the only ones who have delved into the mysteries of klatha hantis nodded you were birthed by the hospitalers of ghrauth then she made a face risky business dealing with them pausert had never heard of the hospitalers of ghrauth but he noticed that both goth and the leewits eyes were wider than they had been clumping crazy muttered the leewit the sedmons shrugged it is an old arrangement said one of them dating back through the last four daals of uldune a bit dangerous i suppose but let us say that my forefathers not only paid extremely well but had certain methods of ensuring that the hospitalers stuck to their side of the bargain goth seemed to suppress a snort no fooling burn their moonlet down to bedrock well yes that too said the other sedmon modestly though of course that would only be an inconvenience to the monsters but the daals have other longstanding arrangements you know the hospitalers have always been considerably more impressed by our friendly relations with the nemode cluster so was goth from the way her eyes kept widening the leewits eyes bore a fair resemblance to saucers clumping insane she choked hulik on the other hand simply looked intrigued very intrigued pausert cleared his throat forcefully he didnt understand anything they were talking about and had more pressing concerns anyway you were going to explain why you had our account frozen the sedmons knew about the nanite plague they had known about the agandars fleet and the iss being in pursuit of the venture and its crew this according to the two that were here was why they had put a holda hold only and then only with the instructions to verify with us before authorizing paymenton the account with the daals bank on uldune the hold was on the account the righthand sedmon said crossly it wasnt an order to hold the captain who tried to use it all that was supposed to happen was that the person verifying the information was supposed to call us and we would release the account it seemed a perfectly reasonable and quiet way to find out where you were without sending out messages that would have revealed you and us to enemies our instructions were not carried out and we are most aggrieved hmph not half as aggrieved as we were pausert replied but he was privately feeling a lot less angry when sedmon of the six lives was most aggrieved heads usually began to roll your instructions may have been subverted and contaminated excellency said hantis when the iss fails to honor a safeconduct in the empress own hand such a thing is not unlikely both sedmons nodded somberly like a pair of souvenir bobbleheads all the more reason to be aggrieved the lefthand one said this time very grimly indeed pausert could practically hear the echo of a falling ax behind his words and our sources give us three reasons why such things could have happened to you and to us onethat someone high in the empress government has been infected with the plague or is jockeying to make himself regent or emperor we think the former is the more likely possibility otherwise why try to stop you you only bring word of the nanite plaguethis could not help or harm someone who is merely engaging in cutthroat politics so there would be no reason to try to intercept you pausert nodded and so did the nartheby sprite twosomeone high in the iss is the infected entity we thought of both of those ourselves said goth evenly unlike the leewit she was not scowlinghad not scowled once in factbut there was always something rather unsettling about that expressionless face on a girl who was still only twelve standard years old for a moment the sedmons almost seemed to flinch a little ah but there is a third possibility the righthand sedmon raised a finger the agandars followers pursue you under the assumption that you have the agandars treasure or at least the key to it i dont pausert began with some heat but the sedmons both waved him to silence he might not have obeyed except that seeing both of them move and act as one was oddly compelling and a bit creepy whether you do or not is irrelevant the lefthand sedmon said the point is that they believe that you do and so perhaps does someone in the iss eh said pausert and oh said goth and the leewit together the older sisters face now had an expression and the leewit had left off scowling captain someone in the iss might be looking to make himself rich on the agandars treasure said the leewit and thats a lot of treasure hantis and pul stared at each other reason enough pul agreed even for ignoring the empress safeconduct personally of all three reasons this is the one that is the most likely we think the righthand sedmon said greed is a more reliable motivator than anything else pausert didnt agree with him although he wished he did the daals third alternative was the least frightening a corrupt iss official was somehow easier to deal with in his mind than someone whowellwasnt himself anymore that just made the hair on the back of his neck stand up and worse made him want to shut himself in his stateroom and weld the door closed now we have unlocked your account but it may not be safe to use it the lefthand sedmon continued clearly someone has a watch on it we underwent some difficulties ourselves in the course of finding you that lead us to believe that our own safeguards off uldune are not as secure as we had thought we have access to other accounts to pay off your ship and refuel it of course but it might be best not to touch them until you have lost pursuit soit may be that this is your best and safest means of travel for some time but the petey b wont be going anywhere near the core worlds pausert protested both sedmons raised their eyebrows oh said the righthand one the ship goes where the profit is does it not and if the daals bank on uldune elects to sponsor this ship on a goodwill cultural tour spiraling towards the core there might even be some profit in it the lefthand sedmon added thoughtfully these oldyartheian plays are strangely compelling especially the one with the mudwrestling scene sponsoring the showboat would certainly guarantee that it went where you wanted pausert interjected hastily but sedmonuh or is it sedmonsyou arent dealing with some backcountry yokel here himbo petey is shrewd so are richard cravan and dame ethulassiaand himbo wont do anything like this without consulting with them theyre all going to be curious about why the daals bank is suddenly sponsoring cultural tours and they probably wont stop looking for an answer until they find one and in the process they may reveal us to more than just the cast and crew of the showboat hulik cautioned the sedmons pursed their lips just sedmon please whichever of us you are addressingor however many at once murmured the one on the right a moment later his clone said a bit reluctantly in that case i believe we are going to have to tell them the truth most of it at least my identity will have to be fudged of course beyond whats needed to make the offer of payment believable but i think we can leave the specific details regarding the nanite plague on the vague side as well as your exact identities beyond being agents for the empress i see no reason to mention karres at all the proposal should have made pausert very unhappy in fact it did the opposite logic and cunning maneuver be damned his instincts told him that himbo petey richard cravan and dame ethulassia were to be trusted in a matter of this sort besides the duplicity they had been engaged in was chafing at him more and more im for it he said immediately hulik sighed it goes entirely against all my training she said but i feel the same hantis shrugged at this point there is danger either way but himbo might order us off his ship and keep ours this is a mining world retorted the lefthand sedmon if we cannot buy an old freighter i would be very much surprised pausert winced he had grown very attached to the venture well we could probably buy our way off though that much activity might alert the people were trying to hide from i dont think hell dump us the leewit said suddenly himbo petey i mean and id feel better telling him too goth nodded vezzarn shrugged and the grikdog simply grunted it seems unanimous said the righthand sedmon i suggest then that you tell him now if possible me pausert asked what about you it seems prudent that we remain an unknown the sedmons said together in fact added the lefthand one we intend to send one of us back to our own ship to remain there for the duration it is not a wise idea for us both to be seen at the same time it didnt ever occur to you to pass yourself off as perfectly ordinary twins did it goth asked sardonically i dont know sometimes all that supposed intelligence the sedmons looked stricken twins they said together but do twins sort of said vezzarn thoughtfully tapping his finger against his glass not a real psionic bond like the hospitalers seem to have given you but twins sometimes do act together talk togetherknow when each others in trouble why i remember a couple of girls in a socialclub back on nardis that hulik coughed vezzarn flushed and cut off whatever he was going to say very well then the sedmons said we will come with youbut not as ourselves agents for the bank perhaps i dont care how you come said pausert flatly so long as you have some way of proving to himbo petey that you have access to enough money to commission his ship for this cultural cruise because if you cant do that you might as well unlock our account so we can cut loose and take our chances that said the sedmons would be a bad idea himbo petey looked from hantis to pausert and back again his eyes narrowed pausert expected an explosion but he wasnt getting one he wasnt sure whether to be relieved or more worried well petey said at last if that doesnt beat anything ive ever heard but it certainly explains some otherwise inexplicable things himbo said richard cravan thoughtfully mind you i am less than pleased with their lack of candor up to this point on the other hand i can understand why they prevaricated sure so can i growled petey but i still dont like it not one bit gainst my showboat principles you have to admit that not knowing hasnt harmed you or the showboat hulik pointed out reasonably and youre serious about paying the petey b to go on this innersystem tour are you himbo petey licked his lips i dunno i just dont know itd mean guaranteed pay no matter what the box office took in and thats not to be sneezed at but i dunno himbie cried ethulassia seizing his arm urgently and drawing him close i like the idea she and cravan exchanged a quick glance and ethulassia nodded slightly as she did sothe dame was no mean magician herselfthe incredible bosom seemed to expand still further himbo cravan said his eyes taking on something of an unholy glow you know how my one dream has been to take my company and these plays to the central worlds you know how sure ive been that we could hold our own against any other theatrical company there this is our chance this is our chance to prove what we can do who we are and at no risk at all to you financial or otherwise please himbo please i have never truly begged you for anything before this but i am begging you nowplease let us do this himbo petey looked from ethulassia to cravan then to pausert then the sedmons then back to cravan well cravan seized his hand and pumped it thank you himbo thank you you are making my dream come true petey hemmed and hawed a little looking pleased but embarrassed but we dont leave here until weve earned everything there is to earn here he added hastily damned if i will showboat principles are showboat principles we do not disagree said the righthand sedmon earnestly it would seem odd if we did and aher he coughed our own disguiseperhaps bona fides is a more salubrious termneeds to be established we think perhaps our ship should be added to the frame and a job found for us temporarily of course of course himbo agreed he cocked an eyebrow at pausert and hulik suggestions mentalist act said hulik instantly cagesweeper said pausert just as quickly the sedmons gave the captain a look which did not bode well for pauserts fate and fortune should he ever find himself back on uldune again but he couldnt pass up the opportunity once in a lifetime that was besides he was still a little peeved about the episode on pidoon chapter of course the sedmons were not made into cagesweepers they would have been entirely useless at the job for one thing they were accustomed to having people following them about picking up what they absentmindedly dropped not cleaning up other creatures messes old habits are too hard to break much as pausert would have enjoyed watching the sedmons try to cope even he had to admit that no as hulik had suggested the sedmons got a mentalist act it was easy enough for them to do and a good talker made up for their inexperience they also got a makework job as dame ethulassias assistants in wardrobe not that they were any good at sewing and the like but they could at least check in the costumes that needed repairs and cleaning and check out the ones to replace them wardrobe covered not only the thespians but the entire company so there was enough work to make them look busy at least the sedmons had agreed initially to the plan not to leave until every last mael had been milked from the miners simply to resolve the initial situation but they had always assumed they could eventually persuade the showmaster otherwise they were wrong absolutely and completely wrong no argument no persuasion not all of the sedmons diplomatic experience served himbo petey was not going to budge from this planet as long as there was money to be made there and no matter what the sedmons said to him he was adamant on that score it seemedthe sedmons were quite astonished actuallythat the man took his ridiculous showboat principles in deadly earnest it was like dealing with a religious zealot the sedmons were left with the depressing feeling that receipts were never going to drop off that the petey b would be here forever they had to get out of here somewhere out there the nanite plague had started they were sure of it too many things were going wrong out there and it chafed at the sedmons that although the other four had the best information services in the galaxy at their disposal there just was not enough information coming in why else would karres have disappeared again they had to leave and yet it seemed that himbo peteys people would never want to and for a while it looked as if their worst fears might be right miners continued to pack the stalls the big top and the theater and accolades continued to come in hulik was the recipient of quite a few of those especially when she played juliet or helene and that was another source of fretting for the daal when that happened when the gifts and inevitable marriage proposals appeared backstage the emotions stirred up were something the sedmons were ill equipped to handle but hulik always sent the same answer to the proposals a politely even kindly worded refusal and the sedmons relaxed there was time apparently time yesand now time spent in huliks company the experience only confirmed what had sent them across the galaxy in the first place it hadnt been the danger of the nanite plague not really the sedmons were in love hulik do eldel was impossibly enough the most important person in the universe to them as important as any one of their six selves maybe more the only problem was they hadnt the faintest idea what to do about it how could they propose any sort of alliance with a woman any woman what sort of woman would consider such a thing what had always seemed to be their greatest strength their very nature now seemed to be the greatest of curses nevertheless they could not would not leave aside from any other considerations this mad longing for her kept them at her side surely with enough time they would think of something or hulik would accept one of those proposals or they would fall out of love such things could happen however unlikely it seemed and it seemed more and more unlikely with every passing day before long the sedmons were in a perpetual agony of indecision what to do what to do after two weeks however audiences for the sideshow acts finally began to drop down to more normal levels and some acts stopped getting any attention at all the exotic dancersin fact any act featuring a pretty femaleremained popular but some of the rest began to cut back or close it was obvious why it was happening of course you could only watch a comedic escapism act so many times before you got tired of it but the theater stayed packed and cravan made up for the dropoff in attendance at the sideshows by putting all four of the old plays back into production those who had closed their sideshow acts quickly found places to fill there even the sedmons were recruited for nonspeaking roles two weeks became four the sedmons still had not thought of a way to approach hulik they began to think that they never would and in all of their lives they could not remember feeling such despair they actually indulged in daydreams imagining scenarios in which they rescued hulik and her companions from thugs of varying design the costumes changed though the scenes remained pretty much the same they even dreamed such things at night and in fact almost came to long for such a thing to happen at least it would give an opportunity to speak it became worse when new ships arrived bearing new miners would one of them win huliks heart or had it already been given perhaps to one of the thespians that last thought was the worst of all pausert went through his limbering exercises as he had done so many times although by now he was no longer nervous about that part of his role as mercutio his body knew every choreographed movement so thoroughly that he could have done his fight scenes blindfolded or drunk so all that mattered was his own preparation warming up his muscles so that he wouldnt injure himself himbo petey had confided to the thespians that it was getting to be time to move along he knew the signs and cravan agreed with him the advertisements would go out tonight last four days onplanet see your favorites again for the final time there were several potential problems not the least of which was the possibility of developing jealousy between those whose acts had lasted past the novelty stage and those whose acts had not but even the thespians were beginning to see signs of the contempt bred by familiarity early in the run the audiences had been forgiving but now if someone fumbled a line or a prop there was a subtle grumbling even on occasion outright raspberries so there it was time to go the announcement of last days would bring a final influx of customers and cash and then they would lift and now they would be heading in the direction where they needed to go hubwards towards the empress to deliver their message and what then pausert only wished he knew he could not imagine how even the empress could do anything about the nanite plague but who was he to assume he knew anything at all he heard the start of the music for act three and swaggered onto the stage as the curtain rose benvolio fanned himself with his hand and spoke the first lines of act i pray thee good mercutio lets retire the day is hot the capulets abroad and if we meet we shall not scape a brawl for now these hot days is the mad blood stirring pausert made a face and waggled his finger in benvolios face thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says god send me no need of thee and by the operation of the second cup draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need he raised his eyes heavenward as if asking for patience they traded jibes until tybalt entered vonard kleesp playing the role with his usual swaggering panache benvolio exclaimed by my head here come the capulets he flung himself down on the steps of a propfountain right in their way by my heel i care not and that was when pausert relled vatch not that silvereyes hadnt been around quite faithfully it was just that the vatch hadnt made its presence known during one of the plays for quite some time it had been quite scrupulous in fact about not making itself a nuisance suddenly from the aura the vatch was emitting pausert realized that silvereyes had not come here in play or jest trouble trouble trouble shrilled the vatch a sudden commotion erupted backstage vonard kleesps eyes narrowed there is one sound that no fencer every forgets if hes heard it once it is the sudden snap of the protected tip of a fencing blade being broken off it is the sound that says someone has a deadly blade in his hands now a length of steel that can kill you it was the sound that pausertand everyone elseheard at that moment move and you die said kleesp softly so of course pausert moved he rolled out of immediate striking distance desperately trying to get his own blade free at the same time it got tangled up in his cloak though and as he shot to his feet he saw kleesp coming at him and he thought it was all over but like a miraclevatchstyle miracle he realizedthe cloak flung itself off his blade wrapped itself around his free hand giving him a shield of the sort that streetfencers would use and there was a lot more noise going on backstage pausert didnt have time to think much about it but his initial assumption that vonard kleesp had simply gone mad due to the effects of his alcoholism vanished this was foul play of some sort not lunacy kleesp lunged the tip ripped cloth on his hose and pausert felt warm wetness on his thigh then the blade licked across his upper arm penetrating and being pulled free the captain tried to get into the most sensible position which a man with a buttoned foil can take when facing a murderer with a naked blade that position was somewhere a long way off unfortunately short of jumping into the audience pausert had run out of space to go to so he parried the next lunge wishing desperately it was really as easy to convert a foil into a live blade as the threedee made it out to be it wasnt or there would have been a lot of dead fencers every year kleesp had obviously prepared his sword ahead of time pausert had no such advantage standing on the tip and giving it a sharp jerk upwards was a futile pastimeunless you had a handy metal vise under your shoes the soft rubber sole on the buskins he was wearing certainly wouldnt do the job so he did what the sword could doparry he managed to force kleesps blade up so he could grapple the man pausert dropped the foil and snatching at the base of the naked blade with his cloaked hand clung to kleesps shirtfront with the other it was the last thing the murderous actor had expected what in the name of pathams seventh hell are you playing at damn you pausert hissed into his ear drop the sword and back off kleesp wrestled with manic strength im going to kill you and be a wealthy man pausert he hissed back the agandars fortune belongs to me since i was his lieutenant you think i spent this much time tracking it down and setting my trap just to walk away not a chance he managed to wrench his blade free but he was still too close to use it effectively and before he could back away pausert had him in a bear hug whatever else the captain wasnt letting his armed opponent go kleesp tried to headbutt the captain but pausert had been in too many brawls as a junior naval officer he met the headbutt with one of his ownharder and better placed kleesp grunted softly and for a moment seemed to weaken offbalance they stumbled against the one of the prop pillars at the edge of the stage the prop never intended to withstand such impact promptly collapsed they fell to the floor together kleesps foil was jarred out of his hand when they hit the stage skittering a few feet away pausert felt a momentary surge of elation thensomehowkleesp managed to break the captains bear hug and roll clear the actorassassin scrabbled for his foil and came back to his feet weapon in hand he lunged at pausert in a single smooth motion pausert dove out of the way and landed painfully on another foil hed barely managed to take it in hand before kleesp was onto him again the captain parried successfully and took a step back and then he learned the lesson all good actors do if you are retreating dont do so towards the edge of the stage he tumbled over and fell against the front row seats with a leap kleesp followed him give them space yelled someone move the chairs to pauserts astonishment the audience was cheering wildly this was entertainment they thought the play was still on the cheers grew to a deafening roar as the captains sword and kleesps clashed in a flurry of thrusts and parries alas not all the chairs had been moved out of the way pausert stumbled over one bringing it down in his fall luckily kleesp fell also the captains sudden fall caused his lunge to miss wildly and the assassin lost his balance pausert snatched up the chair hed fallen over and slammed it down on kleesps back unfortunately it was one of the flimsy folding chairs used for the front seats of overflow crowds it couldnt do any real damagethough it bought pausert enough time to vault back onto the stage kleesp followed relentlessly youll pay for that he snarled another flurry of lunges and parriesalas all lunges by kleesp and parries by pausert what else could he do with a tipped sword steadily the captain was forced back towards the wings he stumbled over the fallen prop pillar again and rolled backstage under the curtains kleesp followed instantly sensing the kill using his free hand to thrust aside the curtains he arrived backstage so quickly that the captain was just getting back onto his feet kleesp lunged at pausert hard knowing it was useless pausert tried to hold him off with the foil but kleesps blade struck the captain neatly on the middle of the left breast his powerful lunge also carried kleesp forward with his full weight pressed against pauserts foil which the captain had held up stiffly in that last futile gesture the buttoned tip bent as intended the other blade carefully weakened with an acuteangled cut so it would snap to a sharp point did not bend at all it slid with sickening ease right through the ribs and into the chest cavity kleesp looked down gaping blood suddenly gushed out of his open mouth youve killed me he coughed the words were spoken more in chagrin than anger that was quite understandable pausert thought wildly he didnt know much about the mentality involved but he was quite sure that dying because youd grabbed the wrong blade was not going to make for bragging rights in whatever afterlife pirates enjoyed or didnt another cough another gush of blood it was obvious the sword had pierced the assassins heart kleesp clawed at the blade but his eyes were already rolling horrified pausert released the hilt of the sword some strange last surge of effort kept kleesp on his feet for a few stumbling backwards stepsjust long enough for him to collapse through the curtains and back onto the stage his impromptu and quite unplanned reentrance produced a veritable hurricane of applause pausert shook his head and then realized that his troubles were far from over something hard and narrow was now pressing into his lower spine the way something presses which is being made to do so thats an m blaster youre feeling growled a voice in his ear now moveslowlyback onto the stage seeing no alternative pausert obeyed as soon as he came through the curtains pausert realized that his earlier premonition was quite correctkleesp had been no madman suddenly unhinged hed planned everything as part of a coordinated effort there were three men standing on the stage who constituted no part of the thespian troupe the captain vaguely recognized two of themsome of the locals hired on by the showboat during its stop at tornam the same planet where vonard kleesp had joined the company four men in all counting the one still prodding pausert forward and all of them were armed with ms not a handgun any military force would favor due to its short range but one that was quite in demand in criminal circles whatever that model blaster lacked in range it made up for in destructive power the actors were also on the stage but they all had their hands raised and it wasnt just the actors either however theyd managed it kleesps cohorts had rounded up vezzarn as wellalong with one of the sedmons no funny stuff pausert growled the voice in his ear or well kill all the actors starting with the women dont think we wont were the agandars pirates and you know our reputation now we need those two kids also and then were all out of here you figure out how to get them or we start the killing in the odd way that one notices details at this sort of time pauserts eyes fell on one of the blasterholding men on the stage the one nearest to him except for the one at his back that he still hadnt seen something about the mans stance made it clear that he was now the one in charge the burly pirate grinned sardonically you might have killed the boss but i guess that just means more money for the rest of us once we get our hands on the agandars account so where are the two witch kids i really have no idea said pausert slowly his arm was now beginning to hurt he needed time to think he wasnt going to get it the pirate turned to one of his associates and pointed at hulik shoot her in the head itll help his memory and then things started happening very fast and all at once somebody kicked the backstage door off its hinges a flat came hissing down onto one of the assassins knocking him off his feet unseen handsor vatch oneshad apparently untied a rope a whistle like a punch on the jaw felled another the pirate leader one sedmon came through the door hed just kicked in the other the one already on the stage dove at the pirate who was bringing his blaster to bear on hulik he never would have made it in time except that somethinga pen pausert couldnt quite tellwent sailing from vezzarns hand and struck the assassin whatever it was it was sharp enough to gash the mans face and completely distract him an instant later the sedmons tackle had the pirate on the floor and the two of them fell to wrestling for control of the weapon that left the stillunseen man holding the blaster against pauserts spine old naval training came back to the captain holding a weapon pressed directly against a trained fighter is the trick of an amateuror a thug grown overconfident a quick twist and an elbow strike knocked the weapon aside the same elbow came back up in a forearm smash to the jaw that drove the man backward the captain followed raising his hand for a very nasty strike at the throat the strike never landed the fellow already staggering flipped onto his back as if hed tripped over something unseen the unseen something emitted a very gothlike ow and the assassins head made an even louder thunk as it smashed against the floor of the stage pausert pounced on him he hit the man once with his fist a nasty temple smash but he did so more out of anger and general principle than from any real need the fellow had obviously been knocked cold from the impact of his head against the stage the captain pried the blaster out of a limp hand and rose to his feet ready to use it but there was no need vezzarn had apparently joined the sedmons tackle on the man who started to shoot hulik between the two of them especially since vezzarn had retrieved whatever missile hed thrown so accurately and had then used it to pausert winced he winced again when he caught sight of the pirate whod been floored by the falling flat in and of itself the flat hadnt done much more than knock the man down what had kept him down thereafter was puls jaws clamped on his leg well at one time clamped on his leg right now the leg itself was no longer attached mentally the captain shrugged if the thug didnt bleed to death before medical help arrived modern prosthetics were quite miraculous and although pausert wasnt any more familiar with the ethos of maximum security prisons than he was of the pecking order in the pirate afterworld he suspected that stumpy was a better monicker than the goof who picked up the wrong sword not that he cared anyway live by the growl die by the growl so be it besides pausert had other problems that were far more pressing first the applause from the audience was so deafening he could hardly think the exuberant miners still thought it was all part of the act apparently they ascribed such minor details as a severed leg and several quarts of spilled blood to smoke and mirrors secondly the accolades now showering the stageno raining on itwere a positive menace gold is heavy even in small pouches pausert found himself wondering for a moment if he and his fellow thespians were about to undergo an ancient form of death by torture stoning he thought it was called then he spotted the person he was looking for off in a corner and forgot about everything else pausert felt almost dizzy with relief goth was holding the leewit both of the sisters shaking a little in the aftermath of using a lot of klatha power theyd need to be fed a lot and quickly but hed deal with that later goth had been looking for him also and the moment his eyes fell on that expressionless face he knew she would be okay for a while something in her eyes told him so he wasnt sure what it was but he didnt doubt the knowledge deal with the rest first then he saw that dame ethulassia was binding up a bleeding gash on vezzarns forehead hantis and pul were mounting guard on the pirate whom the sedmon and vezzarn had grappled the man looked to be badly beaten up but he was not unconscious it hardly mattered his gaze was flicking back and forth from his cohorts severed leg to the instrument that had severed it pul in full gape mode was an utterly paralyzing sight as for hulik whod almost been killed hulik was cradling one of the sedmons in her lap while the other hovered over her sedmon sedmon speak to me she was pleading why is she doing that big real thing there is nothing wrong with the divided thing the vatch was sorely puzzled and pausert didnt blame it the captain was quite sure there was nothing seriously wrong with the sedmon beyond a few bruises he wasnt breathing the way someone would if he was knocked out northe real tipoffwas his clone acting at all anxious in fact he seemed immensely pleased please sedmon hulik whimpered please slowly theatrically the sedmon opened his eyes whathappened he asked putting on such an act of being dazed and confused that pausert had to fight down a laugh you saved us sedmon both of you you saved us all hey the leewit interjected from the corner annoyed enough to come out of her own shock other people had something to do with that too hulik ignored her you were amazing she said can you move i dont know said the sedmon who started to sit up then groaned my head here ill get you both back to your ship said hulik tenderly helping the prone one to his feet ill take care of you until you feel better ohthank you lovely lady the sedmon breathed she blushed hulik blushed pausert could see vezzarns jaw sagging his own jaw was pretty loose too we need to get you both lying down she told them you might have gotten hurt somewhere else pausert felt a gentle tug on his sleeve come over here captain and well see to that said dame ethulassia tugging on his good elbow and pointing to the wound on his other arm i realize that the do eldel is normally your ships medic butha no use trying to get her attention right now she coaxed pausert over to sit down beside vezzarn and began cutting his shirtsleeve away he yelled as she pulled the cloth out of the wound she ignored him just as resolutely as she ignored the corpse of her former paramour vonard kleesp here captain said someonerichard cravan from the richsounding voicehanding him a cup of something he drank it and felt a pleasant numbness begin immediately what he asked thickly what happened to hulik remember that i said she was in love but hadnt realized it yet asked ethulassia well she just realized it so did he they i mean hence the act one corner of her mouth came up in a sardonic little smile im glad we never gave either man a speaking roleive never seen such a terrible bit of overacting pausert blinked hed already deduced as much himself but now that he really thought about it hulik but his mind grappled feebly with the ramifications involved theres six of them ethulassia raised her eyebrow sextuplets must be clones i think either way her other eyebrow raised adventurous lass and one of her and thats not our problem captain said vezzarn somehow i doubt its much of a problem for her either besides rolled the rich tones of cravans voice sounding enthusiastic think of the dramatic possibilities for future thespians a modern update on the venerable hindu epic the mahabharatawhose heroine draupati im sure i neednt remind you married all five of the pandava brothers pausert has never heard of the mahabawhatever it was called he mumbled as much how unstudied of you captain reproved cravan you really should you know draupati and her husbands had such a lot of adventures oh volumes and volumes and volumes worth speaking of volumes pausert looked for goth and saw that other members of the cast were now providing her and the leewit with something to eat a lot of something to eat he didnt know where theyd found so much food on such short notice but he wasnt really surprised thespians hed come to learn were nothing if not adaptable and expert at improvisation especially with the leewits scolds to spur them on nothing left to worry about then the drug cravan had given him was definitely taking effect the audiences applause now sounded like a waterfall heard dimly at a distance the pitterpat of the accolades still showering the stage like a gentle rain i think id like to lie down and sleep pausert said weakly and did chapter i think were probably done with the agandars pirates said captain pausert as they sat around the mess table in the venture their leaderhis name turns out to be juhtaconfessed that kleesp was the agandars lieutenant although he still refuses to explain why theyve been chasing us so relentlessly but whats worrying me is the fact that we havent seen any more of the iss i mean by now they should have talked their way out of prison on tornam subradio should have carried the news ahead goth yawned shed had a hard day practicing their roles in the latest thespian production and some cage muckingout and bit of practice at their act the sedmons said theyd done some covering of our tracks besides captain the venture is ready to fly again we can run if they come looking and all for the cost of some tinklewood fishing poles said the leewit you ought to be ashamed of yourself captain pausert was getting the measure of the littlest witch by now i kept one as a switch he said calmly you never know when you might need it huh said the leewit you and which army but it was quite cheerfully said so does anyone know where were going next yes the sedmons have set the itinerary along with himbo were going to yin bauh its at least a place we should be safe from the iss i thought said goth biting the end of a strand of her brown hair that hulik said no place in the empire was really safe from the iss ah but yin bauh isnt really part of the empire missy said vezzarn looking very cheerful its an independent principality within the empires borders true enoughbut the sultan doesnt like competition with his secret police and has some pretty abrupt ways of making that clear what do they do there vezzarn asked the leewit just an edge of greed in her voice the witches didnt strictly speaking need gold dust but the leewit had enjoyed collecting it anyway is it another mining world like the last one yin bauh no the old spacer laughed and pointed at the dishcleaning unit if you want to know what they do there look on the base of half the cheap trade goods in the galaxy yb made the leewit looked astounded i thought that stood for why be made you mean its a planet its a planet all right a tax haven without the labor laws of most of the rest of the empire all the big companies have manufacturing plants there its a pretty grim sort of place mind you but it is nice and inconspicuously on our way to the imperial capital eh captain pausert nodded so it is and you girls should be nice and inconspicuously on your way to bath and bed and remember to wash behind your ears he said sternly to the leewit she stuck her tongue out at him im going to talk the little vatch into putting baking soda in your bubblebath dont have any child said pausert with a grin bubble bath was a newly discovered chink in the leewit antiwashing armor actually goth had privately told the captain most of that was for show these days but the leewit liked to resist baths she felt it was something she ought to do just as a matter of principle the mistress of the universe shouldnt even be subjected to getting dirty in the first place goth rolled her eyes but her shoulders shook slightly as she led the leewit off to that fate worse than death hot water and dont you forget to wash behind your ears either captain she called back sternly i wont good night girls three days later the lattice ship drifted her way downward to a landing on yin bauh they were making a nightside landing and it was plain to see that this world was heavily populated we going to get audiences wondered goth with all the scornful skepticism of a newconverted thespian this looks like the sort of planet full of holotheaters and threedee parlors with walltowall vidscreens in every house vezzarn snorted not likely missy those lights are either factories or dormitories mostly factories the dormitory towns are the bleakest places youll see this side of prison i was here to look over the potential for a smuggling route once since its an independent state and nice and free of official imperial customs the sultans customs are worse unfortunately and its a bad place for anything except murderthey dont worry about corpses much he seemed to shudder a little those dormitories are full of debtprisoners whose prison contracts are sold off by various imperial worlds the people dont get paid much at all other than production bonuses but food and your bunk are free and theres not much to spend money on the poor beggars are mostly desperate enough for any kind of entertainment any showboat thats down on her luck comes hereits not great money but its reliable it seems a bit like robbery taking it from them said hantis its one of the things we sprites find strange about you humans its in character for the petey b though said the captain its on our way and theres nothing suspicious about us setting down here lattice ships arent cheap to operate and most of the showboats get into financial trouble sooner or later he rubbed the back of his neck wincing still reliable as it might be yin bauh is a frightening place for a showmaster a threat of where he might end up with the petey b sold off and him still in debt the leewit was horrified ol himby belongs with the show and the petey b is going to go for ever and ever and ever you couldnt let that happen to him could you captain touched by her faithmost unusual that coming from the leewitthe captain smiled ill do my best privately he suspected the petey bs debts might easily be enough to give the sedmons pause and he didnt see them coming to the petey bs rescue anyway in the event the showboat fell on hard times over the centuries the daals of uldune had been famous for many thingsa very long list of things in fact including most capital crimes but neither altruism nor generosity had ever been on the list once the setup on an expensive piece of wasteland hired from the sultans factor didnt even draw the four reporters that altim four had where is everybody they work long shifts here and you have to get a pass to travel anywhere outside your official place of residence and work so how do they get to know were here mannicholo the chameleon man stopped hauling on the banner rope for a moment his colors rippled word gets through the dormitory towns like lightning the sultans rules be damned thats why the sultans satraps dont let ships set down too close to the last spot a showboat visited itll be a year or so since these people have had anything more than a game of cards to entertain them when the next shift ends well have em in droves we only sell cheap tickets when we come here himbo says its too close to the bone to exploit these poor devils at least itll be short shows said timblay grumpily all well get out of this place is refueling money you watch and see maybe so said the chameleon man tersely but at least well give them something to forget about this dump for a while dump was certainly the right word the place was an industrial garbage heap the air burned in the captains lungs the sky was a brown color and the rows of factory chimneys belched out more of it he was glad they wouldnt be staying sure enough that evening was a full house it was also one of the most depressing crowds that pausert had ever seen there was a beaten look about the people buying the oneprice specialoffer tickets it even infected the actors the first scene of a midsummer nights dream was pausert thought completely flat but the audience still drank it up as if it were the honeydew of paradise never had helenas how happy some oer other some can be seemed more appropriate cravan was backstage snapping like an irate turtle they paid to be lifted up from this miserynot have you join them now scene change is coming youhe pointedbottom snug flute quince snout and starveling you go out there and give the punters the show of their lives so pausert aka bottom the passionately pursued did so did his fellow actors the audience loved it well most of them loved it but there were some people sitting in the front row who didnt seem to be enjoying anything that worried pausert pausert the new thespian because members of an audience who dont enjoy the show are always worrisome pausert the captain entrusted with a vital mission was a lot more worried so as he changed costumes in the dressing room pausert wasnt surprised at all when silvereyes showed up and echoed his own anxieties i think theres more trouble big real thing squeaked the little vatch inside his head there are some strange dream things hereor maybe real things its hard to tell theyre like notthings like those tiny bits of klatha stuff you feed me except different that was confusing although now that he thought about it it struck pausert that not things was a fairly accurate description of the oddly impassive bunch of people sitting in the front of the house tonight they are waiting back at your ship too that was another unpleasant report like the ones in the front rows out there the vatch disappeared briefly before returning to the dressing rooms yes but there are more than that at the ship and some more still at the edge of the lattice digging digging what well whatever they were up to it would be no good he didnt need puls nanitesniffing nose to tell him the naniteinfected iss had almost certainly caught up with them thoughtfully pausert sucked his teeth you feel like some mischief silvereyes i always feel like mischief im like the littlest witch that was true enough the vatch had grown but it was still barely a handsized creature obviously the things mental age was still preteen even if it could think the leewit certainly could whenever she chose to and goths ability to think was sometimes downright scary mischiefs fun what do you want me to do to them im still little though i cant do big stuff yet pausert went over to the store cupboard in the props section he found some of the luminous virulent yellowgreen paint theyd used for the posters a few days earlier here he pointed can you put a big splash of this on all of the notthings maybe on the back of their heads or something sure big fun the little vatch vanished pausert went off in hasty search of the others he still had a few minutes before he was due onstage again and that would be the last show for the night the captain was willing to bet that whatever the nanites had planned was supposed to happen after the punters had gone one couldnt exactly say home but back to their miserable bunks both vezzarn and hulik had assured him that the sultan did not take kindly to the iss sticking its nose into his territory so pausert had thought them safe enough here but the naniteinfected agents apparently ignored the conventional bounds he found the leewit first or rather she found him shed just come backstage we got troubles captain she said quietly vezzarn sent me to tell you the petey bs engine room is in a shambles old vezzarn found one of the engineers unconscious the drive control boxes trashed and whole lot of other stuff busted someone intended to make sure the petey b didnt do a hasty retreat obviously pausert winced there are also a bunch of them waiting for us at the venture and some in the audience and theyre digging at the perimeter struts for some reason ive got the little vatch tagging them with some of that limegreen luminous paint the leewit grinned that was the kind of trick she adored see if you can get the others together here the captain said im due onstage in a minute wheres vezzarn reporting the incident to himbo hes coming down here next the littlest witch shivered the captain gave her brief squeeze the shows got to go on but stay here backstage the curtain call was enthusiastic but pausert noticed that the not things had already left a few minutes later as the factory workers streamed hastily into the night to get a few hours sleep before returning to work pausert came backstage and unobtrusively joined the rest of ventures crew and the sedmons i think we need to head for the thunderbird said one of the sedmons shes well enough armored and armed to hold off a fairly serious assault we could flee in her too if need be said the other sedmon itd be crowded but we could manage himbo petey arrived on the scene then looking grim i need to talk to you about something exploded the lattice pole the captain was leaning against shivered one of the main lattice legs caved in with the terrible sound of shredding synthasilk the stage canted sideways spilling screaming people and terrified animals in a flash pausert understood why the nanites had been digging the entire exercise was designed to cause maximum chaos and send the ventures crew scurrying for shelter in their ship the sedmons were right come on to the thunderbird he yelled he had to yell with the destruction of one of her main struts the old petey bs structure was under terrific stress things were breaking loose and falling everywhere some of the powercables snapped plunging the tented area into darkness except for showers of sparks and cascading and exploding lights and the din produced by the people and animals was even worse than that produced by the inanimate objects in a tightknit bunch they left the chaos of the dressing rooms and headed out the first thing that pausert saw was that the vatch had exceeded its mandate the bunch of people shooting at them should not have been able to fire anything at all since their heads had been doused in luminous limegreen paint the vatchlet must have raided the petey bs main store not just the little propsroom cupboard but the nanites it seemed didnt need human eyes to see well enough to shoot a blaster bolt seared above them hitting another strut bringing down a large banner theyre between us and the thunderbird said hulik drawing her own elegant little blaster from an outfit that pausert would have thought couldnt hide a toothpick she started returning the fire another painthead tried a flanking shot his paintsoaked blaster exploded just as the leewit gave a shattering whistle whether it was the paint or the whistle that caused that was a matter for later academic discussion goth narrowed her eyes and looked intently at a surviving speakerbank above another group of painted heads it began slowly to totter as an already offbalance pile will when an extra wedge is teleported under its base moments later tumbling tons of electronic speakers were hurtling down on the painted heads another group found theyd made a mistake with their target timblay folded neatly avoiding the blaster fire with a contortionists skill and started shooting back with a blythe rifle keep going towards the thunderbird said sedmon the other sedmons are controlling her computer system remotely they activated blaster tracking whatever you do hulik dont fire again blaster tracking meant that the thunderbirds weapons systems responded with automatic shipfire to any active weapon in the vicinity pausert could only hope that the petey bs own defenses didnt get manned he had a feeling there wouldnt be much left of the old showboat if the thunderbird really cut loose a trio of painted heads appeared from behind a tumble of flats pul bit one of them as the captain coldcocked another a flying paintpot materialized in the face of the third attacker and did for him in the background the thunderbirds guns vaporized steel and a nanitecarrier the nanites didnt seem to have realized yet that firing immediately made them a target it suddenly occurred to pausert that while the nanites were clearly able to think the diffuse form of their intelligence made them relatively slow witted they had no sense of macrocosmic scale clearly enough the nanites themselves were micrometers in size and didnt seem to be able to gauge proportions properly in their human hosts mannicholo and master himbo came charging through mounted on pair of fanderbagsand several of the nanitecarriers raced up to stop them with the pancakeflat results youd expect the tide had turned still the nanites kept shootingand being vaporized almost instantly by the thunderbirds deadly guns every time they did they seemed incapable of learning the lesson within minutes it was no longer a case of retreating to the thunderbird it was a case of mopping up but as the sun came up over yin bauh district one thing was plain when the next shift came offduty there would be no show chapter himbo petey looked at the chaos which had once bragged the name the greatest show in the galaxy he sighed reflexively twirled his mustachios and then uncharacteristically stopped and sat down his shoulders drooped he shook his head there was a small tear in the corner of his eye dame ethulassia came and sat next to him putting an arm around his shoulders well get it all back together again himbo she said in a quiet voice quite unlike her usual brassy contralto no not this time ethy he replied quietly sadly the old show is over what is left of the lattice ship will be broken up for scrap we could have afforded to get offworld since theres enough money for fuel but theres nothing extra for repairs not repairs on this scale anyway and with this wreckage we cant even put on a show to earn any more he sighed no well have to sell the old girl off for scrap and pay off the artistes as best we can this is the end of the petey byrum and keep mannicholos colors turned a melancholy blue the other showpeople looked silently at the walls and scuffed shoes ahem one of the two sedmons cleared his throat stepping forward from where the clones stood with the ventures crew perhaps we can be of assistance himbo looked at him and laughed bitterly i think youve assisted me to ruin well enough already thank you quite the sedmons nodded in unison looking just a trace embarrassed and thus it seems only fair that we should attempt to make amends i think we may safely assume that messrs byrum and keep are long dead himbo petey shrugged legend traces the show all the way back to old yarthe the lattice ship is at least fifteen centuries old shes held together with hullmetal welds on hullmetal welds i presume there must once have been a byrum and a keep like the name petey all gone now he picked up a handful of premier deluxebox tickets and flung them like confetti up into the air so you himbo petey are the sole owner continued the other sedmon ignoring the theatricals himbo looked at the still smoldering remains of the bright lattice awnings of this ruin yes it would be a waste of effort suing me though by the time my creditors are finished there wont even be a square inch of skin for you to auction off at the slave market the sedmons frowned again in that uncanny unison we have no intention of suing you how would you feel about another partner his clone cleared his throat one with ah capital to invest the showmaster blinked at them invest in what this wreckage where would i find such a fool the sedmons smiled sardonically it seems likely to me showmaster that you might find at least two right here said the one has it not occurred to you that such destruction and such expense would only be incurred for very high stakes continued the other himbo shook his head refusing to allow any trace of hope to trickle into his mind your high stakes mister twinsorclones are very small compared to the debts weve racked up i leave aside the cost of getting the lattice ship into space again im sorry but you just dont have any idea what repairing the petey byrum and keep would cost on the contrary said one sedmon this estimate is childs play his eyes and those of his clone flicked here and there assessing the damage very expert eyes they seemed not surprising thought pausert the daals of uldune would be experts at assessing havoc and ruin repairs would cost approximately seven million three hundred thousand maels not more than eight million for a certainty the other sedmon chimed in simply say the word and you will find that the petey byrum and keep account has been credited with ten million maels which will mean your account would be in the black for a change they each raised one eyebrow for the first time in generations actually pauserts conscience started tugging at his sleeve while it went against the captains grain to disrupt the dawning look of amazed hope on himbo peteys face he also felt that it was only fair to explain to the showmaster exactly who he was dealing with pausert had seen enough of sedmons operations to be very sure that uldune had not moved that far from its piratical past the daal waswere dealing with a sixway person was confusingstill neckdeep in smuggling and had certainly taken the lead over the empire in some fields of weaponry to judge by the latest display of firepower the showmaster might just prefer bankruptcy to being indebted to uldune the captain cleared his throat the sedmons continued without a pause for breatheasy for them of course since they could speak in turns i suspect although i would have preferred them not to be involved that their wisdoms of karres will match that in the near future that threw pausert right off his moral stride match ten million maels ive lately gotten the feeling said the second sedmon looking pointedly at captain pausert that they dont entirely trust the daal of uldune though i cant imagine why thats me by the way so we propose onethird ownership of course you will retain daytoday control said sedmon smoothly pausert was still mentally stumbling even cut in half match five million maels how himbo petey stared at the sedmons his eyes resembling the proverbial saucers then turned his very wide blueeyed gaze on the others uldune and karres i should have guessed it wasnt stage magic at all was it goth was stillfaced the leewit fidgeted then the little blond witch halfwailed its not cheating to use the real thing she glared about the surface belligerence in her eyes covering notsoveiled anxiety well its not i dont think ethulassia barked a laugh ha an interesting question that our magicians will probably spend a year wrangling over the professional ethics involved the dame bestowed a fond and approving look upon the leewit never you mind dearie even if those cranky magicians crab and complain youll always have a place in the thespians company the leewit beamed goths face still held no expression but her brown eyes seemed to lighten a bit pausert kept his mouth shut five millions maels how if didnt occur to him until some time later that in addition to histheirother talents the daal of uldune would be a superb card player and he had just bluffed the captain right out of the hand by simply cranking up the stakes for the first time since the disastrous fight himbo petey let his round face slip into the creases of his familiar smile it is against magicians union rules as a matter of fact says so right there in section iii article clause f no use of exotic mental powers to imitate stage magic and fakery he glanced about the area but since there are no members of the magicians union here well if you dont tell them i wont he did something totally unlike himself then he took the waxed end of one of his proud mustachios and chewed it everyone was silent waiting then he pulled it out and twirled it in a familiar manner nodded abruptly took a deep breath knelt on the floor and began picking up the premier deluxebox tickets hed scattered about well come on all of you well be needing these collect them up before someone stands on them we cant waste funds by throwing tickets on the floor he turned to pausert and waved a handful of tickets at him ill be looking to karres to provide us with a counterweight to uldune theyre notorious criminals you know the lot of them then he waved the tickets at the two daals and you will have to keep an eye on the witches their reputation is no more savory than yours we have been trying to do that its less easy than we would like said the other do we have a deal then pausert was uncomfortably aware that the ventures account stood at four hundred thousand maels in credit that oncemagnificent amount seemed measly now when compared to the resources the daal of uldune had on call well goth interrupted him smoothly i reckon karres will buy in sedmonif we can get through to the imperial capital in time for the winter carnival but youll just have to wait for our share of the money until then and help us get there pausert knew that if they didnt get there it wouldnt matter if karres agreed or not himbo petey nodded i think we have a deal youre undervaluing the petey byrum and keep said dame ethulassia her brassy voice miraculously returning shes more than just a lattice ship more than a mere showboat shes a body of artistes the incredible bosom made a grand entrance ethulassia put a hand on himbos shoulder as he knelt and gathered tickets the greatest show in the galaxy with real dramatic and artistic merit shes worth at least twice that the two sedmons looked at hulik do eldel looked at the hand on himbo peteys shoulder the nails were red and there were a number of rings studded with improbable diamonds on the fingers and a vast clatter of goldinappearance bracelets on the plump wrist but the grip was a firm one a point one of them acknowledged but only valid so long as the component parts of the show are kept solidly together he cocked an eye at his clone who picked up the train of thought flawlessly precisely so i thinka matter of simple fiscal prudencethat our offer should be contingent on petey byrum and keep being maintained as a family enterprise the eyes of the two sedmons like gun barrels on a single turret swiveled back and forth from himbo to ethulassia the deal hinges on an imminent marriage a young petey to take over the reins one day otherwise who knows what we might get the sooner the better agreed hulik doing her bestnot entirely successfullyto disguise her glee starship captains are empowered to perform marriages arent they captain pausert pausert nodded indeed he said sententiously were often called on to perform the rite it is legally binding it was a pleasure to see dame ethulassia doing a very good imitation of a fish suddenly pulled from the water for once in her life she wasnt acting himbo petey got up from his ticket collecting he was quite a lot shorter than the leading lady ethy is married to her art he said in a tone which was an odd combination of humility and sarcasm i dont even understand it half the time ethulassias gaping mouth snapped shut she bestowed upon himbo a look that was its own peculiar combination indignation calculation amusement and something else something quite warm in fact if pausert didnt miss his guess just as i dont understand the mystical significance of that mustache of yours she said a bit acidly however she struck a truly dramatic pose the incredible bosom soared to impossible heights we must all make sacrifices for the common good the tone was tragicbut pausert noticed that the bejeweled hand never left himbos shoulder never even twitched hes not such a bad old dope the leewit said gruffly you could do worse for a moment there was an awkward pause everyone did their best to look somewhere else sure and certain that the brash little witch would continue the thought you did do worserecently whether she would have said it or not would never be known the dame after all was a lady of many parts ethulassia laughed easily and throatily oh sweetie you can say that again i hate to say it but that bum vonard probably wasnt even the worst the incredible bosom vanished magically there stood before them now just a quite attractive woman of middle yearsstill with a most impressive busther pleasant face lined with much experience the look she gave himbo was a fond one and her hand squeezed his shoulder well consider it a marriage of convenience himbo hows that he nodded solemnly though his eyes seemed to twinkle a bit the same twinkle that was in the dames eye in fact of course she mused well have to figure out how a marriage of convenience manages to produce the heir our ruthless financial backers demand a desperate situation but i dare say two experienced and stalwart troupers like you and me can manage to pull it off imagine so huffed himbo rising to his feet in fact a notion has already come to me he glanced towards that section of the wreckage which had onceand might stillcontained his stateroom this clever witchly trick of faking fakery it has possibilities applied elsewhere you know hulik do eldel was the maid of honor mannicholo the best man in a face of startling pinkness and the leewit would have been a flower girl except that she had a newly broken collarbone from trying to ride mannicholos unicycle for the occasion she was going to have to endure strapping and an hour a day in the bonegrowthpromoter for the next two weeks she was very grumpy about it back on karres someone coulda done a bonemeld goth spoke the usual serene philosophical phrases spoken in the presence of those recuperating from injury and illness the leewit glared at her you she slapped her hands on the rim of the growthpromoter just happy that she wont be sniffing around the captain any more cant fool me goths serenity seemed untouched dont be silly though now that you bring it up i notice that himbo and ethulassia disappeared right after the wedding course sniffed the leewit theyre sweet on each other i always knew probably been for years people are stupid chapter this is all very well captain said hantis worriedly but the lattice ship will take weeks to repair at best we need to move on if were to get to the empress in time the captain tried to focus his thoughts on the business at hand hed been completely preoccupied making sure his part of the wedding went off satisfactorily despite his public boast pausert had never had any occasion to perform a captains marriage before he was just grateful that the little vatch hadnt showed up to amuse itself at his expense it been active enough in the last fight but it had disappeared since well what i had in mind said pausert slowly was getting the venture free from the lattice and heading onward on our own all the old ship needs now is some fuel and it looks like we have the credit to fuel her up and to replace her with a hulk maybe we can talk himbo into faking our presence here for a while the iss will come looking again even if i think weve dealt with the agandars pirates once and for all goth nodded be good to have our own ship again captain the leewit looked across at the hive of activity that was the repair program on the lattices of the pbk i guess she said at least halfregretfully nice to be in the circus for a while but home is best i guess it was curious thought pausert as they walked over to talk to himbo petey that the little fairhaired scrap of a grayeyed witch should regard the old venture as home her real home was karres after all along with toll and pauserts great uncle threbus the captain had stayed at her parents house when hed made his one and only visit to the world of karres true goth and the leewits world wasnt the easiest place to find let alone visit the way it hopped around the galaxy a bit like the venture in that way and it was a very witchy place very like the venture in that way these days now that he thought about it himbo petey was visibly shocked at the news he glanced at ethulassia lounging nearby on a divan and tugged at his mustachios you cant leave we agreed to take you all the way to the imperial capital and im a man of my word captain pausert besides the act of the great escapologist aron is famous youre one of our most popular shows people expect to see you youre a star i could stretch to a bigger contract pausert got the distinct feeling that most of that little speech was spoken by rote while himbo gathered his thoughts just for starters while the captains escapologist act was certainly no financial drain on petey byrum and keep it was hardly one of our most popular shows himbo paused looking at them with a considering eye but theres more to this than just money isnt there he said abruptly i suppose money doesnt matter that much to people who can buy into the pb and k to the tune of ten million maels theres something big going on that im not part of and not supposed to know about he looked at them like an expectant bird no one said anything so he went on you know all the kids in the galaxy dream of running away to vaudevillia i was born on vaudevillia and i couldnt wait for the petey byrum and keep to take off for anywhere else i dreamed of going to karres because there is supposed to be real magic there he sighed well i cant stop you i wish i could to be honest youve paid off your debts actually i think i owe you a little ethyll have to check the books were going on to the capital anyway he stood up from his cluttered desk and patted the two girls awkwardly on the shoulder remember if your uncle the captain is nasty to you two there is always a place for you on the old petey b he looked sternly at the leewit but no more riding unicycles she stuck her tongue out at him but there was a quiver in her chin the leewit loved the greatest show in the galaxy make you a deal showmaster said goth looking at the leewit if everything works out well arrange for the petey b to do a show on karres youd be the first ever himbo smiled from ear to ear and put out a plump hand its a deal lady huh lady muttered the leewit but she also stuck out a hand and shook the showmasters hand she didnt even squirm too much when ethulassia hugged and kissed her im sure karres cant wait for a dose of culture said the dame it will be a great day for them privately captain pausert thought that the people of karres living in their tranquil houses in the forest with their wonderful music might just show the statuesque leading lady another side of culture but he thought that the witches would probably like the circus side a lot of the witchchildren might like it too much in fact he could foresee a lot of runaways he said as much to goth and the leewit on the way back to the venture the leewit glanced at him as if he were an imbecile whod just issued an especially mindless statement well sure what you expect goth shrugged its really a lot safer than most adventures young witches get into remember where you found us pausert grunted um point the leewit giggled half of the younger ones will want to go on a trip with the petey b old ethy will be pulling her hair out never mind her wig off after a week or two i wouldnt worry captain said goth witches can look after themselves besides himbo is good people sos the dame and richard cravan and it is good cover witchy stuff on a showboat doesnt stand out thats why i reckon karres will be happy to buy into the lattice ship you dont look for the real thing in a shipload of fake magicians and trickery merchants she rubbed the tip of her nose have to reach a private understanding with the magicians union of course we dont want them mad at us some of their skills arent all that fake pausert thought about it then nodded i guess youre right it would be a good way to do a lot of karres work in future what i thought said goth looking up at him with those big brown eyes goth is sweet on the captain jibed the leewit then the little witch scampered off you just wait said goth but pausert noticed that she didnt bother to run after the leewit to chastise her and it occurred to him that you just wait wasnt necessarily a threat aimed at the younger sister it hadnt been spoken like a threat certainly just stated in that serene tone of voice that came so naturally to goth when she contemplated the workings of fate the captains estimate of just how seriously he ought to take goths assumption theyd eventually get married cranked up another notch he was beginning to understand how his great uncle threbus must have felt many years before when toll made the same confident prediction pausert chewed on the matter for a time as they walked together in silence for the first time giving it some serious thought it wasnt as if the prospect botheredhim after all in fact he was beginning to find himself sharing goths opinion that there ought to be some way klatha could affect the aging process but if there was hed never heard of any so since they were nearing the ship he just dismissed the whole matter from his mind whatever happened it was a matter for the future at the ship they met up with the sedmons well said one of the two they both had their arms around hulik do eldel that was something captain pausert was still getting used to he always felt as if he were seeing double around the cloned sedmons hulik seemed to accept it though shed once told the captain that she didnt think shed ever meet a man she would love enough to marry apparently in her own inimitable style the do eldel had found a solution to the problem were going to have to split up and each try to reach the empress hailie he announced since were running out of time i think hulik youd better travel with the daal if you get through at least you can get the imperial navy pulled off our back the sedmons nodded clearly not inclined to argue the point hulik nodded also i dont want to desert you captain but i was going to ask if youd mind if we did that i think i should keep an eye on him both of him she added impishly the venture and the daals thunderbird made quiet lowfuss departures that night darkness would not shield them from watching instrumentation but it might hide their departure from human spies even instruments might not spot the thunderbird actually the daals ship was equipped with the very best antidetection gear available the best that theyd been able to do for the ventureon the other hand was adding a few mockups from the dames props which slightly changed the outline of the ship if whatever watchers there wereand by now the captain was sure that there must be somedidnt see pauserts trademark wobbly take off and didnt have instruments tracking then they were away at least until daybreak no atmospheric revoltships rose after them at least the leewit left off manning the rear turret of the nova guns and came back to the ventures control room she was rubbing her shoulder youll kill us all yet with these take offs captain she complained my shoulder hurts and im bored already and weve only just left the circus tell you what said goth you fish out those cards you found in the agandars kit and ill play you snap dont feel like snap snapped the leewit but she pulled the pack from an inner pocket anyway she always seemed to have them with her pausert noticed the handpainted cards had been found in the agandars personal kit after the pirates death and the leewit had expropriated them the cards were probably valuable antiques given that the pirate lord had been fabulously wealthy and successful pausert had occasionally wondered if he should try to keep them safe from the leewit but it hadnt seemed worth the fight it would entail money was only worth its face value but a contented leewit was a jewel past price and she was mostly pretty happy playing endless games of snap or patience but it appeared shed been broadening her horizons lets play poker she piped pausert raised an eyebrow where did you learn that game vezzarn taught me i should have guessed well said the captain setting the course for gentians star and clicking on the longrange detectors well play for spillikins every ten you win ill buy you a packet of candy at the next spaceport every ten i win you bathe without a fight and wash behind your ears she looked darkly at him twenty fifteen sa deal but im not too sure how you play poker really the captain had been around the witches too long to fall for that one he was a lucky gambler because of klatha and as soon as he heard that statement he knew hed need to be deal me in said goth sliding bonelessly into the chair next to the chart table they used for cards im not too old for candy but you wash behind your ears anyway protested the leewit im not planning to lose so what does it matter huh said the leewit scornfully youre getting to be just like maleen deal said the captain before this wellused argument could get any more exercise a few minutes later vezzarn came up from the engine room and joined the game and the captain soon realized that he had fallen among thieves or at least cardsharps if the witches or vezzarn ever needed money they had a profession lined up already pausert was quite relieved when the shipdetector alarm went off chapter here near the empires center ship traffic was much heavier there was virtually no way to keep out of detection range of all of them and it very soon became evident that the iss was searching hard and that the imperial space navy now had orders destroy the venture on sight twice now their ship had come within detector range of isn vessels and had not even been given the chance to try deception shed been pursued and fired ondespite being within hailing distance communicator chatter indicates weve been fingered as a plague carrier captain said vezzarn indignantly aft of the venture space was lit up again by the blue lightnings of imperial guns its more like the other way around grunted pausert were the antibiotic and this is the disease trying to keep us away goth stared at the ship detectors guess well have to use the sheewash drive captain those space navy jobs are gaining on us pausert nodded id rather not have to because it gives them a definite fix on where we are again but i dont think we have a choice were certainly not going to win a battle with that many imperial cruisers seeing the littlest witch glaring he added diplomatically not even with the leewit at the nova guns that seemed to satisfy the leewits touchy sense of honor so once again she and goth made orange fire dance over the twisted pattern of black wires pausert found himself staring so hard at the pattern that his eyes felt as if theyd crossed it was almost making sense the venture leapt away from the imperial space navy ships the acceleration was fantasticexcept looking at his instruments pausert knew that it wasnt what the ship could do or used to do when the witches of karres pushed her along with sheewash drive they used to move faster than his instruments could cope with measuring now the venture merely ambled along at about double her normal top speed enough to shake pursuit certainly but not enough to break through the cordon that the imperial space navy was putting around the heart of the empire im sorry captain said goth tiredly that pushing through jelly feeling is back i wish i could help said pausert apologetically ive almost got that klatha pattern goth shook her head you cant force klatha captain itll come when youre ready ive got an idea that may work they obviously know what the venture looks like but i could do a lightshift on her external appearance make her look like say a sirian passenger liner could work said the leewit they wouldnt fire on a passenger liner not a sirian one anyway and we could get you to talk to them in sirian missy said vezzarn before you switch to universum lets try it said pausert decisively hantis looked a little uncertain its going to put a lot of strain on you goth she pointed out the slim brownhaired witch shrugged i think i can do it and youre supposed to be there before another fifteen shipsdays pass hantis weve got to do something so they moved slowly forward towards the globe of ships that the isn seemed to have clustered around the spaceways to the inner worlds of the empire i dont see that the nanites have very much left to take over grumbled pausert as they came within detector range of yet another flotilla of imperial space navy ships youre quite wrong said hantis coolly all theyve done is to infiltrate the iss and probably taken over one or two admirals that gives them leverage but not controland certainly not ownership if they had full control over the empire they wouldnt bother to try to stop us at all in a queer backhanded sort of way captain this is hugely encouraging pausert decided she was probably right however if so it also means he said that we have to fight shy of actual shooting combat even if we might win hantis looked thoughtfully at captain pausert as if looking right into him the nartheby sprite was supposed to be a truthhearer at length she said yes captain i know you dont want to kill innocents but the stakes here are very high well try to avoid it said pausert tersely that issue had been worrying him for a while now a few minutes later he had other things to worry about the leewit was giving the commodore of the imperial space ships some lip in sirian fortunately which they recognized but didnt understand then she switched to universum syrian registered passenger liner pride of vorvian what ship ah pride of vorvian this is the isn huntinglea slow your acceleration please give us more details on your registry and port of origin there are two ships peeling off into flanking position hissed goth were out of shebreiths world of course registered on lepper said the leewit imitating perfectly the typical arrogance of sirians thats in the regency of sirius if your knowledge of astrography is up to the usual imperial standards why do you wish to know the isn commodore ignored the implied insult wisely pausert thought the regency of sirius was powerful enoughand certainly belligerent enoughto give pause even to the empire ah administrative details he said his voice smooth as swanhawk grease im afraid we still need some more information pride of vorvian this will only take a few minutes please continue to slow your thrust hes lying said hantis abruptly looking at the officer on the screen captain pausert grit his teeth were going to need the sheewash drive then well have to turn and run again we cant possibly break through he took the microphone from the leewit who hurried to join goth at the tangle of wires weve just discovered we have an outbreak of severe gaspartis on board we are going to have to return to our last port wait pride of vorvian we have medics on board the imperial smoothness disappeared halt or be fired on pirate vessel venture halt or be fired on but the venture was already heading away back where shed come from before the two flanking cruisers could come within range they must have our engines signature keyed into their detectors captain said vezzarn i dont know how they managed that though these engines were installed on uldune and the daal certainly didnt pass along the information to them but i cant see any other explanation pausert sighed if thats the case short of hauling the ventures engines out and putting new engines inwhich we just dont have the time forthe imperial navy will spot us no matter what we do with the lightshift i guess itll have to be the egger route then said goth her face even more expressionless than usual the leewit scowled bit her thumb guess so but she jerked a nod at the captain the grikdog and the nartheby sprite can they do it old vezzarn cant thats for sure hantis shook her head alas no it is not a klatha power that sprites can harness well i suppose it doesnt matter then that i cant do it either said pausert as the point is to get hantis and pul through to the empress before the winter carnival well have to try some other form of disguise maybe we can sneak past on the sheewash drive no good said the old spacer who was still very uncomfortable about the sheewash drive hed tried so hard to stealuntil he found out what it actually was at the speed the little wisdoms can manage now captain theyre still going to detect us true agreed the captain glumly and now that weve tried the lightshift i dont think thats going to fool them anywhere this is not as much fun as the circus big real thing tinkled a vatchy voice get that stinkin little thing out of here said the leewit wrinkling her nose you could hear the girls tiredness and hunger in her peevish tones doing the sheewash drive had taken it out of the littlest witch besides pausert didnt doubt she was missing the circus and the people there badly shed been rather spoiled by them the little vatch simply danced around the room levitating things captain pausert raised his eyes to heaven he could chase it with hooks of klatha force and tickle it lately hed found that the best answer was to humor it much the same way as he did with the leewit actually where have you been for so long littlebit got sick the dreamcandy from the one the dogthing bit was sour got to go now ill find you again gbye it disappeared as quickly as it had come dreamcandy from the naniteinfected pirate the universe as the vatches saw it was rather different from the universe as perceived by humans distance and time were fairly meaningless concepts to them so what did they find in here that was candy to them pausert was sure that many of the words that the vatch put into his mind were not strict translations but merely the nearest human equivalent well thered be time enough to puzzle over what was candy to a vatch once theyd solved their present problems the captain turned his mind back to that so just what is the egger route the way i came here stupid said the leewit crossly do you forget everything of course pausert remembered the droning soundin space where there was nothing to transmit soundand the abrupt and inexplicable arrival of the leewit and the way theyd had to wrap her in blankets because of the shaking he also remembered that shed been well not breathing kind of hard to explain said goth i asked threbus that question once and he said that id have to get to understand ndimensional math first its well there is a place outside this place and times and distances arent the same there theres billions of eggerspaces and they relate to the person going into them even if the leewit and i went home to karres by the egger route we wouldnt be in the same egger space you can take someone else through your egger space or even send them through it but that takes big power scowled the leewit toll and maleen could do it maleen could make us swim her egger space was wet dont know about goth uhhuh said goth i do it pretty good maleen says i can push quite a lot with me too or i could last time i tried its not something you try too often although all karres witches have to learn how inwardly pausert sighed the trouble with the karres witches was that just as soon as you thought you had a handle on it all they introduced new things if ive got this straight the egger route goes through egger space and egger space is different depending on who goes on the egger route so what exactly is in this egger space is it totally nonphysical what is there the leewit shrugged everything anything said goth all the things you never want to meet the details kind of blur up captain its like a defense that your mind has got against it its safe enough said the leewit just horrid so long as you dont meet any stinkin vatches involuntarily pausert looked around the room no vatch in sight why we seem to have one we cant shake off by the way goth looked around she was also trying to rell if there were any vatches in the area because vatches make what you find there real here when you come back threbus says they think thats where the megair cannibals originally came from from beyond the divide from some karres witchs trip through egger space thats why unless there is a real emergency we dont send any witches into egger space except in a trance that way theyre protected you still see stuff but its more like a nightmare than reality if you send yourself through well its just impossible to tell that it isnt real so its a sort of extradimensional dreamworld persisted the captain he felt that if he could understand this then he could do it he just knew he could i suppose so its a place a little bit of everything in our universe is there too and youve just got to sort of push and twist and align everything thats what the vibration is about you kind of bounce around until your body is back in the same dimensions as the rest of our universe and then you come back its pretty bruising but thats not the worst part of the egger route yeah said the leewit shuddering a little its bad enough when you go through someone elses egger space mostly thats just hard to remember weve got another problem captain interrupted vezzarn who had been gazing at the detector screens while all this had been going on i reckon those imperials have done some calculations on our possible course and got on the subradio there are seven ships incoming looks like theyre spreading out for an englobement they all rushed to the screens looking at them pausert thought there could be little doubt that vezzarn was correct going to have to try and run again then captain pausert dropped himself into the control chair goth the leewityou two go and eat and get some rest we may need to use the sheewash drive again soon pausert started worrying that even the sheewash drive wouldnt get them out of the fix they were in the fancy ship detectors theyd had fitted on uldune were registering a second layer of shipsan outer englobement pattern the captain handed control over to vezzarn while he wrestled with the computations after a few minutes he clicked the trajectory calculation screen off and bit his knuckle what is wrong captain asked hantis coming in with a tray of food captain pausert looked at the elfin alien woman that the nanites were so desperate to kill theyve deployed a lot of ships theyve obviously been tracking us and coordinating their efforts by subradio the formation out there is big and elaborate at the best speed we can manage with the sheewash drive at the moment were going to have to come under fire from at least one imperial space navy ship and im not at all sure were heavily enough armored to survive that i see said hantis how much time have we got the longest i can gain for us is half an hour well have to try the egger route after all ill get goth and the leewit the nartheby sprite hesitated a moment then said softly im afraid it may mean abandoning the venture captain pausert patted the console awkwardly the venture was old but she was his ship he hated the idea of losing her its the ship or our lives hantis but when she came into the control room goth had other ideas me and the leewit can work together well just have to take a chance on not being in a trance the two of us we should be able to bring the venture into egger space with us the only trouble is that well have to go somewhere weve been or to someone we know otherwisewell you can come out anywhere vezzarn looked nervously at the screens i reckon your little wisdom anywhere would be better than right here pausert still had a mission to complete can you take us anywhere closer to the imperial capital or at least on the other side of this cordon the two little witches looked at each other well theres always porlumma you know the world where we met you pausert nodded that would probably be close enough but its on the opposite side of the capital goth shrugged distance doesnt really matter much in egger space captain pausert looked at the screens the imperial warships were closing steadily okay porlumma it is anything i can do well need a clear piece of floor space and some chalk if youve got it it helps to draw the klatha pattern for this one and then i guess wed better all strap in and pad ourselves therell be no one to wrap us up on the far side is the ship going to shake the way you did the leewit nodded threbus and toll did it with a house once you can move pretty well anything over the egger route but when they got there the house was a real shambles didnt have a roof left at all she seemed to find this very funny pausert didnt wed better secure everything we can then vezzarn set that course and come and join me it doesnt matter exactly where the venture goes for now were going elsewhere soon i hope muttered the old spacer twenty minutes later with the first imperial cruisers sending probing fire towards the venture they were all strapped in and then the shaking began at first it felt as if a herd of fanderbags was thundering past in the distance but the intensity began to build pausert tried to move but could not he felt as if his body was strapped to a gigantic drumhead and the drummer was picking up both the volume and the tempo the droning noise was like thunder then it began to die away its no use said goth that swimming through jelly feeling is back we need more power the hull vibrated for an entirely different reason near miss captain said vezzarn cant you help the little wisdoms the leewit looked at goth goth stared back at the leewit going to have to try it i guess said goth captain follow the pattern with us captain pausert realized that he had been staring at it while theyd tried now he did his best to mesh in with goth and leewit suddenly the mesh came into being it was like being plugged into an electrical outlet the egger route was grinding away at him and shaking everything he found himself twisting parts of the pattern that now burned as if outlined in fire tweaking this flicking that over gradually the shaking lessened and died away but the darkness that enveloped them was complete are we dead asked vezzarn nervously chapter no i dont think so said goths voice out of the darkness but dont ask us where we are because we dont know said the leewit the leewit didnt sound grumpy as she usually did when things went wrong just a little scared what i do finally know said goth is what caused that swimmingthoughjelly feeling captain it went away just as soon as you joined us but the power you poured into that pattern and the changesit was like riding a runaway bollem i got no idea what happened or even where we are embarrassment flooded the captain the other karres witches had grown up with witch magic they had instructor patterns in their minds to guide their development pausert a one time citizen of the stuffy and conservative little republic of nikkeldepain had no such special advantages he just had to muddle along with klatha he did achieve some spectacular results some time to time though they were rarely the results trained operatives would achieve but his uncontrolled klatha pooling had disturbed all the adult witches when hed been on karres and even the adolescents you mean i might have been causing the problems with the sheewash drive pretty sure captain the feeling was the same hantis spoke from the darkness have you been concentrating on the patterns for the drive all this time she asked er yes i felt i nearly had them pausert heard his own voice trail off foolish churl growled pul havent you been told that klatha powers come in their own time if the darkness had been mere absence of light then pausert was sure the others could have seen the dull red glow he was sure that his face was putting out yes but well i thought i could help and i felt i nearly had it instead you were dragging like a dead weight at those who did have it said hantis at least we understand what was wrong then yeah said the leewit now all we need to know is what went wrong with the egger route and where we are this isnt the egger route then asked pausert nope said the leewit not like it at all in a small voice can you get us out of here captain well said the captain id like to but how like i did with those shields tracing it backwards if that worked at all wed be right back under fire from imperial cruisers pointed out goth anyway i dont know if i can admitted pausert the pattern well i sort of changed things as i went along because it was hurting and im not sure i can visualize it then suddenly he relled vatch so there you went said a cross little voice how did you get here big real thing and why did you run away from me did you think i wouldnt find you there was a trace of plaintiveness in the voice for the first time ever captain pausert was truly glad to see those tiny slitty silver eyes peering at him one of the reasons he was so glad about it was that they could be seen at all there appeared to be no other form of light and his attempts at moving hadnt succeeded he wasnt really sure if they were actually talking with sound and words it didnt feel as if his lips were moving actually it didnt feel at all i never thought id be glad to see a vatch said the leewit hey leggo you little beast where are we little vatch asked pausert you mean you dont know tell us please might if i feel like it what are you going to do now big real thing pausert didnt tell it that what he really wanted to do right now was wring the little silveryeyed vatchs neck if it had a neck and if he could have come to grips with it nothing interesting he said sit here and be boring the vatch made a rude noise cant do that the wave of everything is coming wave of everything pausert wondered if it was worth fashioning klatha hooks of course he could only tickle this one but maybe he could tickle it into telling them tickling was not that far removed from torture after all yes youre outside of everything the only thing thats here is your ship even time hasnt got here yet its a strange place to come well can you get us out of here or tell us how to get out of here i dont think i will said the vatchlet petulantly last time i did something for you i got sick and then when i went to play in all the other ships so theyd leave you alone you ran away inwardly pausert groaned if there had been any doubts in the minds of the captains of imperial space navy ships that the venture was indeed chock full of the notorious witches of karres and should definitely be destroyed on sight he was sure it wasnt there anymore but here outside of everything that seemed a minor problem oh well i suppose you cant do anything anyway can too snapped the little vatch and vanished sitting in the darkness captain pausert had time to wonder if hed handled it right and time to try to reconstruct the pattern he had used inside his head he was sure if he could just get up and redraw it hed have it ive been thinking captain said goth careful you know what happened last time you did that said the leewit snippily youre lucky i cant move grumbled goth in the interests of peace pausert intervened what goth have you some idea of how we can get out of here well no but i think i have some idea of how we got in here you remember you said you had changed some things in the pattern yes admitted the captain they well they just didnt seem right it felt as if my changes would stop all the vibrations and it did said goth thoughtfully never heard of that with the egger route before but wethe leewit and mewere also using that same klatha pattern and so i think we didnt end up where any of us were heading so you mean we could just do it again asked the leewit doubt it answered goth it might do something else entirely anyway ive tried all sorts of klatha stuff it doesnt work there is just nothing here except us or nothing here yet looks like only vatches can handle this place though i dont know why that should be true goth was sounding very like her mother toll now the captain wondered whether it was her tollpattern speaking and wished yet again that he could have such an instructor it also means she continued that to reverse it wed probably have to work together uhoh interjected the leewit im relling vatch again big vatch it was a big vatch a huge oneand it was in hot pursuit of little silvereyes who didnt seem in the least bit amused about anything downright scared in fact the huge eyes were green at the top of a mountain of tumbling black energy roiling and twisting klatha force the vatch paused abruptly in its chase its eyes fixed on pausert and his crew how did they get here how odd the big vatch laughed thunderously nohow delightful well im glad i followed you after all you little nuisance pausert hastily began fashioning klatha hooks in his mind theyre mine all mine hissed the little one buzzing around the big vatch and then hastily retreating before captain pausert could react he was plucked no hurtled out of the venture he was dimly aware of the passage of enormities of time and space and then of sitting down hard onto bluegreen spongy stuff his first realization was that hed actually felt that landing the next was that far from the darkness of a few moments before his senses were almost drowning in colors the horizon was pricked by towers improbably slim towers elfin and beautiful and very white against a sky that was definitely a shade of primrose somewhere in the middle distance a waterfall splashed he glanced around hastily to his immense relief he saw that the whole crew of the venture had come with him and were sitting on the same spongy material above them parasollike trees stretched feathery red leaves towards an alien sun the air was full of strange but almost intoxicating scents where are we asked vezzarn warily boy i really hate this witchy stuff hantis answered in an almost dreamy voice were on nartheby nartheby in her golden age she pointed to the towers on the horizon the towers of fabled delaron were destroyed during the final phase of the quarantine wars we lacked the skills needed to rebuild them they are partly creations of klatha force pausert knew that time and space were not limiting to vatches particularly large ones he was also grimly aware that this was a game to them an entertainment played with what they considered to be phantasms of their minds and that a vatch loved to test its phantasms to see if the pieces in its mindgames had a role in the dreamdrama true there was usually a way out for pieces of quality although not alwaysthe vatch who had placed them on the worm world had fully expected them to be destroyed the immensely powerful and capricious living klatha creatures were quite capable of maneuvering players into hopeless situations just to watch the drama of their doomed efforts to escape and even if there was a way out there was usually only one not for the first time the captain wished that vatches would just leave him alone of course that wasnt likely klatha use attracted the creatures the venture must have stood out like a lighthouse what do we do now captain asked vezzarn looking nervously around pausert did rather wish that people wouldnt keep asking him that he really had no idea this vatch was undoubtedly watching but from beyond the range at which the karres witches could rell it and there seemed to be a more immediate problem anyway by the deepthroated rumble issuing from pul there was something else watching them too pausert felt the hairs on his neck rising the way they had when the sheem war robot had been stalking up behind them he stood up turning as he did so of course the vatch would not have chosen a safe comfortable place to deposit its play pieces no they just had to be in trouble hantis had turned from her rapt contemplation of the towers and was now looking in horror at what pul was growling at gnyarl the creatures that were staring at them from the fernlike undergrowth were sinuous reptilian and gray their eyes however flamed a particularly disquieting shade of orange hantis said the captain quietly warily watching the statuestill creatures what are they what do we do about them we are on some high sprites lands these beasts are his guard we can do nothing so far as i know they have been extinct on nartheby for many centuries but i have been told gnyarl were nearly impossible to kill and equally difficult to shake off we can split up maybe they wont get all of us how do they do on direct blaster fire asked pausert grimly of course it would help if he had a blaster snugged to his hip hulik always carried her slimline mark model but the captains weapons were safely locked up in the venture and the venture was somewhere beyond the edge of nowhere vezzarn proved that once a rogue always a weaponcarrier the little thief had a military rv special out and at the ready i dont know captain but i can try them on this one of the gray reptilian forms darted forward snaking its long neck towards them vezzarn fired the gnyarls head was engulfed in flame the creature blinked shook its long beaknose and spat a gout of fire back at vezzarn only being nimble on his pins saved the old spacer the other three gnyarl had taken advantage of the distraction to split up and begin flanking them the leewit looked hard at the advancing creaturesand whistled the sound was like a wet finger being skimmed around the edge of a delicate wine glass but many times as loud everybody from pausert to the grikdog cringed the gnyarl backed off a bit rubbing their ears with blacktaloned paws blinking those flameorange eyes they looked puzzled obviously nothing much had ever given them pause before right lets head out said pausert keep together and the leewit had better be ready to whistle again watching the gnyarl they began moving away up the hill silently keeping to the cover the creatures followed sometimes all they saw was a sinuous streak of gray through a gap in the undergrowth the clearing theyd landed in with its distant prospects had narrowed into a path that wound upwards through a defile the way grew ever steeper and narrower i dont like this said goth who was an accomplished huntress herself its almost as if were being herded i guess we should just be grateful theyre not eating us said vezzarn who had tucked away his rv and was looking to be on the edge of panicky flight very distantly just on the edge of perception pausert could rell vatch if he could get klatha hooks into the creature stinkin vatch said the leewit pausert agreed this time but the big one was keeping out of range the feathery trees had thinned ahead stood a stalked building that was the best way pausert could describe it it looked rather like a giant piece of broccoli though it was plainly stone there were high round windows looking down on them flicking a glance at her pausert could see that hantis was biting her lower lip with those slightly oddshaped very white teeth of hers she looked to be almost in pain behind them one of the dragonish gnyarl hissed the leewit must have been waiting for the slightest provocation from them she turned around immediately and whistled again the pitch was too high to hear but not too high to feel the captain felt his teeth ringing the gnyarl had a lot more teethand they were on the directional receiving end of that whistle the leewit could target things rather precisely the lead gnyarl yowled like a cat that had had its tail stood on then scrambled back hastily wrinkling its long nosesnout and attempting to squint at its snaggled teeth the other three also retreated goth took hantis elbow should we go somewhere else it doesnt look like you like this place much hantis gave a low musical laugh its no use going anywhere else my dear this is where we were meant to go and its not that i dont like this place i love it as does pul we know it well but seeing it like this hurts well make them fix whatever it is theyve done wrong then said the leewit using her mistress of the universe tone nothing is wrong children this is my home this is where i was born but castle aloorn in our time has few inhabitants and i am afraid it is not in the best repair this is the golden age of nartheby when our starempire was at its height and the sprites culture was in full flower a swinging platform was being lowered slowly down from the broccolihead of the building the platform looked as if it were glass and made by some old yarthe baroquestyle glasssmith it was transparent yet ornate full of gilt and green curlicues and spikes on top of it on an angular throne was a statue a haughtylooking perfectly realistic male sprite but only half hantis size captain pausert had assumed it was a statue because it was all one color even the hata pearly white and then it moved he was no statue hed just been sitting as still as one the captain looked at hantis to see her reaction and suddenly realized that she was no longer next to them she was using her klatha powers now to levitate and she was speaking but not in universum whats she saying whispered goth to the leewit shes just greeted the lord of castle aloorn real flowery stuff huh never heard hantis talk like that before the halfpint sprite spoke he wants to know who she is that dares to trespass on the lands of house aloorn hantis replied she said she has the hereditary right to visit her own lands and home she said some words that i dont think mean anything the haughty looking sprite looked as if he was about to fall off his throne he raised his hands and began jabbering furiously oh they must be like a password or something he says he wants to know who betrayed his house oh thats nasty what he just said you oughta wash his mouth out with soap captain by the widening of the leewits eyes hantis reply was even more educational oh boy i think we are in trouble the two of them are mad clear though ive never heard anyone say anything like that not even the agandars pirates somewhere in the distance was a hint of huge vatchy laughter the captain didnt like this situation at all other glassy platforms were beginning to be lowered down from the bulbous castle above behind the dragonish gnyarl still hemmed them in the leewits whistle had put them off true but would it stop them in a truly determined rush and this was definitely playing the game the way the vatch wanted they had to break out of its pattern the small sprites earlier cool and haughty air was gone his facecolor no longer matched his attire hed have had to change into purple robes to do that and pausert did not need the leewit to understand that the next words out of the halfpints mouth were something along the order of guardsseize them the furious lord of castle aloorn wasnt prepared for one of the leewits shattering whistles though the small sprites glassy platform exploded in a very satisfying shower of brightcolored shards and spilled the sprite onto the ground fifteen feet below but the sprite lord displayed that he too had klatha skills he caught himself just before an undignified landing and levitatedstraight for hantis it was plain that he thought that she had done it to him pausert realized just how lucky hed been that hantis had simply been amused when thinking it was goth playing a lightshift trick hed lifted the sprites hat and veil the redmaned sprites grass green eyes were narrowed with fury a nimbuslike halo of energy hung around the two of them as they dueled the issue however was not decided by klatha powers hantis doubled her elegant sixfingered hand into a fist and punched the other sprite in the gut his hat flew off revealing hair as flamered as hers but the captain had no time to watch any more battle was joined the sprites might be small but they were inhumanly strong there were also an awful lot of them and the gnyarl were charging when pausert woke up he noticed that his bed had become very lumpy and whatever hed drunk the night before had given him a splitting headache gradually he realized it wasnt anything hed drunk the night before and that the ache in his head was probably related to the bumps it had acquired he opened his eyes cautiously he was lying on the floor trussed up like a roast looking around he could see that the others were also lying around the room all of them were virtually wrapped from head to foot in silky looking cord it was an oddly bulbous room but very elegant and beautifully proportionedfor a prison the mirrors on the wall were odd too as were the huge convex butterflyshaped windows not like the last prison hed been in but still a prison associating with the witches of karres seemed to result in the captain spending a lot of time in durance vile to think hed once been a respectable person not a wanted criminalas he seemed to end up being these days no matter how respectably he tried to behave right now he could use some of the escapology skills of the great aron even if it got him laughed at but his little silvereyed assistant wasnt around and the big vatch was staying out of reach this big windy enjoyed playing with humans but was lot more wary than the last one had been maybe it had encountered a vatchhandler before pausert settled for rolling over and trying to sit up against the wall his lambidian iguana boots had great traction so it was not impossible just very awkward the leewit was gagged but conscious she was making frantic squirmings towards him the other fourgoth vezzarn hantis and pulwere trussed up and still for a grim moment pausert knew fear bordering on panic goth had long since made her way into his heart well the leewit too but surely they wouldnt have tied them up if they were dead last hed seen goth had been fighting off a small sea of sprites and giving a good account of herself the leewit managed to wriggle herself close to him the captain was upset to see just how pale she looked pale and very small he set to work on her gag with his teeth while he was busy both goth and vezzarn stirred just those little movements were very comforting but someone was going to pay for this witches didnt take kindly to captivity and he especially didnt take kindly to anyone beating up these particular witches hed just gotten the cloth to start tearing when hantis sat up she blinked as if trying to get her eyes to focus then she looked around the strange elfin face looked thoroughly woebegone pausert went on tearing at the fabric of the gag and was rewarded by an ow the cloth gave and the leewits mouth was free again which of course was a mixed blessing you clumping cudchewer but her illtemper was brief where are we captain asked the leewit after licking her lips hantis answered in a kind of dreamy singsong voice in the hall of the crystals which is also called imnbriahndessahrissathe place of heavenly late afternoon lights it is or was castle aloorns execution chamber it was largely destroyed during the rule of an ancestor of mine he who came to be called arvin warmaker the destroyer of the golden age she shuddered the blame for the fall of the towers of fabled delaron has been laid at his feet as well as much of the destruction done to castle aloorn many other evils also hantis sighed i am afraid that the vatch served us a truly nasty turn captain it sent us back in time to meet one of the greatest villains in narthebys history i am sorry when i realized whom i was dealing with i let my anger overpower me i have been brought up to hate this man hate and despise him for what he did not only to nartheby but also the shame he brought to the clan aloorn i should have been more tactful now we are trapped not for long said the youngest witch the captain can do his shield trick on us i never thought id ask him to do that but itll deal with these ropes all right hantis grimaced not these ropes dear remember that klatha skills are quite common among the sprites the captain can make a shield cocoon around you and that would work but the ropes would remain inside it hantis looked out of the windows no all we can do is wait for the sun to go over the zenith and then the sun will shine in through the windows and we will all die why asked pausert wriggling across the floor to goth she was stirring now and groaning softly because of the crystals and the mirrors when the sunlight shines in through those windows the facets inside the crystals will shatter it into prisms this will become a place of hundreds of rainbows and then as the sun gets into line and the outer facets focus the lighta place of death the ropes will burn away and this beautiful place will become a place for us to dance you see the crystals and the mirrors act as focusdevices and accumulative multipliers as the heat builds up inside them they change facets the light will blast from one then another in a pattern which is supposed to have been unique each time a terrible choreography of laserlights looking at the floor now the captain could see that what hed taken for lumps in his bed when he had been coming to were actually crystals multifaceted crystals thousands of them goth groaned again there its all right goth comforted the captain she quieted at his voice and burrowed against him moaned as she hit a bruised spot lay still for a bit and then opened her eyes one eye rather she could only open the other a crackshed have a magnificent black eye if she lived through the afternoon since hed promised that it would be all right hed better get free of these bonds he strained he noticed that vezzarn was also trying to sit up whats happened captain asked goth muzzily he explained she tried to sit up and managed on the second attempt i guess youd better get whistling she said to the leewit you wont get a chance to break this many things again she looked at the nartheby sprite sorry hantis i cant see any other way to deal with it it is the one place in castle aloorn that i was glad that arvin warmaker destroyed said hantis grimly the windows and mirrors are not true glass though they are strong but flexible organics like the castle itself im not so good on things that bend admitted the leewit but the crystals arent flexible arvin destroyed many of them well hell have to make them again first if hes going to destroy them this time said goth she nodded at the leewit go to it break as much as you like the leewit scowled its not as much fun when youve got permission i promise you that the current owner is going to be as mad as a wet desert bollem about it said the captain firmly the leewit cheered up immediately okay then she pursed her lips focused her gray eyes on one of the larger crystals there was a thin highpitched sound and a series of little clinking noises rather like the hull metal around a cooling spacedrive the crystal fell slowly in on itself the leewit picked out another vezzarn groaned and rolled over by the time the littlest witch was onto her twentythird crystal the little spaceman safecracker and spy was awake captain he asked weakly is there any reason we have to stay tied up pausert shook his head other than the fact i cant get loose no ive got a small vibrorazor hidden in my bootheel captain along with lockpicks and some electronic gear if i could get to it pausert smiled for the first time in quite a while hantisthese ropes theyre klatha proof but can you cut them hantis blinked possibly they muzzled poor pul that could be why captain pausert thought they probably did that to stop the grikdog biting them but he held his tongue instead he said goth do you think you could port that razor into my mouth as we cant even use our fingers sure captain she smiled wickedly open wide he did and the tiny tool arrived neatly between his lips like a little cigar and abruptly disappeared sorry captain wrong way round if youd clicked it on then you could have taken out your tonsils a moment later the hilt was held by his teeth he felt around the ported vibrorazor with his tongue until he found the clickswitch the vibrorazor starting buzzing like an angry gnat under his nose very cautiously he touched it to goths silky ropewrapping it frayed he went on trying not to cut her the rope might resist klatha but it was no match for imperial technology by the time that the leewit had dealt with nine more crystals goth was shrugging off her ropecocoon after that freeing all of them was a quick job the sun had moved directly above castle aloorn and the room was already full of dancing rainbows vezzarn got awkwardly to his feet rubbing life back into his arms and hands let me see if i can master an alien lock captain if i can find the door that is it is there behind the mirrors in the corner said hantis pointing but it isnt intended to be opened from the inside milady ive even dealt with a safe like that said vezzarn with a lopsided grin he walked over to the far corner and began examining the smooth surface with the tiniest folding magnetocalipers the captain had ever seen what about guards asked the captain where would they be hantis waved her slim elfin hands in my day there was no need for guards aloorn is a peaceful friendly place where any visitor would be welcome the captain grimaced well this kind of welcome i could skip what about a way out hantis the sprite wrinkled her sharp nose that could be difficult of course it is not a problem if you can levitate but there is no walkway down and we are about one hundred and twenty of your feet off the ground what about those platform things asked goth hantis shrugged every set of chambers has a hoist most of our people use them rather than levitating which takes a great deal of effort in my time we could have gone to an unoccupied chamber swung the hoist arm out and dropped down but it would appear to me that castle aloorn is very well populated right now to get to a hoist you would have to break into some sprites home and we are as a species able to scream telepathically someone has been trying to probe me since we have been trapped in here fortunately i have very good shields havent felt anything said goth warily that is not surprising said hantis i am a betterthanaverage telepath among my own kind and i can barely pick up the general drift of human thoughts our minds are very differently constructed that is why the captains klatha use does not affect me the way it does other adults over in the corner vezzarn sighed sorry captain but its not working the mechanism itself is simple enough but there is something else there its not mechanical and not hyperelectronic its some kind of energy construct i cant budge it the door is open except for that klatha lock said hantis can you do anything about it asked captain pausert the leewit was still crumbling crystals but there were a lot of them and the mirrors were full of rainbows all of them were bathed in the multicolored light it made the nartheby sprite look even more alien hantis shook her head no then the mirrored door swung open they all stared at it even the leewit stopped her whistling peering cautiously back at them was a wizened sprite a knife in his hand he put his finger to his lips some gestures obviously crossed both species and time lines he beckoned and said something hed come to cut us loose he wants us to go with him said the leewit he has the hoist ready back in his masters chambers he will help us to escape he says something about this smells wrong to me said goth pausert felt the same way he remembered hantis klatha skills is he telling the truth hantis nodded but you need to remember captain that truthhearing only extends to the limits of what the speaker knows he might not be aware that he is lying some of the great truthhearers of our history have been fooled thus we better chance it anyway captain said vezzarn nervously we need to get out of here before these folks see what the little wisdom has done to their precious crystals i reckon theyre not going to be pleased the captain could see his point even if the sprites of castle aloorn had been planning to kill them they were going to be mad about the destruction the leewit had wrought they might as well go and find trouble as wait for it and the leewit was looking tired come on brat he said snagging her and hoisting her up onto his back dont need to be carried she said peevishly but i need you to have lots of spare breath for whistling the leewit thought about that kay she said and wrapped her arms around his neck the party walked towards the beckoning sprite and pul paused nanites he growled hes been near nanites hantis stopped too is he possessed pul sniffed no hes just touched something that had their exudates on it but there is a trace of nanite in these corridors pausert wasnt aware of the nanite smell but he could just rell that big vatch again along with a feeling of being laughed at even more reason to get out of here he said come on our guide is getting nervous they swung the door to click shut behind them the sprites were in for something of a shock when they opened their execution chamber the destruction and the absence of dead bodies would give them something to think about all the captain could hope was that it frightened them out of pursuit not that he was too sure where he was going except that it should be somewhere else then somehow he must try to catch that wary vatch get back to the venture and back to their mission they went past numerous round doors the passage was empty which seemed a little odd seeing that it was midafternoon perhaps the sprites slept during the daytime hantis didnt herself but she had spent a lot of time among humans the captain enquired about it as they hurried after their scurrying guide hantis shook her head it is a little odd ill ask our guide she did so in a quick exchange he says they are at a councilofwar meeting his master sent him to rescue us now as everyone would be there he would have come earlier otherwise they went up several spiral ramps very steep and difficult to climb and came at last to a larger round door covered in ornate embossedworka pattern that looked like complex multipetaled flowers their guide touched one of these with a wide open palm i wonder whose rooms these are its a pretty posh door said the leewit who still had breath for talking the captain would have asked too except that his lungs were gasping from the climb this part of the castle had been destroyed in my day said hantis trying to catch her breath there was something reassuring about the fact that even the alien had found the climb hard going inside the room was still more ornate in what pausert was now beginning to realize was typical sprite taste there was a great deal of translucent and different colored glass there was a table made of a thin section cut through an enormous amethyst crystal it had been delicately fractured and the myriad cracks infiltrated with gold and by the frantic wrinkling of puls nose the place was rotten with the stench of nanite whose chambers are these growled the grikdog at the wizened little spriteservant the servitor looked puzzled the grikdog spoke again but remembered this time to do so in the sprite tongue the wizened little man drew himself up proudly and answered he says lord nalin the advisor of young lord arvin and he says we must go quickly the hoist is through there his master says we should head for delaron hantis however had stopped dead in her tracks you smell nanites here my pul the grikdog pawed its snout the place reeks hantis turned to the others you should all flee but my duty is clear i must remain i think she said grimly i have made a great and grave mistake history is not always as accurate as we would like it to be i began to get that feeling when i saw just what the leewit had destroyed in the hall of the crystals she looked at the leewit you will be glad to know that you never got the blame for that oh you mean hantis nodded history was wrong about that this period was a violent and much disrupted one records are poor but there is no record that nanites made it to the surface of my world they certainly never survived through the troubles so i am going to the great council chamber of aloornthe hall of stars it is calledto try to take steps to eliminate this plague she smiled impishly i am less afraid of arvin than i was he was always described as a giant among my kind instead of a vain little shrimp in the distance the captain could rell vatch still far off but closer and more intense than before this he suddenly realized was why theyd been brought here this was the vatchs game i think we should all stay i think the nanite smell in here was why things smelled wrong when the wrinkled retainer offered to let us outbut i dont think it was just the smell of nanites the little man jabbered something in sprite again and pointed frantically captain pausert shook his head i dont think so old fellow i think what youre saying is hurry and go i also suspect youd get killed pretty soon after our escape to hide your boss nanite tracks come on hantis lets all go to your great council chamber hantis nodded i dont think we need a guide for that either i can find our way it was just as well the terrified servitor had obviously worked out that they werent going and had bolted chapter as she led them towards the great council chamber hantis found herself trying again to deal with the conflicting emotions that had overwhelmed her since shed found herself back on the motherworld shed traveled far and dealt extensively with humans she and the witches of karres had found much common ground but this was nartheby aloorn the place in her heart of hearts and castle aloorn to see it like this lit with faerielights gleaming and gloriousthat was a treasure beyond her wildest dreams she understood now that she might have come to destroy it or at least to lead to its destruction the council chamber the hall of stars was the highest and largest room in castle aloorn they came in through an upper doorthe door of the accused which as she had been sure it would be was open and led to an empty gallery looking out she could see that the many tiers of the chamber were full fuller than she had ever seen it on her chair the judgment seat of aloorn sat arvin warmaker his head was bandaged and he did not look particularly warlike actually now that she was able to look at him slightly more dispassionately he looked both sore and a little afraid they had arrived at an interesting moment a goldclad sprite was just giving arvin the news that the prisoners had escaped from the imnbriahndessahrissa the destruction my lord is terrible more than half of the precious crystals are shattered into dust my lord said a sprite standing at the side of the judgment seat have patrols sent out release the gnyarl we must capture these miscreants before they get back to delaron arvin waved a hand in irritation enough lord nalin i can deal with some things myself angbar see to it the goldclad sprite bowed and scurried out nalin spoke again do you see how right i was now my lord to have them sent to the imnbriahndessahrissa delaron will stop at nothing to see our precious aloorn destroyed nonetheless nalin it is customary for the accused to come before the seat of judgment before they are executed looking at him now her fury gone hantis could see that arvin was a very young sprite young and probably unsure of himself there was nothing unsure about nalin my lord it was necessary to take swift and decisive action against these criminals you were incapacitated and their guilt was established beyond all doubt they were spies from delaron murderers and assassins an elderly sprite from one of the front galleries stood up my lord arvin what rubbish is this assassins come in darkness in secret and with stealth they do not arrive at midmorning with a group of aliens and give the greeting words of the clan aloorn treachery in our very midst proclaimed nalin pointing at the sprite now my lord arvin we know who betrayed the passphrase of the great clan aloorn look no further than lord laar of septclan aloorntaro lord laar looked as if he might just leap over the edge of the gallery and seize the lord nalin by the throat but young arvin raised his hand enough there will be time enough for accusations and counteraccusation when the prisoners are recaptured hantis decided this was as good a chance as she was going to get we are here lord arvin in the gallery of the accused where we should have been brought to begin with we await our hearing pandemonium was the right word for what followed captain pausert wished he could understand what was being said the huge hall that hantis had led them to was an amazing place it was several hundred feet from the floor to the ceiling for a start the ceiling itself was a semitransparent domeroof pausert could now understand why the council chamber was called the hall of stars around each star in the nightsky the ceiling glowed as if magnifying their light although he could see no other form of lighting the chamber was nonetheless quite bright perhaps the light came from hidden globes in the hanging translucent galleries that studded the walls like so many bracketfunguses all of the galleries but for the one they stood in were jampacked with sprites until hantis spoke that iswhen like great flocks of angry birds they all headed for the hanging balcony dont do anything dont fight said hantis urgently as the sprites levitated towards them with the numbers of sprites coming up pausert realized a fight would have been futile anyway so for the second time that day but this time with his cooperation the captain allowed himself to be bound he consoled himself with the thought that after all he could always get loose again vezzarn still had his vibrorazor and goth could still teleport objects hantis said something and the leewit squawked i am not a little child come closer you ill pull your pointy sprite nose she then said something that caused the sprites to gape pausert was glad he didnt understand it saved him having to go through the fight to wash her mouth out with soap again and he had enough trouble already besides he wouldnt have minded saying it himself whatever it was if the leewit and goth hadnt been listening soon pausert found himself being carried away this time the chamber he was taken to had a far greater resemblance to a prison cell at least it was clean he was also alone in it he had plenty of time to examine the bare room he decided and to wonder just why hantis had told them not to resist eventually the door would open while she waited in her own prison chamber hantis had plenty of time to doubt the wisdom of her actions shed had time to realize that perhaps shed been a bit too imperious herself it was indeed her castle but how would she have felt if some stranger had turned up without warning and without an appropriate escort and used the words she had but she would put it right and somehow she would deal with the plague that had infected her people after all she knew the laws and customs of aloorn none better she would be taken back to the hall of stars and would address the seat of judgment and explain then the door to her holding room opened and she realized that shed missed one possible scenario the sprite who stood there was not going to listen that would not suit lord nalin advisor to high lord arvin or rather it would not suit the nanites that populated him who had taken over his body and mind her flesh crawled with horror realizing he had probably not come to kill her killing her would serve his purposes less well than infecting her hantis screamed and screamed with her mind too and this time that was enough a group of seven sprites came running into the room what is it my lord nalin one of them asked lord nalin gestured in irritation nothing go i wish to question the prisoner alone if the nanites could lie so could she he assaulted me look at my face she knew that her face was bruised from the earlier encounter is this how the people of aloorn use prisoners the leader of her guards drew himself up my lord i cannot allow you to assault the prisoner he said stiffly what nonsense said the high lords advisor haughtily i did nothing to her the guard looked doubtfully at hantis who cowered away into the corner there was no need for her to pretend fear that was real enough dont let him touch me she whimpered the guard commander nodded reassuringly we do not allow prisoners to be tortured or hurt lady you will face high lord arvin for justice he is good and fair if young did high lord arvin order us killed without a hearing demanded hantis forgetting to be humble and cower the guard commander gave a hard look at her then at lord nalin no he said as a matter of fact the order was issued by lord nalin my lord i shall have to ask you to leave and do not attempt to visit the prisoners again escort lord nalin away fotri as the nanitecontrolled sprite was ushered awaypolitely but the guards were making very clear that theyd brook no nonsensehantis relaxed i am willing to talk to anyone as long as the guard watches except for lord nalin the news of the nanite plague had plainly not reached nartheby i think he is in the pay of delaron the guard blinked but he is advisor to the high lord himself exactly now can i explain why we are here and from whence we have come we traveled far and in great peril to bring this word to the clan aloorn the guard commander shook his head the high lord himself will hear you you must wait for him will you at least keep lord nalin away from meand my companions the order will be given said the guard commander and with that hantis had to be content but a little later her door was opened by a very worried looking guard the prisoner that you told us was a young girl child of a species from the outworlds she has disappeared hantis felt herself go cold with fear the nanites would take some hours to assume control and in the meantime the victims body would be wracked with spasms and rigors once the nanite infection had begun all you could do for the victim was to incinerate them the only thing that slowed the plague at all was that after taking over a new victim the nanites required several weeks to build up their numbers to the point where they could send out breeding colonies but the mind of the victim was destroyed within the first hour hantis had known goth and the leewit since their birth now she was desperately afraid for the littlest witch how she croaked a hole was cut from storage chambers through the wall and into her holding chamber or the other way around we are not sure if she cut her own way out hantis shook her head i doubt it she wouldnt leave us she is still very young please put us all together and set loose my grikdog pul he will defend us the guard looked worried i cannot do that i have strict orders to keep you apart well then please put pul in with goth the next youngest alien the guard considered then nodded i suppose precisely speaking the grikdog is not a prisoner but more in the way of a caged animal the high lord has several he breeds them very well i will do as you wish he smiled thinly i have heard they have a nasty bite to them hantis realized that grikdogs in the here and now had not yet been bred to sniff out nanites their toxin was simply a general one they werent very intelligent yet either and tell the others to scream if anyone comes in oh they wont understand you only the littlest one can speak our language she sighed i dont suppose youd let me speak to them no milady said the guard not without asking the high lord can he be asked you must send word that the leewit is missing he has already been told extra guards have been detailed chapter the leewit had been a good three parts asleep when she saw the blade coming through the wall it was a blur of bluewhite energy and was steadily cutting a circle out of the back wall of the room where she was confined shed had a long tiring daymore exhausting than shed been willing to admit shed been very glad of the piggyback on the captains back she wished that he were here now was this a dream was this a rescue or was it more trouble she wanted goth or she wanted the captain or preferably both her older sister could be annoying although goth didnt fuss the way maleen did and the captain made her wash her neck and behind her ears but she liked having them around especially when things were unfamiliar although shed never have admitted that to anyone the shimmering lightblade finished cutting its circle out of the wall long slim fingers pulled the piece of wall backwards into the darkness and three furtivelooking sprites came through the hole before the sleepy leewit had a chance to even whistle one of them clapped his hand over her mouth she was carried to the hole and out into the darkness beyond a hand was kept firmly clamped over her mouth as they carried her away the leewit was unsure if she was being rescued or kidnapped if it was a rescue she wished theyd tell her so they wrapped her in a heavy smelly cloth now the leewit was sure she was being kidnapped so she bit the fingers hard yeeow be still keep her mouth shut she bit me another hand clamped over her mouth bite me and i will stick a knife into you this person sounded like he meant it after a moment she was picked up and carried off when they removed the heavy cloth the leewit found herself in a small chamber with a large balcony like all the sprite places shed seen it was full of translucent glass the hand was pulled away from her mouth she finally got to that scream shed been saving up scream all you like said the sprite that had had his hand clapped over her mouth no one can hear you here alien thing although luwis may decide to punish you for biting his fingers who are you demanded the leewit looking around the room it had a very high ceiling and was full of beautiful and delicate ornaments the sprites slanted eyebrows went up i would have thought it was quite obvious small alien we are spies from delaron we want to know what youre doing here and just where youre from the leewit rolled her eyes clumping stupid she gave the sprite an accusing glare he seemed a bit befuddled that mollified the leewit a bit of course it didnt mollify her enough to be cooperative she was the leewit after all so she did what she normally did when she was in trouble went straight up she still weighed a lot less than the sprites and shed spotted a high shelf full of obviously very precious bricabracs before her three captors knew quite what was going on she was on the shelf of course most sprites could levitate also but there wasnt going to be any of that fragile glass and crystal stuff left by the time they caught her hey come down come down or youll be sorry said the one with the bitten fingers here wellpo make her come down before she bumps anything off there the leewit shaped her lips into a whistle one of her best and favorite it worked even better on the sprites than on the people shed tried it on before bones in the ears werent what was the wordflexible they wouldnt shatter in there but they did hurt the three doubled up holding their ears just to keep in practice she blew a beautiful shatterer at a display of rose and amethyst crystals on the table it exploded very nicely but when the leewit saw the look of fury on the face of the one who had threatened to stick a knife into her she realized she wasnt high enough there was a narrow chimneylike opening in one corner of the ceiling it was made up of mirrors and had a skylight and there was a small sill at the top that she could perch on best of all even if they could levitate none of the sprites were going to fit into the mirrorchimney the leewit scooted up it was a tight fit even for her and it wasnt very comfortable but then from the angry sounds the sprites were making it would be a lot less comfortable down there a questing arm came feeling upwards when it found the ledge the leewit stepped on the fingers as hard as she could oww the fingers vanished leave her luwis said one of the other kidnappers shell have to come down sooner or later thats well enough for you wellpo why did we not take her to your chambers you dont have skylighting for two reasons as i already explained to you first its too far away secondly it is near that stiffnecked old laars chambers given what that ass nalin accused laar of that area of aloorn is almost bound to be searched but she has smashed my precious crystal sculpturework smashed it shell come down in time ill murder her the leewit giggled and whistled again it was hard to be directional from here but by the howl of anguish shed gotten lucky and once the howl died away she could hear the tinkling sounds of a glass ornament raining little pieces of its former self onto the floor still they were quite right she couldnt stay up here forever she was pretty tired and starting to get hungry she looked at the tiny chimneylike space she was wedged in it was nothing more than a long tube with a window at the top she peered out the window but there wasnt much that she could see it was dark out there but she knew they must be high up going out this high off the ground was scary but not as scary as going down or trying to stay here until she fell so she whistled at the window all that did was make her ears ring angrily the leewit struck the window with her little fist the skylight opened right up as neatly as you please she must have hit a release of some kind that she hadnt even noticed sticking her head out she could see much better it was less dark outside than shed thought the window must have been filtered best of all this wasnt an opening over a sheer drop to the ground belowthe window opened onto the roof in an scrambling instant the leewit was out of the hole and onto the rooftops someone else would have started their escape immediately not the leewit she turned stuck her face back though the skylight window and sent a real crystalshattering whistle down into the chamber then her shrill and powerful voice overrode the howls and splintering sounds below the leewit bestowed upon the sprites any number of descriptions of themselves using terms shed picked up since their voyage began most of them were in the sprites own language selected from the terms hantis had bestowed on the little sprite muckamuck but the term beelzit was scattered freely throughout then she closed the skylight and started crawling away across the steep rooftops boy i hope the captain doesnt find out she muttered ill be eating soap for a clumping year she stopped crawling after a while since the rooftops were very steep and scary and there seemed no end to them no rhyme or reason either that she could see to the sprite notion of architecture when she came across a little cluster of skylights that formed something like a nest she decided to stop she was very tired and felt very alone and the rooftops were very high and very steep and she was very scaredand now night was falling its not clumping fair the leewit protested to the universe the universe gave no reply grumbling with indignation the leewit crept into the cluster of skylights and curled up among them it wasnt the warmest or most comfortable place to sleep but in a tucked away corner the littlest witch slept all the same sleep was far from hantis she knew what danger they were in and she was terribly worried about the leewit the worry steadily built into anger by the time arvin warmaker finally walked into her room of confinement she was quite ready to start her brawl with him all over again but the high lord looked even smaller than he had when she first met himand a lot younger all the sprites shed seen seemed much smaller than her people which was something of the opposite to the way history had painted the matter he also looked very worried i had planned to leave this until the gathering tomorrow but now the littlest of your band has escaped or been seized why are you trying to push us into this war with delaron i have tried very hard to avoid it weve had generations of war surely that is enough his tone was plaintive the wind was taken out of hantis sails avoid despite what nalin and his cohorts say i am not convinced that it would be wise said arvin or that we would win anyway even if it were hantis took a deep breath she could tell that he spoke the truth so it was history that had lied well it wouldnt be the first time high lord arvin do you have a truthspeaker among your councilors he shook his head such klatha powers are rare it is a pity because they are useful to a ruler very she said dryly you see i am one and despite everything i was raised to believe i know you to be speaking the truth of your heart he looked at her extremely suspiciously you say despite everything you were raised to believe so you are one of our ancient foes after all i had wondered will you make peace with us then is this an overture that has been terribly misunderstood hantis wished that like humans she could weep for this boyman i am not one of those you term our ancient foes but yes this has been a terrible misunderstanding she sighed but i fear i have not come make a peace with delaron i fear i fear terribly that i may have come to make you go to war with them it was his turn to gape at her what if you are not from delaron then where have you come from and how did you know the kinwords of clan aloorn i was taught them said hantis calmly they were among the first things i was ever taught even in my cradle they were sung to me i know how the flame walls are triggered i know where the toothtraps lie i know the portal songs for each and every of the inner chambers he looked fearfully around you must indeed be a spy why would a spy come here if they already knew all of our defenses asked hantis he drew back between his two guards you are an assassin she issued a small wry laugh why would i admit to knowing all of our ancient secrets high lord if i were an assassin no i am one who would know these things by right the only one who could know all of the secrets of aloorn besides yourself think high lord arvin who has the right to know as much as you do except one born to the inner clan i am of aloorn but i am from your distant future that is not possible she shrugged nonetheless it is true i am a distant descendant of yours you are one of the most wellknown sprites from the era of the nanite plague wars the most illfamed and notorious to be precise his eyes nearly popped out of his head leave he said to both of his guards but highlord go you may remain in the passage reluctantly the bodyguards obeyed the high lord of aloorn waited until they were out of earshot you know something that is secret from all but the high lords this is either a very cunning trap or the truth prove to me that it not a trap i can show you the secret exit to your chamber which is activated by placing your palm on the points of the tsaritsa flower in the middle of the windowwall and i can tell you that the early secret quarantine will fail it has already failed he blinked his double lids covering his violet eyes who are you i mean who are you where you come from i told you i am your direct descendant i am named high lady hantis des shaharissa of clan aloorn why have you come here how have you come here a vatch as hantis recalled there had always been vatches they had just become more numerous around humanity klatha wielded by humans seemed attractive to them and to creatures to whom time and space were equally insubstantive they could congregate where they willed he bit his thin lips it is possible i suppose we know the vatches sometimes use their power to play sprites as pieces in great dramas but what test have you and your companions come to nartheby to perform aloorn is no place for such deeds i think said hantis carefully that i was brought here as part of a vatch joke i was supposed to kill you and therebyhaving destroyed my own progenitordestroy myself this vatch seems more malicious than most but you are wrong about the role of aloorn aloorn played a great and central part in the plague wars and there is need the nanites are here already arvin he who would be called the warmaker the destroyer of delaron whose infamy for the burning alive of those in the towers lived on through centuries looked horrified butwell contain them a cure will be found therell be no need for violence the problem can never spread as far as nartheby hantis shook her head sadly this is an intelligent plague i should have realized before that the historical accounts made no sense they came here to nartheby first we always believed the plague started in the outer realms and was fought planet by planet inward to nartheby but why would they act in such a mindless manner of course the nanites would have struck for nartheby first if they could decapitate the sprite dominium the rest would be theirs for the taking she did not say but did realize that the strategy she sketched was exactly what the reemergent nanites had set out to do in the empire centuries in the future but do you not know how the plague was fought demanded arvin the records from the plague years are very confused what i do knowwhat i was taught ratheris that high lord arvin he who was called the warmaker brutally took control of all nartheby and isolated her the young high lord gaped at her i did what took control of all nartheby and isolated her you went to the council of high lords and in the hall of truce killed three of the high lords and their advisors and kinsmen the three who besides yourself were the most powerful then made the rest bow to your will that is mad i wish it were said hantis sadly i conclude that you must have taken pul with you and sniffed out those of the high lords and those who were nanite infected and killed them pul my grikdog i believe you breed them she raised her eyebrows at him it is one thing history gives you great credit for breeding grikdogs that could sniff out nanite infection that was how the plague was eventually dealt with other than in open warfare for the first time there was a slight smile on the face of high lord arvin my grikdogs are bred to smell out trufflefungus their noses are fantastically keen ive been trying to reduce the toxicity of their bite to make them easier to handle theyre far more intelligent than most people realize it was obviously a subject dear to his heart and one hed rather talk about than the nanite plague or the domination of all nartheby she smiled at him too it appeared that being besotted with the yellowfurred creatures was a hereditary trait intelligent and loyal high lord my grikdog is with one of my human companions why dont you go and ask pul to confirm my story he was plainly quite taken with this idea their speech is a bit limited its one of the things ive been working on i think you will be pleasantly surprised at how well pul speaks said hantis graciously when high lord arvin returned a few minutes later he had goth and pul with him he bowed high lady hantis first i must give you my apologies for having treated you like this in your own home will you tell him to stop talking said goth crossly lets get the captain and go and look for the leewit what did the little alien say asked arvin she is very worried about her younger sister the humans are good klatha operatives but this is a young one to be off on her own she wants you to free the other human who is something of a guardian to both of them and to start looking if i may suggest we could use pul to track her down pul knows her scent dont you my clever one pul growled cant miss it its the soapy teeth he is a magnificent male said arvin enviously petting pul the grikdog gave the high lord a nonetoofriendly glance but to hantis relief didnt even bare his fangs yes arvin said decisively let us do it he snapped orders hantis could see that once he grew up a little more this would indeed be the ruthless and effective arvin of legend it was also plain that although he might doubt hantis pul had the high lord under his paw together they went to pauserts holding chamber the captain was very pleased to see them and hantis realized at the same time in a very dangerous state because of his worry about the leewit toll and threbus had not put their childrens welfare lightly in the care of just anyone he took his responsibilities very very seriously the captain was probably unaware of the klatha energies surging around him hantis wasnt but all he said was lets get onto the trail quick pul sniffed around the storage chamber and found the trail of three mixed in with the smell of the leewit he set off at a run along the curving corridors of castle aloorn they had to race to keep up with him they caught up with the grikdog at a beautifully inlaid door covered in an intricate knotted pattern in strings of opaque glass hantis had no chance to ask pul privately if he smelled the odor of nanites all she had time for was fear luwis luwis crystalcrafter said the high lord incredulously captain pausert shouldercharged the door it didnt break open the door said arvin to his guards they added their slighter weight to the captains but to no avail stand aside commanded arvin pausert might not have understood the words but he understood the tone of voice and the behavior of the guards he stepped aside and the door imploded into dust and a wash of heat that frizzed the hairs on the captains hands from the moment the captain had shouldercharged the door to its disintegration had taken at least a minute by the time they got into the chambers the last of the rooms three occupants were leaving into the predawn via the balcony and the stairs leading downward they rushed after them out onto the balcony hantis caught sight of the fugitives far below she could see no sign of the leewit either accompanying them or bundled in any way but the light was poor and the shreds of morning mist soon obscured them completely shall we pursue my lord asked one of the guards the high lord shook his head no give the order to release the gnyarl let them hunt the flight of luwis proclaims his guilt so does this hantis pointed to the mauve powdery remains on the table and the little piles of fine dust on the carefully placed and lit shelves she was here if theyve so much as hurt a hair on her head the captain balled his fists a worried hantis wondered why the leewit had not been taken by those who fled had she been infected nanite infection patterns were well known the invaders immobilized the victim within minutes then over a period of several days reproduced and gradually took control it took roughly a week before full control was established they wouldnt have had to take her along if they could hide her well enough any sign of nanites pul hantis tried to keep her voice casual she sensed pauserts gathering fury and the immense klatha energies that fury could unleash if the captain realized what hantis would have to do if the littlest witch had been infected no growled pul not a trace relief washed her pul sniffed the floor and rose onto his hind legs sniffing upwards she went up the grikdog said pointing with his nose to the mirroredchimney skylight that was catching the first rays of dawn goth might not have understood the words but she understood the gesture she levitated towards the chimney with a scant regard for what remained of luwis crystalcrafters prized creations the upper end of the chimneyskylight was nearly too narrow for her but she managed to force herself in she got to the top and called down this window does open huh chapter the leewit woke shivering and hungry it was bad enough that it was cold and dark and that she was alone but the thin rain that had started to fall seemed just too much to her no one could hear her snuffle so she did but she wasnt going to stay out here in the rain so she started trying to find a way off the roof of castle aloorn that didnt involve going straight down a long long way as worn out and hungry as she was she was afraid to try levitating even for a short distance much less that great drop to the ground below levitation was a new klatha skill for the leewit and she still wasnt as good at it as her sister goth the answer seemed to be to climb into a skylight a different skylight the problem was that most of them seemed to be shut from the inside it took her a long time to find one that wasnt and then to climb in with her hands so cold they were almost numb inside it was gloriously warm the ledge up here wasnt as narrow and uncomfortable as the last one but there was no point in staying on it carefully the leewit started climbing down as usual there were loads of shelves on the walls full of glass and crystal she had a very difficult time descending without kicking something off especially since she was sorely tempted to smash everything in sight anyway but the room shed climbed into seemed to be empty and it wouldnt be smart to make any noise when she finally reached the floor and looked around dim light filtering from panels left the whole place a rather ghostly blue kind of eerie in fact but the leewit decided that the place was as good as any to hide out it was warm and dry if nothing else and there might just be some food somewhere maybe in one of those jars or bottles she murmured to herself clumping stuff has to be good for something the nightrain has washed away the scent growled pul and i do not like being up here pausert could see why the roof of the castle sloped steeply and the slope was treacherous in places the thought of the leewit wandering around up here in the dark made his blood run cold blessedly the high lords guards hadnt found pauserts worst fear a small broken body on the ground far below and theyd now searched everywhere she might have fallen so apparently she hadnt the leewit was just missing she wasnt responding to their shouts either but there were any number of the chimneylike skylights and odd towers sprouting from the top of the castle she could be hiding anywhere said goth tiredly leaning against him when hantis said those skylight things opened for ventilation i was pretty happy now i almost wish they didnt the leewit can get herself into impossible places despite his simmering anger the captain had to fight down a smile at the cross tone in goths voice as if she never got into any such predicaments hantis came across to them come we must go within the high lord arvin will call a council and get everyone to help look for her and besides you look all in you both need food youre pretty chummy with this high lord arvin now said goth eyeing the sprite he tried to kill all of us remember it was a misunderstanding said hantis quietly we fell over our mutual pride i assumed too much and high lord arvin did not send us to the imnbriahndessahrissa that was his advisor lord nalin but that was the name of the boss of the little old guy who came to rescue us yes hantis eyes were cold the same lord nalin who also claimed that we were assassins from delaron in whose apartments pul smelled nanite exudates while arvin was unconscious lord nalin ordered us executed as spies and murderers because that would help to fan the fires hes trying to start when objections were raised in the council nalin sent his servant to free us and send us fleeing to delaron the high lord is actually the only one who can pass the death sentence so arvin sent his guards for us only wed escaped which made us look guilty and lord nalin seem to have been correct that was why i put us in the position of honorable prisoners so whats all this got to do with the leewits kidnapping asked goth we dont know admitted the sprite woman come let us eat and contemplate our next move good sprite food may help me to think properly anyway ive had to reassess my ideas about history apparently so said the captain wryly i thought you said that this arvin was the greatest villain in your history it appears that history blamed the wrong person it appears that the greatest villain in the history of nartheby may be me come i will explain while we eat the high lord needs to marshal his soldiers nalin has gathered many adherents some of whom may be nanite controlled down inside the castle sitting at a construction of glass and silver on velvety upholstered translucent chairs pausert realized that the holding chambers theyd been put in were probably the sprite equivalent of the cell hed been put into on pidoon the food wasnt the usual breakfast fare for humans the icecrystal layers of sweet and tart and definitely alcoholic stuff wasnt anything pausert had encountered neither really were the thin nuttytasting pancakes and deep purple jelly but they were very welcome nonetheless and they were certainly easier to digest than hantis explanations dont you see the nanites are doing precisely what they are trying to do in the empire in our time decapitate at this stage their numbers are probably very few they take control of key individuals ones like lord nalin whose position makes them powerful but whom few people really know well the nanites can take over the body of the victim but the behavior and mannerisms change so the nanites must either take over a whole group which is difficult for them at this stage or someone like nalin he has been away from castle aloorn for some twenty years as a governor of one of the outlying dominions you think this is what were facing in the empire too then said the captain spooning the fragrant purple jelly onto yet another pancake so why are we trying to reach the empress hailie shes a wellknown recluse the empire only sees her twice a year i would have thought that she would be the perfect nanite victim she still wields a lot of power that would be correct except that hailie disappears between official engagements the empress goes somewhere she tours her regency anonymously shes been the unofficial friend of karres for some years now the best premoteteams on karres predicted that the only chance of defeating the nanite plague was to reach hailie first and provide her with information and protection if necessary i am empowered to call for certain drastic steps hantis looked grim ive never explained the details captain but the plague wars were the worst episode in our history high lord arvin destroyed any ship incoming to narthebyeven when they appeared to be full of refugees she took a deep breath he was renowned for his brutal efficiency in disposing of enemies here on nartheby they were always incinerated as were their homes it was a technique he put to use against the nanitepossessed in the later phases of the war when we sprites set out to destroy the nanites is there any other way not a really effective one no admitted hantis grikdog venom affects all those in the host but the environment they are found in should still burn a colony of several thousand could be hiding behind a grain of sugar on the floor but we did not know i supposeit makes sense nowthat it was always kept secret that nanites had reached narthebys surface i am afraid that arvin did what was necessary and shouldered the blame he is a braver and better sprite than i could ever be but i must have been the one who told him it was the right method to use and that it had to be done hes young and scared and in truth quite gentle he wants nothing more than peace with his neighbors he has to act the part of the arrogant high lord to hide the fact the captain struggled to absorb it all so this all happened in your history arvin the shrimpy little sprite turned into what you thought of as a monster and dealt with the problem is that why the vatch brought you here no i think vatches understand humans and time imperfectly the vatch brought me here because arvin was the worst thing in my mind he is also an ancestor of mine the vatch i think thought it would be funny if i killed him because then i would not have existed either in which case how could i have killed him great patham exclaimed goth a sort of impossible loop stinking critter it just wanted to see what would happen hantis smiled yes unfortunately i dont know exactly what i did in history because records from that time are very poor but if you want loops well i think the vatch outsmarted itself an impossible loop is after all impossible so it will be replaced by loops which arent just to name one i believe pul is off fraternizing with high lord arvins lady grikdogs the origin of grikdogs with antinanite venom and the ability to smell out nanites comes from arvins breeding program you know you mean puls his own greatgrandfather demanded goth laughing thats not exactly fraternizing hantis nodded and smiled its quite a bit further removed than that but yes and pul is the end product of a long breeding program it does beg the question of where the first nanitekilling grikdog came from said pausert but right now i am more interested in finding the leewit and somehow getting back to our own mission and own nanite fight if we can get her back at all said hantis biting her lip the gnyarl caught one of those who kidnapped her a sprite called luwis who owned the apartment unfortunately he wont be talking to anyone but the leewit definitely wasnt with him they think the other two may have dodged back into the castle captain pausert rubbed his temples thoughtfully so theyre still on the loose the nanites are here and can only be destroyed with difficulty and the leewit is still missing he rose abruptly to his feet at least weve had a good breakfast and i can still rell a hint of that blasted big vatch if it would get closer goth stood up from the elegant table old nastyvatch has been caught before i reckon hes not going to come close enough captain hes watching us from a distance then well have to go vatch hunting said the captain grimly in the meantime we have a leewit hunt to organize goth grinned catching a vatch might be easier her confidence cheered pausert up his worst fear now that it was clear the leewit hadnt fallen to her death was that her abductors might have murdered her and hidden the body somewhere but that dark thought was difficult to maintain in the presence of goth the girl had a way of projecting serenity somehow as his greatest worry faded a smaller one finally had the chance to push its way forward oh said the captain guiltily wed better ask our hosts to release old vezzarn oops hadnt thought of that either captain admitted goth pausert yawned well at least he got some sleep last night even if ill bet his breakfast wasnt as good as ours the leewit however was enjoying a far more varied and even bigger breakfast moreover she had two new well friends was the wrong word young sprites who had the delusion that a fascinating new pet had wandered into their chambers it could even talk far better than their dolls although it was the oddest looking creature theyd ever seen and it could play games and do all sorts of tricks theyd successfully hidden her from their nursebeast and their parents so far and then theyd raided the larder to see what their new pet would eat now that the leewit had a full stomach she was beginning to think about how she could get out of here and it was going to be less easy than just getting out of prison had been it was not that the two little sprites were cruel well not on purpose they were just a great deal stronger than humans of that size would be stronger than she was for sure and quite happy to tug at their new toy now that theyd fed it the worst part was when they insisted on dressing her in sprite clothes they would be adamant that she wasnt going out of their sight obviously look said the leewit in desperation lets play cards whats cards demanded the two little sprites almost in unison so the leewit had to fish out the agandars cards have them peered at and examined fortunately she always carried them with her the leewit considered boredom the worst peril in the universe but as long as you had cards you could always fend off the monster by playing solitaire hey you cant eat them you play with them here ill show you do you know snap no of course you dont look here ill deal them their names turned out to be lisol and tahimmin fortunately they were quick to learn the rules of the game mostly though they just seemed to love the cards themselves the leewit had looked at the pictures on the cards of course but the sprites noticed the tiniest details they picked up the patterns around the edges and tahimmin was scathing about the fact that each had an error my father makes inlays said the littler sprite proudly his edgepatterns are always the same all the way around play said his sister the things cards are thingmade little brother course they wont be as good as papas the game was noisy cheerful and did not manage to distract the leewit from the fact that she had to somehow get out of here and rescue goth and the captain and old vezzarn hantis and pul of course at least in the hooded sprite cloak and tunic she could pretend that she was a sprite even if lisol and tahimmin thought blond hair was hilarious the sprites couldnt see it under the hood the young high lord arvin had underestimated two things first the depth of support that nalin had gathered around him and secondly just how effective lord nalins spy network was there was no element of surprise on their side when they marched up with pul in the lead towards the wing that lord nalin had made his own actually it was high lord arvin who walked into an ambush the high lord had been stilldoubtful and had been beginning to question his own judgment the small band of his guard that accompanied him were not really prepared to fight the firefight turned nasty almost immediately as nalins team of ambushers had the advantage of a good solid barricade then arvin stood up and traced a pattern on the air and part of the barricade burst into flame and then fell into dust before the dust had settled arvins troops were sprinting forward firing at their now unprotected and shocked foes push on hard and fast yelled the captain without thinking that the high lords troops would not understand a word he said or take orders from someone who had been a prisoner until the middle of the previous night he ran forward and picked up one of the fallen sprites projectile weapons trying to figure out just how it worked but arvin who had looked doubtful about the entire exercise a few moments before was giving orders himself he was only a shrimpsize sprite but he could do a giantsize job of bellowing thought the captain instead of chasing after lord nalins fleeing loyalists the guards began taking up defensive positions one of them roughly hauled the captain down beside him pausert turned and was surprised to see the high lord was striding back the way theyd come accompanied by half a dozen of the guards he has gone to raise the alarm hantis explained quietly to sound the warcall of aloorn only the high lord himself can do that history reached many inaccurate conclusions about arvin but one thing no one ever accused him of was personal cowardice there will be more resistance ahead fierce fighting we are too few for that arvin will be back soon at the head of his soldiers he had a reputation for remaining calm in battles although he had a terrible temper i see that much at least was true things were relatively quiet for a time with occasional probing shots coming from further up then they heard a horn blowing a sort of wild tantivity which seemed to echo through the very material of the castle itself the captain saw that hantis back straightened as it sounded and then within a moment the attack came from the nanites there were several hundred of them firing on the handful of arvins guards that had been left to hold this place what made them attack asked goth that was the warcall of aloorn said hantis the shutters have come down with it now the enemy cannot flee the castle their only chance is to fight well theyre doing that all right the captain looked speculatively at goth i think i need to shield you again child goth looked speculatively back at him sure captain if you stand behind me pausert suddenly had an idea hantis are these men armed with some form of grenade she nodded and pointed to things that looked like indian clubs on the belt of the nearest guard could you port those goth ill shield you and you port those around the far corner up there now goth grinned sure captain you can even push me forward like a screen while i do it pausert traced the klatha patterns with his mind i think well settle for just holding this place until hantis nasty ancestor gets back hes not so bad captain pul likes hi goth was in her shield a grenade vanished from the guards belt nothing happened i think they have to be armed first explained hantis speaking hastily to one of the guards he took a spritegrenade off his belt and twisted the base and held it up it vanished from his grip an explosion occurred further up the passage the other sprites began doing the same for goth deep in the castle the leewit was getting desperate to get out of her new quasicaptivity when a strange wild horncall sounded echoing through the walls the sprite children dropped the cards and their green catlike eyes widened whats that asked the leewit warily there were distant clanging noises now the warcall said lisol looking terrified it means the castle is being attacked great patham said the leewit irritably collecting her precious cards and stowing them in a pocket stupid clumping placecant even play cards in peace i think id better go little uns you cant said tahimmin shutters are down were all supposed to go to the starhall now with mamma and pappa if they are here or else with the nursebeast sure enough the nursebeast arrived there was no time for the leewit to hide and besides there seemed little point the creature looked about as dangerous as bellybutton fluff it was big furry and distinctly cuddly the two little sprites flung themselves on it and clutched it come leewit commanded lisol we must go the huge fluffy beast didnt seem worried by an extra person in with its charges it just fussed them towards the door snuffling anxiously to itself out in the passage where shed been trying to get for the last hour the leewit realized things were even more serious than shed realized the passage was occupied by several armed and nasty looking sprites get back get back into your chambers yelled one further down the passage something exploded but the nursebeast was determined to see her charges through to the right place no matter what explosions happened or orders anyone gave she hooted mournfully and ambled forward one of the sprites shot her the nursebeast squealed in surprise and pain the two little sprites shrieked and clung to her get out of here yelled the shooter go back to your chambers before i shoot you too a moment before the leewit had been really frightened now she was just mad clear through she didnt even think about which whistle to use that one busted up machinery something awful and that gun would never fire again the sprite whod been holding it was hopping around clutching his hand and hissing quick said the leewit hold my hands you two lets get them under nursebeast and carry her back scared the two little ones did their best but the big fluffy creature was heavy and bleeding and there were more sprites coming the leewit whistled again behind the remains of the barricade pausert heard a familiar highpitched whistle it was like having his ears pricked with a hot needle and it was on the wrong side of the barricade then the second whistle the captain seemed to detect a terrible urgency in that whistle he reached into himself knowing there was desperate need and knowing that klatha power came not when you wanted it but when you were ready for it he pictured the leewit in his mind a little blond waif her cold gray eyes staring at him and began to weave the klatha pattern around her she seemed larger than hed envisaged so he made space he didnt want to accidentally cut pieces of the leewit off so he made the pattern include all that was alive and then pattern completed he picked up his spriterifle and began running forward he was unaware that the rest of the little outpost had followed him or that more sprites were coming up behind that led by a shrimp with attitude all the captain knew was that he wasnt going to be stopped short of the leewit goths porting of grenades had kept heads down ahead of them now as lord nalins cohorts put their heads up they found themselves facing what seemed to be a wave of fury sprites are more klathasensitive than most humans the creature running towards them one of the survivors later said seemed at least fifteen feet tall and as unstoppable as an avalanche and they were already rattled by the exploding grenades that had appeared from nowhere afterwards the captain admitted that hed even forgotten to fire while he was running forward those behind him made up for it lord nalins loyalists were not all naniteinfected few of them were actually these were just foot soldiers following their lords orders who really didnt want to be there at all fighting the high lord they turned and fled some of them fell over the barrier of the large cocoon shielding leewit two little sprites and a huge furry beast of some kind the beast was wounded and bleating plaintively the captain got there and as he stopped arvins sprites surged past there were several hundred of them and high lord arvin was in the van so was hantis accompanied by pul a panting vezzarn and two other sprites hed coopted came up with a makeshift stretcherand goth still in her own shield cocoon catching his breath the captain decided that the leewit could wait until hed liberated goth if he could lipread she was saying some pretty awful things and he didnt know if the sprites had soap anyway calming himself slowly and deliberately the captain retraced the pattern that shielded goth what did you leave me behind for captain she demanded as she bounced to her feet you agreed to stay behind me it was one of the few times hed ever seen goth hopping mad she even stamped her foot whats the point of me staying around until im marriageable age if youre going to do stupid things like that er said pausert the leewit was in trouble goth was not mollified the leewits always in trouble crossly goth glanced at her little sister id say leave her in there out of trouble for a change save us all some grief except those two sprites seem to want to get to the others that are in with her she pointed to two anxious sprites who were trying reach into the shield cocoon pausert realized they were trying to get to the two small sprites in there and that the leewit was signing frantically at him he took a deep breath and retraced that pattern too instantly the passage was overwhelmed by yelling captain the leewit tugged at his sleeve the nursebeasts been shot she dragged him towards the fluffy thing it was definitely bleeding and in pain he knelt beside it and parted the rich fur looking for the wound give me the vibrorazor vezzarn let me just cut the fur clear here he did exposing the entrywound the beast turned its long neck to try and peer at it its beerybrown eyes had a look of entreaty that made pausert feel terribly helpless goth and the leewit were kneeling beside him so on the other side of the fluffy creature were two small sprites and what were apparently their parents sprite soldiers streamed around them as the captain felt around the wound cautiously wishing he knew more about first aid and more about alien physiology at a guess the creature had a bullet lodged in its lungif it was built like the creatures he was familiar with the bullet will have to come out goth took a deep breath i can do that i think she closed her eyes briefly here captain she held out a bloody metal fragment i think i can still the pain and stop the bleeding said a voice from the leewits mouth it didnt sound like the leewit but more like her older sister maleen captain pausert realized that the leewit was calling up her sisters pattern to guide her through some piece of unfamiliar klatha but ill need to borrow from you two sure said goth gruffly so long as you fix it i ought to give you a good thumping later you idiot the captain and i have been worried stiff about you and you nearly got him killed you and what clumping army the leewit jibed just cause youre sweet on him take more than a few silly sprites to hurt the captain anyway now help me with the nursebeast we can fight later goth smiled mistily at her sister just you wait now draw away this is what they premoted youd be good at one day what must i do asked the captain just hold her shoulders and when she needs your strength let her have it ill do my best he said a bit uncertainly he knew it wasnt physical strength she wanted the leewit began to glow her hands wrapped in the nursebeasts fur looked like little torches of warm redness that seemed to be sinking into the animal the captain felt himself being drawn on and gave the nursebeast gave an odd sort of hooting whinny and stuck a long pink wet tongue out and licked the little sprites and the leewit then the fluffy head sank down the little sprites gave unmistakably heartbroken cries the leewit said something tiredly even if they werent human there was no mistaking the incredulity on the faces of the sprite parents and hope on the faces of the little ones i told them shes going to be all right now with some rest i think we did the trick captain i could use some rest myself can you give us a hand to carry her into their home and then the littlest witch hugged him fiercely and so did goth and captain pausert once of the republic of nikkeldepain suddenly felt very good about the universe and his place in it pausert took one side vezzarn and the male sprite the other joining hands they lifted the fluffy thing and carried it down the passage while the little sprites the leewit and the mother rushed ahead and opened a door into what the captain presumed was the sprites apartment they three carried the nursebeast into a small entirely softupholstered room and put it down i guess ill skip whopping her said goth her little sister had flopped onto a chair with the small sprites on either side the leewit looked tired and pale this time anyway the leewit beckoned hey ive asked them for some food better make it something we can eat on the run said goth weve got to catch up with hantis before she does something silly shes very taken up with this high lord arvin and weve still got a job to do for karres getting her and pul to the imperial court before the winter carnival the leewit sighed i guess ill just ask for a few of the meatroll things then theyre pretty good and we can eat those while we go there followed a high speed exchange in the sprite language the two little sprites were still clinging onto the leewit from whom they had to be pried away by their parents i said wed see them and explain later and thanks for the food said the leewit phew i hadnt realized what hard work it is not to be the youngest once they got back into the corridor it was easy to work out where to go there was a steady stream of armed sprites heading in one direction word must have gotten around too because no one tried to stop the human party they ate as they walked the captain found he was both ravenous and tired and was grateful to his professional beggar niece she must have done a fair job of cleaning out the sprite familys pantry as well as expropriating some of their childrens clothes nalin had apparently retreated into the upper reaches of the castle as they got higher it became apparent that they were catching up on the fighting and that it had been fierce burned areas showed that the high lord had been forced to make his own path forward the air stank of smoke fear and the coppery smell of sprite blood captain pausert began to wonder if he should perhaps have left goth and the leewit with the grateful sprite family but the leewit reassured him they say its all over a small party cut their way out through the shutters and the rest are dead or captive and the high lord and the foreign lady are still alive oh and pul bit someone pul had indeed bitten someone lord nalin had not been one of those who got away the sprites moved aside to allow the captain through to hantis and the high lord arvin they say youre a hero captain said hantis her brown face had sooty smudges and a shallow scratch on it that you charged the barricades alone you know the captain thinks he has to look after us goths voice trailed off and it was hardly surprising lord nalin was on the ground in a circle of nervous spritesoldiers he was jerking and twitching and something that looked like gray dust was spilling out of him poisoned nanites said hantis grimly and the others was he the only one infected asked the captain both fascinated and revolted no at least seven of them got away they fled in the direction of delaron there was no expression in hantis voice we also have the infected but not yet controlled ones she patted high lord arvin on the shoulder high lord this one is safe but we must deal with the others we must sterilize their nest she turned back to pausert goth the leewit and vezzarn come see what were up against they went through into an adjoining room this did not look like it was a homeeven a warsmashed homeof the detail and decorconscious sprites instead the glass and bricabrac with which the sprites filled every spare corner had been carelessly swept together glass gold silver gems and crystal lay broken and jumbled in a trash pile on the floor lay some twentyseven sprites males females even a child their bodies convulsed every now and again their eyes were open and empty hantis saw how the high lord started when he saw the infected ones then he gave a cry of horror and would have run into the room if hantis had not restrained him you dont understand he said frantically trying to pull away from her hands hantis that is neirion there we must help her we are betrothed no my lord arvin said hantis it is you who do not understand that was your betrothed now she is just a crawling mass of nanites but we must get them out of her we must we cant we have found no way of doing so not without killing the victim anyway it is already too late she spoke as gently as she could knowing full well that it was this moment that had transformed the gentle young arvin into arvin warmaker who had halfdestroyed nartheby to save it and been cursed by generations unborn for his goodness and greatness you must destroy this with your klatha power destroy all of lord nalins chambers sterilize everything with cleansing fire it is the greatestthe onlymercy you can give to those infected hantis saw the anguish in the young high lords face i cant high lord arvin unless you would see all aloorn and indeed all nartheby like that you must our dominions are already lost without you we are too she paused and you do have the strength three thousand years later we still remember that you did chapter it had been a more comfortable rest than the last couple hed had captain pausert had to admit the sprites were treating them rather like royalty even if hantis said that they would still have to appear in the hall of stars before high lord arvin in the seat of judgment the next morning arvin was recovering from the immense amount of klatha energy hed expended if hantis was right he was also preparing to attack and destroy the neighboring principality as part of saving his species and the galaxy from the nanite plague that was all very well but the captain wanted to get back to saving his own species and the galaxy from the same plaguethree thousand years from now it was of course logical that it had to be saved earlier in order to have it around to save later but arvin seemed to have the matter in hand he was doing just fine and didnt need them at all other than some advice from hantis and the loan of pul as a stud but pausert was no nearer to solving his own problem of how to get them back the vatch was still around but it was keeping its distance the hall of stars was just as full as it had been the last time they had been there and once again they were in the gallery reserved for the accused but this time they were respectfully ushered into it its mostly a formality said hantis with slight unease it was all something of a misunderstanding but you did call the high lord names pointed out the leewit a bit selfrighteously you punched him in the belly too and you little lady did willfully destroy precious crystals some of which had been grown for more than five centuries in zerogravity hey the little squirts were going to fry us protested the leewit that takes some nerveyou calling anyone else a little squirt hantis smiled impishly its not that the high lord wants to punish us but sprite law is quite inflexible hell have to go through the motions if there are complainants then he has to act but now that the truth is being told arvin and the others are somewhat embarrassed no one will complain but it soon became apparent that although high lord arvin was content to let bygones be bygones some of the other sprites were not first the accusers got to speak theyre saying said the leewit with a frown that misunderstanding or no hantis insulted aloorns honor and we destroyed part of the ancient heritage of aloorn and that one is saying that the high lord is taking a strangers word and destroying part ofhey wait a minute i recognize him thats the one they called wellpo hes one of those three that kidnapped me ah said hantis i will ask the guard to take a message to the high lord i could tell he was lying but i thought that it was merely politics which is mostly lies you dont remember the name of the third kidnapper the leewit shook her head no she had a sharp chin and a pointy nose that was all i noticed well that means it could only be about any of the sprites said goth with a yawn the captain knew how she felt the proceedings were long and the seats comfortable enough to encourage a nap below them the arguments went back and forth and on and on rather like a slow foreign play in which the dialogue was the only important part then just as the captain was dropping off to sleep things suddenly got more interesting theyre grabbing old wellpo squeaked the leewit with delight said hed stick a knife into me oh look hes hit one of the high lords guards over the head pausert sat up and peered over the edge of the gallery there was quite a fracas going on in a gallery some ways down and further to his right and he noticed one going on across to their left that the leewit hadnt yet spotted he took her by the elbow and pointed that your lady with a pointy nose the hat of the lady in question had just been knocked off she was struggling with two of the high lords guards yep said the leewit in satisfaction i guess they got her too then her eyes narrowed and she whistled several pieces of expensive crystal in the far gallery shattered including a globe in the longnosed womans hand the sprites in the gallery scattered guess whatever was in there was pretty nasty said the leewit theyve still got her though she was one of those calling for retribution too said hantis with satisfaction the guard i sent to tell arvin about wellpo said that the high lord had instructed the guards to search his quarters i think they must have found something that incriminated her i think that this is all over even before those who would speak for us have their turn vatch hissed goth captain get ready pausert began hastily shaping hooks of klatha force with his mind and then realized that unless silvereyes needed to be tickled they wouldnt help why didnt you catch the big one it buzzed reproachfully i took a big chance teasing it big real thing it nearly caught me tooand then you let it get away it was too quick for me admitted the captain and i cant get close enough to it now its watching us but keeping its distance ive been trying to figure out how to either go after it or to get it to come closer the tiny vatch buzzed around amusing itself by doing a quick lightshift and making the underside of the gallery where they stood transparent why dont you hide where we cant see then the big one might come looking though it might just go away i suppose if the big vatch just went away theyd be stuck here in the past but they had to try something where can we hide though you seem to be able to find us across time and space theres a noplace right here big real thing where they make the stuff for the lights the place where up spins you could hide there where up spins the captain assumed silvereyes was talking about some kind of power plant he thought about it for a while where up spins a generator a spinning magnetic field that might make some sort of sense to a creatures like a vatch the crowded galleries began cheering whats going on out there asked the captain irritated that his train of thought had been disturbed hantis laughed weve got a lot more adherents than sprites who wish us illespecially as the chief detractor turned out to be a paid spy and possible murderer the fact that the leewit is a child and was kidnapped upset a lot of sprites the mother of young lisol and tahimmin has just finished speaking she was very eloquent on your behalf captain we sprites are protective of our young theyll be yelling for war now when they find out the infected ones have fled to delaron huh child said the leewit crossly i think ill whistle at em lisol and tahimmin are children me im an impossible brat said the captain with a smile a pintsized disasterinmotion other terms come to mind he pressed on before the leewit could do more than scowl now if theyll let us out of here i want to try getting out of historical nartheby before you go and destroy any more its ancient heritage is there a powergenerator room we can get to hantis she nodded but you will have to wait until high lord arvin rises from the seat of judgment while this matter will i think be speedily settled i believe there is a second item on the slate a question of property we sprites believe in finders keepers and there is a belief among a small party that you have expropriated their property captain property that they found and should be entitled to keep whats that asked pausert warily feeling in his pockets their pet said hantis with a perfectly straight face tahimmin and lisol aloorntaro have prevailed on their grandfather to enter a plea for its return they say it is skilled in playing games and good for defense besides all that it helped to fix their nursebeast so they want it back even if it does eat a lot it a toy huh ill fix them she began to purse her lips hastily the captain clamped his hand over her mouth hantis shook her head the demand will be denied of course this is just their grandfathers way of raising a public vote of gratitude to you leewit he is a powerful subclan head this is how you gave rise to your own name you know as well as saving two great ones among my people tahimmin aloorntaro is credited with much of the restoration and his sister is remembered as lisol the healer hantis smiled oddly it is a bit strange to see my own distant and famous ancestor as a very little girlsprite as you know the youngest daughter of my house is always called the leewit toll and threbus asked me for a good name for you so i offered them one of ours i never knew where it came from until now tahimmin and lisol never forgot you the latest of the universes leewits dissolved into tears the captain decided it was safe to remove his hand but he still did so a bit warily with the leewit you never knew chapter the power rooms of aloorn were hidden deep within the stalk of the castle they were heavily guarded both by ordinary and klatha means but with the high lord at their side those barriers were passed arvin had walked slowly talking to hantis both of them looking sad and serious from what the captain could work out it would be a grim time and hard tasks ahead for the young sprite lord for which hed get much blame and little credit down here underneath the huge humming turbines the captain hoped that they would be invisible to the vatches silvereyes certainly hadnt followed them the captain fashioned his hooks of klatha force for the big creature with heat like a kiss of the sun he put barbs on them and not threads of force but broad ropes of it this vatch wasnt going to get away if he could catch it at all they waited the sprites also had folk who could rell vatch and while the party from the venture had to disappear to make the creature of klatha force curious they could reappear in a hurry if the vatch came calling and it did the signal came down all right everybody onto the hoist go go go yelled the captain they tumbled onto the hoist and rushed upwards as they rose the captain became aware of the big vatch he flung those hooks of force flung them around and over the huge shifting cloud of vatch they hooked into the black energy swirls they hauled and tightened tighten more as much as we need to immobilize this one pull in hold it hold hard the vatch yowled green slitted eyes peered fearfully at him not again monster let me go not unless you do what i sayor ill tear you apart and short out your innards playing with us take us back to our ship and our time right now no wait lets finish things here properly let me see where those nanitepossessed ones fled to the towers that hantis had pointed out as fabled delaron sprang into view from the grayness that was vatchspace and then the elegant slim towers shrank and broadened the captain blinked there werent twenty of them just one this tower looked like the others hadonly this looked like it could be built with bricks and mortar it was impressive but not impossibly tall and looking insomehow as if he had xray vision he saw a group of sprites in an upper chamber once again his vision shifted as if he was now seeing into the sprites and he saw them as a seething mass of myriad tiny klatha black energy points all but three of those present in the upper chamber the nanites were klatha or klathausing creatures too and this was apparently what they looked like to a vatch pausert directed a bolt of dark energy torn from the mass of the great roiling thing that was the vatch at each of the nanitecreatures it absorbed the little sparks of klatha energy that were billions of nanites and consumed the bodies in gouts of incandescent heat he saw the three noninfected ones flee and then he finished the business with a explosive bolt of raw energy that simply vaporized the now empty upper stories of the tower that would do as a parting present for the safety of ancient nartheby if not arvins reputationsince hed be the one blamed for the destruction in the historical records now take us all back to our ship and then take the ship where i tell you pausert had already decided that if he caught the vatch hed have it take them to within a few hours of the imperial capital to great pathams seventh hell with all this mucking about in egger space the grayness whirled and surged even by the vatch standards of nondistance this place was far off and dark and then tumbling finally they were back in the venture but not the venture in the stillness of the void the venture on the expanding wild edge of matter the venture was being violently flung and rolled as a great tumbling tidal wave of energy and existence picked her up the ship was on the verge of breaking up torn between two states and sometimes existing in both her engines roared at full throttle and then cut out and then roared again gravity surged in waves that almost made the captain black out as he reached for the drive controls the engines cut again then free lightnings danced through the ship sparks zipped and sizzled the venture vibrated like some giant jawsharp nothing could survive the frontwave of singularity for long even the vatch was being battered and torn and so were the cables of pure force and the klatha hooks suddenly they were out of there the control panels were alive with flashing lights and the air in the control room was thick with smoke and the sound of damage alarms pausert fought with the controls realizing as he did so that his grip on the vatch was literally being torn away the vatch was so desperate to leave that it was willing to part with large pieces of itself in order to do so one of the control panels was actually on fire pausert just let the vatch go and focused all his attention on the damaged venture vezzarn had managed to get out of his acceleration couch and grab a fire extinguisher and spray the burning control panel but the power systems were running on emergency auxiliary now the lights dimmed and flickered the ventures main drive engines stuttered and hiccupped and were still unfortunately one auxiliary lateral rocket still firedeven though the automatic controls had it shut downand it spun the venture in a clumsy spiral the lights cut completely as the captain managed to shut the lateral down with one of the manual override switches there was an eerie silence a spaceship is never completely silent there is always some machinery running there is always some vibration even at the subliminal level spacers became inured to the roar of the main drive to the point where they just didnt notice it but when everything is still the ship is dying or dead the venture drifted like a derelict hulk inertia kept her on the slow spiral that the misfiring lateral had caused then the standby batteries cut in lighting only the emergency glows and the instrument readouts the air was thick with smoke burning the captains eyesthough not as much as the readouts from the instrument panel did pausert knew sadness and despair his ship was in no state to go anywhere the old venture would be lucky if it ever made another planetfall but he didnt let any of that show in his voice vezzarn better check the engine room give me a damage assessment as soon as possible goth check the air recycler hantis you and the leewit start collecting suits and get yourselves suited up then report back here the captain was already examining the control panels a navigation readout would be good too if weve got anything still operating that will pick up beacons the captain himself had already taken the small atomic powered lamp from the worktable and started undogging the access hatches to the control panels electronics boards the circuitry there was mostly solidstate but there were various plugin spares he could try ow he burned his hand and sucked his fingers while trying to work out what was going on the smoke didnt help he waved it away and continued to examine the boards he moved one and was rewarded with a shower of sparks at least there was still power even if patham himself didnt know what was shorting out what he took a deep breath coughed and let klatha guide his hands he pulled out one of the units part of it was melted and pausert dropped it hastily with a word he hoped the leewit wasnt near enough to hear he plugged the replacement unit from the spares compartment into the panel luckily it was a j and that was one of the modules the venture carried in case of emergencies he was rewarded by a buzzing sound and a redflickering in the darkened control room hastily pulling his head out of the control panel the captain was relieved to see that the flickering was caused by a bank of telltales flashing red the buzzing was stilled by flicking a switch or two and the telltales at least told him where to start looking there was life in the boards and that in itself was reassuring what wasnt was the sheer number of faults being registered there was a sudden comforting hum a vibration of machinery somewhere in the deepspacesilence of the venture the intercom crackled to life captain ive got the number two auxiliary running on manual we can draw power for the air recycler off that and some lights well done vezzarn whats the status of the rest of the engine room not good captain there was a pause we had a burnback weve lost part of the aft tubes the main drive i dont know yet captain it was not what pausert needed to hear he studied the telltales deciding what to do next goth came in got power to the air recycler again theyre working just fine captain well at least have this smoke dealt with pretty soon she went straight to the communicator and dialed the space beacon frequencies doesnt seem to be any life in the communicator system she said hang on you should have power now pausert pushed the module onto its pins and crossed his fingers there were stars out there the familiar river of light that was the milky way said that they were at least back in the right galaxybut exactly where and when they were was another matter the dials have lit up announced goth still not getting anything though try the general and imperial shiptoship channels the captain wrestled with a hot board that seemed to have soldered itself in place there was a vague crackly noise from the communicator might almost have been someone saying something said goth the captain more familiar with communicator problems felt some relief hed definitely picked up a word there in universum they were back in a familiar part of the galaxy in humanoccupied space i think we might also have lost our external aerials its a quick job to replace them uhhuh said goth well seeing as the leewits brought me a suit ill suitup and see to it youre busy and its just plugin plugout stuff since goth had moved herself into the venture shed taken on responsibility as naturally as a miffel grew winter fur to deal with the cold the girl was a fair way to becoming a competent shiphandler and her skill with navigation sometimes left the captain feeling embarrassed about his own ability anything else we can do captain asked the leewit a general check keep out of the engine room but do a damage assessment of the rest the captain went back to his work some of the boards could be bypassed some could be replaced it was a painstaking process that required him sticking his head under the console and then getting out again to check the readouts and displays proach on standard incoming lane three squawked the communicator goth must have replaced the aerials and they had communications and they couldnt be too far from a planet or refuel spacestation with space traffic that was a weight off his mind well weve broken some furniture and the electric butlers not working said the leewit cant see any big damage so far though captain and its not so smoky any more trust the leewit to check out the electric butler first that was the least of the captains worries right now the electric butler had always been a bit cranky and inclined to deliver ice cream when you asked for steak and sometimes deliver it to the control room floor with a cackle instead of to the small messroom hed worry about starving to death once theyd reestablished control and engine function thanks try the communicators on the beacon channel again whats the beam length r less than half a minute later the captain heard the beep of the beacon signal you want the trans transwatsisname captain asked the leewit transcription yes please its the green button on the right two minutes later the captain knew that he was back in his old stamping grounds he could have been home in the stuffy republic of nikkeldepain within three weeks ship time and the world of porlumma where hed once rescued three witchgirls from slavery lay just ahead now the captain only had two problems the first was simple enough to deal with certainly he and probably goth and the leewit were considered to be criminals on porlumma despite the fact that hed sent wansings jewels back to him well the venture could still travel under her ulduneobtained false papers as the evening bird he could go back to being captain aron of mulm and goth his niece dani they could come up with a suitable alias for the leewit and no papers would be needed as long as she didnt leave the ship but he wouldnt be surprised if there were wanted holovids all over the dock hed have to talk to goth about doing a suitable lightshift although he knew that was a tiring exercise to keep up the second problem was more immediate would the venture make it to the surface of porlumma at all the captain got up and went to inspect the engines for himself there was still several more hours work here on the control systems but he needed some tools from the engine room to get into some of the panels and besides what was the use in fixing control and navigation systems if the engines werent usable at least they were within easy reach of porlumma by lifeboat if worse came to worst down in the engine room the captain found vezzarn hard at work on the main drive might get three of her tubes functional captain but theyre none of them going to be calibrated right ive adjusted the thrust settings as best i can for the situation the main drive itself well shes working but for how long i cant say well be lucky if we get a lightyear out of her and i dont know if the damage can really be repaired at all shell need to be seen by the engineers the tubes themselves are a writeoff well said the captain comfortingly luckily enough were within three lighthours of an empire world its a backwater but theyll have repair facilities if i can get her down in this state that is going to be tricky landing captain but youll pull it off vezzarn seemed more cheerful now that he knew there was an empire world within reach ill do my best is there anything i can do for you down here otherwise i need to get back to the navigation and control systems theres a ton of work up there to make them operational never mind fit to handle a dicey landing ill be fine captain with respect sir ive probably worked on more tubes than you have if you like you could send one of the girls down to pass me things and it would make my day if i could have a cup of coffee with this job the electric butlers on the fritz but ill ask the leewit to come down here i want goth up there for navigation vezzarn actually laughed something that would have been unthinkable minutes before that electric butler is probably the one bit of this ship i wouldnt mind seeing in the state that these engines are in they didnt like those surges captain thats not going to happen again is it he asked warily not if i can help it the captain went back up to the control room after several grueling and often frustrating hours of peering at manuals and working in awkward confined spaces pausert had repaired or replaced what he could of the control system and juryrigged as best as possible whatever couldnt be repaired then vezzarn and he went through an extremely cautious test firing of the main drive at a very reduced capacity the drive could push the venture onwards to porlumma she began the slow limp to port what would have taken hours would take her the better part of a shipday and the captain knew hed have as tricky a landing as hed ever managed to pull off at the end of it it was nearly enough to get him to consider the egger route again nearly the captain went off to shower and returned to find that the now inevitable poker school had taken over the navigation table again he was glad that he had the excuse of wanting to keep an eye on the instruments and do some calculations for the landing he already owed the leewit too much candy to be good for her goth said that his problem with playing with the leewit was that he didnt really want to win pausert knew it was true enough but using klatha powers on the two young witches would seem unfair even if he was sure that the leewit had somehow marked the agandars cards chapter wiping the sweat from his brow the captain exhaled long and slowly if he could bottle that landing he could sell it as the perfect instant diet pausert thought that hed probably lost fifteen pounds on the way down at least ten of them had simply melted away when one of the remaining tubes lost half its liner seconds before setdown and yet hed managed it near to a textbook perfect landing in fact now so long as porlummas authorities didnt recognize them all they had to do was get the venture repaired and get back into space again once they were out of detector range theyd have to make use of the sheewash drive to get to the imperial capital in time but according to the calendar of the customs official who was coming to give the evening bird the onceover they still had ten days the question of course was whether they could get the venture repaired and spaceborne before then even with the sheewash drive it was going to be a close thing the engineer from saltash and gryfin ltd was not encouraging the tubes will have to come out entirely captain aron theyre just about completely shot and half of the instrumentation needs to be junked the fact that you managed to set your ship down without leaving a crater in the landing field fills me with admiration for your skill as a pilot though i have grave doubts about your common sense ill let you have a quote in the morning but brace yourself for something steep frankly if you could afford it it would make more sense to haul your drive out and scrap it captain pausert sucked breath through his teeth he was painfully aware that the ventures current bank balance was comfortable enough for regular running but not really in good shape for massive repair bills how steep is something steep and how long is this going to take he asked warily ive got a contract to fulfill and its got really harsh noncompletion clauses well need to make this a rush job the engineer grimaced captain ive never seen engines or even control systems that have taken this kind of battering and still functioned and i was once a navy engineer whatd you do pick a fight with a neutron star ive seen craft towed in from battles that looked better ill give you a precise figure as soon as i can but were talking the better part of half a million maels im guessing and to reengineer and recalibrate the engine call it three weeks its a big job oh the captain sat down so by the sudden dent on the couch beside him did goth shed plainly been keeping an eye on the engineer while she was in noshape well said the captain weakly will you get back to us with the exact quote the engineer nodded as soon as ive done the calculations captain aron but as i said its a big job he left the captain and goth to stare at each other in despair a half a million maels and you know what these repair quotes are like said the captain gloomily never under goth was already calculating weve got about three hundred and fifty thousand maels left in the account and we can run into the red another fifty thousand or so well be a long way short captain and i just dont see how we can get hantis and pul to the imperial capital in time if its going to take them that long itd be quicker to haul the engines out and put a new drive in they could do that in a couple of days well then thats what we need to do said goth decisively the captain shook his head if we had a couple of spare million we could do it and stop thinking of wansings jewels goth theyd catch us for sure and besides its not right its an emergency captain said goth thoughtfully by now her reserved manner fooled him not at all the captain knew that she was thinking seriously about larceny well to be honest so was he they had a vital mission to complete after all but it still went against his grain he sighed give me a few minutes to think we must have some way of raising the money i could go and play some poker said the leewit appearing from behind the couch the agandars cards in her hand i suspect they might think that they were marked child said the captain managing at least half a smile oh they are said the leewit cheerfully look here on the edges she dealt a card out face up see that pattern around the edge its different on some of them lisol and tahimmin spotted it back on nartheby those sprites have got sharp eyes but thats on the face of the cards thats no good its got to be on the edges or on the backs goth was betraying more knowledge of cardsharping than the captain would have expected the leewit snorted so why is the royal flush marked then smarty the captain felt that odd scalpcrawling sensation that he got from klatha events he reached slowly for the cards not he said in a hushed voice to enable the previous owner to cheat at cards what said goth puzzled the captain looked at the two of them and dealing the cards out face up separated out the suits just who was the previous owner of this pack of cards he asked the agandar criminy you mean yes said the captain sorting the suits into order i think this pack of cards that the leewit has been carrying around in her pocket is what the agandars pirates were looking for all along he drew the royal flush out of each suit and laid them out i think im sure the answer is right here right in front of our eyes he stared intently at the picturecards patterns imported centuries ago from old yarthe that had altered gradually over the centuries the agandar had been on uldune bloodyhistoried uldune the world whose pirate fleets had once spread fear and terror across a huge sector of the galaxy the world that had turned from piracy and raiding to become the clearing house of half the dubious merchandise in the galaxy a place that still welcomed pirates at least successful ones why had the agandar been on uldune to follow up the rumor of a new spacedrive or had he been on uldune anyway for another purposewhen his spies had brought him the rumor that the venture was being renamed the evening bird by courtesy of the daals highly efficient staff of forgers uldune still welcomed pirates successful pirates it provided among other services a fence for stolen goods and banking the pirates of ancient history hid their loot in secret hoards on desert islands but the modern pirate was more likely to use a bank vault or a numbered private account kleesps accomplice had actually said as much pausert was willing to bet that the cards in front of him held the key to just such a numbered account but the question was how he studied the pattern on the edge of the cards it was a simple repeatpattern handpainted and skillfully so but still nothing more than that at least as far as he could see ill bet its supposed to give us the numbers of the agandars bank accounts probably with the daals bank but for the life of me i cant see what the numbers could be i suppose you could count which number of the repeat pattern was wrong but what order would they go in he picked up the four sets of marked suits see he said dealing them out again there are sixteen repeats of this pattern on the top margin each one of these cards has a different one of those repeats altered he moved the cards around arranging them in the order of the altered repeat pattern on the top edge we can make pretty patterns but they dont ulp as he laid the last card in the row the altered patterns linked up there was a brief hum and a small hyperelectronic screen and keypad appeared above the cards letters began forming on the screen enter access code they arent cards at all whispered the captain its a hyperelectronic computer those are circuits not just patterns and a minisubradio said goth no wonder the agandar was able to keep in touch with his fleet the captain shook his head incredulously he even said he had a secret shielded transmitter the sheem robot was also hyperelectronic we should have guessed only question is whats the access code asked the leewit then a little plaintively and when do i get my cards back thats two questions said the captain and i dont know either answer enter code within the next thirty seconds or i guess we dont dare find out muttered the captain i need to be lucky i need every ounce of klatha power he took a deep breath and began to type a sequence of numbers nothing happened five seconds hit enter said goth code accepted destruct program aborted a menu popped up a very ordinary menu of choices including subradio banking pausert exhaled slowly then accessed the subradio banking option i think he said the leewits cards have given us the jackpot lets see if we can transfer enough into my account to allow us to simply buy new engines and forget about repairs thatll be a lot faster when the figures came up the leewit whistled softly we could buy a whole new ship said goth buy a whole clumping fleet exclaimed her sister the captain shook his head the paperwork would take longer and attract more attention than a repair job besides i like the old venture shes been places with us that no new ship would ever have coped with but when this is all over and we decide what to do with whats left of the agandars fortuneafter we track down those of his victims we can tracei will promise you both a refit and a redecoration of your cabins and fifty decks of cards for the leewit want that one said the leewit pointing always knew those were my lucky cards hmm i was thinking about that share in the petey byrum and keep said goth thoughtfully chapter even spending money like water it took three days to get the evening bird ready for space again the captain was nervous every minute of that time because he knew that the amount of money they were spending was sure to get someone from the iss interested before too long so the minute the preflight checks were done pausert lifted the venture as if to make up for his brilliant landing on juryrigged controls and with a mere three battered tubes the takeoff was one of his worst still they were spaceborne before the authorities figured out just who had been spending rivers of money on little porlumma there were going to be some red faces if they ever they found out that theyd put in new engines for the infamous captain pausert whose vid still graced porlumma customs control offices still in fairness they could say that captain aron from faroff mulm had looked nothing like the vidpicture the sternvisaged planarfaced aron bore no resemblance at all to the images of the cheerful criminal pausert right said the captain to his two witches the time has come to show me how to work the sheewash drive i feel im ready huh otherwise well have to hit you over the head or something said the leewit cheekily im not going to do it with you dragging us back like a big rock again thats for sure only if you promise me youll stick to the pattern exactly this time captain said goth sternly so goth and leewit talked the captain through the pattern as it was developing the captain thought he saw where it could be done differently but this time he stuck exactly to the pattern as goth and the leewit presented it they kept it up for a mere fifteen seconds the captain was sweating and beginning to feel as if the entire weight of the venture was pressing onto his shoulders when goth said enough whew said the captain it sure does take it out of you uhhuh come on lets eat they walked through to the mess the captain found that hantis had had the forethought to order the new electric butler to make them a substantial lunch it was more reliable than the old electric butler but hed gotten used to the way the old one used to burn the eggs how did i do he asked wedid pretty good said the leewit talking with her mouth halffull goth swallowed and started loading up another huge forkful she looked sideways at him with those big brown eyes told you the captain is a hot witch captain pausert concentrated on adding food to a stomach that was telling him hed been starving for a while after hed got to his third plateful he said you know when we were doing the klatha patternthe part where we sort of plait those strands of lighti thought well if we both witches started to giggle in the leewits case as she had a mouthful of juice the captain had to pat her on the back while goth fetched a pile of napkins told you so said goth to the leewit good thing you didnt try it said the leewit sternly the captain held up his hands but it felt like it would work and i have worked out new klatha stuff that did goth grinned at the leewit like our egger trip or those clumping cocoon shields said the leewit snorting toll was so right goth the captain began to feel more than a little irritated sure theyd had some misadventures here and there but he didnt have a guiding pattern in his head i worked out how to do klatha hooks and the vatchhandling all by myself and the cocoon shields might have been awkward to get you out of but they worked they worked pretty well oh they work all right captain except goth scowled when you leave me behind and attack hundreds of sprites on your own they just dont work the same way that most of the witches of karres do things thats what toll said when maleen suggested youd need a pattern to teach you she said you were better off learning to do them on your own and maybe seeing them in new ways so maleen and some of the other premotes did some work on it came out they agreed with toll came out they thought we wouldnt survive if you were taught so weve had to let you blunder along sometimes i wondered if we would survive because you werent trained but it seems like youre pretty lucky so far captain its hairraising though but dont do any more sperimetal twists while were linked said the leewit shaking her finger at him the captain smiled at her experimental not even little ones no both of them said firmly it was somehow comforting to discover that karres had not just turned him loose untrained without consideration of the matter he could see the point to some extent a schooled witch would tend to approach things in the way in which they had been taught coming at it cold he had a rather different perspective and had come up with different but effective answers even if some of themhad been rather hairraising just that little burst of the three of them working together at the sheewash drive had shortened their journey by several weeks the captain had added considerable power to the drive as they saw when they picked up beacons on the communicator the journey from porlumma to the imperial capital would now take four days instead of nearly three weeks the trip wasnt entirely peaceful though the captain was awakened from his sleep by an intercom call from goth captain youd better get here quick she was laughing as she said it but the leewit was yelling in the background so he had a pretty good idea what the problem was he was quite right it was silvereyes who was as usual tormenting the leewit the little vatch gave up the moment the captain arrived and buzzed affectionately around him hello big dream thing ooh did you ever give that big bully a hidingcan i bring some more big ones theyre scared of you the thought was enough to make the captain shudder some vatches like silvereyes itself couldnt be handled the next big one might be the sameonly much more powerful not right now i dont want to frighten them all off that seemed to amuse the little vatch guess so that last big one is making a lot of noise about it the others are mostly laughing though there are a lot of others pausert felt weak at the thought oh sure little ones like me lots and lots not so many big ones but ill be a big one too some day you wait and see im already a little bigger now from eating that dreamcandy having seen the nanites from a vatch perspective the captain thought that he knew what silvereyes was talking about lots of it inside dreampeople yep but theyre dreamnotpeople theyre not there just the candy is it sorts of thinks together to be a pretenddreampeople the vatch obviously getting bored with all this conversation went back to tormenting the leewit in the interests of peace tranquility and the noise levels in deep space the captain had to tickle the vatch with klatha hooks to get it to go away when they entered the area around the capital planet pausert discovered that the new drive fitted on porlumma had one other serious advantage the signature of this engine was quite unlike the one that the iss was hunting for they passed unmolested through the cordon and went peacefully onward towards the great spaceport at the empires heart whats the program hantis the captain asked as they drifted in to land along with the thousands and thousands of other ships that were here for the empires biggest annual event the sprite made a face the witches have cooperated for some time with hailie but the empress is in quite a precarious position as you know something like open contact with the witches of karres could be the final straw to give her enemies the leverage to insist that she step down her stepson would jump at the opportunity so the contacts are very secret we have a rendezvous point at the nenbutal grillits an eatery on the portside of town i give a certain password and things will be taken from there hmm the captain rubbed his chin thoughtfully i think wed better all go along with you an escort will be welcome we can pretend to be a mere party of diners so once the ship had docked and port formalities and customs had been dealt with the entire crew of the venture with her special passengers took a cab into the town heading for the nenbutal grill pausert was relieved to think that his responsibilities were almost over it had been a tougher mission than hed anticipated when hed cheerfully taken it on back on emris but it was finally nearing completion however when they stepped out of the cab into the cold evening air pul took a deep sniff of the warm steamy aromas coming out of the halftimbered restaurant and suddenly evinced a desire to visit a lamppost further up the street hantis followed him holding his leash hantis came back a few moments later trailing the stocky yellow grikdog my dear captain she said coolly im really not feeling at all well and the smell of that nenbutal food has quite put me off i dont believe ill dine after all will you call me another cab to take me back to my hotel captain pausert fumbled for words ah certainly maam i think well accompany you to tell the truth im not all that fond of nenbutal food myself and he hailed a passing cab back at the huge spaceport the captain waited until he was sure they were quite alone what was wrong pul smelled nanites said hantis worriedly i think that the rendezvous must have been discovered pretty sure maam said vezzarn something else smelled about that restaurant too and i dont mean the food or these nanites i looked in through the window and those diners just didnt look right you know why no wine you ever been to a nenbutal place where they havent served more wine than food i wonder what effect alcohol or other drugs would have on nanitecontrolled people said the captain i guess it might make those bodies harder to handle probably hantis agreed but what do i do now a plump woman with gray hair and a rather frumpish uniform approached them pardon me sirs and ladies but your coach has arrived the captain was about to point out that theyd not ordered a coach when the woman continued you are the party i am waiting for from nikkeldepain id venture to guess sir the captain realized suddenly that it was hulik do eldel hulik made up as an older woman and padded out to change her shape uh thats us if you would follow me sir ten minutes later after a series of maneuvers designed to shake off any pursuit they were sitting in the thunderbird with the daal of uldune or rather with two of the six sedmons your ship is under surveillance a large party of iss operatives went out there shortly after you left weve been monitoring all incoming ships of the right sizeclass as we were pretty sure the vessels appearance would be subtly altered it took us a little time to get thereand we nearly ran into the iss ourselves continued the other they were probably mounting the same kind of operation and the restaurant we were supposed to use as a rendezvous is full of nanites said pausert i think there was a severe security leak but the real question is what do we do now weve got no way of contacting the empress one of the sedmons coughed we have an official invitation to the carnival ball as usual as part of the entertainment there is to be a cultural display from various planets in the empire organized by the ministry for arts and cultures folk dances traditional singing apparently a display of fireeating and stiltfighting goth was the first to catch on is the petey b in port the sedmons nodded in unison we have certain associates in town we believe a substitution could be arranged the ministry for arts and cultures is not terribly well organized in the meanwhile the iss is searching for you said hulik weve arranged that you will disappear we have a comfortably appointed warehouse on the northern edge of the port himbo petey will be brought to see you you may leave the arrangements to us better send dame ethulassia too said goth thoughtfully well need to raid her wardrobe chapter so that was how the captain found himself sweating in the uniform of a slalonican peasant festival dancer the puffy sleeves would have been ideal to hide a mark in but naturally theyd all been thoroughly scanned for weaponry before being allowed into the imperial complex even here they were totally isolated from the actual guests and nobility of the empire and of course the imperial house themselves the dances and displays took place on a stage with an unobtrusive moat separating the mere entertainers from the jeweled and masked butterflies of the imperial court that moat the sedmons had explained was actually a killzone it had everything from spikes to detectors connected to sonic fibrilators to several imperial household bodyguards with heavy weapons all to forestall a wouldbe folk dancer assassin they were locked into their sectionand the only official way out was through a long passage that led to gates outside the main compound emperor koloth was taking no chances that the traditional winter carnival would lead to his death the way it had to the death of his uncle the emperor tarabian there was however a door which no one was supposed to know about the emperor justino had had a secret way made to the dressing rooms so that he could visit his mistress who had been a tslingdancer from ambars world it was of course securely locked the empress hailie would be at the ball as would her stepson the emperor first there would be the dancing and the entertainments and then the imperial house would go out to the grand balcony for the people and the vids outside in the imperial city the revelry was noisy and cheerful with music and dancing fireworks and the drinking of loyal toasts it wouldnt even pause until the emperor and his retinue appeared on the stroke of midnight on the grand balcony to accept the adulation of his people inside the grand ballroom the royal orchestra played ancient music on traditional instrumentsvery badly to the captains ear it didnt matter much as the masked courtiers werent letting appreciation of it spoil their cultivated languid boredom or their gossip how is vezzarn doing with that lock captain pausert was living in mortal fear that he might have to dance the pinstriped kilt and wooden shoes might be traditional dress on slalonica but as far as the captain was concerned they made him feel very foolish not to mention clumsy fine he said another five minutes said a stilt dancer from kota she was a pretty little blonde with gray eyes thats what he said five minutes ago grumbled pausert well it still looks like you wont actually have to dance captain goth was dressed up in the red and green paint of the mardaban fireeaters ive got your eveningdress ported into the changing rooms and a lovely mask captain pausert was going to accompany hantis whod be wearing her fabulously expensive tozzami fur coat lelaundel tippet and a gorgeous beaked mask the captains costume especially his own mask was designed to match the mask had jewels on it lots of them and the captain didnt think any were fake he decided not to ask where the jewels had come from thered be time enough later for his stern lectures on property and moral probity has anyone got the empress picked out yet he asked we think shes the one in the gold lame with the feathers said hulik but thats the whole point of the masked ball captain the idea is to let the imperial house mingle with their courtiers stupid grumbled pul you can tell who anyone is by smell anyway and that lot reek of nanite ill tell you soon enough which one is the empress i was given her scarf to sniff once its open said the small spacer lots of dream candy out there said a little silvereyed menace suddenly dont cause trouble now please begged the captain hastily why did this vatch have to keep coming back lets go captain said hantis he offered the sprite his arm and she rested one elegant gloved hand on it pul had been decorated as much as possible to make the grikdog appear to be a pampered ladys toy not even to be left behind at a social occasion the grikdog looked more sour than usual about the pink bows and the jewelencrusted leash they slipped out and were soon weaving their way between the emperors guests the masked dancers were subjected to puls nasal enquiry the feathered gold lame likewise none of them were the person they were looking for at length they came to a small woman with a simply cut azure silk gown and a butterfly mask sitting quietly in an alcove a couple of other guests lounged around nearby considerably bulkier ones pul nodded and tugged at his leash one of the two large men got up ever so unobtrusively pausert knew then that they had the right person your imperial highness said hantis quietly i have been sent to you by our mutual friends of the house serrak lady hantis of aloorn i assume said the woman in the butterfly mask its all right jaime these are our last remaining friends although i think they have come too late in a few minutes i will have to take my place on the dais with my stepson or the thing that is pretending to be my stepson and then the nanites will have me at last you know about the nanites your highness asked pausert puzzled she gave a low sad laugh why do you think i sent word to karres that i needed help oh the captain felt rather stupid i wasnt told all the facts maam she laughed again that old need to know business i wonder how many more disasters occur than are avoided by keeping agents in the dark i realize that karres is in strict quarantine but i have been hoping for rescue by witches coming thrumming down the egger route but according to the last communication i had the only hope they had been able to come up with for the empire was one captain pausert and a companion by the name of goth their best premotors all agreed on that they also agreed on there being a very low probability of successless than a one in five chance that he would get here but if he did that he would have discovered how to deal with the plague i dont suppose your companion would be captain pausert lady hantis er yes said the captain uncomfortably i am captain pausert your highness and goth is with me he bowed now that he thought about it it was all rather obvious the witches could if theyd wanted to have reached the empress via the egger route pul was indeed effective against nanites but there was a limited amount of venom in one grikdog and the empress hadnt needed hantis to tell her about the nanites the empress inclined her head at him and have you worked out how to deal with the nanites captain a number of pieces fell into place in the puzzle in pauserts head the mission hadnt been about hantis and pul after all it had been about goth and himself then this was all a teaching device he demanded of hantis say rather a learning device she replied threbus detected unusual klatha skills in you when he ran the tests you affect adult witches enormously with your klatha gathering but you dont appear to affect nonhumans or childrenwhich is the reason i was sent on this mission as your minder you are a klathaforce lighthouse captain the best premotors on karres worked on youand found that you obscured their results when fate said that you had to die you changed the rules they tried various future models the predictors always came up with the same answer allow him certain factors and allow him to evolve then they worked on what the best factors would be do not imagine that any of your companions are here by accident huh they could have told us said a voice close to his ear the empress and her bodyguards jumped only slightly more than the captain goth he muttered i should have guessed noshape and where is the leewit the servant with the canapes said goth we couldnt let you out on your own captain the empress shoulders shook slightly well captain it appears that you inspire loyalty and great faith so have you the answer we need in less than twenty minutes i will need to take my seat among the imperial house who are we believe naniteinvaded to the last person if i fail to do so i will undoubtedly be stripped of amras regency my influence and my daughter will disappear and the empire will slowly be devoured by the nanites eventually all humanity as well knowing that what he needed desperately was to think captain pausert felt as if his brain had turned into cheese what had he learned what klatha skills had he evolved he suspected that he could use the egger route without the shaking hed learned how to do the sheewash drive what else well there was the cocoon shields hed bet theyd be proof against nanites or anything else and there was that too betting itself hed always been a lucky gambler goth had put her finger on it he always won if he really wanted to when it came to the pinch hed gambled on the sequence of the cards being the access number for the agandars accounts and hed been right hed known he was right and yet it had needed goth too to put the final key in to it the predictors had said that it would take goth and himself goth he said quietly come and put your hand on my shoulder lend me your strength as we did for the leewit when she helped the nursebeast be the key the moment he said it the same hairraising prickle that came with massive klatha use surged around him this was right he knew it knew it with a castiron certainty he felt goths handsno both armsand not on his shoulder but around his neck hugging him so what is the answer goth what can i do that karres had to send us on this harebrained mission to learn its got to be the vatches captain goths voice whispered in his ear or at least little silvereyes ive never heard of anyone having a vatch that they play with instead of the other way around have you noticed that it always seems to come when you think of it i dont usually want the pesky critter it likes you captain same as the leewit does and i think you do like silvereyes sort of deep inside silvereyes was very like the leewit now that pausert thought about it annoying mischievous and capricious demanding too and true enough the captain had a soft spot for both of them the vatchlet and the leewit did things hed often wished to do himself i suppose so but i cant see why it would like me goth you protect it you frighten off the big ones the captain felt something dawn in him and it regards nanites as dreamcandy call silvereyes captain said goth with a calm tolllike certainty he did and the little vatchlet came like the sound of violets like the smell of music well big real thing what do you want make that ladys mask disappear no what i want you to do is to eat dream candy all of it thats here every last piece the vatchlet emanated a definitely dubious feeling i dont know the last time i did that i got sick so much for that idea the little vatchs worries were unwarranted since pausert was now sure that it had been puls venom which had made it feel ill not the nanites themselves but how could he convince silvereyes of that the leewit too consumed with curiosity to stay away any longer came over with her tray what are you doing here stinkin little thing she hissed silvereyes giggled been playing with the others but theyre not as much fun as you are the others you say said the captain to hantis that im like a klatha lighthouse threbusgoth tooonce said that would attract vatches to me yes captain said the sprite threbus told me that you glowed so call the vatches captain said goth the big ones are scared of him said silvereyes proudly and proprietarily levitating a canape to drop down a stately dancers neck ignoring the shriek the captain asked would the little ones come if i invited them you said there were many of them sure they only stay away from dream things because the big ones chase them but its like i said the big ones are scared of you captain pausert felt that absolute gamblers certainty settling over him this was the answer hed been hunting for he took a deep breath and concentrated on summoning them across time and space later when she was called on to describe the event the leewit hit on it perfectly imagine the biggest messiest kids party ever times ten the captain was amazed at the number of little vatches who came still there was enough dreamcandy for all of them to gorge on which they did except for silvereyes that little vatchnot quite so little anymorewas too wary to do more than nibble a bit so silvereyes amused itself with canape bombing runs there were entire buffets full of ammunition only one of the nanitepossessed came close to them pul bit him it was not a pretty sight one of the bodyguards dragged the writhing man away you could tell who the infected ones were without puls help they were the ones collapsing all over the place the rest were screaming and running around in the foodfight and practical joke session to end all food fight and practical joke sessions admittedly the victims werent enjoying it much but none of them was going to end up dead which was what the captain had rather expected after the experiences in nartheby they just looked like the victims of canape carpet bombing the leewit stood it as long she could then she grabbed a platter of the stickiest canapes and announced to the captain that she was going to join in no fair that the stinkin vatches have all the fun the captain grinned why not you will never get such a chance again food fight at the imperial gala event of the year pul had walked cautiously over to one of the collapsed figures sniffed no live ones he growled in his gravelcrusher voice the human is still alive though he wont be for long they have to be alive said the empress turning pale if they dont appear on the balcony at midnight well have panic across the empire insurrections war why did it never get any simpler lets examine him said the captain maybe he and the bodyguard hauled the courtier into the alcove he was breathing normally although his pulse was racing he was also deeply unconscious it was obvious to pausert that there would be no way to simply prop him up on the balcony and fool anyone into thinking he was anything but comatose a man in evening dress walked over good evening captain said sedmon your highness the empress had retreated behind her two bodyguards who is this captain the daal of uldune maam said the captain he decided there was no point in explaining that it was actually onesixth of the daal sedmon bowed hulik wants to know whether you need assistance the artistes of the petey b are ready to intervene although it appears that what is really being affronted out there is dignity he looked at the chaos and smiled wryly weve noted that uldune wants no part in a fight with the witches of karres if this is what the three of you alone can do unless they want to get in the middle of this mess i think not dame ethy would never forgive us for getting pink turofish mousse on the costumes we need to get these men back to their senses by midnight sedmon give that appearance at least sedmon looked thoughtful or uldune is in a remarkable position to possibly profit said the descendant of the pirate overlords urbanely not everyone will miss the empire captain captain pausert realized it was up to him again but the gamblers certainty was back i would he said firmly not the empire as such sedmon but the stability and peace it brings to ordinary peoples lives were not going to start the war years war centuries again and before you think of taking advantage of the situationi suggest you remember just who you are dealing with karres is not destroyed or even gone for long ill have your cooperation or uldune will be fighting the witches of karres look around you and be warned this is what we do in mere play dont make us do things in earnest now tell the other sedmon that we need dame ethy to go through her wardrobes for regal gear she and her troupe are about to play the role of their lives in the case of richard cravan an imperial one then he walked out onto the ballroom floor accompanied by goth he clapped his hands vatches began swarming around him all of them were tiny but there were so many they seemed like a curtain of impossible blackness the party is over thank you all for coming please come again now go home the vatchlets squawked vehement protest pausert began forming vatch hooks great big glowing terrible vatch hooks that had the same salutary effect on the vatchlets as a father brandishing a great big terrible leather belt before his human brats quickly the blackness receded silence settled over the ruined ballroom and then the orchestra those who still had whole instruments began to play of all things an ancient lullaby the empress took off her mask and walked up onto the dais she held up her hands to hush the crowd the hysterical panicfilled babble subsided as they turned to stare at empress hailie my lords and ladies control yourselves she said firmly we have an empire to save we have the imperial appearance to make at midnight if it doesnt happen you know what the consequences are sure to be so masks off courtiers and to work if the emperor himself isnt fit to appear on that balcony ill find someone else to stand in his shoes for the night and wear the crown and wave to his people but the people of the empire will see what they expect to see the empire will go on then when that is dealt with well put things to rights here dame ethulassia finally got both the audience and the applause shed always craved richard cravan found himself wearing imperial regalia and playing the role of a lifetime in later years it was said that was the winter canival when the emperor had given his most regal speech ever though the leewit didnt think so clumping stupid you ask me there wasnt any wind blowing at all and even if there had been he didnt have to say that crude stuff about wind cracking its cheeks the leewit was genuinely affronted huh its not fair if id said it youd be washing my mouth out with soap epilogue things still had to carry on and be finished off hantis however wouldnt be part of it she was dead keen to leave for nartheby i have a great deal to rebuild a great deal of history to see revisited i made an arrangement with my ancestor before we left hes hidden all his records in a secret chamber under the seat of justice in aloorn someone is finally about to receive the honor he deserved the captain realized just how closely they had been monitoredsomehow presumably with yet another branch of klatha he hadnt exploredwhen a few minutes after the midnight ceremony a delegation of witches arrived in the banquet hall pausert had no idea how theyd gotten there thered been none of the telltale signs of the egger route there was a lot of hugging as toll was reunited with her daughters pausert was grateful to see that his great uncle threbus had come to take control of the situation among those the witches had brought with them were a squad of healers such as the leewit would be one day they took charge of the unconscious victims of the nanite plague it appears that the petey bs thespian troupe will have to remain here for some years said threbus later as he and pausert walked in the cool green gardens of the empressregents palace to keep the masquerade going until amra is old enough to ascend the throne herself pausert winced no hope of saving any of the people infected threbus shrugged a fewthose who were infected at the carnival itself but not all that many it doesnt take long for the mind of the victim to be wrecked beyond repair pausert wasnt really surprised he tried to find what comfort there was well i guess that means cravan and ethys troupe will have to be given official status the empress players something like that no other way to explain why a showboat would remain here for years theyll like that even if theyll complain constantly that they miss their wandering ways threbus nodded and look on the bright side the empress has firmly cemented her position as the power behind the throne since the throne is now nothing more than an actor playing a role and shes gained the respect and leverage she needs over the bulk of the nobility he patted pausert on the shoulder karres is proud of you grandnephew you came through at the end with flying colors i wasnt inclined to forgive you at first threbus said the captain heavily but i suppose you risked a great deal too the karres witch nodded two of my daughters pausert two of those i love most dearly he sighed it was a highrisk option but all our predictors said it was the only alternative to a long and terrible war just as the sprites once fought now we have an answer you and the little vatches weve bought time and can find other ways of dealing with the problem without killing people goth came to join them as she drew alongside she slid her arm around pauserts waist and hugged him tightly he placed his large hand on her little one and gave it an affectionate squeeze there was a time when the captain would have been a little surprised at how easily and naturally that movement came to both of them but no longer again he found himself wishing that klatha could somehow be used to affect aging threbus was smiling time passes nephew trust me the smug expression on his face combined with the serene look on goths aroused pauserts natural contrariness ha you two knowitalls i remind you that you also predicted something very good would happen to goth if she spent the next year in my company so what is it alas threbus still looked every bit as smug and goths serenity seemed completely unfazed she gave pausert that sidelong glance hed come to know so well the year isnt up yet captain she murmured pausert tried to think of a suitable reply but couldnt then he caught sight of a pair of slitty silver eyes and then another and another and more the cure may just be worse than the disease threbus he said with a grin here we go again
