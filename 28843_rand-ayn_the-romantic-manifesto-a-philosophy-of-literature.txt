ayn rand the romantic manifesto a philosophy of literature revised edition this manifesto is not issued in the name of an organization or a movement i speak only for myself there is no romantic movement today if there is to be one in the art of the future this book will have helped it to come into being introduction the dictionary definition of manifesto is a public declaration of intentions opinions objectives or motives as one issued by a government sovereign or organization the random house dictionary of the english language college edition i must state therefore that this manifesto is not issued in the name of an organization or a movement i speak only for myself there is no romantic movement today if there is to be one in the art of the future this book will have helped it to come into being according to my philosophy one must not express intentions opinions objectives or motives without stating ones reasons for themie without identifying their basis in reality therefore the actual manifestothe declaration of my personal objectives or motivesis at the end of this book after the presentation of the theoretical grounds that entitle me to these particular objectives and motives the declaration is in chapter the goal of my writing and partly in chapter introduction to ninetythree those who feel that art is outside the province of reason would be well advised to leave this book alone it is not for them those who know that nothing is outside the province of reason will find in this book the base of a rational esthetics it is the absence of such a base that has made todays obscenely grotesque degradation of art possible to quote from chapter the destruction of romanticism in estheticslike the destruction of individualism in ethics or of capitalism in politicswas made possible by philosophical default in all three cases the nature of the fundamental values involved had never been defined explicitly the issues were fought in terms of nonessentials and the values were destroyed by men who did not know what they were losing or why in regard to romanticism i have often thought that i am a bridge from the unidentified past to the future as a child i saw a glimpse of the preworld war i world the last afterglow of the most radiant cultural atmosphere in human history achieved not by russian but by western culture so powerful a fire does not die at once even under the soviet regime in my college years such works as hugos ruy blas and schillers don carlos were included in theatrical repertories not as historical revivals but as part of the contemporary esthetic scene such was the level of the publics intellectual concerns and standards if one has glimpsed that kind of artand wider the possibility of that kind of cultureone is unable to be satisfied with anything less i must emphasize that i am not speaking of concretes nor of politics nor of journalistic trivia but of that periods sense of life its art projected an overwhelming sense of intellectual freedom of depth ie concern with fundamental problems of demanding standards of inexhaustible originality of unlimited possibilities and above all of profound respect for man the existential atmosphere which was then being destroyed by europes philosophical trends and political systems still held a benevolence that would be incredible to the men of today ie a smiling confident good will of man to man and of man to life it has been said and written by many commentators that the atmosphere of the western world before world war i is incommunicable to those who have not lived in that period i used to wonder how men could say it know it yet give it upuntil i observed more closely the men of my own and the preceding generations they had given it up and along with it they had given up everything that makes life worth living conviction purpose values future they were drained embittered hulks whimpering occasionally about the hopelessness of life whatever spiritual treason they had committed they could not accept the cultural sewer of the present they could not forget that they had once seen a higher nobler possibility unable or unwilling to grasp what had destroyed it they kept cursing the world or kept calling men to return to meaningless dogmas such as religion and tradition or kept silent unable to stifle their vision or to fight for it they took the easy way out they renounced valuing to fight in this context means to think today i wonder at how stubbornly men cling to their vices and how easily they give up whatever they regard as the good renunciation is not one of my premises if i see that the good is possible to men yet it vanishes i do not take such is the trend of the world as a sufficient explanation i ask such questions as whywhat caused itwhat or who determines the trends of the world the answer is philosophy the course of mankinds progress is not a straight automatic line but a tortuous struggle with long detours or relapses into the stagnant night of the irrational mankind moves forward by the grace of those human bridges who are able to grasp and transmit across years or centuries the achievements men had reachedand to carry them further thomas aquinas is one illustrious example he was the bridge between aristotle and the renaissance spanning the infamous detour of the dark and middle ages speaking only of the pattern with no presumptuous comparison of stature intended i am a bridge of that kindbetween the esthetic achievements of the nineteenth century and the minds that choose to discover them wherever and whenever such minds might exist it is impossible for the young people of today to grasp the reality of mans higher potential and what scale of achievement it had reached in a rational or semirational culture but i have seen it i know that it was real that it existed that it is possible it is that knowledge that i want to hold up to the sight of menover the brief span of less than a centurybefore the barbarian curtain descends altogether if it does and the last memory of mans greatness vanishes in another dark ages i made it my task to learn what made romanticism the greatest achievement in art history possible and what destroyed it i learnedas in other similar cases involving philosophythat romanticism was defeated by its own spokesmen that even in its own time it had never been properly recognized or identified it is romanticisms identity that i want to transmit to the future as for the present i am not willing to surrender the world to the jerky contortions of selfinducedly brainless bodies with empty eye sockets who perform in stinking basements the immemorial rituals of staving off terror which are a dime a dozen in any jungleand to the quavering witch doctors who call it art our day has no art and no future the future in the context of progress is a door open only to those who do not renounce their conceptual faculty it is not open to mystics hippies drug addicts tribal ritualistsor to anyone who reduces himself to a subanimal subperceptual sensory level of awareness will we see an esthetic renaissance in our time i do not know what i do know is this anyone who fights for the future lives in it today all the essays in this book with one exception appeared originally in my magazine the objectivist formerly the objectivist newsletter the date at the end of each essay indicates the specific issue the exception is introduction to ninetythree which is a condensed version of the introduction i wrote for a new edition of ninetythree by victor hugo translated by lowell bair published by bantam books inc in the objectivist is a magazine that deals with the application of my philosophy to the problems and issues of todays culture for further information those interested may write to objectivism po box irvine california ayn rand new york city june the psychoepistemology of art the position of art in the scale of human knowledge is perhaps the most eloquent symptom of the gulf between mans progress in the physical sciences and his stagnation or today his retrogression in the humanities the physical sciences are still ruled by some remnants of a rational epistemology which is rapidly being destroyed but the humanities have been virtually abandoned to the primitive epistemology of mysticism while physics has reached the level where men are able to study subatomic particles and interplanetary space a phenomenon such as art has remained a dark mystery with little or nothing known about its nature its function in human life or the cause of its tremendous psychological power yet art is of passionately intense importance and profoundly personal concern to most menand it has existed in every known civilization accompanying mans steps from the early hours of his prehistorical dawn earlier than the birth of written language while in other fields of knowledge men have outgrown the practice of seeking the guidance of mystic oracles whose qualification for the job was unintelligibility in the field of esthetics this practice has remained in full force and is becoming more crudely obvious today just as savages took the phenomena of nature for granted as an irreducible primary not to be questioned or analyzed as the exclusive domain of unknowable demonsso todays epistemological savages take art for granted as an irreducible primary not to be questioned or analyzed as the exclusive domain of a special kind of unknowable demons their emotions the only difference is that the prehistorical savages error was innocent one of the grimmest monuments to altruism is mans culturally induced selflessness his willingness to live with himself as with the unknown to ignore evade repress the personal the nonsocial needs of his soul to know least about the things that matter most and thus to consign his deepest values to the impotent underground of subjectivity and his life to the dreary wasteland of chronic guilt the cognitive neglect of art has persisted precisely because the function of art is nonsocial this is one more instance of altruisms inhumanity of its brutal indifference to the deepest needs of manof an actual individual man it is an instance of the inhumanity of any moral theory that regards moral values as a purely social matter art belongs to a nonsocializable aspect of reality which is universal ie applicable to all men but noncollective to the nature of mans consciousness one of the distinguishing characteristics of a work of art including literature is that it serves no practical material end but is an end in itself it serves no purpose other than contemplationand the pleasure of that contemplation is so intense so deeply personal that a man experiences it as a selfsufficient selfjustifying primary and often resists or resents any suggestion to analyze it the suggestion to him has the quality of an attack on his identity on his deepest essential self no human emotion can be causeless nor can so intense an emotion be causeless irreducible and unrelated to the source of emotions and of values to the needs of a living entitys survival art does have a purpose and does serve a human need only it is not a material need but a need of mans consciousness art is inextricably tied to mans survivalnot to his physical survival but to that on which his physical survival depends to the preservation and survival of his consciousness the source of art lies in the fact that mans cognitive faculty is conceptualie that man acquires knowledge and guides his actions not by means of single isolated percepts but by means of abstractions to understand the nature and function of art one must understand the nature and function of concepts a concept is a mental integration of two or more units which are isolated by a process of abstraction and united by a specific definition by organizing his perceptual material into concepts and his concepts into wider and still wider concepts man is able to grasp and retain to identify and integrate an unlimited amount of knowledge a knowledge extending beyond the immediate concretes of any given immediate moment in any given moment concepts enable man to hold in the focus of his conscious awareness much more than his purely perceptual capacity would permit the range of mans perceptual awarenessthe number of percepts he can deal with at any one timeis limited he may be able to visualize four or five unitsas for instance five trees he cannot visualize a hundred trees or a distance of ten lightyears it is only his conceptual faculty that makes it possible for him to deal with knowledge of that kind man retains his concepts by means of language with the exception of proper names every word we use is a concept that stands for an unlimited number of concretes of a certain kind a concept is like a mathematical series of specifically defined units going off in both directions open at both ends and including all units of that particular kind for instance the concept man includes all men who live at present who have ever lived or will ever livea number of men so great that one would not be able to perceive them all visually let alone to study them or discover anything about them language is a code of visualauditory symbols that serves the psychoepistemological function of converting abstractions into concretes or more precisely into the psychoepistemological equivalent of concretes into a manageable number of specific units psychoepistemology is the study of mans cognitive processes from the aspect of the interaction between the conscious mind and the automatic functions of the subconscious consider the enormous conceptual integration involved in any statement from the conversation of a child to the discourse of a scientist consider the long conceptual chain that starts from simple ostensive definitions and rises to higher and still higher concepts forming a hierarchical structure of knowledge so complex that no electronic computer could approach it it is by means of such chains that man has to acquire and retain his knowledge of reality yet this is the simpler part of his psychoepistemological task there is another part which is still more complex the other part consists of applying his knowledgeie evaluating the facts of reality choosing his goals and guiding his actions accordingly to do that man needs another chain of concepts derived from and dependent on the first yet separate and in a sense more complex a chain of normative abstractions while cognitive abstractions identify the facts of reality normative abstractions evaluate the facts thus prescribing a choice of values and a course of action cognitive abstractions deal with that which is normative abstractions deal with that which ought to be in the realms open to mans choice ethics the normative science is based on two cognitive branches of philosophy metaphysics and epistemology to prescribe what man ought to do one must first know what he is and where he isie what is his nature including his means of cognition and the nature of the universe in which he acts it is irrelevant in this context whether the metaphysical base of a given system of ethics is true or false if it is false the error will make the ethics impracticable what concerns us here is only the dependence of ethics on metaphysics is the universe intelligible to man or unintelligible and unknowable can man find happiness on earth or is he doomed to frustration and despair does man have the power of choice the power to choose his goals and to achieve them the power to direct the course of his lifeor is he the helpless plaything of forces beyond his control which determine his fate is man by nature to be valued as good or to be despised as evil these are metaphysical questions but the answers to them determine the kind of ethics men will accept and practice the answers are the link between metaphysics and ethics and although metaphysics as such is not a normative science the answers to this category of questions assume in mans mind the function of metaphysical valuejudgments since they form the foundation of all of his moral values consciously or subconsciously explicitly or implicitly man knows that he needs a comprehensive view of existence to integrate his values to choose his goals to plan his future to maintain the unity and coherence of his lifeand that his metaphysical valuejudgments are involved in every moment of his life in his every choice decision and action metaphysicsthe science that deals with the fundamental nature of realityinvolves mans widest abstractions it includes every concrete he has ever perceived it involves such a vast sum of knowledge and such a long chain of concepts that no man could hold it all in the focus of his immediate conscious awareness yet he needs that sum and that awareness to guide himhe needs the power to summon them into full conscious focus that power is given to him by art art is a selective recreation of reality according to an artists metaphysical valuejudgments by a selective recreation art isolates and integrates those aspects of reality which represent mans fundamental view of himself and of existence out of the countless number of concretesof single disorganized and seemingly contradictory attributes actions and entitiesan artist isolates the things which he regards as metaphysically essential and integrates them into a single new concrete that represents an embodied abstraction for instance consider two statues of man one as a greek god the other as a deformed medieval monstrosity both are metaphysical estimates of man both are projections of the artists view of mans nature both are concretized representations of the philosophy of their respective cultures art is a concretization of metaphysics art brings mans concepts to the perceptual level of his consciousness and allows him to grasp them directly as if they were percepts this is the psychoepistemological function of art and the reason of its importance in mans life and the crux of the objectivist esthetics just as language converts abstractions into the psychoepistemological equivalent of concretes into a manageable number of specific unitsso art converts mans metaphysical abstractions into the equivalent of concretes into specific entities open to mans direct perception the claim that art is a universal language is not an empty metaphor it is literally truein the sense of the psychoepistemological function performed by art observe that in mankinds history art began as an adjunct and often a monopoly of religion religion was the primitive form of philosophy it provided man with a comprehensive view of existence observe that the art of those primitive cultures was a concretization of their religions metaphysical and ethical abstractions the best illustration of the psychoepistemological process involved in art can be given by one aspect of one particular art by characterization in literature human characterwith all of its innumerable potentialities virtues vices inconsistencies contradictionsis so complex that man is his own most bewildering enigma it is very difficult to isolate and integrate human traits even into purely cognitive abstractions and to bear them all in mind when seeking to understand the men one meets now consider the figure of sinclair lewiss babbitt he is the concretization of an abstraction that covers an incalculable sum of observations and evaluations of an incalculable number of characteristics possessed by an incalculable number of men of a certain type lewis has isolated their essential traits and has integrated them into the concrete form of a single characterand when you say of someone hes a babbitt your appraisal includes in a single judgment the enormous total conveyed by that figure when we come to normative abstractionsto the task of defining moral principles and projecting what man ought to bethe psychoepistemological process required is still harder the task demands years of studyand the results are almost impossible to communicate without the assistance of art an exhaustive philosophical treatise defining moral values with a long list of virtues to be practiced will not do it it will not convey what an ideal man would be like and how he would act no mind can deal with so immense a sum of abstractions when i say deal with i mean retranslate all the abstractions into the perceptual concretes for which they standie reconnect them to realityand hold it all in the focus of ones conscious awareness there is no way to integrate such a sum without projecting an actual human figurean integrated concretization that illuminates the theory and makes it intelligible hence the sterile uninspiring futility of a great many theoretical discussions of ethics and the resentment which many people feel toward such discussions moral principles remain in their minds as floating abstractions offering them a goal they cannot grasp and demanding that they reshape their souls in its image thus leaving them with a burden of undefinable moral guilt art is the indispensable medium for the communication of a moral ideal observe that every religion has a mythologya dramatized concretization of its moral code embodied in the figures of men who are its ultimate product the fact that some of these figures are more convincing than others depends on the comparative rationality or irrationality of the moral theory they exemplify this does not mean that art is a substitute for philosophical thought without a conceptual theory of ethics an artist would not be able successfully to concretize an image of the ideal but without the assistance of art ethics remains in the position of theoretical engineering art is the modelbuilder many readers of the fountainhead have told me that the character of howard roark helped them to make a decision when they faced a moral dilemma they asked themselves what would roark do in this situationand faster than their mind could identify the proper application of all the complex principles involved the image of roark gave them the answer they sensed almost instantly what he would or would not doand this helped them to isolate and to identify the reasons the moral principles that would have guided him such is the psychoepistemological function of a personified concretized human ideal it is important to stress however that even though moral values are inextricably involved in art they are involved only as a consequence not as a causal determinant the primary focus of art is metaphysical not ethical art is not the handmaiden of morality its basic purpose is not to educate to reform or to advocate anything the concretization of a moral ideal is not a textbook on how to become one the basic purpose of art is not to teach but to showto hold up to man a concretized image of his nature and his place in the universe any metaphysical issue will necessarily have an enormous influence on mans conduct and therefore on his ethics and since every art work has a theme it will necessarily convey some conclusion some message to its audience but that influence and that message are only secondary consequences art is not the means to any didactic end this is the difference between a work of art and a morality play or a propaganda poster the greater a work of art the more profoundly universal its theme art is not the means of literal transcription this is the difference between a work of art and a news story or a photograph the place of ethics in any given work of art depends on the metaphysical views of the artist if consciously or subconsciously an artist holds the premise that man possesses the power of volition it will lead his work to a value orientation to romanticism if he holds the premise that mans fate is determined by forces beyond his control it will lead his work to an antivalue orientation to naturalism the philosophical and esthetic contradictions of determinism are irrelevant in this context just as the truth or falsehood of an artists metaphysical views is irrelevant to the nature of art as such an art work may project the values man is to seek and hold up to him the concretized vision of the life he is to achieve or it may assert that mans efforts are futile and hold up to him the concretized vision of defeat and despair as his ultimate fate in either case the esthetic meansthe psychoepistemological processes involvedremain the same the existential consequences of course will differ amidst the incalculable number and complexity of choices that confront a man in his daybyday existence with the frequently bewildering torrent of events with the alternation of successes and failures of joys that seem too rare and suffering that lasts too longhe is often in danger of losing his perspective and the reality of his own convictions remember that abstractions as such do not exist they are merely mans epistemological method of perceiving that which existsand that which exists is concrete to acquire the full persuasive irresistible power of reality mans metaphysical abstractions have to confront him in the form of concretesie in the form of art consider the difference it would make ifin his need of philosophical guidance or confirmation or inspirationman turns to the art of ancient greece or to the art of the middle ages reaching his mind and emotions simultaneously with the combined impact of abstract thought and of immediate reality one type of art tells him that disasters are transient that grandeur beauty strength selfconfidence are his proper natural state the other tells him that happiness is transient and evil that he is a distorted impotent miserable little sinner pursued by leering gargoyles crawling in terror on the brink of an eternal hell the consequences of both experiences are obviousand history is their practical demonstration it is not art alone that was responsible for the greatness or the horror of those two eras but art as the voice of philosophyof the particular philosophy that dominated those cultures as to the role of emotions in art and the subconscious mechanism that serves as the integrating factor both in artistic creation and in mans response to art they involve a psychological phenomenon which we call a sense of life a sense of life is a preconceptual equivalent of metaphysics an emotional subconsciously integrated appraisal of man and of existence but this is a different though corollary subject which i discuss in chapters and the present subject is only the psychoepistemological role of art a question raised at the start of this discussion should now be clear the reason why art has such a profoundly personal significance for men is that art confirms or denies the efficacy of a mans consciousness according to whether an art work supports or negates his own fundamental view of reality such is the meaning and the power of a medium which today is predominantly in the hands of practitioners who boastfully offer as their credentials the fact that they do not know what they are doing let us take them at their word they dont we do april philosophy and sense of life since religion is a primitive form of philosophyan attempt to offer a comprehensive view of realitymany of its myths are distorted dramatized allegories based on some element of truth some actual if profoundly elusive aspect of mans existence one of such allegories which men find particularly terrifying is the myth of a supernatural recorder from whom nothing can be hidden who lists all of a mans deedsthe good and the evil the noble and the vileand who confronts a man with that record on judgment day that myth is true not existentially but psychologically the merciless recorder is the integrating mechanism of a mans subconscious the record is his sense of life a sense of life is a preconceptual equivalent of metaphysics an emotional subconsciously integrated appraisal of man and of existence it sets the nature of a mans emotional responses and the essence of his character long before he is old enough to grasp such a concept as metaphysics man makes choices forms valuejudgments experiences emotions and acquires a certain implicit view of life every choice and valuejudgment implies some estimate of himself and of the world around himmost particularly of his capacity to deal with the world he may draw conscious conclusions which may be true or false or he may remain mentally passive and merely react to events ie merely feel whatever the case may be his subconscious mechanism sums up his psychological activities integrating his conclusions reactions or evasions into an emotional sum that establishes a habitual pattern and becomes his automatic response to the world around him what began as a series of single discrete conclusions or evasions about his own particular problems becomes a generalized feeling about existence an implicit metaphysics with the compelling motivational power of a constant basic emotionan emotion which is part of all his other emotions and underlies all his experiences this is a sense of life to the extent to which a man is mentally active ie motivated by the desire to know to understand his mind works as the programmer of his emotional computerand his sense of life develops into a bright counterpart of a rational philosophy to the extent to which a man evades the programming of his emotional computer is done by chance influences by random impressions associations imitations by undigested snatches of environmental bromides by cultural osmosis if evasion or lethargy is a mans predominant method of mental functioning the result is a sense of life dominated by feara soul like a shapeless piece of clay stamped by footprints going in all directions in later years such a man cries that he has lost his sense of identity the fact is that he never acquired it man by his nature cannot refrain from generalizing he cannot live moment by moment without context without past or future he cannot eliminate his integrating capacity ie his conceptual capacity and confine his consciousness to an animals perceptual range just as an animals consciousness cannot be stretched to deal with abstractions so mans consciousness cannot be shrunk to deal with nothing but immediate concretes the enormously powerful integrating mechanism of mans consciousness is there at birth his only choice is to drive it or to be driven by it since an act of volitiona process of thoughtis required to use that mechanism for a cognitive purpose man can evade that effort but if he evades chance takes over the mechanism functions on its own like a machine without a driver it goes on integrating but integrating blindly incongruously at randomnot as an instrument of cognition but as an instrument of distortion delusion and nightmare terror bent on wrecking its defaulting processors consciousness a sense of life is formed by a process of emotional generalization which may be described as a subconscious counterpart of a process of abstraction since it is a method of classifying and integrating but it is a process of emotional abstraction it consists of classifying things according to the emotions they invokeie of tying together by association or connotation all those things which have the power to make an individual experience the same or a similar emotion for instance a new neighborhood a discovery adventure struggle triumphor the folks next door a memorized recitation a family picnic a known routine comfort on a more adult level a heroic man the skyline of new york a sunlit landscape pure colors ecstatic musicor a humble man an old village a foggy landscape muddy colors folk music which particular emotions will be invoked by the things in these examples as their respective common denominators depends on which set of things fits an individuals view of himself for a man of selfesteem the emotion uniting the things in the first part of these examples is admiration exaltation a sense of challenge the emotion uniting the things in the second part is disgust or boredom for a man who lacks selfesteem the emotion uniting the things in the first part of these examples is fear guilt resentment the emotion uniting the things in the second part is relief from fear reassurance the undemanding safety of passivity even though such emotional abstractions grow into a metaphysical view of man their origin lies in an individuals view of himself and of his own existence the subverbal subconscious criterion of selection that forms his emotional abstractions is that which is important to me or the kind of universe which is right for me in which i would feel at home it is obvious what immense psychological consequences will follow depending on whether a mans subconscious metaphysics is consonant with the facts of reality or contradicts them the key concept in the formation of a sense of life is the term important it is a concept that belongs to the realm of values since it implies an answer to the question importantto whom yet its meaning is different from that of moral values important does not necessarily mean good it means a quality character or standing such as to entitle to attention or consideration the american college dictionary what in a fundamental sense is entitled to ones attention or consideration reality importantin its essential meaning as distinguished from its more limited and superficial usesis a metaphysical term it pertains to that aspect of metaphysics which serves as a bridge between metaphysics and ethics to a fundamental view of mans nature that view involves the answers to such questions as whether the universe is knowable or not whether man has the power of choice or not whether he can achieve his goals in life or not the answers to such questions are metaphysical valuejudgments since they form the base of ethics it is only those values which he regards or grows to regard as important those which represent his implicit view of reality that remain in a mans subconscious and form his sense of life it is important to understand thingsit is important to obey my parentsit is important to act on my ownit is important to please other peopleit is important to fight for what i wantit is important not to make enemiesmy life is importantwho am i to stick my neck out man is a being of selfmade souland it is of such conclusions that the stuff of his soul is made by soul i mean consciousness the integrated sum of a mans basic values is his sense of life a sense of life represents a mans early valueintegrations which remain in a fluid plastic easily amendable state while he gathers knowledge to reach full conceptual control and thus to drive his inner mechanism a full conceptual control means a consciously directed process of cognitive integration which means a conscious philosophy of life by the time he reaches adolescence a mans knowledge is sufficient to deal with broad fundamentals this is the period when he becomes aware of the need to translate his incoherent sense of life into conscious terms this is the period when he gropes for such things as the meaning of life for principles ideals values and desperately for selfassertion andsince nothing is done in our antirational culture to assist a young mind in this crucial transition and everything possible is done to hamper cripple stultify itthe result is the frantic hysterical irrationality of most adolescents particularly today theirs is the agony of the unbornof minds going through a process of atrophy at the time set by nature for their growth the transition from guidance by a sense of life to guidance by a conscious philosophy takes many forms for the rare exception the fully rational child it is a natural absorbing if difficult processthe process of validating and if necessary correcting in conceptual terms what he had merely sensed about the nature of mans existence thus transforming a wordless feeling into clearly verbalized knowledge and laying a firm foundation an intellectual roadbed for the course of his life the result is a fully integrated personality a man whose mind and emotions are in harmony whose sense of life matches his conscious convictions philosophy does not replace a mans sense of life which continues to function as the automatically integrated sum of his values but philosophy sets the criteria of his emotional integrations according to a fully defined and consistent view of reality if and to the extent that a philosophy is rational instead of deriving subconsciously an implicit metaphysics from his valuejudgments he now derives conceptually his valuejudgments from an explicit metaphysics his emotions proceed from his fully convinced judgments the mind leads the emotions follow for many men the process of transition never takes place they make no attempt to integrate their knowledge to acquire any conscious convictions and are left at the mercy of their inarticulate sense of life as their only guide for most men the transition is a tortured and not fully successful process leading to a fundamental inner conflicta clash between a mans conscious convictions and his repressed unidentified or only partially identified sense of life very often the transition is incomplete as in the case of a man whose convictions are not part of a fully integrated philosophy but are merely a collection of random disconnected often contradictory ideas and therefore are unconvincing to his own mind against the power of his subconscious metaphysics in some cases a mans sense of life is better closer to the truth than the kind of ideas he accepts in other cases his sense of life is much worse than the ideas he professes to accept but is unable fully to practice ironically enough it is mans emotions in such cases that act as the avengers of his neglected or betrayed intellect in order to live man must act in order to act he must make choices in order to make choices he must define a code of values in order to define a code of values he must know what he is and where he isie he must know his own nature including his means of knowledge and the nature of the universe in which he actsie he needs metaphysics epistemology ethics which means philosophy he cannot escape from this need his only alternative is whether the philosophy guiding him is to be chosen by his mind or by chance if his mind does not provide him with a comprehensive view of existence his sense of life will if he succumbs to centuries of concerted assaults on the mindto traditions offering vicious irrationality or unconscionable nonsense in the guise of philosophyif he gives up in lethargy or in bewilderment evades fundamental issues and concerns himself only with the concretes of his daybyday existence his sense of life takes over for good or evil and usually for evil he is left at the mercy of a subconscious philosophy which he does not know has never checked has never been aware of accepting then as his fear anxiety and uncertainty mount year by year he finds himself living with a sense of unknown undefinable doom as if in expectation of some approaching judgment day what he does not know is that every day of his life is judgment daythe day of paying for the defaults the lies the contradictions the blankouts recorded by his subconscious on the scrolls of his sense of life and on that kind of psychological record the blank entries are the blackest sins a sense of life once acquired is not a closed issue it can be changed and correctedeasily in youth while it is still fluid or by a longer harder effort in later years since it is an emotional sum it cannot be changed by a direct act of will it changes automatically but only after a long process of psychological retraining when and if a man changes his conscious philosophical premises whether he corrects it or not whether it is objectively consonant with reality or not at any stage or state of its specific content a sense of life always retains a profoundly personal quality it reflects a mans deepest values it is experienced by him as a sense of his own identity a given persons sense of life is hard to identify conceptually because it is hard to isolate it is involved in everything about that person in his every thought emotion action in his every response in his every choice and value in his every spontaneous gesture in his manner of moving talking smiling in the total of his personality it is that which makes him a personality introspectively ones own sense of life is experienced as an absolute and an irreducible primaryas that which one never questions because the thought of questioning it never arises extrospectively the sense of life of another person strikes one as an immediate yet undefinable impressionon very short acquaintancean impression which often feels like certainty yet is exasperatingly elusive if one attempts to verify it this leads many people to regard a sense of life as the province of some sort of special intuition as a matter perceivable only by some special nonrational insight the exact opposite is true a sense of life is not an irreducible primary but a very complex sum it can be felt but it cannot be understood by an automatic reaction to be understood it has to be analyzed identified and verified conceptually that automatic impressionof oneself or of othersis only a lead left untranslated it can be a very deceptive lead but if and when that intangible impression is supported by and unites with the conscious judgment of ones mind the result is the most exultant form of certainty one can ever experience it is the integration of mind and values there are two aspects of mans existence which are the special province and expression of his sense of life love and art i am referring here to romantic love in the serious meaning of that termas distinguished from the superficial infatuations of those whose sense of life is devoid of any consistent values ie of any lasting emotions other than fear love is a response to values it is with a persons sense of life that one falls in lovewith that essential sum that fundamental stand or way of facing existence which is the essence of a personality one falls in love with the embodiment of the values that formed a persons character which are reflected in his widest goals or smallest gestures which create the style of his soulthe individual style of a unique unrepeatable irreplaceable consciousness it is ones own sense of life that acts as the selector and responds to what it recognizes as ones own basic values in the person of another it is not a matter of professed convictions though these are not irrelevant it is a matter of much more profound conscious and subconscious harmony many errors and tragic disillusionments are possible in this process of emotional recognition since a sense of life by itself is not a reliable cognitive guide and if there are degrees of evil then one of the most evil consequences of mysticismin terms of human sufferingis the belief that love is a matter of the heart not the mind that love is an emotion independent of reason that love is blind and impervious to the power of philosophy love is the expression of philosophyof a subconscious philosophical sumand perhaps no other aspect of human existence needs the conscious power of philosophy quite so desperately when that power is called upon to verify and support an emotional appraisal when love is a conscious integration of reason and emotion of mind and values thenand only thenit is the greatest reward of mans life art is a selective recreation of reality according to an artists metaphysical valuejudgments it is the integrator and concretizer of mans metaphysical abstractions it is the voice of his sense of life as such art is subject to the same aura of mystery the same dangers the same tragediesand occasionally the same gloryas romantic love of all human products art is perhaps the most personally important to man and the least understoodas i shall discuss in the next chapter february art and sense of life if one saw in real life a beautiful woman wearing an exquisite evening gown with a cold sore on her lips the blemish would mean nothing but a minor affliction and one would ignore it but a painting of such a woman would be a corrupt obscenely vicious attack on man on beauty on all valuesand one would experience a feeling of immense disgust and indignation at the artist there are also those who would feel something like approval and who would belong to the same moral category as the artist the emotional response to that painting would be instantaneous much faster than the viewers mind could identify all the reasons involved the psychological mechanism which produces that response and which produced the painting is a mans sense of life a sense of life is a preconceptual equivalent of metaphysics an emotional subconsciously integrated appraisal of man and of existence it is the artists sense of life that controls and integrates his work directing the innumerable choices he has to make from the choice of subject to the subtlest details of style it is the viewers or readers sense of life that responds to a work of art by a complex yet automatic reaction of acceptance and approval or rejection and condemnation this does not mean that a sense of life is a valid criterion of esthetic merit either for the artist or the viewer a sense of life is not infallible but a sense of life is the source of art the psychological mechanism which enables man to create a realm such as art the emotion involved in art is not an emotion in the ordinary meaning of the term it is experienced more as a sense or a feel but it has two characteristics pertaining to emotions it is automatically immediate and it has an intense profoundly personal yet undefined valuemeaning to the individual experiencing it the value involved is life and the words naming the emotion are this is what life means to me regardless of the nature or content of an artists metaphysical views what an art work expresses fundamentally under all of its lesser aspects is this is life as i see it the essential meaning of a viewers or readers response under all of its lesser elements is this is or is not life as i see it the psychoepistemological process of communication between an artist and a viewer or reader goes as follows the artist starts with a broad abstraction which he has to concretize to bring into reality by means of the appropriate particulars the viewer perceives the particulars integrates them and grasps the abstraction from which they came thus completing the circle speaking metaphorically the creative process resembles a process of deduction the viewing process resembles a process of induction this does not mean that communication is the primary purpose of an artist his primary purpose is to bring his view of man and of existence into reality but to be brought into reality it has to be translated into objective therefore communicable terms in chapter i discussed why man needs artwhy as a being guided by conceptual knowledge he needs the power to summon the long chain and complex total of his metaphysical concepts into his immediate conscious awareness he needs a comprehensive view of existence to integrate his values to choose his goals to plan his future to maintain the unity and coherence of his life mans sense of life provides him with the integrated sum of his metaphysical abstractions art concretizes them and allows him to perceiveto experiencetheir immediate reality the function of psychological integrations is to make certain connections automatic so that they work as a unit and do not require a conscious process of thought every time they are evoked all learning consists of automatizing ones knowledge in order to leave ones mind free to pursue further knowledge there are many special or crossfiled chains of abstractions of interconnected concepts in mans mind cognitive abstractions are the fundamental chain on which all the others depend such chains are mental integrations serving a special purpose and formed accordingly by a special criterion cognitive abstractions are formed by the criterion of what is essential epistemologically essential to distinguish one class of existents from all others normative abstractions are formed by the criterion of what is good esthetic abstractions are formed by the criterion of what is important an artist does not fake realityhe stylizes it he selects those aspects of existence which he regards as metaphysically significantand by isolating and stressing them by omitting the insignificant and accidental he presents his view of existence his concepts are not divorced from the facts of realitythey are concepts which integrate the facts and his metaphysical evaluation of the facts his selection constitutes his evaluation everything included in a work of artfrom theme to subject to brushstroke or adjectiveacquires metaphysical significance by the mere fact of being included of being important enough to include an artist as for instance the sculptors of ancient greece who presents man as a godlike figure is aware of the fact that men may be crippled or diseased or helpless but he regards these conditions as accidental as irrelevant to the essential nature of manand he presents a figure embodying strength beauty intelligence selfconfidence as mans proper natural state an artist as for instance the sculptors of the middle ages who presents man as a deformed monstrosity is aware of the fact that there are men who are healthy happy or confident but he regards these conditions as accidental or illusory as irrelevant to mans essential natureand he presents a tortured figure embodying pain ugliness terror as mans proper natural state now consider the painting described at the start of this discussion the cold sore on the lips of a beautiful woman which would be insignificant in real life acquires a monstrous metaphysical significance by virtue of being included in a painting it declares that a womans beauty and her efforts to achieve glamor the beautiful evening gown are a futile illusion undercut by a seed of corruption which can mar and destroy them at any momentthat this is realitys mockery of manthat all of mans values and efforts are impotent against the power not even of some great cataclysm but of a miserable little physical infection the naturalistic type of argumentto the effect that in real life a beautiful woman might get a cold soreis irrelevant esthetically art is not concerned with actual occurrences or events as such but with their metaphysical significance to man an indication of the metaphysical slant of art can be seen in the popular notion that a reader of fiction identifies himself with some character or characters of the story to identify with is a colloquial designation for a process of abstraction it means to observe a common element between the character and oneself to draw an abstraction from the characters problems and apply it to ones own life subconsciously without any knowledge of esthetic theory but by virtue of the implicit nature of art this is the way in which most people react to fiction and to all other forms of art this illustrates one important aspect of the difference between a reallife news story and a fiction story a news story is a concrete from which one may or may not draw an abstraction which one may or may not find relevant to ones own life a fiction story is an abstraction that claims universality ie application to every human life including ones own hence one may be impersonal and indifferent in regard to a news story even though it is real and one feels an intensely personal emotion about a fiction story even though it is invented this emotion may be positive when one finds the abstraction applicable to oneselfor resentfully negative when one finds it inapplicable and inimical it is not journalistic information or scientific education or moral guidance that man seeks from a work of art though these may be involved as secondary consequences but the fulfillment of a more profound need a confirmation of his view of existencea confirmation not in the sense of resolving cognitive doubts but in the sense of permitting him to contemplate his abstractions outside his own mind in the form of existential concretes since man lives by reshaping his physical background to serve his purpose since he must first define and then create his valuesa rational man needs a concretized projection of these values an image in whose likeness he will reshape the world and himself art gives him that image it gives him the experience of seeing the full immediate concrete reality of his distant goals since a rational mans ambition is unlimited since his pursuit and achievement of values is a lifelong processand the higher the values the harder the strugglehe needs a moment an hour or some period of time in which he can experience the sense of his completed task the sense of living in a universe where his values have been successfully achieved it is like a moment of rest a moment to gain fuel to move farther art gives him that fuel the pleasure of contemplating the objectified reality of ones own sense of life is the pleasure of feeling what it would be like to live in ones ideal world the importance of that experience is not in what man learns from it but in that he experiences it the fuel is not a theoretical principle not a didactic message but the lifegiving fact of experiencing a moment of metaphysical joya moment of love for existence see chapter the same principle applies to an irrational man though in different terms according to his different views and responses for an irrational man the concretized projection of his malevolent sense of life serves not as fuel and inspiration to move forward but as permission to stand still it declares that values are unattainable that the struggle is futile that fear guilt pain and failure are mankinds predestined endand that he couldnt help it or on a lower level of irrationality the concretized projection of a malignant sense of life provides a man with an image of triumphant malice of hatred for existence of vengeance against lifes best exponents of the defeat and destruction of all human values his kind of art gives him a moments illusion that he is rightthat evil is metaphysically potent art is mans metaphysical mirror what a rational man seeks to see in that mirror is a salute what an irrational man seeks to see is a justificationeven if only a justification of his depravity as a last convulsion of his betrayed selfesteem between these two extremes there lies the immense continuum of men of mixed premiseswhose sense of life holds unresolved precariously balanced or openly contradictory elements of reason and unreasonand works of art that reflect these mixtures since art is the product of philosophy and mankinds philosophy is tragically mixed most of the worlds art including some of its greatest examples falls into this category the truth or falsehood of a given artists philosophy as such is not an esthetic matter it may affect a given viewers enjoyment of his work but it does not negate its esthetic merit some sort of philosophical meaning however some implicit view of life is a necessary element of a work of art the absence of any metaphysical values whatever ie a gray uncommitted passively indeterminate sense of life results in a soul without fuel motor or voice and renders a man impotent in the field of art bad art is predominantly the product of imitation of secondhand copying not of creative expression two distinct but interrelated elements of a work of art are the crucial means of projecting its sense of life the subject and the stylewhat an artist chooses to present and how he presents it the subject of an art work expresses a view of mans existence while the style expresses a view of mans consciousness the subject reveals an artists metaphysics the style reveals his psychoepistemology the choice of subject declares what aspects of existence the artist regards as importantas worthy of being recreated and contemplated he may choose to present heroic figures as exponents of mans natureor he may choose statistical composites of the average the undistinguished the mediocreor he may choose crawling specimens of depravity he may present the triumph of heroes in fact or in spirit victor hugo or their struggle michelangelo or their defeat shakespeare he may present the folks next door next door to palaces tolstoy or to drugstores sinclair lewis or to kitchens vermeer or to sewers zola he may present monsters as objects of moral denunciation dostoevsky or as objects of terror goyaor he may demand sympathy for his monsters and thus crawl outside the limits of the realm of values including esthetic ones whatever the case may be it is the subject qualified by the theme that projects an art works view of mans place in the universe the theme of an art work is the link uniting its subject and its style style is a particular distinctive or characteristic mode of execution an artists style is the product of his own psychoepistemologyand by implication a projection of his view of mans consciousness of its efficacy or impotence of its proper method and level of functioning predominantly though not exclusively a man whose normal mental state is a state of full focus will create and respond to a style of radiant clarity and ruthless precisiona style that projects sharp outlines cleanliness purpose an intransigent commitment to full awareness and clearcut identitya level of awareness appropriate to a universe where a is a where everything is open to mans consciousness and demands its constant functioning a man who is moved by the fog of his feelings and spends most of his time out of focus will create and respond to a style of blurred mysterious murk where outlines dissolve and entities flow into one another where words connote anything and denote nothing where colors float without objects and objects float without weighta level of awareness appropriate to a universe where a can be any nona one chooses where nothing can be known with certainty and nothing much is demanded of ones consciousness style is the most complex element of art the most revealing and often the most baffling psychologically the terrible inner conflicts from which artists suffer as much as or perhaps more than other men are magnified in their work as an example salvador dali whose style projects the luminous clarity of a rational psychoepistemology while most though not all of his subjects project an irrational and revoltingly evil metaphysics a similar but less offensive conflict may be seen in the paintings of vermeer who combines a brilliant clarity of style with the bleak metaphysics of naturalism at the other extreme of the stylistic continuum observe the deliberate blurring and visual distortions of the socalled painterly school from rembrandt on downdown to the rebellion against consciousness expressed by a phenomenon such as cubism which seeks specifically to disintegrate mans consciousness by painting objects as man does not perceive them from several perspectives at once a writers style may project a blend of reason and passionate emotion victor hugoor a chaos of floating abstractions of emotions cut off from reality thomas wolfeor the dry bare concretebound humortinged raucousness of an intelligent reporter sinclair lewisor the disciplined perceptive lucid yet muted understatement of a represser john oharaor the carefully superficial overdetailed precision of an amoralist flaubertor the mannered artificiality of a secondhander several moderns not worthy of mention style conveys what may be called a psychoepistemological sense of life ie an expression of that level of mental functioning on which the artist feels most at home this is the reason why style is crucially important in artboth to the artist and to the reader or viewerand why its importance is experienced as a profoundly personal matter to the artist it is an expression to the reader or viewer a confirmation of his own consciousnesswhich means of his efficacywhich means of his selfesteem or pseudoselfesteem now a word of warning about the criteria of esthetic judgment a sense of life is the source of art but it is not the sole qualification of an artist or of an esthetician and it is not a criterion of esthetic judgment emotions are not tools of cognition esthetics is a branch of philosophyand just as a philosopher does not approach any other branch of his science with his feelings or emotions as his criterion of judgment so he cannot do it in the field of esthetics a sense of life is not sufficient professional equipment an estheticianas well as any man who attempts to evaluate art worksmust be guided by more than an emotion the fact that one agrees or disagrees with an artists philosophy is irrelevant to an esthetic appraisal of his work qua art one does not have to agree with an artist nor even to enjoy him in order to evaluate his work in essence an objective evaluation requires that one identify the artists theme the abstract meaning of his work exclusively by identifying the evidence contained in the work and allowing no other outside considerations then evaluate the means by which he conveys itie taking his theme as criterion evaluate the purely esthetic elements of the work the technical mastery or lack of it with which he projects or fails to project his view of life the esthetic principles which apply to all art regardless of an individual artists philosophy and which must guide an objective evaluation are outside the scope of this discussion i will mention only that such principles are defined by the science of estheticsa task at which modern philosophy has failed dismally since art is a philosophical composite it is not a contradiction to say this is a great work of art but i dont like itprovided one defines the exact meaning of that statement the first part refers to a purely esthetic appraisal the second to a deeper philosophical level which includes more than esthetic values even in the realm of personal choices there are many different aspects from which one may enjoy a work of artother than senseoflife affinity ones sense of life is fully involved only when one feels a profoundly personal emotion about a work of art but there are many other levels or degrees of liking the differences are similar to the difference between romantic love and affection or friendship for instance i love the work of victor hugo in a deeper sense than admiration for his superlative literary genius and i find many similarities between his sense of life and mine although i disagree with virtually all of his explicit philosophyi like dostoevsky for his superb mastery of plot structure and for his merciless dissection of the psychology of evil even though his philosophy and his sense of life are almost diametrically opposed to minei like the early novels of mickey spillane for his plot ingenuity and moralistic style even though his sense of life clashes with mine and no explicit philosophical element is involved in his worki cannot stand tolstoy and reading him was the most boring literary duty i ever had to perform his philosophy and his sense of life are not merely mistaken but evil and yet from a purely literary viewpoint on his own terms i have to evaluate him as a good writer now to demonstrate the difference between an intellectual approach and a sense of life i will restate the preceding paragraph in senseoflife terms hugo gives me the feeling of entering a cathedraldostoevsky gives me the feeling of entering a chamber of horrors but with a powerful guidespillane gives me the feeling of hearing a military band in a public parktolstoy gives me the feeling of an unsanitary backyard which i do not care to enter when one learns to translate the meaning of an art work into objective terms one discovers that nothing is as potent as art in exposing the essence of a mans character an artist reveals his naked soul in his workand so gentle reader do you when you respond to it march art and cognition a frequent question which the estheticians have failed to answer is what kinds of objects may be properly classified as works of art what are the valid forms of artand why these an examination of the major branches of art will give a clue to the answer art is a selective recreation of reality according to an artists metaphysical valuejudgments mans profound need of art lies in the fact that his cognitive faculty is conceptual ie that he acquires knowledge by means of abstractions and needs the power to bring his widest metaphysical abstractions into his immediate perceptual awareness art fulfills this need by means of a selective recreation it concretizes mans fundamental view of himself and of existence it tells man in effect which aspects of his experience are to be regarded as essential significant important in this sense art teaches man how to use his consciousness it conditions or stylizes mans consciousness by conveying to him a certain way of looking at existence bearing this in mind consider the nature of the major branches of art and of the specific physical media they employ literature recreates reality by means of languagepainting by means of color on a twodimensional surfacesculpture by means of a threedimensional form made of a solid material music employs the sounds produced by the periodic vibrations of a sonorous body and evokes mans senseoflife emotions architecture is in a class by itself because it combines art with a utilitarian purpose and does not recreate reality but creates a structure for mans habitation or use expressing mans values there are also the performing arts whose medium is the person of the artist we shall discuss them later now observe the relation of these arts to mans cognitive faculty literature deals with the field of conceptspainting with the field of sightsculpture with the combined fields of sight and touchmusic with the field of hearing architecture qua art is close to sculpture its field is threedimensional ie sight and touch but transposed to a grand spatial scale the development of human cognition starts with the ability to perceive things ie entities of mans five cognitive senses only two provide him with a direct awareness of entities sight and touch the other three senseshearing taste and smellgive him an awareness of some of an entitys attributes or of the consequences produced by an entity they tell him that something makes sounds or something tastes sweet or something smells fresh but in order to perceive this something he needs sight andor touch the concept entity is implicitly the start of mans conceptual development and the buildingblock of his entire conceptual structure it is by perceiving entities that man perceives the universe and in order to concretize his view of existence it is by means of concepts language or by means of his entityperceiving senses sight and touch that he has to do it music does not deal with entities which is the reason why its psychoepistemological function is different from that of the other arts as we shall discuss later the relation of literature to mans cognitive faculty is obvious literature recreates reality by means of words ie concepts but in order to recreate reality it is the sensoryperceptual level of mans awareness that literature has to convey conceptually the reality of concrete individual men and events of specific sights sounds textures etc the socalled visual arts painting sculpture architecture produce concrete perceptually available entities and make them convey an abstract conceptual meaning all these arts are conceptual in essence all are products of and addressed to the conceptual level of mans consciousness and they differ only in their means literature starts with concepts and integrates them to perceptspainting sculpture and architecture start with percepts and integrate them to concepts the ultimate psychoepistemological function is the same a process that integrates mans forms of cognition unifies his consciousness and clarifies his grasp of reality the visual arts do not deal with the sensory field of awareness as such but with the sensory field as perceived by a conceptual consciousness the sensoryperceptual awareness of an adult does not consist of mere sense data as it did in his infancy but of automatized integrations that combine sense data with a vast context of conceptual knowledge the visual arts refine and direct the sensory elements of these integrations by means of selectivity of emphasis and omission these arts lead mans sight to the conceptual context intended by the artist they teach man to see more precisely and to find deeper meaning in the field of his vision it is a common experience to observe that a particular paintingfor example a still life of applesmakes its subject more real than it is in reality the apples seem brighter and firmer they seem to possess an almost selfassertive character a kind of heightened reality which neither their reallife models nor any color photograph can match yet if one examines them closely one sees that no reallife apple ever looked like that what is it then that the artist has done he has created a visual abstraction he has performed the process of conceptformationof isolating and integratingbut in exclusively visual terms he has isolated the essential distinguishing characteristics of apples and integrated them into a single visual unit he has brought the conceptual method of functioning to the operations of a single sense organ the organ of sight no one can perceive literally and indiscriminately every accidental inconsequential detail of every apple he happens to see everyone perceives and remembers only some aspects which are not necessarily the essential ones most people carry in mind a vaguely approximate image of an apples appearance the painting concretizes that image by means of visual essentials which most men have not focused on or identified but recognize at once what they feel in effect is yes thats how an apple looks to me in fact no apple ever looked that way to themonly to the selectively focused eye of an artist but psychoepistemologically their sense of heightened reality is not an illusion it comes from the greater clarity which the artist has given to their mental image the painting has integrated the sum of their countless random impressions and thus has brought order to the visual field of their experience apply the same process to the paintings of more complex subjectsof landscapes of cities of human figures of human facesand you will see the psychoepistemological power of the art of painting the closer an artist comes to a conceptual method of functioning visually the greater his work the greatest of all artists vermeer devoted his paintings to a single theme light itself the guiding principle of his compositions is the contextual nature of our perception of light and of color the physical objects in a vermeer canvas are chosen and placed in such a way that their combined interrelationships feature lead to and make possible the paintings brightest patches of light sometimes blindingly bright in a manner which no one has been able to render before or since compare the radiant austerity of vermeers work to the silliness of the dotsanddashes impressionists who allegedly intended to paint pure light he raised perception to the conceptual level they attempted to disintegrate perception into sense data one might wish and i do that vermeer had chosen better subjects to express his theme but to him apparently the subjects were only the means to his end what his style projects is a concretized image of an immense nonvisual abstraction the psychoepistemology of a rational mind it projects clarity discipline confidence purpose powera universe open to man when one feels looking at a vermeer painting this is my view of life the feeling involves much more than mere visual perception as i have mentioned in art and sense of life all the other elements of painting such as theme subject composition are involved in projecting an artists view of existence but for this present discussion style is the most important element it demonstrates in what manner an art confined to a single sense modality using exclusively visual means can express and affect the total of mans consciousness in this connection i should like to relate without comment a personal incident at the age of for one summer i joined a drawing class given by a man who would have become a great artist had he survived which i doubt this was in russia his paintings were magnificent even then he forbade the class ever to draw a curved line he taught us that every curve must be broken into facets of intersecting straight lines i fell in love with this style i still am today i know the reason fully what i felt then and still do was not this is for me but this is me compared to painting sculpture is more limited a form of art it expresses an artists view of existence through his treatment of the human figure but it is confined to the human figure for a discussion of sculptures means i will refer you to metaphysics in marble by mary ann sures the objectivist february march dealing with two senses sight and touch sculpture is restricted by the necessity to present a threedimensional shape as man does not perceive it without color visually sculpture offers shape as an abstraction but touch is a somewhat concretebound sense and confines sculpture to concrete entities of these only the figure of man can project a metaphysical meaning there is little that one can express in the statue of an animal or of an inanimate object psychoepistemologically it is the requirements of the sense of touch that make the texture of a human body a crucial element in sculpture and virtually a hallmark of great sculptors observe the manner in which the softness the smoothness the pliant resiliency of the skin is conveyed by rigid marble in such statues as the venus de milo or michelangelos pietà it is worth noting that sculpture is almost a dead art its great day was in ancient greece which philosophically was a mancentered civilization a renaissance is always possible but the future of sculpture depends to a large extent on the future of architecture the two arts are closely allied one of the problems of sculpture lies in the fact that one of its most effective functions is to serve as architectural ornament i shall not include architecture in this discussioni assume the reader knows which book i will refer him to this brings us to the subject of music the fundamental difference between music and the other arts lies in the fact that music is experienced as if it reversed mans normal psychoepistemological process the other arts create a physical object ie an object perceived by mans senses be it a book or a painting and the psychoepistemological process goes from the perception of the object to the conceptual grasp of its meaning to an appraisal in terms of ones basic values to a consequent emotion the pattern is from perceptionto conceptual understandingto appraisalto emotion the pattern of the process involved in music is from perceptionto emotionto appraisalto conceptual understanding music is experienced as if it had the power to reach mans emotions directly as in the case of all emotions existential or esthetic the psychoepistemological processes involved in the response to music are automatized and are experienced as a single instantaneous reaction faster than one can identify its components it is possible to observe introspectively up to a certain point what ones mind does while listening to music it evokes subconscious materialimages actions scenes actual or imaginary experiencesthat seems to flow haphazardly without direction in brief random snatches merging changing and vanishing like the progression of a dream but in fact this flow is selective and consistent the emotional meaning of the subconscious material corresponds to the emotions projected by the music subconsciously ie implicitly man knows that he cannot experience an actually causeless and objectless emotion when music induces an emotional state without external object his subconscious suggests an internal one the process is wordless directed in effect by the equivalent of the words i would feel this way if if i were in a beautiful garden on a spring morning if i were dancing in a great brilliant ballroom if i were seeing the person i love i would feel this way if if i were fighting a violent storm at sea if i were climbing up the crumbling side of a mountain if i were on the barricades i would feel this way if if i reached the top of that mountain if i stood in full sunlight if i leaped over that barrier as i did today as i will tomorrow observe three aspects of this phenomenon it is induced by deliberately suspending ones conscious thoughts and surrendering to the guidance of ones emotions the subconscious material has to flow because no single image can capture the meaning of the musical experience the mind needs a succession of images it is groping for that which they have in common ie for an emotional abstraction the process of emotional abstractionie the process of classifying things according to the emotions they evokeis the process by which one formed ones sense of life a sense of life is a preconceptual equivalent of metaphysics an emotional subconsciously integrated appraisal of man and of existence it is in terms of his fundamental emotionsie the emotions produced by his own metaphysical valuejudgmentsthat man responds to music music cannot tell a story it cannot deal with concretes it cannot convey a specific existential phenomenon such as a peaceful countryside or a stormy sea the theme of a composition entitled spring song is not spring but the emotions which spring evoked in the composer even concepts which intellectually belong to a complex level of abstraction such as peace revolution religion are too specific too concrete to be expressed in music all that music can do with such themes is convey the emotions of serenity or defiance or exaltation liszts st francis walking on the waters was inspired by a specific legend but what it conveys is a passionately dedicated struggle and triumphby whom and in the name of what is for each individual listener to supply music communicates emotions which one grasps but does not actually feel what one feels is a suggestion a kind of distant dissociated depersonalized emotionuntil and unless it unites with ones own sense of life but since the musics emotional content is not communicated conceptually or evoked existentially one does feel it in some peculiar subterranean way music conveys the same categories of emotions to listeners who hold widely divergent views of life as a rule men agree on whether a given piece of music is gay or sad or violent or solemn but even though in a generalized way they experience the same emotions in response to the same music there are radical differences in how they appraise this experienceie how they feel about these feelings on a number of occasions i made the following experiment i asked a group of guests to listen to a recorded piece of music then describe what image action or event it evoked in their minds spontaneously and inspirationally without conscious devising or thought it was a kind of auditory thematic apperception test the resulting descriptions varied in concrete details in clarity in imaginative color but all had grasped the same basic emotionwith eloquent differences of appraisal for example there was a continuum of mixed responses between two pure extremes which condensed were i felt exalted because this music is so lightheartedly happy and i felt irritated because this music is so lightheartedly happy and therefore superficial psychoepistemologically the pattern of the response to music seems to be as follows one perceives the music one grasps the suggestion of a certain emotional state and with ones sense of life serving as the criterion one appraises this state as enjoyable or painful desirable or undesirable significant or negligible according to whether it corresponds to or contradicts ones fundamental feeling about life when the emotional abstraction projected by the music corresponds to ones sense of life the abstraction acquires a full bright almost violent realityand one feels at times an emotion of greater intensity than any experienced existentially when the emotional abstraction projected by the music is irrelevant to or contradicts ones sense of life one feels nothing except a dim uneasiness or resentment or a special kind of enervating boredom as corroborating evidence i have observed a number of cases involving persons who over a period of time underwent a significant change in their fundamental view of life some in the direction of improvement others of deterioration their musical preferences changed accordingly the change was gradual automatic and subconscious without any decision or conscious intention on their part it must be stressed that the pattern is not so gross and simple as preferring gay music to sad music or vice versa according to a benevolent or malevolent view of the universe the issue is much more complex and much more specifically musical than that it is not merely what particular emotion a given composition conveys but how it conveys it by what musical means or method for instance i like operetta music of a certain kind but i would take a funeral march in preference to the blue danube waltz or to the nelson eddyjeanette macdonald kind of music as in the case of any other art or any human product the historical development of music followed the development of philosophy but the differences in the music produced by various cultures in the various eras of history are deeper than those among the other arts even the sounds used and the scales are different western man can understand and enjoy oriental painting but oriental music is unintelligible to him it evokes nothing it sounds like noise in this respect the differences in the music of various cultures resemble the differences in language a given language is unintelligible to foreigners but language expresses concepts and different languages can be translated into one another different kinds of music cannot there is no common vocabulary of music not even among the individual members of the same culture music communicates emotionsand it is highly doubtful whether the music of different cultures communicates the same emotions mans emotional capacity as such is universal but the actual experience of particular emotions is not the experience of certain senseoflife emotions precludes the experience of certain others this brings us to the great unanswered question why does music make us experience emotions in the other arts whose works are perceived by the normal cognitive process the answer can be found in the work itself by a conceptual analysis of its nature and meaning a common vocabulary and an objective criterion of esthetic judgment can be established there is no such vocabulary or criterion at present in the field of musicneither among different cultures nor within the same culture it is obvious that the answer lies in the nature of the work since it is the work that evokes the emotions but how does it do it why does a succession of sounds produce an emotional reaction why does it involve mans deepest emotions and his crucial metaphysical values how can sounds reach mans emotions directly in a manner that seems to bypass his intellect what does a certain combination of sounds do to mans consciousness to make him identify it as gay or sad no one has yet discovered the answers and i hasten to add neither have i the formulation of a common vocabulary of music would require these answers it would require a translation of the musical experience the inner experience into conceptual terms an explanation of why certain sounds strike us a certain way a definition of the axioms of musical perception from which the appropriate esthetic principles could be derived which would serve as a base for the objective validation of esthetic judgments this means that we need a clear conceptual distinction and separation of object from subject in the field of musical perception such as we do possess in the other arts and in the wider field of our cognitive faculty conceptual cognition necessitates this separation until a man is able to distinguish his inner processes from the facts which he perceives he remains on the perceptual level of awareness an animal cannot grasp such a distinction neither can a very young child man has grasped it in regard to his other senses and his other arts he can tell whether a blurring of his vision is produced by a thick fog or by his failing eyesight it is only in the field of specifically musical perception that man is still in a state of early infancy in listening to music a man cannot tell clearly neither to himself nor to othersand therefore cannot provewhich aspects of his experience are inherent in the music and which are contributed by his own consciousness he experiences it as an indivisible whole he feels as if the magnificent exaltation were there in the musicand he is helplessly bewildered when he discovers that some men do experience it and some do not in regard to the nature of music mankind is still on the perceptual level of awareness until a conceptual vocabulary is discovered and defined no objectively valid criterion of esthetic judgment is possible in the field of music there are certain technical criteria dealing mainly with the complexity of harmonic structures but there are no criteria for identifying the content ie the emotional meaning of a given piece of music and thus demonstrating the esthetic objectivity of a given response at present our understanding of music is confined to the gathering of material ie to the level of descriptive observations until it is brought to the stage of conceptualization we have to treat musical tastes or preferences as a subjective matternot in the metaphysical but in the epistemological sense ie not in the sense that these preferences are in fact causeless and arbitrary but in the sense that we do not know their cause no one therefore can claim the objective superiority of his choices over the choices of others where no objective proof is available its every man for himselfand only for himself the nature of musical perception has not been discovered because the key to the secret of music is physiologicalit lies in the nature of the process by which man perceives soundsand the answer would require the joint effort of a physiologist a psychologist and a philosopher an esthetician the start of a scientific approach to this problem and the lead to an answer were provided by helmholtz the great physiologist of the nineteenth century he concludes his book on the sensations of tone as a physiological basis for the theory of music with the following statement here i close my work it appears to me that i have carried it as far as the physiological properties of the sensation of hearing exercise a direct influence on the construction of a musical system that is as far as the work especially belongs to natural philosophy the real difficulty would lie in the development of the psychical motives which here in the esthetics of music assert themselves certainly this is the point where the more interesting part of musical esthetics begins the aim being to explain the wonders of great works of art and to learn the utterances and actions of the various affections of the mind but however alluring such an aim may be i prefer leaving others to carry out such investigations in which i should feel myself too much of an amateur while i myself remain on the safe ground of natural philosophy in which i am at home new york dover publications p to my knowledge no one has attempted to carry out such investigations the context and the shrinking scale of modern psychology and philosophy would have made an undertaking of this kind impossible from the standpoint of psychoepistemology i can offer a hypothesis on the nature of mans response to music but i urge the reader to remember that it is only a hypothesis if man experiences an emotion without existential object its only other possible object is the state or actions of his own consciousness what is the mental action involved in the perception of music i am not referring to the emotional reaction which is the consequence but to the process of perception we must remember that integration is a cardinal function of mans consciousness on all the levels of his cognitive development first his brain brings order into his sensory chaos by integrating sense data into percepts this integration is performed automatically it requires effort but no conscious volition his next step is the integration of percepts into concepts as he learns to speak thereafter his cognitive development consists in integrating concepts into wider and ever wider concepts expanding the range of his mind this stage is fully volitional and demands an unremitting effort the automatic processes of sensory integration are completed in his infancy and closed to an adult the single exception is in the field of sounds produced by periodic vibrations ie music the sounds produced by nonperiodic vibrations are noise one may listen to noise for an hour a day or a year and it remains just noise but musical tones heard in a certain kind of succession produce a different resultthe human ear and brain integrate them into a new cognitive experience into what may be called an auditory entity a melody the integration is a physiological process it is performed unconsciously and automatically man is aware of the process only by means of its results helmholtz has demonstrated that the essence of musical perception is mathematical the consonance or dissonance of harmonies depends on the ratios of the frequencies of their tones the brain can integrate a ratio of one to two for instance but not of eight to nine this does not mean that dissonances cannot be integrated they can in the proper musical context helmholtz was concerned mainly with tones heard simultaneously but his demonstration indicates the possibility that the same principles apply to the process of hearing and integrating a succession of musical tones ie a melodyand that the psychoepistemological meaning of a given composition lies in the kind of work it demands of a listeners ear and brain a composition may demand the active alertness needed to resolve complex mathematical relationshipsor it may deaden the brain by means of monotonous simplicity it may demand a process of building an integrated sumor it may break up the process of integration into an arbitrary series of random bitsor it may obliterate the process by a jumble of sounds mathematicallyphysiologically impossible to integrate and thus turn into noise the listener becomes aware of this process in the form of a sense of efficacy or of strain or of boredom or of frustration his reaction is determined by his psychoepistemological sense of lifeie by the level of cognitive functioning on which he feels at home epistemologically a man who has an active mind regards mental effort as an exciting challenge metaphysically he seeks intelligibility he will enjoy the music that requires a process of complex calculations and successful resolution i refer not merely to the complexities of harmony and orchestration but primarily to their core the complexity of melody on which they depend he will be bored by too easy a process of integration like an expert in higher mathematics who is put to the task of solving problems in kindergarten arithmetic he will feel a mixture of boredom and resentment when he hears a series of random bits with which his mind can do nothing he will feel anger revulsion and rebellion against the process of hearing jumbled musical sounds he will experience it as an attempt to destroy the integrating capacity of his mind a man of mixed cognitive habits has epistemologically a limited interest in mental effort and metaphysically tolerates a great deal of fog in his field of awareness he will feel strain when listening to the more demanding type of music but will enjoy the simpler types he may enjoy the broken random kind of music if he is pretentiousand may even become conditioned to accept the jumbled music if he is sufficiently lethargic there may be many other kinds of reactions according to the many different aspects of musical compositions and to the many variants of mens cognitive habits the above examples merely indicate the hypothetical pattern of mans response to music music gives mans consciousness the same experience as the other arts a concretization of his sense of life but the abstraction being concretized is primarily epistemological rather than metaphysical the abstraction is mans consciousness ie his method of cognitive functioning which he experiences in the concrete form of hearing a specific piece of music a mans acceptance or rejection of that music depends on whether it calls upon or clashes with confirms or contradicts his minds way of working the metaphysical aspect of the experience is the sense of a world which he is able to grasp to which his minds working is appropriate music is the only phenomenon that permits an adult to experience the process of dealing with pure sense data single musical tones are not percepts but pure sensations they become percepts only when integrated sensations are mans first contact with reality when integrated into percepts they are the given the selfevident the nottobedoubted music offers man the singular opportunity to reenact on the adult level the primary process of his method of cognition the automatic integration of sense data into an intelligible meaningful entity to a conceptual consciousness it is a unique form of rest and reward conceptual integrations require constant effort and impose a permanent responsibility they involve the risk of error and failure the process of musical integration is automatic and effortless it is experienced as effortless since it is unconscious it is a process of cashing in on the kinds of mental habits one has or has not spent effort to acquire ones reaction to music carries a sense of total certainty as if it were simple selfevident not to be doubted it involves ones emotions ie ones values and ones deepest sense of oneselfit is experienced as a magic union of sensations and thought as if thought had acquired the immediate certainty of direct awareness hence all the mystic clamor about the spiritual or supernatural character of music mysticism the perennial parasite here appropriates a phenomenon which is a product of the union not the dichotomy of mans body and mind it is part physiological part intellectual in regard to the relationship of music to mans state of mind helmholtz indicates the following in a discussion of the difference between the major and minor keys the major mode is well suited for all frames of mind which are completely formed and clearly understood for strong resolve and for soft and gentle or even for sorrowing feelings when the sorrow has passed into the condition of dreamy and yielding regret but it is quite unsuited for indistinct obscure unformed frames of mind or for the expression of the dismal the dreary the enigmatic the mysterious the rude and whatever offends against artistic beautyand it is precisely for these that we require the minor mode with its veiled harmoniousness its changeable scale its ready modulation and less intelligible basis of construction the major mode would be an unsuitable form for such purposes and hence the minor mode has its own proper artistic justification as a separate system on the sensations of tone p my hypothesis would explain why men hear the same emotional content in a given piece of music even though they differ in their evaluations cognitive processes affect mans emotions which affect his body and the influence is reciprocal for instance the successful solution of an intellectual problem creates a joyous triumphant mood failure to solve a problem creates a painful mood of dejection or discouragement and conversely a joyous mood tends to sharpen accelerate energize ones mind a mood of sadness tends to blur the mind to burden it to slow it down observe the melodic and rhythmic characteristics of the types of music we regard as gay or sad if a given process of musical integration taking place in a mans brain resembles the cognitive processes that produce andor accompany a certain emotional state he will recognize it in effect physiologically then intellectually whether he will accept that particular emotional state and experience it fully depends on his senseoflife evaluation of its significance the epistemological aspect of music is the fundamental but not the exclusive factor in determining ones musical preferences within the general category of music of equal complexity it is the emotional element that represents the metaphysical aspect controlling ones enjoyment the issue is not merely that one is able to perceive successfully ie to integrate a series of sounds into a musical entity but also what sort of entity does one perceive the process of integration represents the concretized abstraction of ones consciousness the nature of the music represents the concretized abstraction of existenceie a world in which one feels joyous or sad or triumphant or resigned etc according to ones sense of life one feels yes this is my world and this is how i should feel or no this is not the world as i see it as in the other arts one may appreciate the esthetic value of a given composition yet neither like nor enjoy it the scientific research that would be needed to prove this hypothesis is enormous to indicate just a few of the things which proof would require a computation of the mathematical relationships among the tones of a melodya computation of the time required by the human ear and brain to integrate a succession of musical sounds including the progressive steps the duration and the time limits of the integrating process which would involve the relationship of tones to rhythma computation of the relationships of tones to bars of bars to musical phrases of phrases to ultimate resolutiona computation of the relationships of melody to harmony and of their sum to the sounds of various musical instruments etc the work involved is staggering yet this is what the human brainthe composers the performers and the listenersdoes though not consciously if such calculations were made and reduced to a manageable number of equations ie of principles we would have an objective vocabulary of music it would be a mathematical vocabulary based on the nature of sound and on the nature of mans faculty of hearing ie on what is possible to this faculty the esthetic criterion to be derived from such a vocabulary would be integrationie the range or complexity of the integration achieved by a given composition integrationbecause it is the essence of music as distinguished from noise rangebecause it is the measure of any intellectual achievement until my theory is proved or disproved by scientific evidence of this kind it has to be regarded as a mere hypothesis there is however a great deal of evidence pertaining to the nature of music which we can observe not on the physiological but on the psychologicalexistential level which tends to support my hypothesis the connection of music to mans cognitive faculty is supported by the fact that certain kinds of music have a paralyzing narcotic effect on mans mind they induce a state of trancelike stupor a loss of context of volition of selfawareness primitive music and most oriental music fall into this category the enjoyment of such music is the opposite of the emotional state that a western man would call enjoyment to the western man music is an intensely personal experience and a confirmation of his cognitive powerto the primitive man music brings the dissolution of self and of consciousness in both cases however music is the means of evoking that psychoepistemological state which their respective philosophies regard as proper and desirable for man the deadly monotony of primitive musicthe endless repetition of a few notes and of a rhythmic pattern that beats against the brain with the regularity of the ancient torture of water drops falling on a mans skullparalyzes cognitive processes obliterates awareness and disintegrates the mind such music produces a state of sensory deprivation whichas modern scientists are beginning to discoveris caused by the absence or the monotony of sense stimuli there is no evidence to support the contention that the differences in the music of various cultures are caused by innate physiological differences among various races there is a great deal of evidence to support the hypothesis that the cause of the musical differences is psychoepistemological and therefore ultimately philosophical a mans psychoepistemological method of functioning is developed and automatized in his early childhood it is influenced by the dominant philosophy of the culture in which he grows up if explicitly and implicitly through the general emotional attitude a child grasps that the pursuit of knowledge ie the independent work of his cognitive faculty is important and required of him by his nature he is likely to develop an active independent mind if he is taught passivity blind obedience fear and the futility of questioning or knowing he is likely to grow up as a mentally helpless savage whether in the jungle or in new york city butsince one cannot destroy a human mind totally so long as its possessor remains alivehis brains frustrated needs become a restless incoherent unintelligible groping that frightens him primitive music becomes his narcotic it wipes out the groping it reassures him and reinforces his lethargy it offers him temporarily the sense of a reality to which his stagnant stupor is appropriate now observe that the modern diatonic scale used in western civilization is a product of the renaissance it was developed over a period of time by a succession of musical innovators what motivated them this scale permits the greatest number of consonant harmoniesie of soundcombinations pleasant to the human ear ie integratable by the human brain the manreasonscienceoriented culture of the renaissance and postrenaissance periods represented the first era in history when such a concern as mans pleasure could motivate composers who had the freedom to create today when the influence of western civilization is breaking up the static traditionbound culture of japan young japanese composers are doing talented work in the western style of music the products of americas antirational anticognitive progressive education the hippies are reverting to the music and the drumbeat of the jungle integration is the key to more than music it is the key to mans consciousness to his conceptual faculty to his basic premises to his life and lack of integration will lead to the same existential results in anyone born with a potentially human mind in any century in any place on earth a brief word about socalled modern music no further research or scientific discoveries are required to know with full objective certainty that it is not music the proof lies in the fact that music is the product of periodic vibrationsand therefore the introduction of nonperiodic vibrations such as the sounds of street traffic or of machine gears or of coughs and sneezes ie of noise into an allegedly musical composition eliminates it automatically from the realm of art and of consideration but a word of warning in regard to the vocabulary of the perpetrators of such innovations is in order they spout a great deal about the necessity of conditioning your ear to an appreciation of their music their notion of conditioning is unlimited by reality and by the law of identity man in their view is infinitely conditionable but in fact you can condition a human ear to different types of music it is not the ear but the mind that you have to condition in such cases you cannot condition it to hear noise as if it were music it is not personal training or social conventions that make it impossible but the physiological nature the identity of the human ear and brain let us turn now to the performing arts acting playing a musical instrument singing dancing in these arts the medium employed is the person of the artist his task is not to recreate reality but to implement the recreation made by one of the primary arts this does not mean that the performing arts are secondary in esthetic value or importance but only that they are an extension of and dependent on the primary arts nor does it mean that performers are mere interpreters on the higher levels of his art a performer contributes a creative element which the primary work could not convey by itself he becomes a partner almost a cocreatorif and when he is guided by the principle that he is the means to the end set by the work the basic principles which apply to all the other arts apply to the performing artist as well particularly stylization ie selectivity the choice and emphasis of essentials the structuring of the progressive steps of a performance which lead to an ultimately meaningful sum the performing artists own metaphysical valuejudgments are called upon to create and apply the kind of technique his performance requires for instance an actors view of human grandeur or baseness or courage or timidity will determine how he projects these qualities on the stage a work intended to be performed leaves a wide latitude of creative choice to the artist who will perform it in an almost literal sense he has to embody the soul created by the author of the work a special kind of creativeness is required to bring that soul into full physical reality when the performance and the work literary or musical are perfectly integrated in meaning style and intention the result is a magnificent esthetic achievement and an unforgettable experience for the audience the psychoepistemological role of the performing artstheir relationship to mans cognitive facultylies in the full concretization of the metaphysical abstractions projected by a work of the primary arts the distinction of the performing arts lies in their immediacyin the fact that they translate a work of art into existential action into a concrete event open to direct awareness this is also their danger integration is the hallmark of artand unless the performance and the primary work are fully integrated the result is the opposite of the cognitive function of art it gives the audience an experience of psychoepistemological disintegration a performed event may contain a certain degree of imbalance among its many elements yet still be regarded as art for example a great actor is often able to impart some stature and meaning to an undistinguished playor a great play may project its power in spite of an undistinguished cast such events leave the audience with a sense of wistful frustration but they still offer some partial element of esthetic value when however the imbalance becomes outright contradiction the event falls apart and tumbles outside the boundaries of art for example an actor may decide to rewrite the play without changing a line merely by playing a villain as a hero or vice versa because he disagrees with the authors ideas or wants to play a different kind of role or simply doesnt know any betterand proceeds to present a characterization that clashes with every line he utters the result is an incoherent mess the more so the better the lines and the performance in such a case the event degenerates into meaningless posturing or lower into clowning the disastrously inverted approach to the performing arts is exemplified by the mentality that regards plays as vehicles for stars the traffic smashups of such vehicles and their riders are written all over the esthetic police blotters and are not confined to hollywood the wreckage includes great actors performing trashy playsgreat plays rewritten for a performance by simpering amateurspianists mangling compositions to show off their virtuosity etc the common denominator is a crude reversal of ends and means the how can never replace the whatneither in the primary nor in the performing arts neither in the form of an exquisite style of writing used to say nothing nor in the form of greta garbo exquisitely uttering a truck drivers idea of a love scene among the performing arts dancing requires a special discussion is there an abstract meaning in dancing what does dancing express the dance is the silent partner of music and participates in a division of labor music presents a stylized version of mans consciousness in actionthe dance presents a stylized version of mans body in action stylized means condensed to essential characteristics which are chosen according to an artists view of man music presents an abstraction of mans emotions in the context of his cognitive processesthe dance presents an abstraction of mans emotions in the context of his physical movements the task of the dance is not the projection of single momentary emotions not a pantomime version of joy or sorrow or fear etc but a more profound issue the projection of metaphysical valuejudgments the stylization of mans movements by the continuous power of a fundamental emotional stateand thus the use of mans body to express his sense of life every strong emotion has a kinesthetic element experienced as an impulse to leap or cringe or stamp ones foot etc just as a mans sense of life is part of all his emotions so it is part of all his movements and determines his manner of using his body his posture his gestures his way of walking etc we can observe a different sense of life in a man who characteristically stands straight walks fast gestures decisivelyand in a man who characteristically slumps shuffles heavily gestures limply this particular elementthe overall manner of movingconstitutes the material the special province of the dance the dance stylizes it into a system of motion expressing a metaphysical view of man a system of motion is the essential element the precondition of the dance as an art an indulgence in random movements such as those of children romping in a meadow may be a pleasant game but it is not art the creation of a consistently stylized metaphysically expressive system is so rare an achievement that there are very few distinctive forms of dancing to qualify as art most dance performances are conglomerations of elements from different systems and of random contortions arbitrarily thrown together signifying nothing a male or a female skipping jumping or rolling over a stage is no more artistic than the children in the meadow only more pretentious consider two distinctive systems ballet and the hindu dance which are examples of the dance as an art the keynote of the stylization achieved in ballet is weightlessness paradoxically ballet presents man as almost disembodied it does not distort mans body it selects the kinds of movements that are normally possible to man such as walking on tiptoe and exaggerates them stressing their beautyand defying the law of gravitation a gracefully effortless floating flowing and flying are the essentials of the ballets image of man it projects a fragile kind of strength and a certain inflexible precision but it is man with a fine steel skeleton and without flesh man the spirit not controlling but transcending this earth by contrast the hindu dance presents a man of flesh without skeleton the keynote of its stylization is flexibility undulation writhing it does distort mans body imparting to it the motions of a reptile it includes dislocations normally impossible to man and uncalled for such as the sideways jerking of the torso and of the head which momentarily suggests decapitation this is an image of man as infinitely pliable man adapting himself to an incomprehensible universe pleading with unknowable powers reserving nothing not even his identity within each system specific emotions may be projected or faintly suggested but only as the basic style permits strong passions or negative emotions cannot be projected in ballet regardless of its librettos it cannot express tragedy or fearor sexuality it is a perfect medium for the expression of spiritual love the hindu dance can project passions but not positive emotions it cannot express joy or triumph it is eloquent in expressing fear doomand a physicalistic kind of sexuality i want to mention a form of dancing that has not been developed into a full system but possesses the key elements on which a full distinctive system could be built tap dancing it is of american negro origin it is singularly appropriate to america and distinctly uneuropean its best exponents are bill robinson and fred astaire who combines it with some elements of the ballet tap dancing is completely synchronized with responsive and obedient to the musicby means of a common element crucial to music and to mans body rhythm this form permits the dancer no pause no stillness his feet can touch the ground only long enough to accent the rhythms beat from start to finish no matter what the action of his body his feet continue that even rapid tapping it is like a long series of dashes underscoring his movements he can leap whirl kneel yet never miss a beat it looks at times as if it is a contest between the man and the music as if the music is daring him to followand he is following lightly effortlessly almost casually complete obedience to the music the impression one gets is complete controlmans mind in effortless control of his expertly functioning body the keynote is precision it conveys a sense of purpose discipline claritya mathematical kind of claritycombined with an unlimited freedom of movement and an inexhaustible inventiveness that dares the sudden the unexpected yet never loses the central integrating line the musics rhythm no the emotional range of tap dancing is not unlimited it cannot express tragedy or pain or fear or guilt all it can express is gaiety and every shade of emotion pertaining to the joy of living yes it is my favorite form of the dance music is an independent primary art the dance is not in view of their division of labor the dance is entirely dependent on music with the emotional assistance of music it expresses an abstract meaning without music it becomes meaningless gymnastics it is music the voice of mans consciousness that integrates the dance to man and to art music sets the terms the task of the dance is to follow as closely obediently and expressively as possible the tighter the integration of a given dance to its musicin rhythm in mood in style in themethe greater its esthetic value a clash between dance and music is worse than a clash between actor and play it is an obliteration of the entire performance it permits neither the music nor the dance to be integrated into an esthetic entity in the viewers mindand it becomes a series of jumbled motions superimposed on a series of jumbled sounds observe that the modern antiart trend takes precisely this form in the field of the dance i am not speaking of the socalled modern dance which is neither modern nor dance ballet for instance is being modernized by being danced to inappropriate undanceable music which is used as a mere accompaniment like the tinkling piano in the days of the silent movies only less synchronized with the action add to it the vast infusion of pantomime which is not an art but a childish game it is not acting but expository signaling and you get a form of selfaffronting compromise more abject than anything seen in politics i submit in evidence marguerite and armand as presented by the royal ballet even the pratfalls or the walkingheelsfirst of the socalled modern dance seem innocent by comparison their perpetrators have nothing to betray or to disfigure dancers are performing artists music is the primary work they performwith the help of an important intermediary the choreographer his creative task is similar to that of a stage director but carries a more demanding responsibility a stage director translates a primary work a play into physical actiona choreographer has to translate a primary work a composition of sounds into another medium into a composition of movements and create a structured integrated work a dance this task is so difficult and its esthetically qualified practitioners so rare that the dance has always been slow in its development and extremely vulnerable today it is all but extinct music andor literature are the base of the performing arts and of the largescale combinations of all the arts such as opera or motion pictures the base in this context means that primary art which provides the metaphysical element and enables the performance to become a concretization of an abstract view of man without this base a performance may be entertaining in such fields as vaudeville or the circus but it has nothing to do with art the performance of an aerialist for instance demands an enormous physical skillgreater perhaps and harder to acquire than the skill demanded of a ballet dancerbut what it offers is merely an exhibition of that skill with no further meaning ie a concrete not a concretization of anything in operas and operettas the esthetic base is music with the libretto serving only to provide an appropriate emotional context or opportunity for the musical score and an integrating line for the total performance in this respect there are very few good librettos in motion pictures or television literature is the ruler and termsetter with music serving only as an incidental background accompaniment screen and television plays are subcategories of the drama and in the dramatic arts the play is the thing the play is that which makes it art the play provides the end to which all the rest is the means in all the arts that involve more than one performer a crucially important artist is the director in music his counterpart is the conductor the director is the link between the performing and the primary arts he is a performer in relation to the primary work in the sense that his task is the means to the end set by the workhe is a primary artist in relation to the cast the set designer the cameramen etc in the sense that they are the means to his end which is the translation of the work into physical action as a meaningful stylized integrated whole in the dramatic arts the director is the esthetic integrator this task requires a firsthand understanding of all the arts combined with an unusual power of abstract thought and of creative imagination great directors are extremely rare an average director alternates between the twin pitfalls of abdication and usurpation either he rides on the talents of others and merely puts the actors through random motions signifying nothing which results in a hodgepodge of clashing intentionsor he hogs the show putting everyone through senseless tricks unrelated to or obliterating the play if any on the inverted premise that the play is the means to the end of exhibiting his skill thus placing himself in the category of circus acrobats except that he is much less skillful and much less entertaining as an example of film direction at its best i shall mention fritz lang particularly in his earlier work his silent film siegfried is as close to a great work of art as the films have yet come though other directors seem to grasp it occasionally lang is the only one who has fully understood the fact that visual art is an intrinsic part of films in a much deeper sense than the mere selection of sets and camera anglesthat a motion picture is literally that and has to be a stylized visual composition in motion it has been said that if one stopped the projection of siegfried and cut out a film frame at random it would be as perfect in composition as a great painting every action gesture and movement in this film is calculated to achieve that effect every inch of the film is stylized ie condensed to those stark bare essentials which convey the nature and spirit of the story of its events of its locale the entire picture was filmed indoors including the magnificent legendary forests whose every branch was manmade but does not look so on the screen while lang was making siegfried it is reported a sign hung on the wall of his office nothing in this film is accidental this is the motto of great art very few artists in any field have ever been able to live up to it fritz lang did there are certain flaws in siegfried particularly the nature of the story which is a tragic malevolent universe legendbut this is a metaphysical not an esthetic issue from the aspect of a directors creative task this film is an example of the kind of visual stylization that makes the difference between a work of art and a glorified newsreel potentially motion pictures are a great art but that potential has not as yet been actualized except in single instances and random moments an art that requires the synchronization of so many esthetic elements and so many different talents cannot develop in a period of philosophicalcultural disintegration such as the present its development requires the creative cooperation of men who are united not necessarily by their formal philosophical convictions but by their fundamental view of man ie by their sense of life whatever the variety and the vast potential of the performing arts one must always remember that they are a consequence and an extension of the primary artsand that the primary arts give them the abstract meaning without which no human product or activity can be classified as art the question asked at the start of this discussion was what are the valid forms of artand why these it can now be answered the proper forms of art present a selective recreation of reality in terms needed by mans cognitive faculty which includes his entityperceiving senses and thus assist the integration of the various elements of a conceptual consciousness literature deals with concepts the visual arts with sight and touch music with hearing each art fulfills the function of bringing mans concepts to the perceptual level of his consciousness and allowing him to grasp them directly as if they were percepts the performing arts are a means of further concretization the different branches of art serve to unify mans consciousness and offer him a coherent view of existence whether that view is true or false is not an esthetic matter the crucially esthetic matter is psychoepistemological the integration of a conceptual consciousness this is the reason why all the arts were born in prehistoric times and why man can never develop a new form of art the forms of art do not depend on the content of mans consciousness but on its naturenot on the extent of mans knowledge but on the means by which he acquires it in order to develop a new form of art man would have to acquire a new sense organ the growth of mans knowledge makes possible an unlimited growth and development of the arts scientific discoveries give rise to new subcategories in the various branches of art but these are variants and subcategories or combinations of the same fundamental arts such variants require new rules new methods new techniques but not a change of basic principles for example different techniques are required to write for the stage or screen or television but all these media are subcategories of the drama which is a subcategory of literature and all are subject to the same basic principles the wider a given principle the more innovations and variations it permits and subsumes but it itself is changeless the breach of a basic principle is not a new form of art but merely the destruction of that particular art for example the change from classicism to romanticism in the theater was a legitimate esthetic innovation so was the change from romanticism to naturalism even if motivated by false metaphysical views but the introduction of a narrator into a stage play is not an innovation but a breach of the theaters basic principle which demands that a story be dramatized ie presented in action such a breach is not a new form of art but simply an encroachment by incompetence on a very difficult form and a wedge for the eventual destruction of that particular form a certain type of confusion about the relationship between scientific discoveries and art leads to a frequently asked question is photography an art the answer is no it is a technical not a creative skill art requires a selective recreation a camera cannot perform the basic task of painting a visual conceptualization ie the creation of a concrete in terms of abstract essentials the selection of camera angles lighting or lenses is merely a selection of the means to reproduce various aspects of the given ie of an existing concrete there is an artistic element in some photographs which is the result of such selectivity as the photographer can exercise and some of them can be very beautifulbut the same artistic element purposeful selectivity is present in many utilitarian products in the better kinds of furniture dress design automobiles packaging etc the commercial art work in ads or posters or postage stamps is frequently done by real artists and has greater esthetic value than many paintings but utilitarian objects cannot be classified as works of art if it is asked at this point but why then is a film director to be regarded as an artistthe answer is it is the story that provides an abstract meaning which the film concretizes without a story a director is merely a pretentious photographer a similar type of confusion exists in regard to the decorative arts the task of the decorative arts is to ornament utilitarian objects such as rugs textiles lighting fixtures etc this is a valuable task often performed by talented artists but it is not an art in the estheticphilosophical meaning of the term the psychoepistemological base of the decorative arts is not conceptual but purely sensory their standard of value is appeal to the senses of sight andor touch their material is colors and shapes in nonrepresentational combinations conveying no meaning other than visual harmony the meaning or purpose is concrete and lies in the specific object which they decorate as a recreation of reality a work of art has to be representational its freedom of stylization is limited by the requirement of intelligibility if it does not present an intelligible subject it ceases to be art on the other hand a representational element is a detriment in the decorative arts it is an irrelevant distraction a clash of intentions and although designs of little human figures or landscapes or flowers are often used to decorate textiles or wallpaper they are artistically inferior to the nonrepresentational designs when recognizable objects are subordinated to and treated as a mere pattern of colors and shapes they become incongruous color harmony is a legitimate element but only one out of many more significant elements in the art of painting but in painting colors and shapes are not treated as a decorative pattern visual harmony is a sensory experience and is determined primarily by physiological causes there is a crucial difference between the perception of musical sounds and the perception of colors the integration of musical sounds produces a new cognitive experience which is sensoryconceptual ie the awareness of a melody the integration of colors does not it conveys nothing beyond the awareness of pleasant or unpleasant relationships cognitively the sensation of color qua color is of no significance because color serves an incomparably more important function the sensation of color is the central element of the faculty of sight it is one of the fundamental means of perceiving entities color as such and its physical causes is not an entity but an attribute of entities and cannot exist by itself this fact is ignored by the men who make pretentious attempts to create a new art in the form of color symphonies which consist in projecting moving blobs of color on a screen this produces nothing in a viewers consciousness but the boredom of being unemployed it could conceivably produce an appropriate decorative effect at a carnival or in a night club on new years eve but it has no relation to art such attempts however can be classified as antiart for the following reason the essence of art is integration a kind of superintegration in the sense that art deals with mans widest abstractions his metaphysics and thus expands the power of mans consciousness the notion of color symphonies is a trend in the opposite direction it is an attempt to disintegrate mans consciousness and reduce it to a preperceptual level by breaking up percepts into mere sensations this brings us to the subject of modern art if a gang of menno matter what its slogans motives or goalswere roaming the streets and gouging out peoples eyes people would rebel and would find the words of a righteous protest but when such a gang is roaming the culture bent on annihilating mens minds people remain silent the words they need can be supplied only by philosophy but modern philosophy is the sponsor and spawner of that gang mans mind is much more complex than the best computer and much more vulnerable if you have seen a news photograph of brutes smashing a computer you have seen a physical concretization of the psychological process now going on which is initiated in the plateglass windows of art galleries on the walls of fashionable restaurants and of multibilliondollar business offices in the glossy pages of popular magazines in the technological radiance of movie and television screens decomposition is the postscript to the death of a human body disintegration is the preface to the death of a human mind disintegration is the keynote and goal of modern artthe disintegration of mans conceptual faculty and the retrogression of an adult mind to the state of a mewling infant to reduce mans consciousness to the level of sensations with no capacity to integrate them is the intention behind the reducing of language to grunts of literature to moods of painting to smears of sculpture to slabs of music to noise but there is a philosophically and psychopathologically instructive element in the spectacle of that gutter it demonstratesby the negative means of an absencethe relationships of art to philosophy of reason to mans survival of hatred for reason to hatred for existence after centuries of the philosophers war against reason they have succeededby the method of vivisectionin producing exponents of what man is like when deprived of his rational faculty and these in turn are giving us images of what existence is like to a being with an empty skull while the alleged advocates of reason oppose systembuilding and haggle apologetically over concretebound words or mystically floating abstractions its enemies seem to know that integration is the psychoepistemological key to reason that art is mans psychoepistemological conditioner and that if reason is to be destroyed it is mans integrating capacity that has to be destroyed it is highly doubtful that the practitioners and admirers of modern art have the intellectual capacity to understand its philosophical meaning all they need to do is indulge the worst of their subconscious premises but their leaders do understand the issue consciously the father of modern art is immanuel kant see his critique of judgment i do not know which is worse to practice modern art as a colossal fraud or to do it sincerely those who do not wish to be the passive silent victims of frauds of this kind can learn from modern art the practical importance of philosophy and the consequences of philosophical default specifically it is the destruction of logic that disarmed the victims and more specifically the destruction of definitions definitions are the guardians of rationality the first line of defense against the chaos of mental disintegration works of artlike everything else in the universeare entities of a specific nature the concept requires a definition by their essential characteristics which distinguish them from all other existing entities the genus of art works is manmade objects which present a selective recreation of reality according to the artists metaphysical valuejudgments by means of a specific material medium the species are the works of the various branches of art defined by the particular media which they employ and which indicate their relation to the various elements of mans cognitive faculty mans need of precise definitions rests on the law of identity a is a a thing is itself a work of art is a specific entity which possesses a specific nature if it does not it is not a work of art if it is merely a material object it belongs to some category of material objectsand if it does not belong to any particular category it belongs to the one reserved for such phenomena junk something made by an artist is not a definition of art a beard and a vacant stare are not the defining characteristics of an artist something in a frame hung on a wall is not a definition of painting something with a number of pages in a binding is not a definition of literature something piled together is not a definition of sculpture something made of sounds produced by anything is not a definition of music something glued on a flat surface is not a definition of any art there is no art that uses glue as a medium blades of grass glued on a sheet of paper to represent grass might be good occupational therapy for retarded childrenthough i doubt itbut it is not art because i felt like it is not a definition or validation of anything there is no place for whim in any human activityif it is to be regarded as human there is no place for the unknowable the unintelligible the undefinable the nonobjective in any human product this side of an insane asylum the actions of a human being are motivated by a conscious purpose when they are not they are of no interest to anyone outside a psychotherapists office and when the practitioners of modern art declare that they dont know what they are doing or what makes them do it we should take their word for it and give them no further consideration apriljune basic principles of literature the most important principle of the esthetics of literature was formulated by aristotle who said that fiction is of greater philosophical importance than history because history represents things as they are while fiction represents them as they might be and ought to be this applies to all forms of literature and most particularly to a form that did not come into existence until twentythree centuries later the novel a novel is a long fictional story about human beings and the events of their lives the four essential attributes of a novel are themeplotcharacterizationstyle these are attributes not separable parts they can be isolated conceptually for purposes of study but one must always remember that they are interrelated and that a novel is their sum if it is a good novel it is an indivisible sum these four attributes pertain to all forms of literature ie of fiction with one exception they pertain to novels plays scenarios librettos short stories the single exception is poems a poem does not have to tell a story its basic attributes are theme and style a novel is the major literary formin respect to its scope its inexhaustible potentiality its almost unlimited freedom including the freedom from physical limitations of the kind that restrict a stage play and most importantly in respect to the fact that a novel is a purely literary form of art which does not require the intermediary of the performing arts to achieve its ultimate effect i shall discuss the four major attributes of a novel but i shall ask you to remember that the same basic principles apply with appropriate qualifications to the other literary forms theme a theme is the summation of a novels abstract meaning for instance the theme of atlas shrugged is the role of the mind in mans existence the theme of victor hugos les misérables is the injustice of society toward its lower classes the theme of gone with the wind is the impact of the civil war on southern society a theme may be specifically philosophical or it may be a narrower generalization it may present a certain moralphilosophical position or a purely historical view such as the portrayal of a certain society in a certain era there are no rules or restrictions on the choice of a theme provided it is communicable in the form of a novel but if a novel has no discernible themeif its events add up to nothingit is a bad novel its flaw is lack of integration louis h sullivans famous principle of architecture form follows function can be translated into form follows purpose the theme of a novel defines its purpose the theme sets the writers standard of selection directing the innumerable choices he has to make and serving as the integrator of the novel since a novel is a recreation of reality its theme has to be dramatized ie presented in terms of action life is a process of action the entire content of mans consciousnessthought knowledge ideas valueshas only one ultimate form of expression in his actions and only one ultimate purpose to guide his actions since the theme of a novel is an idea about or pertaining to human existence it is in terms of its effects on or expression in human actions that that idea has to be presented this leads to the crucial attribute of a novelthe plot plot to present a story in terms of action means to present it in terms of events a story in which nothing happens is not a story a story whose events are haphazard and accidental is either an inept conglomeration or at best a chronicle a memoir a reportorial recording not a novel a chronicle real or invented may possess certain values but these values are primarily informativehistorical or sociological or psychologicalnot primarily esthetic or literary they are only partly literary since art is a selective recreation and since events are the building blocks of a novel a writer who fails to exercise selectivity in regard to events defaults on the most important aspect of his art the means of exercising that selectivity and of integrating the events of a story is the plot a plot is a purposeful progression of logically connected events leading to the resolution of a climax the word purposeful in this definition has two applications it applies to the author and to the characters of a novel it demands that the author devise a logical structure of events a sequence in which every major event is connected with determined by and proceeds from the preceding events of the storya sequence in which nothing is irrelevant arbitrary or accidental so that the logic of the events leads inevitably to a final resolution such a sequence cannot be constructed unless the main characters of the novel are engaged in the pursuit of some purposeunless they are motivated by some goals that direct their actions in real life only a process of final causationie the process of choosing a goal then taking the steps to achieve itcan give logical continuity coherence and meaning to a mans actions only men striving to achieve a purpose can move through a meaningful series of events contrary to the prevalent literary doctrines of today it is realism that demands a plot structure in a novel all human actions are goaldirected consciously or subconsciously purposelessness is contrary to mans nature it is a state of neurosis therefore if one is to present man as he isas he is metaphysically by his nature in realityone has to present him in goaldirected action the naturalists object that a plot is an artificial contrivance because in real life events do not fall into a logical pattern that claim depends on the observers viewpoint in the literal sense of the word viewpoint a nearsighted man standing two feet away from the wall of a house and staring at it would declare that the map of the citys streets is an artificial invented contrivance that is not what an airplane pilot would say flying two thousand feet above the city the events of mens lives follow the logic of mens premises and valuesas one can observe if one looks past the range of the immediate moment past the trivial irrelevancies repetitions and routines of daily living and sees the essentials the turning points the direction of a mans life and from that viewpoint one can also observe that the accidents or disasters which interfere with or defeat human goals are a minor and marginal not a major and determining element in the course of human existence the naturalists object that most men do not lead purposeful lives but it has been said that if a writer writes about dull people he does not have to be dull in the same way if a writer writes about purposeless people his story structure does not have to be purposeless provided some of his characters do have a purpose the naturalists object that the events of mens lives are inconclusive diffuse and seldom fall into the clearcut dramatic situations required by a plot structure this is predominantly trueand this is the chief esthetic argument against the naturalist position art is a selective recreation of reality its means are evaluative abstractions its task is the concretization of metaphysical essentials to isolate and bring into clear focus into a single issue or a single scene the essence of a conflict which in real life might be atomized and scattered over a lifetime in the form of meaningless clashes to condense a long steady drizzle of buckshot into the explosion of a blockbusterthat is the highest hardest and most demanding function of art to default on that function is to default on the essence of art and to engage in childs play along its periphery for example most men have inner conflicts of values these conflicts in most lives take the form of small irrationalities petty inconsistencies mean little evasions shabby little acts of cowardice with no crucial moments of choice no vital issues or great decisive battlesand they add up to the stagnant wasted life of a man who has betrayed all his values by the method of a leaking faucet compare that to gail wynands conflict of values in regard to howard roarks trial in the fountainheadand decide which esthetically is the right way to present the ravages of a conflict of values from the aspect of universality as an important attribute of art i will add that gail wynands conflict being a wide abstraction can be reduced in scale and made applicable to the valueconflicts of a grocery clerk but the valueconflicts of a grocery clerk cannot be made applicable to gail wynand nor even to another grocery clerk the plot of a novel serves the same function as the steel skeleton of a skyscraper it determines the use placement and distribution of all the other elements matters such as number of characters background descriptions conversations introspective passages etc have to be determined by what the plot can carry ie have to be integrated with the events and contribute to the progression of the story just as one cannot pile extraneous weight or ornamentation on a building without regard for the strength of its skeleton so one cannot burden a novel with irrelevancies without regard for its plot the penalty in both cases is the same the collapse of the structure if the characters of a novel engage in lengthy abstract discussions of their ideas but their ideas do not affect their actions or the events of the story it is a bad novel an example of that kind is the magic mountain by thomas mann its characters periodically interrupt the story to philosophize about life after which the storyor lack of itgoes on a related though somewhat different example of a bad novel is an american tragedy by theodore dreiser here the author attempts to give significance to a trite story by tacking on to it a theme which is not related to or demonstrated by its events the events deal with an ageold subject the romantic problem of a rotten little weakling who murders his pregnant sweetheart a working girl in order to attempt to marry a rich heiress the alleged theme according to the authors assertions is the evil of capitalism in judging a novel one must take the events as expressing its meaning because it is the events that present what the story is about no amount of esoteric discussions on transcendental topics attached to a novel in which nothing happens except boy meets girl will transform it into anything other than boy meets girl this leads to a cardinal principle of good fiction the theme and the plot of a novel must be integratedas thoroughly integrated as mind and body or thought and action in a rational view of man the link between the theme and the events of a novel is an element which i call the plottheme it is the first step of the translation of an abstract theme into a story without which the construction of a plot would be impossible a plottheme is the central conflict or situation of a storya conflict in terms of action corresponding to the theme and complex enough to create a purposeful progression of events the theme of a novel is the core of its abstract meaningthe plottheme is the core of its events for example the theme of atlas shrugged is the role of the mind in mans existence the plottheme is the men of the mind going on strike against an altruistcollectivist society the theme of les misérables is the injustice of society toward its lower classes the plottheme is the lifelong flight of an exconvict from the pursuit of a ruthless representative of the law the theme of gone with the wind is the impact of the civil war on southern society the plottheme is the romantic conflict of a woman who loves a man representing the old order and is loved by another man representing the new margaret mitchells skill in this novel lies in the fact that the developments of the romantic triangle are determined by the events of the civil war and involve in a single plot structure other characters who are representative of the various levels of southern society the integration of an important theme with a complex plot structure is the most difficult achievement possible to a writer and the rarest its great masters are victor hugo and dostoevsky if you wish to see literary art at its highest study the manner in which the events of their novels proceed from express illustrate and dramatize their themes the integration is so perfect that no other events could have conveyed the theme and no other theme could have created the events i must mention parenthetically that victor hugo interrupts his stories to insert historical essays dealing with various aspects of his subject it is a very bad literary error but it was a convention shared by many writers of the nineteenth century it does not detract from hugos achievement because these essays can be omitted without affecting the structure of the novels and although they do not properly belong in a novel these essays as such are brilliant literarily since a plot is the dramatization of goaldirected action it has to be based on conflict it may be one characters inner conflict or a conflict of goals and values between two or more characters since goals are not achieved automatically the dramatization of a purposeful pursuit has to include obstacles it has to involve a clash a strugglean action struggle but not a purely physical one since art is a concretization of values there are not many errors as bad estheticallyor as dullas fist fights chases escapes and other forms of physical action divorced from any psychological conflict or intellectual valuemeaning physical action as such is not a plot nor a substitute for a plotas many bad writers attempt to make it particularly in todays television dramas this is the other side of the mindbody dichotomy that plagues literature ideas or psychological states divorced from action do not constitute a storyand neither does physical action divorced from ideas and values since the nature of an action is determined by the nature of the entities that act the action of a novel has to proceed from and be consistent with the nature of its characters this leads to the third major attribute of a novel characterization characterization is the portrayal of those essential traits which form the unique distinctive personality of an individual human being characterization requires an extreme degree of selectivity a human being is the most complex entity on earth a writers task is to select the essentials out of that enormous complexity then proceed to create an individual figure endowing it with all the appropriate details down to the telling small touches needed to give it full reality that figure has to be an abstraction yet look like a concrete it has to have the universality of an abstraction and simultaneously the unrepeatable uniqueness of a person in real life we have only two sources of information about the character of the people around us we judge them by what they do and by what they say particularly the first similarly characterization in a novel can be achieved only by two major means action and dialogue descriptive passages dealing with a characters appearance manner etc can contribute to a characterization so can introspective passages dealing with a characters thoughts and feelings so can the comments of other characters but all these are merely auxiliary means which are of no value without the two pillars action and dialogue to recreate the reality of a character one must show what he does and what he says one of the worst errors that a writer can make in the field of characterization is to assert the nature of his characters in narrative passages with no evidence to support his assertions in the characters actions for instance if an author keeps telling us that his hero is virtuous benevolent sensitive heroic but the hero does nothing except that he loves the heroine smiles at the neighbors contemplates the sunset and votes for the democratic partythe result can hardly be called characterization a writer like any other artist must present an evaluative recreation of reality not merely assert his evaluations without any image of reality in the field of characterization one action is worth a thousand adjectives characterization requires the portrayal of essential traits now what are the essentials of a mans character what do we mean in real life when we say that we do not understand a person we mean that we do not understand why he acts as he does and when we say that we know a person well we mean that we understand his actions and know what to expect of him what is it that we know his motivation motivation is a keyconcept in psychology and in fiction it is a mans basic premises and values that form his character and move him to actionand in order to understand a mans character it is the motivation behind his actions that we must understand to know what makes a man tick we must ask what is he after to recreate the reality of his characters to make both their nature and their actions intelligible it is their motivation that a writer has to reveal he may do it gradually revealing it bit by bit building up the evidence as the story progresses but at the end of the novel the reader must know why the characters did the things they did the depth of a characterization depends on the psychological level of motivation which a writer regards as sufficient to illuminate human behavior for instance in an average detective story the criminals are motivated by the superficial notion of material greedbut a novel such as dostoevskys crime and punishment reveals the soul of a criminal all the way down to his philosophical premises consistency is a major requirement of characterization this does not mean that a character has to hold nothing but consistent premisessome of the most interesting characters in fiction are men torn by inner conflicts it means that the author has to be consistent in his view of a characters psychology and permit him no inexplicable actions no actions unprepared by or contradictory to the rest of his characterization it means that a characters contradictions should never be unintentional on the part of the author to maintain the inner logic of his characterizations a writer must understand the logical chain that leads from the motives of his characters to their actions to maintain their motivational consistency he must know their basic premises and the key actions to which these premises will lead them in the course of the story when he writes the actual scenes in which the characters appear their premises act as the selectors of all the details and small touches he decides to include such details are innumerable the opportunities for revealing a characters nature are virtually inexhaustible and it is the knowledge of what he has to reveal that guides the writers selections the best way to demonstrate what the process of characterization accomplishes the means by which it is done and the disastrous consequences of contradictions is to illustrate it in action on a specific example i shall do it by means of two scenes reproduced below one is a scene from the fountainhead as it stands in the novelthe other is the same scene as i rewrote it for the purpose of this demonstration both versions present only the bare skeleton of the scene only the dialogue omitting the descriptive passages it will be sufficient to illustrate the process it is the first scene in which howard roark and peter keating appear together it takes place on the evening of the day when roark was expelled from college and keating graduated with high honors the action of the scene consists of one young man asking the advice of another about a professional choice he has to make but what kind of young men are they what are their attitudes premises and motives observe what one can learn from a single scene and how much your the readers mind registers automatically here is the scene as originally written as it stands in the novel congratulations peter said roark oh oh thanks i mean do you know or has mother been telling you she has she shouldnt have why not look howard you know that im terribly sorry about your being forget it i theres something i want to speak to you about howard to ask your advice mind if i sit down what is it you wont think that its awful of me to be asking about my business when youve just been i said forget about that what is it you know ive often thought that youre crazy but i know that you know many things about itarchitecture i meanwhich those fools never knew and i know that you love it as they never will well well i dont know why i should come to you buthoward ive never said it before but you see id rather have your opinion on things than the deans id probably follow the deans but its just that yours means more to me myself i dont know why i dont know why im saying this either come on youre not being afraid of me are you what do you want to ask about its about my scholarship the paris prize i got yes its for four years but on the other hand guy francon offered me a job with him some time ago today he said its still open and i dont know which to take if you want my advice peter youve made a mistake already by asking me by asking anyone never ask people not about your work dont you know what you want how can you stand it not to know you see thats what i admire about you howard you always know drop the compliments but i mean it how do you always manage to decide how can you let others decide for you this was the scene as it stands in the novel now here is the same scene rewritten congratulations peter said roark oh oh thanks i mean do you know or has mother been telling you she has she shouldnt have oh well i didnt mind it look howard you know that im terribly sorry about your being expelled thank you peter i theres something i want to speak to you about howard to ask your advice mind if i sit down go right ahead ill be glad to help you if i can you wont think that its awful of me to be asking about my business when youve just been expelled no but its nice of you to say that peter i appreciate it you know ive often thought that youre crazy why well the kind of ideas youve got about architecturetheres nobody thats ever agreed with you nobody of importance not the dean not any of the professors and they know their business theyre always right i dont know why i should come to you well there are many different opinions in the world what did you want to ask me its about my scholarship the paris prize i got personally i wouldnt like it but i know its important to you its for four years but on the other hand guy francon offered me a job with him some time ago today he said its still open and i dont know which to take if you want my advice peter take the job with guy francon i dont care for his work but hes a very prominent architect and youll learn how to build you see thats what i admire about you howard you always know how to decide i try my best how do you do it i guess i just do it but you see im not sure howard im never sure of myself you always are oh i wouldnt say that but i guess im sure about my work this is an example of humanizing a character a young reader to whom i showed this scene said with astonished indignation hes not awfulhes just completely ordinary let us analyze what the two scenes have conveyed in the original scene roark is impervious to keatings or the worlds view of his expulsion he does not even conceive of any comparative standard of any relation between his expulsion and keatings success roark is courteous to keating but completely indifferent roark relents and shows a touch of friendliness only when keating acknowledges his respect for roarks architectural ideas and only when keating shows an earnest sincerity roarks advice to keating about independence shows the generosity of taking keatings problem seriouslyroark gives him advice not about a specific choice but about a crucial basic principle the essence of the difference between their fundamental premises is focused in two lines of dialogue keating how do you always manage to decideroark how can you let others decide for you in the rewritten scene roark accepts the standards of keating and his motherthe estimate of his expulsion as disaster and of keatings graduation as triumphbut he is generously tolerant about it roark shows interest in keatings future and eagerness to help him roark accepts the charity of keatings condolences at keatings insulting comment on his ideas roark shows concern by asking why roark shows a tolerant respect for all differences of opinion thus confessing a nonobjective relativistic view of ideas and values roark gives keating specific advice about his choice finding nothing wrong in keatings reliance on another mans judgment roark is modest about his selfconfidence and tries to minimize it he does not hold selfconfidence as a major virtue he sees no wider principle no reason why he should be confident in issues other than his work thus he indicates that he is merely a superficial concretebound professional man who might have some integrity in regard to his work but no wider concept of integrity no wider principles no philosophical convictions or values if roark were that type of man he would not be able to withstand for more than a year or two the kind of battle he had to fight for the next eighteen years nor would he be able to win it if that rewritten scene were used in the novel instead of the original scene with a few other softening touches to match it none of the subsequent events of the story would make sense roarks later actions would become incomprehensible unjustifiable psychologically impossible his characterization would fall apart and so would the story and so would the novel now it should be clear why the major elements of a novel are attributes not separable parts and in what manner they are interrelated the theme of a novel can be conveyed only through the events of the plot the events of the plot depend on the characterization of the men who enact themand the characterization cannot be achieved except through the events of the plot and the plot cannot be constructed without a theme this is the kind of integration required by the nature of a novel and this is why a good novel is an indivisible sum every scene sequence and passage of a good novel has to involve contribute to and advance all three of its major attributes theme plot characterization there is no rule about which of these three attributes should come first to a writers mind and initiate the process of constructing a novel a writer may begin by choosing a theme then translate it into the appropriate plot and the kind of characters needed to enact it or he may begin by thinking of a plot that is a plottheme then determine the characters he needs and define the abstract meaning his story will necessarily imply or he may begin by projecting certain characters then determine what conflicts their motives will lead to what events will result and what will be the storys ultimate meaning it does not matter where a writer begins provided he knows that all three attributes have to unite into so well integrated a sum that no starting point can be discerned as to the fourth major attribute of a novel the style it is the means by which the other three are presented style the subject of style is so complex that it cannot be covered in a single discussion i shall merely indicate a few essentials a literary style has two fundamental elements each subsuming a large number of lesser categories the choice of content and the choice of words by choice of content i mean those aspects of a given passage whether description narrative or dialogue which a writer chooses to communicate and which involve the consideration of what to include or to omit by choice of words i mean the particular words and sentence structures a writer uses to communicate them for instance when a writer describes a beautiful woman his stylistic choice of content will determine whether he mentions or stresses her face or body or manner of moving or facial expression etc whether the details he includes are essential and significant or accidental and irrelevant whether he presents them in terms of facts or of evaluations etc his choice of words will convey the emotional implications or connotations the valueslanting of the particular content he has chosen to communicate he will achieve a different effect if he describes a woman as slender or thin or svelte or lanky etc let us compare the literary style of two excerpts from two different novels reproduced below both are descriptions of the same subject new york city at night observe which one of them recreates the visual reality of a specific scene and which one deals with vague emotional assertions and floating abstractions first excerpt nobody ever walked across the bridge not on a night like this the rain was misty enough to be almost foglike a cold gray curtain that separated me from the pale ovals of white that were faces locked behind the steamedup windows of the cars that hissed by even the brilliance that was manhattan by night was reduced to a few sleepy yellow lights off in the distance some place over there i had left my car and started walking burying my head in the collar of my raincoat with the night pulled in around me like a blanket i walked and i smoked and i flipped the spent butts ahead of me and watched them arch to the pavement and fizzle out with one last wink second excerpt that hour that moment and that place struck with a peerless coincision upon the very heart of his own youth the crest and zenith of his own desire the city had never seemed as beautiful as it looked that night for the first time he saw that new york was supremely among the cities of the world the city of the night there had been achieved here a loveliness that was astounding and incomparable a kind of modern beauty inherent to its place and time that no other place nor time could match he realized suddenly that the beauty of other cities of the nightof paris spread below one from the butte of sacrécoeur in its vast mysterious blossoms of nocturnal radiance of london with its smoky nimbus of fogged light which was so peculiarly thrilling because it was so vast so lost in the illimitablehad each its special quality so lovely and mysterious but had yet produced no beauty that could equal this the first excerpt is by mickey spillane from his novel one lonely night the second excerpt is by thomas wolfe from his novel the web and the rock both writers had to recreate a visual scene and convey a certain mood observe the difference in their methods there is not a single emotional word or adjective in spillanes description he presents nothing save visual facts but he selects only those facts only those eloquent details which convey the visual reality of the scene and create a mood of desolate loneliness wolfe does not describe the city he does not give us a single characteristic visual detail he asserts that the city is beautiful but does not tell us what makes it beautiful such words as beautiful astounding incomparable thrilling lovely are estimates in the absence of any indication of what aroused these estimates they are arbitrary assertions and meaningless generalities spillanes style is realityoriented and addressed to an objective psychoepistemology he provides the facts and expects the reader to react accordingly wolfes style is emotionoriented and addressed to a subjective psychoepistemology he expects the reader to accept emotions divorced from facts and to accept them secondhand spillane has to be read in full focus because the readers own mind has to estimate the given facts and evoke an appropriate emotion if one reads him out of focus one gets nothingthere are no loose readymade generalizations no predigested emotions if one reads wolfe out of focus one gets a vague grandiloquent approximation suggesting that he has said something important or uplifting if one reads him in full focus one sees that he has said nothing these are not the only attributes of a literary style i have used these examples only to indicate some very broad categories a great many other elements are involved in these two excerpts and in any piece of writing style is the most complex aspect of literature and psychologically the most revealing but style is not an end in itself it is only a means to an endthe means of telling a story the writer who develops a beautiful style but has nothing to say represents a kind of arrested esthetic development he is like a pianist who acquires a brilliant technique by playing fingerexercises but never gives a concert the typical literary product of such writersand of their imitators who possess no styleare socalled moodstudies popular among todays literati which are little pieces conveying nothing but a certain mood such pieces are not an artform they are merely fingerexercises that never develop into art art is a recreation of reality which can and does affect a readers mood this however is merely one of the byproducts of art but the attempt to affect the readers mood bypassing any meaningful recreation of reality is an attempt to divorce consciousness from existenceto make consciousness not reality the focal point of art to regard a momentary emotion a mood as an end in itself observe that a modern painter offers some smears of paint over a crudely inept drawing and boasts about his colorharmonieswhile to a real painter colorharmony is only one of the means he has to master for the achievement of a much more complex and important end similarly a modern writer offers some evocative sentences adding up to a trivial vignette and boasts about the mood he has createdwhile to a real writer the recreation of a mood is only one of the means he has to master for the achievement of such complex elements as theme plot characterization which have to be integrated into so gigantic an end as a novel this particular issue is an eloquent illustration of the relationship between philosophy and art just as modern philosophy is dominated by the attempt to destroy the conceptual level of mans consciousness and even the perceptual level reducing mans awareness to mere sensationsso modern art and literature are dominated by the attempt to disintegrate mans consciousness and reduce it to mere sensations to the enjoyment of meaningless colors noises and moods the art of any given period or culture is a faithful mirror of that cultures philosophy if you see obscene dismembered monstrosities leering at you from todays esthetic mirrorsthe aborted creations of mediocrity irrationality and panicyou are seeing the embodied concretized reality of the philosophical premises that dominate todays culture only in this sense can those manifestations be called artnot by the intention or accomplishment of their perpetrators but only by grace of the fact that even in usurping the field of art one cannot escape from its revelatory power it is a frightening sight but it has a certain didactic value those who do not wish to surrender their future to the mercy and power of unfocused gargoyles can learn from them what swamp is their breeding ground and what disinfectant is needed to fight them the swamp is modern philosophy the disinfectant is reason julyaugust what is romanticism romanticism is a category of art based on the recognition of the principle that man possesses the faculty of volition art is a selective recreation of reality according to an artists metaphysical valuejudgments an artist recreates those aspects of reality which represent his fundamental view of man and of existence in forming a view of mans nature a fundamental question one must answer is whether man possesses the faculty of volitionbecause ones conclusions and evaluations in regard to all the characteristics requirements and actions of man depend on the answer their opposite answers to this question constitute the respective basic premises of two broad categories of art romanticism which recognizes the existence of mans volitionand naturalism which denies it in the field of literature the logical consequences of these basic premises whether held consciously or subconsciously determine the form of the key elements of a literary work if man possesses volition then the crucial aspect of his life is his choice of valuesif he chooses values then he must act to gain andor keep themif so then he must set his goals and engage in purposeful action to achieve them the literary form expressing the essence of such action is the plot a plot is a purposeful progression of logically connected events leading to the resolution of a climax the faculty of volition operates in regard to the two fundamental aspects of mans life consciousness and existence ie his psychological action and his existential action ie the formation of his own character and the course of action he pursues in the physical world therefore in a literary work both the characterizations and the events are to be created by the author according to his view of the role of values in human psychology and existence and according to the code of values he holds to be right his characters are abstract projections not reproductions of concretes they are invented conceptually not copied reportorially from the particular individuals he might have observed the specific characters of particular individuals are merely the evidence of their particular valuechoices and have no wider metaphysical significance except as material for the study of the general principles of human psychology they do not exhaust mans characterological potential if man does not possess volition then his life and his character are determined by forces beyond his controlif so then the choice of values is impossible to himif so then such values as he appears to hold are only an illusion predetermined by the forces he has no power to resistif so then he is impotent to achieve his goals or to engage in purposeful actionand if he attempts the illusion of such action he will be defeated by those forces and his failure or occasional success will have no relation to his actions the literary form expressing the essence of this view is plotlessness since there can be no purposeful progression of events no logical continuity no resolution no climax if mans character and the course of his life are the product of unknown or unknowable forces then in a literary work both the characterizations and the events are not to be invented by the author but are to be copied from such particular characters and events as he has observed since he denies the existence of any effective motivational principle in human psychology he cannot create his characters conceptually he can only observe the people he meets as he observes inanimate objects and reproduce themin the implicit hope that some clue to the unknown forces controlling human destiny may be discovered in such reproductions these basic premises of romanticism and naturalism the volition or antivolition premise affect all the other aspects of a literary work such as the choice of theme and the quality of the style but it is the nature of the story structurethe attribute of plot or plotlessnessthat represents the most important difference between them and serves as the main distinguishing characteristic for classifying a given work in one category or the other this is not to say that a writer identifies and applies all the consequences of his basic premise by a conscious process of thought art is the product of a mans subconscious integrations of his sense of life to a larger extent than of his conscious philosophical convictions even the choice of the basic premise may be subconscioussince artists like any other men seldom translate their sense of life into conscious terms and since an artists sense of life may be as full of contradictions as that of any other man these contradictions become apparent in his work the dividing line between romanticism and naturalism is not always maintained consistently in every aspect of every given work of art particularly since one of these basic premises is false but if one surveys the field of art and studies the works produced one will observe that the degree of consistency in the consequences of these two basic premises is a remarkably eloquent demonstration of the power of metaphysical premises in the realm of art with very rare and partial exceptions romanticism is nonexistent in todays literature this is not astonishing when one considers the crushing weight of the philosophical wreckage under which generations of men have been brought upa wreckage dominated by the doctrines of irrationalism and determinism in their formative years young people could not find much evidence on which to develop a rational benevolent valueoriented sense of life neither in philosophical theory nor in its cultural echoes nor in the daily practice of the passively deteriorating society around them but observe the psychological symptoms of an unrecognized unidentified issue the virulently intense antagonism of todays esthetic spokesmen to any manifestation of the romantic premise in art it is particularly the attribute of plot in literature that arouses an impassioned hostility among thema hostility with deeply personal overtones too violent for a mere issue of literary canons if plot were a negligible and inappropriate element of literature as they claim it to be why the hysterical hatred in their denunciations this type of reaction pertains to metaphysical issues ie to issues that threaten the foundations of a persons entire view of life if that view is irrational what they sense in a plot structure is the implicit premise of volition and therefore of moral values the same reaction for the same subconscious reason is evoked by such elements as heroes or happy endings or the triumph of virtue or in the visual arts beauty physical beauty is not a moral or volitional issuebut the choice to paint a beautiful human being rather than an ugly one implies the existence of volition of choice standards values the destruction of romanticism in estheticslike the destruction of individualism in ethics or of capitalism in politicswas made possible by philosophical default it is one more demonstration of the principle that that which is not known explicitly is not in mans conscious control in all three cases the nature of the fundamental values involved had never been defined explicitly the issues were fought in terms of nonessentials and the values were destroyed by men who did not know what they were losing or why this was the predominant pattern of issues in the field of esthetics which throughout history has been a virtual monopoly of mysticism the definition of romanticism given here is mineit is not a generally known or accepted one there is no generally accepted definition of romanticism nor of any key element in art nor of art itself romanticism is a product of the nineteenth centurya largely subconscious result of two great influences aristotelianism which liberated man by validating the power of his mindand capitalism which gave mans mind the freedom to translate ideas into practice the second of these influences was itself the result of the first but while the practical consequences of aristotelianism were reaching mens daily existence its theoretical influence was long since gone philosophy since the renaissance had been retrogressing overwhelmingly to the mysticism of plato thus the historically unprecedented events of the nineteenth centurythe industrial revolution the childprodigy speed in the growth of science the skyrocketing standard of living the liberated torrent of human energywere left without intellectual direction or evaluation the nineteenth century was guided not by an aristotelian philosophy but by an aristotelian sense of life and like a brilliantly violent adolescent who fails to translate his sense of life into conscious terms it burned itself out choked by the blind confusions of its own overpowering energy whatever their conscious convictions the artists of that centurys great new schoolthe romanticistspicked their sense of life out of the cultural atmosphere it was an atmosphere of men intoxicated by the discovery of freedom with all the ancient strongholds of tyrannyof church state monarchy feudalismcrumbling around them with unlimited roads opening in all directions and no barriers set to their newly unleashed energy it was an atmosphere best expressed by that centurys naive exuberant and tragically blind belief that human progress from here on was to be irresistible and automatic esthetically the romanticists were the great rebels and innovators of the nineteenth century but in their conscious convictions they were for the most part antiaristotelian and leaning toward a kind of wild freewheeling mysticism they did not see their own rebellion in fundamental terms they were rebellingin the name of the individual artists freedomnot against determinism but much more superficially against the esthetic establishment of the time against classicism classicism an example of a much deeper superficiality was a school that had devised a set of arbitrary concretely detailed rules purporting to represent the final and absolute criteria of esthetic value in literature these rules consisted of specific edicts loosely derived from the greek and french tragedies which prescribed every formal aspect of a play such as the unity of time place and action down to the number of acts and the number of verses permitted to a character in every act some of that stuff was based on aristotles esthetics and can serve as an example of what happens when concretebound mentalities seeking to bypass the responsibility of thought attempt to transform abstract principles into concrete prescriptions and to replace creation with imitation for an example of classicism that survived well into the twentieth century i refer you to the architectural dogmas represented by howard roarks antagonists in the fountainhead even though the classicists had no answer to why their rules were to be accepted as valid except the usual appeal to tradition to scholarship and to the prestige of antiquity this school was regarded as the representative of reason such were the roots of one of the grimmest ironies in cultural history the early attempts to define the nature of romanticism declared it to be an esthetic school based on the primacy of emotionsas against the champions of the primacy of reason which were the classicists and later the naturalists in various forms this definition has persisted to our day it is an example of the intellectually disastrous consequences of definitions by nonessentialsand an example of the penalty one pays for a nonphilosophical approach to cultural phenomena one can observe the misapprehended element of truth that gave rise to that early classification what the romanticists brought to art was the primacy of values an element that had been missing in the stale arid thirdand fourthhand and rate repetitions of the classicists formulacopying values and valuejudgments are the source of emotions a great deal of emotional intensity was projected in the work of the romanticists and in the reactions of their audiences as well as a great deal of color imagination originality excitement and all the other consequences of a valueoriented view of life this emotional element was the most easily perceivable characteristic of the new movement and it was taken as its defining characteristic without deeper inquiry such issues as the fact that the primacy of values in human life is not an irreducible primary that it rests on mans faculty of volition and therefore that the romanticists philosophically were the champions of volition which is the root of values and not of emotions which are merely the consequenceswere issues to be defined by philosophers who defaulted in regard to esthetics as they did in regard to every other crucial aspect of the nineteenth century the still deeper issue the fact that the faculty of reason is the faculty of volition was not known at the time and the various theories of free will were for the most part of an antirational character thus reinforcing the association of volition with mysticism the romanticists saw their cause primarily as a battle for their right to individuality andunable to grasp the deepest metaphysical justification of their cause unable to identify their values in terms of reasonthey fought for individuality in terms of feelings surrendering the banner of reason to their enemies there were other lesser consequences of this fundamental error all of them symptoms of the intellectual confusion of the age groping blindly for a metaphysically oriented grandscale exalted way of life the romanticists predominantly were enemies of capitalism which they regarded as a prosaic materialistic petty bourgeois systemnever realizing that it was the only system that could make freedom individuality and the pursuit of values possible in practice some of them chose to be advocates of socialism some turned for inspiration to the middle ages and became shameless glamorizers of that nightmare era some ended up where most champions of the nonrational end up in religion all of it served to accelerate romanticisms growing break with reality when in the later half of the nineteenth century naturalism rose to prominence and assuming the mantle of reason and reality proclaimed the artists duty to portray things as they areromanticism did not have much of an opposition to offer it must be noted that philosophers contributed to the confusion surrounding the term romanticism they attached the name romantic to certain philosophers such as schelling and schopenhauer who were avowed mystics advocating the supremacy of emotions instincts or will over reason this movement in philosophy had no significant relation to romanticism in esthetics and the two movements must not be confused the common nomenclature however is significant in one respect it indicates the depth of the confusion on the subject of volition the romantic philosophers theories were a viciously malevolent existencehating attempt to uphold volition in the name of whim worship while the esthetic romanticists were groping blindly to uphold volition in the name of mans life and values here on earth in terms of essentials the brilliant sunlight of victor hugos universe is the diametrical opposite of the venomous muck of schopenhauers it was only philosophical packagedealing that could throw them in the same category but the issue demonstrates the profound importance of the subject of volition and the grotesque distortions it assumes when men are unable to grasp its nature this issue may also serve as an illustration of the importance of establishing that volition is a function of mans rational faculty in recent times some literary historians have discarded as inadequate the definition of romanticism as an emotionoriented school and have attempted to redefine it but without success following the rule of fundamentality it is as a volitionoriented school that romanticism must be definedand it is in terms of this essential characteristic that the nature and history of romantic literature can be traced and understood the implicit standards of romanticism are so demanding that in spite of the abundance of romantic writers at the time of its dominance this school has produced very few pure consistent romanticists of the top rank among novelists the greatest are victor hugo and dostoevsky and as single novels whose authors were not always consistent in the rest of their works i would name henryk sienkiewiczs quo vadis and nathaniel hawthornes the scarlet letter among playwrights the greatest are friedrich schiller and edmond rostand the distinguishing characteristic of this top rank apart from their purely literary genius is their full commitment to the premise of volition in both of its fundamental areas in regard to consciousness and to existence in regard to mans character and to his actions in the physical world maintaining a perfect integration of these two aspects unmatched in the brilliant ingenuity of their plot structures these writers are enormously concerned with mans soul ie his consciousness they are moralists in the most profound sense of the word their concern is not merely with values but specifically with moral values and with the power of moral values in shaping human character their characters are larger than life ie they are abstract projections in terms of essentials not always successful projections as we shall discuss later in their stories one will never find action for actions sake unrelated to moral values the events of their plots are shaped determined and motivated by the characters values or treason to values by their struggle in pursuit of spiritual goals and by profound valueconflicts their themes are fundamental universal timeless issues of mans existenceand they are the only consistent creators of the rarest attribute of literature the perfect integration of theme and plot which they achieve with superlative virtuosity if philosophical significance is the criterion of what is to be taken seriously then these are the most serious writers in world literature the second rank of romanticists who are still writers of considerable merit but of lesser stature indicates the direction of romanticisms future decline this rank is represented by such writers as walter scott and alexander dumas the distinguishing characteristic of their work is the emphasis on action without spiritual goals or significant moral values their stories have wellbuilt imaginative suspenseful plot structures but the values pursued by their characters and motivating the action are of a primitive superficial emphatically nonmetaphysical order loyalty to a king the reclaiming of a heritage personal revenge etc the conflicts and story lines are predominantly external the characters are abstractions they are not naturalistic copies but they are abstractions of loosely generalized virtues or vices and characterization is minimal in time they become a writers own selfmade bromides such as a brave knight a noble lady a vicious courtierso that they are neither created nor drawn from life but picked from a kind of readytowear collection of stock characters of romanticism the absence of any metaphysical meaning apart from the affirmation of volition implicit in a plot structure is evident in the fact that these novels have plots but no abstract themeswith the storys central conflict serving as the theme usually in the form of some actual or fictionalized historical event going farther down one can observe the breakup of romanticism the contradictions that proceed from a premise held subconsciously on this level there emerges a class of writers whose basic premise in effect is that man possesses volition in regard to existence but not to consciousness ie in regard to his physical actions but not in regard to his own character the distinguishing characteristic of this class is stories of unusual events enacted by conventional characters the stories are abstract projections involving actions one does not observe in real life the characters are commonplace concretes the stories are romantic the characters naturalistic such novels seldom have plots since valueconflicts are not their motivational principle but they do have a form resembling a plot a coherent imaginative often suspenseful story held together by some one central goal or undertaking of the characters the contradictions in such a combination of elements are obvious they lead to a total breach between action and characterization leaving the action unmotivated and the characters unintelligible the reader is left to feel these people couldnt do these things with its emphasis on sheer physical action and neglect of human psychology this class of novels stands on the borderline between serious and popular literature no toprank novelists belong to this category the betterknown ones are writers of science fiction such as h g wells or jules verne occasionally a good writer of the naturalistic school with a repressed element of romanticism attempts a novel on an abstract theme that requires a romantic approach the result falls into this category for example sinclair lewiss it cant happen here it is obvious why the novels of this category are enormously unconvincing and no matter how skillfully or suspensefully their action is presented they always have an unsatisfying uninspiring quality on the other side of the same dichotomy there are romanticists whose basic premise in effect is that man possesses volition in regard to consciousness but not to existence ie in regard to his own character and choice of values but not in regard to the possibility of achieving his goals in the physical world the distinguishing characteristics of such writers are grandscale themes and characters no plots and an overwhelming sense of tragedy the sense of a malevolent universe the chief exponents of this category were poets the leading one is byron whose name has been attached to this particular byronic view of existence its essence is the belief that man must lead a heroic life and fight for his values even though he is doomed to defeat by a malevolent fate over which he has no control today the same view is advocated philosophically by the existentialists but without the grandscale element and with romanticism replaced by a kind of subnaturalism philosophically romanticism is a crusade to glorify mans existence psychologically it is experienced simply as the desire to make life interesting this desire is the root and motor of romantic imagination its greatest example in popular literature is o henry whose unique characteristic is the pyrotechnical virtuosity of an inexhaustible imagination projecting the gaiety of a benevolent almost childlike sense of life more than any other writer o henry represents the spirit of youthspecifically the cardinal element of youth the expectation of finding something wonderfully unexpected around all of lifes corners in the field of popular literature romanticisms virtues and potential flaws may be seen in a simplified more obvious form popular literature is fiction that does not deal with abstract problems it takes moral principles as the given accepting certain generalized commonsense ideas and values as its base commonsense values and conventional values are not the same thing the first can be justified rationally the second cannot even though the second may include some of the first they are justified not on the ground of reason but on the ground of social conformity popular fiction does not raise or answer abstract questions it assumes that man knows what he needs to know in order to live and it proceeds to show his adventures in living which is one of the reasons for its popularity among all types of readers including the problemladen intellectuals the distinctive characteristic of popular fiction is the absence of an explicitly ideational element of the intent to convey intellectual information or misinformation detective adventure sciencefiction novels and westerns belong for the most part to the category of popular fiction the best writers of this category come close to the scottdumas group their emphasis is on action but their heroes and villains are abstract projections and a loosely generalized view of moral values of a struggle between good and evil motivates the action as contemporary examples of the best in this class mickey spillane ian fleming donald hamilton when we go below the top level of popular fiction we descend into a kind of no mans land where literary principles are barely applicable particularly if we include the field of movies and television here the distinctive characteristics of romanticism become almost indistinguishable on this level writing is not the product of subconscious premises it is a mixture of elements picked by random imitation rather than by senseoflife creation a certain characteristic is typical of this level it is not merely the use of conventional naturalistic characters to enact romantic events but worse the use of characters who are romanticized embodiments of conventional values such embodiments represent canned values empty stereotypes that serve as an automatic substitute for valuejudgments this method lacks the essential attribute of romanticism the independent creative projection of an individual writers valuesand it lacks the reportorial honesty of the better naturalists it does not present concrete men as they are it presents human pretensions a collective roleplaying or an indiscriminate collective daydream and palms this off as reality most of the slickmagazine fiction popular before world war ii belongs to this class with its endless variations on the cinderella theme the motherhood theme the costumedrama theme or the commonmanwithaheartofgold theme for example edna ferber fannie hurst barry benefield this type of fiction has no plots only more or less cohesive stories and no discernible characterizations the characters are false journalistically and meaningless metaphysically it is an open question whether this group belongs to the category of romanticism it is usually regarded as romantic simply because it is far removed from anything perceivable in reality concretely or abstractly as far as their fiction aspects are concerned movies and television by their nature are media suited exclusively to romanticism to abstractions essentials and drama unfortunately both media came too late the great day of romanticism was gone and only its sunset rays reached a few exceptional movies fritz langs siegfried is the best among them for a while the movie field was dominated by the equivalent of the slickmagazine romanticism with a still less discriminating level of taste and imagination and an incommunicable vulgarity of spirit partly in reaction against this debasement of values but mainly in consequence of the general philosophicalcultural disintegration of our time with its antivalue trend romanticism vanished from the movies and never reached television except in the form of a few detective series which are now gone also what remains is the occasional appearance of cowardly pieces whose authors apologize for their romantic attempts by means of comedyor mongrel pieces whose authors beg not to be mistaken for advocates of human values or human greatness by means of coyly militantly commonplace characters who enact worldshaking events and perform fantastic feats particularly in the realm of science the nature of this type of scenario can best be encapsulated by a line of dialogue on the order of sorry baby i cant take you to the pizza joint tonight ive got to go back to the lab and split the atom the next and final level of disintegration is the attempt to eliminate romanticism from romantic fictionie to dispense with the element of values morality and volition this used to be called the hardboiled school of detective fiction today it is plugged as realistic this school makes no distinction between heroes and villains or detectives and criminals or victims and executioners and presents in effect two mobs of gangsters fighting savagely and incomprehensibly no motivation is offered for the same territory neither side being able to do otherwise this is the dead end where arriving by different roads romanticism and naturalism meet blend and vanish deterministically helpless compulsively evil characters go through a series of inexplicably exaggerated events and engage in purposeful conflicts without purpose beyond this point the field of literature both serious and popular is taken over by a genre compared to which romanticism and naturalism are clean civilized and innocently rational the horror story the modern ancestor of this phenomenon is edgar allan poe its archetype or purest esthetic expression is boris karloff movies popular literature more honest in this respect presents its horrors in the form of physical monstrosities in serious literature the horrors become psychological and bear less resemblance to anything human this is the literary cult of depravity the horror story in either variant represents the metaphysical projection of a single human emotion blind stark primitive terror those who live in such terror seem to find a momentary sense of relief or control in the process of reproducing that which they fearas savages find a sense of mastery over their enemies by reproducing them in the form of dolls strictly speaking this is not a metaphysical but a purely psychological projection such writers are not presenting their view of life they are not looking at life what they are saying is that they feel as if life consisted of werewolves draculas and frankenstein monsters in its basic motivation this school belongs to psychopathology more than to esthetics historically neither romanticism nor naturalism could survive the collapse of philosophy there are individual exceptions but i am speaking of these schools as broad active creative movements since art is the expression and product of philosophy it is the first to mirror the vacuum at the base of a culture and the first to crumble this general cause had special consequences affecting romanticism which hastened its decline and collapse there were also special consequences affecting naturalism which were of a different character and their destructive potential worked at a slower rate the archenemy and destroyer of romanticism was the altruist morality since romanticisms essential characteristic is the projection of values particularly moral values altruism introduced an insolvable conflict into romantic literature from the start the altruist morality cannot be practiced except in the form of selfdestruction and therefore cannot be projected or dramatized convincingly in terms of mans life on earth particularly in the realm of psychological motivation with altruism as the criterion of value and virtue it is impossible to create an image of man at his bestas he might be and ought to be the major flaw that runs through the history of romantic literature is the failure to present a convincing hero ie a convincing image of a virtuous man it is the abstract intentionthe grandeur of the authors view of manthat one admires in the characters of victor hugo not their actual characterizations the greatest romanticist never succeeded in projecting an ideal man or any convincing major characters of a positive nature his most ambitious attempt jean valjean in les misérables remains a giant abstraction that never integrates into a person in spite of isolated touches of profound psychological perceptiveness on the part of the author in the same novel marius the young man who is supposed to be hugos autobiographical projection acquires a certain stature only by means of what the author says about him not by means of what he shows as far as characterization is concerned marius is not a person but the suggestion of a person squeezed into a straitjacket of cultural bromides the bestdrawn and most interesting characters in hugos novels are the semivillains his benevolent sense of life made him un able to create a real villain javert in les misérables josiana in the man who laughs claude frollo in notredame de paris dostoevsky whose sense of life was the diametrical opposite of hugos was a passionate moralist whose blind quest for values was expressed only in the fiercely merciless condemnation with which he presented evil characters no one has equaled him in the psychological depth of his images of human evil but he was totally incapable of creating a positive or virtuous character such attempts as he made were crudely inept for example alyosha in the brothers karamazov it is significant that according to dostoevskys preliminary notes for the possessed his original intention was to create stavrogin as an ideal manan embodiment of the russianchristianaltruist soul as the notes progressed that intention changed gradually in logically inexorable steps dictated by dostoevskys artistic integrity in the final result in the actual novel stavrogin is one of dostoevskys most repulsively evil characters in sienkiewiczs quo vadis the bestdrawn most colorful character who dominates the novel is petronius the symbol of roman decadencewhile vinicius the authors hero the symbol of the rise of christianity is a cardboard figure this phenomenonthe fascinating villain or colorful rogue who steals the story and the drama from the anemic herois prevalent in the history of romantic literature serious or popular from top to bottom it is as if under the dead crust of the altruist code officially adopted by mankind an illicit subterranean fire were boiling chaotically and erupting once in a while forbidden to the hero the fire of selfassertiveness burst forth from the apologetic ashes of a villain the highest function of romanticismthe projection of moral valuesis an extremely difficult task under any moral code rational or not and in literary history only the top rank of romanticists were able to attempt it given the added burden of an irrational code such as altruism the majority of romantic writers had to avoid that taskwhich led to the weakness and neglect of the element of characterization in their writing in addition the impossibility of applying altruism to reality to mens actual existence led many romantic writers to avoid the problem by escaping into history ie by choosing to place their stories in some distant past such as the middle ages thus the emphasis on action the neglect of human psychology the lack of convincing motivation were progressively dissociating romanticism from realityuntil the final remnants of romanticism became a superficial meaningless unserious school that had nothing to say about human existence the disintegration of naturalism brought it to the same state for different reasons although naturalism is a product of the nineteenth century its spiritual father in modern history was shakespeare the premise that man does not possess volition that his destiny is determined by an innate tragic flaw is fundamental in shakespeares work but granted this false premise his approach is metaphysical not journalistic his characters are not drawn from real life they are not copies of observed concretes nor statistical averages they are grandscale abstractions of the character traits which a determinist would regard as inherent in human nature ambition powerlust jealousy greed etc some of the famous naturalists attempted to maintain shakespeares abstract level ie to present their views of human nature in metaphysical terms for example balzac tolstoy but the majority following the lead of émile zola rejected metaphysics as they rejected values and adopted the method of journalism the recording of observed concretes the contradictions inherent in determinism were obvious in this movement from the start one does not read fiction except on the implicit premise of volitionie on the premise that some element some abstraction of the fiction story is applicable to oneself that one will learn discover or contemplate something of value and that this experience will make a difference if one were to accept the deterministic premise fully and literallyif one were to believe that the characters of a fiction story are as distant and irrelevant to oneself as the unknowable inhabitants of another galaxy and that they cannot affect ones life in any way whatever since neither they nor the reader have any power of choiceone would not be able to read beyond the first chapter nor would one be able to write psychologically the whole of the naturalist movement rode on the premise of volition as on an unidentified subconscious stolen concept choosing society as the factor that determines mans fate most of the naturalists were social reformers advocating social changes claiming that man has no volition but society somehow has tolstoy preached resignation and passive obedience to societys power in anna karenina the most evil book in serious literature he attacked mans desire for happiness and advocated its sacrifice to conformity no matter how concretebound their theories forced them to be the writers of the naturalist school still had to exercise their power of abstraction to a significant extent in order to reproduce reallife characters they had to select the characteristics they regarded as essential differentiating them from the nonessential or accidental thus they were led to substitute statistics for values as a criterion of selectivity that which is statistically prevalent among men they held is metaphysically significant and representative of mans nature that which is rare or exceptional is not see chapter at first having rejected the element of plot and even of story the naturalists concentrated on the element of characterizationand psychological perceptiveness was the chief value that the best of them had to offer with the growth of the statistical method however that value shrank and vanished characterization was replaced by indiscriminate recording and buried under a catalogue of trivia such as minute inventories of a characters apartment clothing and meals naturalism lost the attempted universality of shakespeare or tolstoy descending from metaphysics to photography with a rapidly shrinking lens directed at the range of the immediate momentuntil the final remnants of naturalism became a superficial meaningless unserious school that had nothing to say about human existence there were several reasons why naturalism outlasted romanticism even if not for long chief among them is the fact that naturalisms standards are much less demanding a thirdrate naturalist may still have some perceptive observations to offer a thirdrate romanticist has nothing romanticism demands mastery of the primary element of fiction the art of storytellingwhich requires three cardinal qualities ingenuity imagination a sense of drama all this and more goes into the construction of an original plot integrated to theme and characterization naturalism discards these elements and demands nothing but characterization in as shapeless a narrative as uncontrived ie purposeless a progression of events if any as a given author pleases the value of a romanticists work has to be created by its author he owes no allegiance to men only to man only to the metaphysical nature of reality and to his own values the value of a naturalists work depends on the specific characters choices and actions of the men he reproducesand he is judged by the fidelity with which he reproduces them the value of a romanticists story lies in what might happen the value of a naturalists story lies in that it did happen if the spiritual ancestor or symbol of the romanticist is the medieval troubadour who roamed the countryside inspiring men with visions of lifes potential beyond the dreary boundaries of their daily toilthen the symbol of the naturalist is the backfence gossip as one contemporary naturalist has somewhat boastfully admitted contributing to the temporary dominance of naturalism was the fact that precious stones attract a greater number of seekers of the unearned than do the more commonly available minerals the essential element of romanticism the plot can be purloined and disguised by recutting even though it loses fire brilliance and value with every stroke of a dimestore chisel the original plots of romantic literature have been borrowed in countless variations by countless imitators losing color and meaning with each successive copy for example compare the dramatic structure of the lady of the camellias camille by alexander dumas fils which is an unusually good play to the endless series of dramas about a prostitute caught between her true love and her past from eugene oneills anna christie on down or properly speaking on up to hollywood variants the esthetic parasites of romanticism helped to run it into the ground turning its examples of inventiveness into wornout bromides this however does not detract from the original authors achievements if anything it underscores them naturalism does not offer such opportunities to imitators the essential element of naturalismthe presentation of a slice of life at a specific time and placecannot be borrowed literally a writer cannot copy the russian society of as presented in tolstoys war and peace he has to employ some thought and effort of his own at least in the sense of using his own observations to present the people of his own time and place thus paradoxically on its lower levels naturalism offers a chance for some minimal originality which romanticism does not in this respect naturalism would appeal to some writers seeking the possibility of a literary achievement on a modest scale there were however many imitators of a less obvious kind among the naturalists and many pretentious mediocrities particularly in europe for example romain rolland a romanticizing naturalist who in intellectual stature belongs with the slickmagazine romanticists but at naturalisms height the movement included writers of genuine literary talent particularly in america its best representative is sinclair lewis whose novels display a perceptive critical firstrate intelligence at work the best of naturalisms contemporary survivors is john ohara who combines a sensitive intelligence with a beautifully disciplined style just as there was a kind of naively innocent optimistic benevolence in the great romanticists of the nineteenth century so there was in the better naturalists of the twentieth the first were individualoriented the second societyoriented world war i marked the end of the great era of romanticism and accelerated the fading of individualism one may take as a tragic symbol the fact that edmond rostand died in in the flu epidemic following that war world war ii marked the end of naturalism exposing the bankruptcy of collectivism blasting the vague hopes and illusions of achieving a benevolent welfare state these wars demonstrated existentially what their literary consequences demonstrated psychologically that man cannot live without philosophy and neither can he write in the eclectic shambles of todays literature it is hard to tell which is worse a western that explains the deeds of a cattle rustler by reference to his oedipus complexor a gory cynical realistic account of sundry horrors which reveals the message that love is the solution to everything except for the exceptions there is no literature and no art todayin the sense of a broad vital cultural movement and influence there are only bewildered imitators with nothing to imitateand charlatans who rise to splitsecond notoriety as they always did in periods of cultural collapse some remnants of romanticism may still be found in the popular mediabut in such a mangled disfigured form that they achieve the opposite of romanticisms original purpose the best symbolic projection of these remnants meaning whether the author intended it or not was given in a brief television story of the twilight zone series some years ago in some indeterminate world of another dimension the shadowy whiteclad authoritarian figures of doctors and social scientists are deeply concerned with the problem of a young girl who looks so different from everyone else that she is shunned as a freak a disfigured outcast unable to lead a normal life she has appealed to them for help but all plastic surgery operations have failedand now the doctors are grimly preparing to give her a last chance one more attempt at plastic surgery if it fails she will remain a monstrosity for life in heavily tragic tones the doctors speak of the girls need to be like others to belong to be loved etc we are not shown any of the characters faces but we hear the tense ominous oddly lifeless voices of their dim figures as the last operation progresses the operation fails the doctors declare with contemptuous compassion that they will have to find a young man as deformed as this girl who might be able to accept her then for the first time we see the girls face lying motionless on the pillow of a hospital bed it is a face of perfect radiant beauty the camera moves to the faces of the doctors it is an unspeakably horrifying row not of human faces but of mangled distorted disfigured pigs heads recognizable only by their snouts fadeout the last remnants of romanticism are sneaking apologetically on the outskirts of our culture wearing the masks of a similar plastic surgery operation which has been partially successful under the pressure of conformity to the pigs snouts of decadence todays romanticists are escaping not into the past but into the supernaturalexplicitly giving up reality and this earth the exciting the dramatic the unusualtheir policy is declaring in effectdo not exist please dont take us seriously what were offering is only a spooky daydream rod serling one of the most talented writers of television started as a naturalist dramatizing controversial journalistic issues of the moment never taking sides conspicuously avoiding valuejudgments writing about ordinary peopleexcept that these people spoke the most beautifully eloquently romanticized dialogue a purposeful intellectual sharply focused dialoguebyessentials of a kind that people do not speak in real life but should prompted apparently by the need to give full scope to his colorful imagination and brilliant sense of drama rod serling turned to romanticismbut placed his stories in another dimension in the twilight zone ira levin who started with an excellent first novel a kiss before dying now comes out with rosemarys baby which goes beyond the physical trappings of the middle ages straight to that eras spirit and presents seriously a story about witchcraft in a modern setting and since the original version of the virgin birth involving god would probably be regarded as camp by todays intellectual establishment this story revolves around the obscenity of a virgin birth authored by the devil fredric brown an unusually ingenious writer had been devoting his ingenuity to turning science fiction into stories of earthly or supernatural evil now he has stopped writing alfred hitchcock the last moviemaker who has managed to preserve his stature and his following gets away with romanticism by means of an overemphasis on malevolence or on sheer horror this is the manner in which men of imagination now express their need to make life interesting romanticismwhich started in defiance of primordial evils as a violent passionate torrent of righteous selfassertivenessends up by dribbling through the fingers of tottering heirs who disguise their works and motives by paying lip service to evil i do not mean to imply that this type of appeasement is the product of conscious cowardice i do not believe it is which makes it worse such is the esthetic state of our day but so long as men exist the need of art will exist since that need is rooted metaphysically in the nature of mans consciousnessand it will survive a period when under the reign of irrationality run amuck men produce and accept tainted scraps to satisfy that need as in the case of an individual so in the case of a culture disasters can be accomplished subconsciously but a cure cannot a cure in both cases requires conscious knowledge ie a consciously grasped explicit philosophy it is impossible to predict the time of a philosophical renaissance one can only define the road to follow but not its length what is certain however is that every aspect of western culture needs a new code of ethicsa rational ethicsas a precondition of rebirth and perhaps no aspect needs it more desperately than the realm of art when reason and philosophy are reborn literature will be the first phoenix to rise out of todays ashes and armed with a code of rational values aware of its own nature confident of the supreme importance of its mission romanticism will have come of age mayjuly the esthetic vacuum of our age prior to the nineteenth century literature presented man as a helpless being whose life and actions were determined by forces beyond his control either by fate and the gods as in the greek tragedies or by an innate weakness a tragic flaw as in the plays of shakespeare writers regarded man as metaphysically impotent their basic premise was determinism on that premise one could not project what might happen to men one could only record what did happenand chronicles were the appropriate literary form of such recording man as a being who possesses the faculty of volition did not appear in literature until the nineteenth century the novel was his proper literary formand romanticism was the great new movement in art romanticism saw man as a being able to choose his values to achieve his goals to control his own existence the romantic writers did not record the events that had happened but projected the events that should happen they did not record the choices men had made but projected the choices men ought to make with the resurgence of mysticism and collectivism in the later part of the nineteenth century the romantic novel and the romantic movement vanished gradually from the cultural scene mans new enemy in art was naturalism naturalism rejected the concept of volition and went back to a view of man as a helpless creature determined by forces beyond his control only now the new ruler of mans destiny was held to be society the naturalists proclaimed that values have no power and no place neither in human life nor in literature that writers must present men as they are which meant must record whatever they happen to see around themthat they must not pronounce valuejudgments nor project abstractions but must content themselves with a faithful transcription a carbon copy of any existing concretes this was a return to the literary principle of the chroniclebut since a novel was to be an invented chronicle the novelist was faced with the problem of what to use as his standard of selection when values are declared to be impossible how is one to know what to record what to regard as important or significant naturalism solved the problem by substituting statistics for a standard of value that which could be claimed to be typical of a large number of men in any given geographical area or period of time was regarded as metaphysically significant and worthy of being recorded that which was rare unusual exceptional was regarded as unimportant and unreal just as the new schools of philosophy became progressively dedicated to the negation of philosophy so naturalism was dedicated to the negation of art instead of presenting a metaphysical view of man and of existence the naturalists presented a journalistic view in answer to the question what is manthey said this is what the village grocers are in the south of france in the year or this is what the inhabitants of the slums are in new york in or these are the folks next door artthe integrator of metaphysics the concretizer of mans widest abstractionswas shrinking to the level of a plodding concretebound dolt who has never looked past the block he lives on or beyond the range of the moment it did not take long for the philosophical roots of naturalism to come out into the open at first by the standard that substituted the collective for the objective the naturalists consigned the exceptional man to unreality and presented only the men who could be taken as typical of some group or another high or low then since they saw more misery than prosperity on earth they began to regard prosperity as unreal and to present only misery poverty the slums the lower classes then since they saw more mediocrity than greatness around them they began to regard greatness as unreal and to present only the mediocre the average the common the undistinguished since they saw more failure than success they took success to be unreal and presented only human failure frustration defeat since they saw more suffering than happiness they took happiness to be unreal and presented only suffering since they saw more ugliness than beauty they took beauty to be unreal and presented only ugliness since they saw more vice than virtue they took virtue to be unreal and presented only vice crime corruption perversion depravity now take a look at modern literature manthe nature of man the metaphysically significant important essential in manis now represented by dipsomaniacs drug addicts sexual perverts homicidal maniacs and psychotics the subjects of modern literature are such themes as the hopeless love of a bearded lady for a mongoloid pinhead in a circus side showor the problem of a married couple whose child was born with six fingers on her left handor the tragedy of a gentle young man who just cant help murdering strangers in the park for kicks all this is still presented to us under the naturalistic heading of a slice of life or real lifebut the old slogans have worn thin the obvious question to which the heirs of statistical naturalism have no answer is if heroes and geniuses are not to be regarded as representative of mankind by reason of their numerical rarity why are freaks and monsters to be regarded as representative why are the problems of a bearded lady of greater universal significance than the problems of a genius why is the soul of a murderer worth studying but not the soul of a hero the answer lies in the basic metaphysical premise of naturalism whether its practitioners ever chose it consciously or not as an outgrowth of modern philosophy that basic premise is antiman antimind antilife and as an outgrowth of the altruist morality naturalism is a frantic escape from moral judgmenta long wailing plea for pity for tolerance for the forgiveness of anything the literary cycle has swung all the way around what one reads today is not naturalism any longer it is symbolism it is the presentation of a metaphysical view of man as opposed to a journalistic or statistical view but it is the symbolism of primitive terror according to this modern view depravity represents mans real essential metaphysical nature while virtue does not virtue is only an accident an exception or an illusion therefore a monster is an appropriate projection of mans essence but a hero is not the romanticists did not present a hero as a statistical average but as an abstraction of mans best and highest potentiality applicable to and achievable by all men in various degrees according to their individual choices for the same reasons in the same manner but on an opposite metaphysical premise todays writers do not present a monster as a statistical average but as an abstraction of mans worst and lowest potentiality which they regard as applicable to and essential in all mennot however as a potentiality but as a hidden actuality the romanticists presented heroes as larger than life now monsters are presented as larger than lifeor rather man is presented as smaller than life if men hold a rational philosophy including the conviction that they possess volition the image of a hero guides and inspires them if men hold an irrational philosophy including the conviction that they are helpless automatons the image of a monster serves to reassure them they feel in effect i am not that bad the philosophical meaning or the vested interest of presenting man as a loathsome monstrosity is the hope and the demand for a moral blank check now consider a curious paradox the same estheticians and intellectuals who advocate collectivism with the subordination of all values and of everyones life to the rule of the masses with art as the voice of the peoplethese same men are resentfully antagonistic toward all popular values in art they engage in virulent denunciations of the mass media of the socalled commercial producers or publishers who happen to attract large audiences and to please the public they demand government subsidies for the artistic ventures which the people do not enjoy and do not choose to support voluntarily they feel that any financially successful that is popular work of art is automatically worthless while any unpopular failure is automatically greatprovided it is unintelligible anything that can be understood they feel is vulgar and primitive only inarticulate language smears of paint and the noise of radio static are civilized sophisticated and profound the popularity or unpopularity the boxoffice success or failure of a work of art is not of course a criterion of esthetic merit no valueesthetic philosophical or moralcan be established by counting noses fifty million frenchmen can be as wrong as one but while a crude philistine who takes financial success as proof of artistic merit can be regarded merely as a mindless parasite on artwhat is one to think of the standards motives and intentions of those who take financial failure as the proof of artistic merit if the snobbery of mere financial success is reprehensible what is the meaning of a snobbery of failure draw your own conclusions if you wonder what is the ultimate destination toward which modern philosophy and modern art are leading you you may observe its advance symptoms all around us observe that literature is returning to the art form of the preindustrial ages to the chroniclethat fictionalized biographies of real people of politicians baseball players or chicago gangsters are given preference over works of imaginative fiction in the theater in the movies in televisionand that a favored literary form is the documentary observe that in painting sculpture and music the current fashion and inspirational model is the primitive art of the jungle if you rebel against reason if you succumb to the old bromides of the witch doctors such as reason is the enemy of the artist or the cold hand of reason dissects and destroys the joyous spontaneity of mans creative imaginationi suggest that you take note of the following fact by rejecting reason and surrendering to the unhampered sway of their unleashed emotions and whims the apostles of irrationality the existentialists the zen buddhists the nonobjective artists have not achieved a free joyous triumphant sense of life but a sense of doom nausea and screaming cosmic terror then read the stories of o henry or listen to the music of viennese operettas and remember that these were the products of the spirit of the nineteenth centurya century ruled by the cold dissecting hand of reason and then ask yourself which psychoepistemology is appropriate to man which is consonant with the facts of reality and with mans nature just as a mans esthetic preferences are the sum of his metaphysical values and the barometer of his soul so art is the sum and the barometer of a culture modern art is the most eloquent demonstration of the cultural bankruptcy of our age november bootleg romanticism art including literature is the barometer of a culture it reflects the sum of a societys deepest philosophical values not its professed notions and slogans but its actual view of man and of existence the image of an entire society stretched out on a psychologists couch revealing its naked subconscious is an impossible concept yet that is what art accomplishes it presents the equivalent of such a session a transcript which is more eloquent and easier to diagnose than any other set of symptoms this does not mean that an entire society is bound by the mediocrities who may choose to posture in the field of art at any given time but it does mean that if no better men chose to enter the field this tells us something about the state of that society there are always exceptions who rebel against the dominant trend in the art of their age but the fact that they are exceptions tells us something about the state of that age the dominant trend may not in fact express the soul of an entire people it may be rejected resented or ignored by an overwhelming majority but if it is the dominant voice of a given period this tells us something about the state of the peoples souls in politics the panicblinded advocates of todays status quo clinging to the shambles of their mixed economy in a rising flood of statism are now adopting the line that theres nothing wrong with the world that this is a century of progress that we are morally and mentally healthy that we never had it so good if you find political issues too complex to diagnose take a look at todays art it will leave you no doubt in regard to the health or disease of our culture the composite picture of man that emerges from the art of our time is the gigantic figure of an aborted embryo whose limbs suggest a vaguely anthropoid shape who twists his upper extremity in a frantic quest for a light that cannot penetrate its empty sockets who emits inarticulate sounds resembling snarls and moans who crawls through a bloody muck red froth dripping from his jaws and struggles to throw the froth at his own nonexistent face who pauses periodically and lifting the stumps of his arms screams in abysmal terror at the universe at large engendered by generations of antirational philosophy three emotions dominate the sense of life of modern man fear guilt and pity more precisely selfpity fear as the appropriate emotion of a creature deprived of his means of survival his mind guilt as the appropriate emotion of a creature devoid of moral values pity as the means of escape from these two as the only response such a creature could beg for a sensitive discriminating man who has absorbed that sense of life but retained some vestige of selfesteem will avoid so revealing a profession as art but this does not stop the others fear guilt and the quest for pity combine to set the trend of art in the same direction in order to express justify and rationalize the artists own feelings to justify a chronic fear one has to portray existence as evil to escape from guilt and arouse pity one has to portray man as impotent and innately loathsome hence the competition among modern artists to find ever lower levels of depravity and ever higher degrees of mawkishnessa competition to shock the public out of its wits and jerk its tears hence the frantic search for misery the descent from compassionate studies of alcoholism and sexual perversion to dope incest psychosis murder cannibalism to illustrate the moral implications of this trendthe fact that pity for the guilty is treason to the innocenti submit an enthusiastic review that commends a current movie for arousing compassion for kidnappers ones attention and indeed ones anxiety is centered more upon them than upon the kidnapped youngster states the review and as a matter of fact the motivation is not so clearly defined that it bears analysis or criticism on psychological grounds but it is sufficiently established to compel our anguished sympathy for the two incredible kidnappers the new york times november sewers are not very rich nor very deep and todays dramatists seem to be scratching bottom as to literature it has shot its bolt there is no way to beat the following which i reproduce in full from the august issue of time the heading is books the subhead best reading then cat and mouse by günter grass bestselling novelist grass the tin drum relates the torment of a young man whose prominent adams apple makes him an outcast to his classmates he strives for achievement and wins it but to the cathuman conformityhe is still a curiosity no all this is not presented to us tongue in cheek there is an old french theater that specializes in presenting that sort of stuff tongueincheek it is called grand guignol but today the spirit of grand guignol has been elevated into a metaphysical system and demands to be taken seriously what then is not to be taken seriously any representation of human virtue one would think that that maudlin preoccupation with chambers of horror that waxworksmuseum view of life was bad enough but there is something still worse and morally more evil the recent attempts to concoct socalled tongueincheek thrillers the trouble with the sewer school of art is that fear guilt and pity are selfdefeating dead ends after the first few daring revelations of human depravity people cease to be shocked by anything after experiencing pity for a few dozen of the depraved the deformed the demented people cease to feel anything and just as the noncommercial economics of modern idealists tells them to take over commercial establishments so the noncommercial esthetics of modern artists prompts them to attempt the takeover of commercial ie popular art forms thrillers are detective spy or adventure stories their basic characteristic is conflict which means a clash of goals which means purposeful action in pursuit of values thrillers are the product the popular offshoot of the romantic school of art that sees man not as a helpless pawn of fate but as a being who possesses volition whose life is directed by his own valuechoices romanticism is a valueoriented moralitycentered movement its material is not journalistic minutiae but the abstract the essential the universal principles of mans natureand its basic literary commandment is to portray man as he might be and ought to be thrillers are a simplified elementary version of romantic literature they are not concerned with a delineation of values but taking certain fundamental values for granted they are concerned with only one aspect of a moral beings existence the battle of good against evil in terms of purposeful actiona dramatized abstraction of the basic pattern of choice goal conflict danger struggle victory thrillers are the kindergarten arithmetic of which the higher mathematics is the greatest novels of world literature thrillers deal only with the skeletonthe plot structureto which serious romantic literature adds the flesh the blood the mind the plots in the novels of victor hugo or dostoevsky are pure thrillerplots unequaled and unsurpassed by the writers of thrillers in todays culture romantic art is virtually nonexistent but for some very rare exceptions it requires a view of man incompatible with modern philosophy the last remnants of romanticism are flickering only in the field of popular art like bright sparks in a stagnant gray fog thrillers are the last refuge of the qualities that have vanished from modern literature life color imagination they are like a mirror still holding a distant reflection of man bear that in mind when you consider the meaning of the attempt to present thrillers tongueincheek humor is not an unconditional virtue its moral character depends on its object to laugh at the contemptible is a virtue to laugh at the good is a hideous vice too often humor is used as the camouflage of moral cowardice there are two types of cowards in this connection one type is the man who dares not reveal his profound hatred of existence and seeks to undercut all values under cover of a chuckle who gets away with offensive malicious utterances and if caught runs for cover by declaring i was only kidding the other type is the man who dares not reveal or uphold his values and seeks to smuggle them into existence under cover of a chuckle who tries to get away with some concept of virtue or beauty and at the first sign of opposition drops it and runs declaring i was only kidding in the first case humor serves as an apology for evil in the secondas an apology for the good which morally is the more contemptible policy the motives of both types can be united and served by a phenomenon such as tongueincheek thrillers what are such thrillers laughing at at values at mans struggle for values at mans capacity to achieve his values at man at man the hero regardless of their creators conscious or subconscious motives such thrillers in fact carry a message or intention of their own implicit in their nature to arouse peoples interest in some daring venture to hold them in suspense by the intricacy of a battle for great stakes to inspire them by the spectacle of human efficacy to evoke their admiration for the heros courage ingenuity endurance and unswerving integrity of purpose to make them cheer his triumphand then to spit in their faces declaring dont take me seriouslyi was only kiddingwho are we you and i to aspire to be anything but absurd and swinish to whom are such thrillers apologizing to the sewer school of art in todays culture the gutterworshiper needs and makes no apology but the heroworshiper chooses to crawl on his belly crying i didnt mean it boys its all in fun im not so corrupt as to believe in virtue im not so cowardly as to fight for values im not so evil as to long for an idealim one of you the social status of thrillers reveals the profound gulf splitting todays culturethe gulf between the people and its alleged intellectual leaders the peoples need for a ray of romanticisms light is enormous and tragically eager observe the extraordinary popularity of mickey spillane and ian fleming there are hundreds of thriller writers who sharing the modern sense of life write sordid concoctions that amount to a battle of evil against evil or at best gray against black none of them have the ardent devoted almost addicted following earned by spillane and fleming this is not to say that the novels of spillane and fleming project a faultlessly rational sense of life both are touched by the cynicism and despair of todays malevolent universe but in strikingly different ways both offer the cardinal element of romantic fiction mike hammer and james bond are heroes this universal need is precisely what todays intellectuals cannot grasp or fill a seedy emasculated unventilated elitea basement elite transported by default into vacant drawing rooms and barricaded behind dusty curtains against light air grammar and realitytodays intellectuals cling to the stagnant illusion of their altruistcollectivist upbringing the vision of a cloddish humble inarticulate people whose voice and masters they were to be observe their anxious partpatronizing partobsequious pursuit of folk art of the primitive the anonymous the undeveloped the unintellectualor their lusty earthy movies that portray man as an obscene subanimal politically the reality of a noncloddish people would destroy them the collectivist jig would be up morally the existence possibility or image of a hero would be intolerable to their overwhelming sense of guilt it would wipe out the slogan that permits them to go on wallowing in sewers i couldnt help it a heroesseeking people is what they cannot admit into their view of the universe a sample of that cultural gulfa small sample of a vast modern tragedymay be seen in an interesting little article in tv guide may under the title violence can be fun and with the eloquent subtitle in britain everybody laughs at the avengersexcept the audience the avengers is a sensationally successful british television series featuring the adventures of secret agent john steed and his attractive assistant catherine galesurrounded by some delightfully ingenious plots states the article the avengers is compulsive viewing for a huge audience steed and mrs gale are household words but recently the secret sorrow of producer john bryce was revealed the avengers was conceived as a satire of counterespionage thrillers but the british public still insists on taking it seriously the manner in which that revelation came about is interesting the fact that the avengers is satire was probably the bestkept secret in british television for almost a year it might have remained that way but the series came up for discussion during another show called the critics one of these criticsto the astonishment of the othersdeclared that surely everybody realized it was being played for laughs nobody had but the producer of the avengers confirmed that view and moodily blamed the public for its failure to understand his intentions its failure to laugh at his product bear in mind that romantic thrillers are an exceedingly difficult job they require such a degree of skill ingenuity inventiveness imagination and logicsuch a great amount of talent on the part of the producer or the director or the writer or the cast or all of themthat it is virtually impossible to fool an entire nation for a whole year somebodys values were being shamefully exploited and betrayed besides the publics it is obvious that the modern intellectuals rush to the thriller bandwagon was precipitated by the spectacular figure and success of james bond but in keeping with modern philosophy they want to ride the wagon and spit at it too if you think that the producers of massmedia entertainment are motivated primarily by commercial greed check your premises and observe that the producers of the james bond movies seem to be intent on undercutting their own success contrary to somebodys strenuously spread assertions there was nothing tongueincheek about the first of these movies dr no it was a brilliant example of romantic screen artin production direction writing photography and most particularly in the performance of sean connery his first introduction on the screen was a gem of dramatic technique elegance wit and understatement when in response to a question about his name we saw his first closeup and he answered quietly bond james bondthe audience on the night i saw it burst into applause there wasnt much applause on the night when i saw his second movie from russia with love here bond was introduced pecking with schoolboy kisses at the face of a vapidlooking girl in a bathing suit the story was muddled and at times unintelligible the skillfully constructed dramatic suspense of flemings climax was replaced by conventional stuff such as oldfashioned chases involving nothing but crude physical danger i shall still go to see the third movie goldfinger but with heavy misgivings the misgivings are based on an article by richard maibaum who adapted all three novels to the screen the new york times december flemings tongueincheek attitude toward his material intrigue expertise violence love death finds a ready mass response in a world where audiences enjoy sick jokes writes mr maibaum incidentally it is the aspect of fleming which the films have most developed so much for his understanding of the appeal of romantic thrillersor of fleming discussing his own work mr maibaum remarks do i hear anyone asking sotto voce about the screenwriters blushes if he was the blushing type he wouldnt be doing bond screenplays in the first place besides its good clean fun or so he tells himself draw your own conclusions about the nature of the ethical standards involved note also that the writer of the movie about the two incredible but sympathetic kidnappers did not feel called upon to blush the actual characterization of james bond mr maibaum continues was also a departure from the novels that concept retained a basic supersleuth superfighter superhedonist superlover of flemings but added another large dimension humor humor vocalized in wry comments at critical moments in the books bond was singularly lacking in this which is not true as any reader of the books can ascertain and finally a bright young producer accosted me one day with glittering eyes im making a parody of the james bond films how i asked myself does one make a parody of a parody for that is precisely in the final analysis what we have done with flemings books parodied them im not sure that ian himself ever completely realized this this is said about the work of a man whose talent achievement and fame gave a group of previously undistinguished persons their chance at distinction and at piles of money observe that in the issue of humor versus thrillers modern intellectuals are using the term humor as an anticoncept ie as a packagedeal of two meanings with the proper meaning serving to cover and to smuggle the improper one into peoples minds the purpose is to obliterate the distinction between humor and mockery particularly selfmockeryand thus bring men to defile their own values and selfesteem for fear of being accused of lacking a sense of humor remember that humor is not an unconditional virtue and depends on its object one may laugh with a hero but never at himjust as a satire may laugh at some object but never at itself a composition that laughs at itself is a fraud on the audience in flemings novels james bond is constantly making witty humorous remarks which are part of his charm but apparently this is not what mr maibaum meant by the word humor what he meant apparently was humor at bonds expensethe sort of humor intended to undercut bonds stature to make him ridiculous which means to destroy him such is the basic contradictionand the terrible parasitic immoralityof any attempt to create tongueincheek thrillers it requires that one employ all the values of a thriller in order to hold the audiences interest yet turn these values against themselves that one damage the very elements one is using and counting on it means an attempt to cash in on the thing one is mocking to profit by the audiences hunger for romanticism while seeking to destroy it this is not the method of a legitimate satire a satire does not share the values of that which it denounces it denounces by means and in the context of an opposite set of values the failure to understand the nature and appeal of romanticism is an eloquent measure of the modern intellectuals epistemological disintegration only an appallingly concretebound anticonceptual mentality would lose its faculty of abstraction to such an extent as to be incapable of grasping an abstract meaning which an unskilled laborer can grasp and a united states president can enjoy only an arrested modern mentality would go on protesting that the events portrayed in a thriller are incredible or improbable that there are no heroes that life is not like thatall of which is thoroughly irrelevant nobody takes thrillers literally nor cares about their specific events nor harbors any frustrated desire to become a secret agent or a private eye thrillers are taken symbolically they dramatize one of mans widest and most crucial abstractions the abstraction of moral conflict what people seek in thrillers is the spectacle of mans efficacy of his ability to fight for his values and to achieve them what they see is a condensed simplified pattern reduced to its essentials a man fighting for a vital goalovercoming one obstacle after anotherfacing terrible dangers and riskspersisting through an excruciating struggleand winning far from suggesting an easy or unrealistic view of life a thriller suggests the necessity of a difficult struggle if the hero is largerthanlife so are the villains and the dangers an abstraction has to be largerthanlifeto encompass any concretes that individual men may be concerned with each according to the scale of his own values goals and ambition the scale varies the psychological relationships involved remain the same the obstacles confronting an average man are to him as formidable as bonds adversaries but what the image of bond tells him is it can be done what men find in the spectacle of the ultimate triumph of the good is the inspiration to fight for ones own values in the moral conflicts of ones own life if the proclaimers of human impotence the seekers of automatic security protest that life is not like that happy endings are not guaranteed to manthe answer is a thriller is more realistic than such views of existence it shows men the only road that can make any sort of happy ending possible here we come to an interesting paradox it is only the superficiality of the naturalists that classifies romanticism as an escape this is true only in the very superficial sense of contemplating a glamorous vision as a relief from the gray burden of reallife problems but in the deeper metaphysicalmoralpsychological sense it is naturalism that represents an escapean escape from choice from values from moral responsibilityand it is romanticism that trains and equips man for the battles he has to face in reality in the privacy of his own soul nobody identifies himself with the folks next door unless he has given up but the generalized abstraction of a hero permits every man to identify himself with james bond each supplying his own concretes which are illuminated and supported by that abstraction it is not a conscious process but an emotional integration and most people may not know that that is the reason of the enjoyment they find in thrillers it is not a leader or a protector that they seek in a hero since his exploits are always highly individualistic and unsocial what they seek is profoundly personal selfconfidence and selfassertion inspired by james bond a man may find the courage to rebel against the impositions of his inlawsor to ask for a deserved raiseor to change his jobor to propose to the girl he lovesor to embark on the career he wantsor to defy the whole world for the sake of his new invention this is what naturalistic art can never give him for example consider one of the best works of modern naturalismpaddy chayefskys marty it is an extremely sensitive perceptive touching portrayal of a humble mans struggle for selfassertion one can feel sympathy for marty and a sad kind of pleasure at his final success but it is highly doubtful that anyoneincluding the thousands of reallife martyswould be inspired by his example no one could feel i want to be like marty everyone except the most corrupt can feel i want to be like james bond such is the meaning of that popular art form which todays friends of the people are attacking with hysterical hatred the guiltiest men involvedboth among the professionals and the publicare the moral cowards who do not share that hatred but seek to appease it who are willing to regard their own romantic values as a secret vice to keep them underground to slip them furtively to blackmarket customers and to pay off the established intellectual authorities in the currency demanded selfmockery the game will continue and the bandwagonriders will destroy james bond as they have destroyed mike hammer as they have destroyed eliot ness then will look for another victim to parodyuntil some future sacrificial worm turns and declares that hell be damned if hell allow romanticism to be treated as bootleg merchandise the public too will have to do its share it will have to cease being satisfied with esthetic speakeasies and demand the repeal of the joycekafka amendment which prohibits the sale and drinking of clean water unless denatured by humor while unconscionable rotgut is being sold and drunk at every bookstore counter january art and moral treason when i saw mr x for the first time i thought that he had the most tragic face i had ever seen it was not the mark left by some specific tragedy not the look of a great sorrow but a look of desolate hopelessness weariness and resignation that seemed left by the chronic pain of many lifetimes he was twentysix years old he had a brilliant mind an outstanding scholastic record in the field of engineering a promising start in his careerand no energy to move farther he was paralyzed by so extreme a state of indecision that any sort of choice filled him with anxietyeven the question of moving out of an inconvenient apartment he was stagnating in a job which he had outgrown and which had become a dull uninspiring routine he was so lonely that he had lost the capacity to know it he had no concept of friendship and his few attempts at a romantic relationship had ended disastrouslyhe could not tell why at the time i met him he was undergoing psychotherapy struggling desperately to discover the causes of his state there seemed to be no existential cause for it his childhood had not been happy but no worse and in some respects better than the average childhood there were no traumatic events in his past no major shocks disappointments or frustrations yet his frozen impersonality suggested a man who neither felt nor wanted anything any longer he was like a gray spread of ashes that had never been on fire discussing his childhood i asked him once what he had been in love with what not whom nothing he answeredthen mentioned uncertainly a toy that had been his favorite on another occasion i mentioned a current political event of shocking irrationality and injustice which he conceded indifferently to be evil i asked whether it made him indignant you dont understand he answered gently i never feel indignation about anything he had held some erroneous philosophical views under the influence of a college course in contemporary philosophy but his intellectual goals and motives seemed to be a confused struggle in the right direction and i could not discover any major ideological sin any crime commensurate with the punishment he was suffering then one day as an almost casual remark in a conversation about the role of human ideals in art he told me the following story some years earlier he had seen a certain semiromantic movie and had felt an emotion he was unable to describe particularly in response to the character of an industrialist who was moved by a passionate intransigent dedicated vision of his work mr x was speaking incoherently but conveying clearly that what he had experienced was more than admiration for a single character it was the sense of seeing a different kind of universeand his emotion had been exaltation it was what i wanted life to be he said his eyes were sparkling his voice was eager his face was alive and younghe was a man in love for the span of that moment then the gray lifelessness came back and he concluded in a dull tone of voice with a trace of tortured wistfulness when i came out of the theater i felt guilty about itabout having felt this guilty why i asked he answered because i thought that what made me react this way to the industrialist is the part of me thats wrong its the impractical element in me life is not like that what i felt was a cold shudder whatever the root of his problems this was the key it was the symptom not of amorality but of a profound moral treason to what and to whom can a man be willing to apologize for the best within him and what can he expect of life after that ultimately what saved mr x was his commitment to reason he held reason as an absolute even if he did not know its full meaning and application an absolute that survived through the hardest periods he had to endure in his struggle to regain his psychological healthto remark and release the soul he had spent his life negating due to his determined perseverance he won his battle todayafter quitting his job and taking many calculated riskshe is a brilliant success in a career he loves and on his way up to an everincreasing range of achievement he is still struggling with some remnants of his past errors but as a measure of his recovery and of the distance he has traveled i would suggest that you reread my opening paragraph before i tell you that i saw a recent snapshot of him which caught him smiling and of all the characters in atlas shrugged the one whom the quality of that smile would suit best is francisco danconia there are countless cases similar to this this is merely the most dramatically obvious one in my experience and involves a man of unusual stature but the same tragedy is repeated all around us in many hidden twisted formslike a secret torture chamber in mens souls from which an unrecognizable cry reaches us occasionally and then is silenced again the person in such cases is both man the victim and man the killer and certain principles apply to them all man is a being of selfmade soulwhich means that his character is formed by his basic premises particularly by his basic valuepremises in the crucial formative years of his lifein childhood and adolescenceromantic art is his major and today his only source of a moral sense of life in later years romantic art is often his only experience of it please note that art is not his only source of morality but of a moral sense of life this requires careful differentiation a sense of life is a preconceptual equivalent of metaphysics an emotional subconsciously integrated appraisal of man and of existence morality is an abstract conceptual code of values and principles the process of a childs development consists of acquiring knowledge which requires the development of his capacity to grasp and deal with an everwidening range of abstractions this involves the growth of two interrelated but different chains of abstractions two hierarchical structures of concepts which should be integrated but seldom are the cognitive and the normative the first deals with knowledge of the facts of realitythe second with the evaluation of these facts the first forms the epistemological foundation of sciencethe second of morality and of art in todays culture the development of a childs cognitive abstractions is assisted to some minimal extent even if ineptly halfheartedly with many hampering crippling obstacles such as antirational doctrines and influences which today are growing worse but the development of a childs normative abstractions is not merely left unaided it is all but stifled and destroyed the child whose valuing capacity survives the moral barbarism of his upbringing has to find his own way to preserve and develop his sense of values apart from its many other evils conventional morality is not concerned with the formation of a childs character it does not teach or show him what kind of man he ought to be and why it is concerned only with imposing a set of rules upon himconcrete arbitrary contradictory and more often than not incomprehensible rules which are mainly prohibitions and duties a child whose only notion of morality ie of values consists of such matters as wash your earsdont be rude to aunt rosaliedo your homeworkhelp papa to mow the lawn or mama to wash the dishesfaces the alternative of either a passively amoral resignation leading to a future of hopeless cynicism or a blind rebellion observe that the more intelligent and independent a child the more unruly he is in regard to such commandments but in either case the child grows up with nothing but resentment and fear or contempt for the concept of morality which to him is only a phantom scarecrow made of duty of boredom of punishment of pain a scarecrow standing in a barren field waving a stick to chase away his pleasures atlas shrugged this type of upbringing is the best not the worst that an average child may be subjected to in todays culture if parents attempt to inculcate a moral ideal of the kind contained in such admonitions as dont be selfishgive your best toys away to the children next door or if parents go progressive and teach a child to be guided by his whimsthe damage to the childs moral character may be irreparable where then can a child learn the concept of moral values and of a moral character in whose image he will shape his own soul where can he find the evidence the material from which to develop a chain of normative abstractions he is not likely to find a clue in the chaotic bewildering contradictory evidence offered by the adults in his daybyday experience he may like some adults and dislike others and often dislike them all but to abstract identify and judge their moral characteristics is a task beyond his capacity and such moral principles as he might be taught to recite are to him floating abstractions with no connection to reality the major source and demonstration of moral values available to a child is romantic art particularly romantic literature what romantic art offers him is not moral rules not an explicit didactic message but the image of a moral personie the concretized abstraction of a moral ideal it offers a concrete directly perceivable answer to the very abstract question which a child senses but cannot yet conceptualize what kind of person is moral and what kind of life does he lead it is not abstract principles that a child learns from romantic art but the precondition and the incentive for the later understanding of such principles the emotional experience of admiration for mans highest potential the experience of looking up to a heroa view of life motivated and dominated by values a life in which mans choices are practicable effective and crucially importantthat is a moral sense of life while his home environment taught him to associate morality with pain romantic art teaches him to associate it with pleasurean inspiring pleasure which is his own profoundly personal discovery the translation of this sense of life into adult conceptual terms would if unimpeded follow the growth of the childs knowledgeand the two basic elements of his soul the cognitive and normative would develop together in serenely harmonious integration the ideal which at the age of seven was personified by a cowboy may become a detective at twelve and a philosopher at twentyas the childs interests progress from comic strips to mystery stories to the great sunlit universe of romantic literature art and music but whatever his age morality is a normative scienceie a science that projects a valuegoal to be achieved by a series of steps of choicesand it cannot be practiced without a clear vision of the goal without a concretized image of the ideal to be reached if man is to gain and keep a moral stature he needs an image of the ideal from the first thinking day of his life to the last in the translation of that ideal into conscious philosophical terms and into his actual practice a child needs intellectual assistance or at least a chance to find his own way in todays culture he is given neither the battering which his precarious unformed barely glimpsed moral sense of life receives from parents teachers adult authorities and little secondhander goons of his own generation is so intense and so evil that only the toughest hero can withstand itso evil that of the many sins of adults toward children this is the one for which they would deserve to burn in hell if such a place existed every form of punishmentfrom outright prohibition to threats to anger to condemnation to crass indifference to mockeryis unleashed against a child at the first signs of his romanticism which means at the first signs of his emerging sense of moral values life is not like that and come down to earth are the catchphrases which best summarize the motives of the attackers as well as the view of life and of this earth which they seek to inculcate the child who withstands it and damns the attackers not himself and his values is a rare exception the child who merely suppresses his values avoids communication and withdraws into a lonely private universe is almost as rare in most cases the child represses his values and gives up he gives up the entire realm of valuing of value choices and judgmentswithout knowing that what he is surrendering is morality the surrender is extorted by a long almost imperceptible process a constant ubiquitous pressure which the child absorbs and accepts by degrees his spirit is not broken at one sudden blow it is bled to death in thousands of small scratches the most devastating part of this process is the fact that a childs moral sense is destroyed not only by means of such weaknesses or flaws as he might have developed but by means of his barely emerging virtues an intelligent child is aware that he does not know what adult life is like that he has an enormous amount to learn and is anxiously eager to learn it an ambitious child is incoherently determined to make something important of himself and his life so when he hears such threats as wait till you grow up and youll never get anywhere with those childish notions it is his virtues that are turned against him his intelligence his ambition and whatever respect he might feel for the knowledge and judgment of his elders thus the foundation of a lethal dichotomy is laid in his consciousness the practical versus the moral with the unstated preconceptual implication that practicality requires the betrayal of ones values the renunciation of ideals his rationality is turned against him by means of a similar dichotomy reason versus emotion his romantic sense of life is only a sense an incoherent emotion which he can neither communicate nor explain nor defend it is an intense yet fragile emotion painfully vulnerable to any sarcastic allegation since he is unable to identify its real meaning it is easy to convince a child and particularly an adolescent that his desire to emulate buck rogers is ridiculous he knows that it isnt exactly buck rogers he has in mind and yet simultaneously it ishe feels caught in an inner contradictionand this confirms his desolately embarrassing feeling that he is being ridiculous thus the adultswhose foremost moral obligation toward a child at this stage of his development is to help him understand that what he loves is an abstraction to help him break through into the conceptual realmaccomplish the exact opposite they stunt his conceptual capacity they cripple his normative abstractions they stifle his moral ambition ie his desire for virtue ie his selfesteem they arrest his valuedevelopment on a primitively literal concretebound level they convince him that to be like buck rogers means to wear a space helmet and blast armies of martians with a disintegratorgun and that hed better give up such notions if he ever expects to make a respectable living and they finish him off with such gems of argumentation as buck rogershahanever gets any colds in the head do you know any real people who never get them why you had one last week so dont you go on imagining that youre better than the rest of us their motive is obvious if they actually regarded romanticism as an impractical fantasy they would feel nothing but a friendly or indifferent amusementnot the passionate resentment and uncontrollable rage which they do feel and exhibit while the child is thus driven to fear mistrust and repress his own emotions he cannot avoid observing the hysterical violence of the adults emotions unleashed against him in this and other issues he concludes subconsciously that all emotions as such are dangerous that they are the irrational unpredictably destructive element in people which can descend upon him at any moment in some terrifying way for some incomprehensible purpose this is the brick before last in the wall of repression which he erects to bury his own emotions the last is his desperate pride misdirected into a decision such as ill never let them hurt me again the way never to be hurt he decides is never to feel anything but an emotional repression cannot be complete when all other emotions are stifled a single one takes over fear the element of fear was involved in the process of the childs moral destruction from the start his victimized virtues were not the only cause his faults were active as well fear of others particularly of adults fear of independence of responsibility of lonelinessas well as selfdoubt and the desire to be accepted to belong but it is the involvement of his virtues that makes his position so tragic and later so hard to correct as he grows up his amorality is reinforced and reaffirmed his intelligence prevents him from accepting any of the current schools of morality the mystical the social or the subjective an eager young mind seeking the guidance of reason cannot take the supernatural seriously and is impervious to mysticism it does not take him long to perceive the contradictions and the sickeningly selfabasing hypocrisy of the social school of morality but the worst influence of all for him is the subjective school he is too intelligent and too honorable in his own twisted tortured way not to know that the subjective means the arbitrary the irrational the blindly emotional these are the elements which he has come to associate with peoples attitudes in moral issues and to dread when formal philosophy tells him that morality by its very nature is closed to reason and can be nothing but a matter of subjective choice this is the kiss or seal of death on his moral development his conscious conviction now unites with his subconscious feeling that value choices come from the mindless element in people and are a dangerous unknowable unpredictable enemy his conscious decision is not to get involved in moral issues its subconscious meaning is not to value anything or worse not to value anything too much not to hold any irreplaceable nonexpendable values from this to the policy of a moral coward existentially and to an overwhelming sense of guilt psychologically is not a very long step for an intelligent man the result is a man such as i described let it be said to his credit that he was unable to adjust to his inner contradictionsand that it was precisely his early professional success that broke him psychologically it exposed his valuevacuum his lack of personal purpose and thus the selfabnegating futility of his work he kneweven though not in fully conscious termsthat he was achieving the opposite of his original preconceptual goals and motives instead of leading a rational ie reasonguided and reasonmotivated life he was gradually becoming a moody subjectivist whimworshiper acting on the range of the moment particularly in his personal relationshipsby default of any firmly defined values instead of reaching independence from the irrationality of others he was being forcedby the same defaulteither into actual secondhandness or into an equivalent code of behavior into blind dependence on and compliance with the valuesystems of others into a state of abject conformity instead of pleasure the glimpse of any higher value or nobler experience brought him pain guilt terrorand prompted him not to seize it and fight for it but to escape to evade to betray it or to apologize for it in order to placate the standards of the conventional men whom he despised instead of man the victim as he had largely been he was becoming man the killer the clearest evidence of it was provided by his attitude toward romantic art a mans treason to his art values is not the primary cause of his neurosis it is a contributory cause but it becomes one of its most revealing symptoms this last is of particular importance to the man who seeks to solve his psychological problems the chaos of his personal relationships and values may at first be too complex for him to untangle but romantic art offers him a clear luminous impersonal abstractionand thus a clear objective test of his inner state a clue available to his conscious mind if he finds himself fearing evading and negating the highest experience possible to man a state of unclouded exaltation he can know that he is in profound trouble and that his only alternatives are either to check his valuepremises from scratch from the start from the repressed forgotten betrayed figure of his particular buck rogers and painfully to reconstruct his broken chain of normative abstractionsor to become completely the kind of monster he is in those moments when with an obsequious giggle he tells some fat babbitt that exaltation is impractical just as romantic art is a mans first glimpse of a moral sense of life so it is his last hold on it his last lifeline romantic art is the fuel and the spark plug of a mans soul its task is to set a soul on fire and never let it go out the task of providing that fire with a motor and a direction belongs to philosophy march introduction to ninetythree from the introduction by ayn rand to ninetythree by victor hugo translated by lowell bair copyright by bantam books inc all rights reserved have you ever wondered what they felt those first men of the renaissance whenemerging from the long nightmare of the middle ages having seen nothing but the deformed monstrosities and gargoyles of medieval art as the only reflections of mans soulthey took a new free unobstructed look at the world and rediscovered the statues of greek gods forgotten under piles of rubble if you have that unrepeatable emotional experience is yours when you rediscover the novels of victor hugo the distance between his world and ours is astonishingly shorthe died in but the distance between his universe and ours has to be measured in esthetic lightyears he is virtually unknown to the american public but for some vandalized remnants on our movie screens his works are seldom discussed in the literary courses of our universities he is buried under the esthetic rubble of our daywhile gargoyles leer at us again not from the spires of cathedrals but from the pages of shapeless unfocused ungrammatical novels about drug addicts bums killers dipsomaniacs psychotics he is as invisible to the neobarbarians of our age as the art of rome was to their spiritual ancestors and for the same reasons yet victor hugo is the greatest novelist in world literature romantic literature did not come into existence until the nineteenth century when mens life was politically freer than in any other period of history and when western culture was still reflecting a predominantly aristotelian influencethe conviction that mans mind is competent to deal with reality the romanticists were far from aristotelian in their avowed beliefs but their sense of life was the beneficiary of his liberating power the nineteenth century saw both the start and the culmination of an illustrious line of great romantic novelists and the greatest of these was victor hugo modern readers particularly the young who have been brought up on the kind of literature that makes zola seem romantic by comparison should be cautioned that a first encounter with hugo might be shocking to them it is like emerging from a murky underground filled with the moans of festering halfcorpses into a blinding burst of sunlight so by way of providing an intellectual firstaid kit i would suggest the following do not look for familiar landmarksyou wont find them you are not entering the backyard of the folks next door but a universe you did not know existed do not look for the folks next dooryou are about to meet a race of giants who might have and ought to have been your neighbors do not say that these giants are unreal because you have never seen them beforecheck your eyesight not hugos and your premises not his it was not his purpose to show you what you had seen a thousand times before do not say that the actions of these giants are impossible because they are heroic noble intelligent beautifulremember that the cowardly the depraved the mindless the ugly are not all that is possible to man do not say that this glowing new universe is an escapeyou will witness harder more demanding more tragic battles than any you have seen on poolroom street corners the difference is only this these battles are not fought for penny ante do not say that life is not like thatask yourself whose life this warning is made necessary by the fact that the philosophical and cultural disintegration of our agewhich is bringing mens intellect down to the concretebound rangeofthemoment perspective of a savagehas brought literature to the stage where the concept of abstract universality is now taken to mean statistical majority to approach hugo with such intellectual equipment and such a criterion is worse than futile to criticize hugo for the fact that his novels do not deal with the daily commonplaces of average lives is like criticizing a surgeon for the fact that he does not spend his time peeling potatoes to regard as hugos failure the fact that his characters are larger than life is like regarding as an airplanes failure the fact that it flies but for those readers who do not see why the kind of people that bore them to death or disgust them in real life should hold a monopoly on the role of literary subjects for those readers who are deserting serious literature in growing numbers and searching for the last afterglow of romanticism in detective fiction hugo is the new continent they have been longing to discover ninetythree quatrevingttreize is hugos last novel and one of his best it is an excellent introduction to his works it presentsin story style and spiritthe condensed essence of that which is uniquely hugoesque the novels background is the french revolutionninetythree stands for the year of the terror the revolutions climax the events of the story take place during the civil war of the vendéean uprising of the royalist peasants of brittany led by aristocrats who returned from exile for a desperate attempt to restore the monarchya civil war characterized by savage ruthlessness on both sides a great many irrelevant things have been said and written about this novel at the time of its publication in it was not favorably received by hugos enormous public or by the critics the explanation usually given by literary historians is that the french public was not sympathetic to a novel that seemed to glorify the first revolution at a time when the recent blood and horror of the paris commune of were still fresh in the publics memory two of hugos modern biographers refer to the novel as follows matthew josephson in victor hugo mentions it disapprovingly as a historical romance with idealized characters andré maurois in olympio ou la vie de victor hugo lists a number of hugos personal connections with the setting of the story such as the fact that hugos father fought in the vendee on the republican side then remarks the dialogue of the novel is theatrical but the french revolution had been theatrical and dramatic its heroes had struck sublime poses and had held them to the death which is a purely naturalistic approach or attempt at justification the fact is that ninetythree is not a novel about the french revolution to a romanticist a background is a background not a theme his vision is always focused on manon the fundamentals of mans nature on those problems and those aspects of his character which apply to any age and any country the theme of ninetythreewhich is played in brilliantly unexpected variations in all the key incidents of the story and which is the motive power of all the characters and events integrating them into an inevitable progression toward a magnificent climaxis mans loyalty to values to dramatize that theme to isolate that aspect of mans soul and show it in its purest form to put it to the test under the pressure of deadly conflicts a revolution is an appropriate background to select hugos story is not devised as a means of presenting the french revolution the french revolution is used as a means of presenting his story it is not any specific code of values that concerns him here but the wider abstraction mans loyalty to values whatever any mans particular values might be although hugos personal sympathy is obviously on the side of the republicans he presents his characters with impersonal detachment or rather with an impartial admiration granted equally to both sides of the conflict in spiritual grandeur intransigent integrity unflinching courage and ruthless dedication to his cause the old marquis de lantenac the leader of the royalists is the equal of cimourdain the expriest who became the leader of the republicans and perhaps lantenac is cimourdains superior as far as the color and power of his characterization are concerned hugos sympathy for the gay boisterous exuberance of the republican soldiers is matched by his sympathy for the grim desperate stubbornness of the royalist peasants the emphasis he projects is not what great values men are fighting for but what greatness men are capable of when they fight for their values hugos inexhaustible imagination is at its virtuoso best in an extremely difficult aspect of a novelists task the integration of an abstract theme to the plot of a story while the events of ninetythree are a sweeping emotional torrent directed by the inexorable logic of a plot structure every event features the theme every event is an instance of mans violent tortured agonized yet triumphant dedication to his values this is the invisible chain the corollary of the plotline that unites such scenes as the ragged disheveled young mother staggering blindly with savage endurance through flaming villages and devastated fields searching desperately for the children she has lost in the chaos of the civil warthe beggar who acts as host to his former feudal master in a cave under the roots of a treethe humble sailor who has to make a choice knowing that for a few brief hours in a rowboat in the darkness of night he holds the fate of the monarchy in his handsthe tall proud figure of a man with the clothes of a peasant and the bearing of an aristocrat who looks up from the bottom of a ravine at the distant reflection of a fire and finds himself confronted by a terrible alternativethe young revolutionary pacing back and forth in the darkness in front of a breach in a crumbling tower torn between treason to the cause he has served all his life and the voice of a higher loyaltythe whitefaced figure of a man who rises to pronounce the verdict of a revolutionary tribunal while the crowd waits in total stillness to hear whether he will spare or sentence to death the only man he had ever loved the greatest example of the power of dramatic integration is an unforgettable scene which only hugo could have written a scene in which the agonizing intensity and suspense of a complex development are resolved and surpassed by two simple lines of dialogue je tarreteje tapprouve i arrest youyou are right the reader will have to reach these lines in their full context to discover who speaks them and what enormous psychological significance and grandeur the author makes them convey grandeur is the one word that names the leitmotif of ninetythree and of all of hugos novelsand of his sense of life and perhaps the most tragic conflict is not in his novels but in their author with so magnificent a view of man and of existence hugo never discovered how to implement it in reality he professed conscious beliefs which contradicted his subconscious ideal and made its application to reality impossible he never translated his sense of life into conceptual terms he did not ask himself what ideas premises or psychological conditions were necessary to enable men to achieve the spiritual stature of his heroes his attitude toward the intellect was highly ambiguous it is as if hugo the artist had overwhelmed hugo the thinker as if a great mind had never drawn a distinction between the processes of artistic creation and of rational cognition two different methods of using ones consciousness which need not clash but are not the same as if his thinking consisted of images in his work and in his own life as if he thought in metaphors not in concepts in metaphors that stood for enormous emotional complexities as hurried symbols and mere approximations it is as if the wide emotional abstractions he handled as an artist made him too impatient for the task of rigorous defining and of identifying that which he sensed rather than knewand so he reached for any available theories that seemed to connote rather than denote his values toward the close of ninetythree hugo the artist sets up two superlatively dramatic opportunities for his characters to express their ideas to declare the intellectual grounds of their stand one a scene between lantenac and gauvain in which the old royalist is supposed to defy the young revolutionary by an impassioned defense of the monarchy the other between cimourdain and gauvain in which they are supposed to confront each other as the spokesmen for two different aspects of the revolutionary spirit i say supposed because hugo the thinker was unable to do it the characters speeches are not expressions of ideas but only rhetoric metaphors and generalities his fire his eloquence his emotional power seemed to desert him when he had to deal with theoretical subjects hugo the thinker was archetypical of the virtues and the fatal errors of the nineteenth century he believed in an unlimited automatic human progress he believed that ignorance and poverty were the only causes of human evil feeling an enormous incoherent benevolence he was impatiently eager to abolish any form of human suffering and he proclaimed ends without thinking of means he wanted to abolish poverty with no idea of the source of wealth he wanted the people to be free with no idea of what is necessary to secure political freedom he wanted to establish universal brotherhood with no idea that force and terror will not establish it he took reason for granted and did not see the disastrous contradiction of attempting to combine it with faiththough his particular form of mysticism was not of the abject oriental variety but was closer to the proud legends of the greeks and his god was a symbol of human perfection whom he worshiped with a certain arrogant confidence almost like an equal or a personal friend the theories by which hugo the thinker sought to implement it do not belong in the universe of hugo the artist when and as they are put into practice they achieve the opposite of those values which he knew only as a sense of life hugo the artist paid for that lethal contradiction even though no other artist had ever projected so deeply joyous a universe as his there is a somber touch of tragedy in all his writing most of his novels have tragic endingsas if he were unable to concretize the form in which his heroes could triumph on earth and he could only let them die in battle with an unbroken integrity of spirit as the only assertion of their loyalty to life as if to him it was the earth not heaven that represented an object of longing which he could never fully reach or win such was the nature of his conflict a professed mystic in his conscious convictions he was passionately in love with this earth a professed altruist he worshiped mans greatness not his suffering weaknesses or evils a professed advocate of socialism he was a fiercely intransigent individualist a professed champion of the doctrine that emotions are superior to reason he achieved the grandeur of his characters by making them all superbly conscious fully aware of their motives and desires fully focused on reality and acting accordinglyfrom the peasant mother in ninetythree to jean valjean in les misérables and this is the secret of their peculiar cleanliness this is what gives a beggar the stature of a giant this absence of blind irrationality and stuporous unfocused drifting this is the hallmark of all of hugos characters it is also the hallmark of human selfesteem on whose politicalphilosophical side does victor hugo belong it is not an accident that in our day in a culture dominated by altruistic collectivism he is not a favorite of those whose alleged ideals he allegedly shared i discovered victor hugo when i was thirteen in the stifling sordid ugliness of soviet russia one would have to have lived on some pestilent planet in order fully to understand what his novelsand his radiant universemeant to me then and mean now and that i am writing an introduction to one of his novelsin order to present it to the american publichas for me the sense of the kind of drama that he would have approved and understood he helped to make it possible for me to be here and to be a writer if i can help another young reader to find what i found in his work if i can bring to the novels of victor hugo some part of the kind of audience he deserves i shall regard it as a payment on an incalculable debt that can never be computed or repaid the goal of my writing the motive and purpose of my writing is the projection of an ideal man the portrayal of a moral ideal as my ultimate literary goal as an end in itselfto which any didactic intellectual or philosophical values contained in a novel are only the means let me stress this my purpose is not the philosophical enlightenment of my readers it is not the beneficial influence which my novels may have on people it is not the fact that my novels may help a readers intellectual development all these matters are important but they are secondary considerations they are merely consequences and effects not first causes or prime movers my purpose first cause and prime mover is the portrayal of howard roark or john galt or hank rearden or francisco danconia as an end in himselfnot as a means to any further end which incidentally is the greatest value i could ever offer a reader this is why i feel a very mixed emotionpart patience part amusement and at times an empty kind of wearinesswhen i am asked whether i am primarily a novelist or a philosopher as if these two were antonyms whether my stories are propaganda vehicles for ideas whether politics or the advocacy of capitalism is my chief purpose all such questions are so enormously irrelevant so far beside the point so much not my way of coming at things my way is much simpler and simultaneously much more complex than that speaking from two different aspects the simple truth is that i approach literature as a child does i writeand readfor the sake of the story the complexity lies in the task of translating that attitude into adult terms the specific concretes the forms of ones values change with ones growth and development the abstraction values does not an adults values involve the entire sphere of human activity including philosophymost particularly philosophy but the basic principlethe function and meaning of values in mans life and in literatureremains the same my basic test for any story is would i want to meet these characters and observe these events in real life is this story an experience worth living through for its own sake is the pleasure of contemplating these characters an end in itself its as simple as that but that simplicity involves the total of mans existence it involves such questions as what kind of men do i want to see in real lifeand why what kind of events that is human actions do i want to see taking placeand why what kind of experience do i want to live through that is what are my goalsand why it is obvious to what field of human knowledge all these questions belong to the field of ethics what is the good what are the right actions for man to take what are mans proper values since my purpose is the presentation of an ideal man i had to define and present the conditions which make him possible and which his existence requires since mans character is the product of his premises i had to define and present the kind of premises and values that create the character of an ideal man and motivate his actions which means that i had to define and present a rational code of ethics since man acts among and deals with other men i had to present the kind of social system that makes it possible for ideal men to exist and to functiona free productive rational system which demands and rewards the best in every man great or average and which is obviously laissezfaire capitalism but neither politics nor ethics nor philosophy are ends in themselves neither in life nor in literature only man is an end in himself now observe that the practitioners of the literary school diametrically opposed to minethe school of naturalismclaim that a writer must reproduce what they call real life allegedly as it is exercising no selectivity and no valuejudgments by reproduce they mean photograph by real life they mean whatever given concretes they happen to observe by as it is they mean as it is lived by the people around them but observe that these naturalistsor the good writers among themare extremely selective in regard to two attributes of literature style and characterization without selectivity it would be impossible to achieve any sort of characterization whatever neither of an unusual man nor of an average one who is to be offered as statistically typical of a large segment of the population therefore the naturalists opposition to selectivity applies to only one attribute of literature the content or subject it is in regard to his choice of subject that a novelist must exercise no choice they claim why the naturalists have never given an answer to that questionnot a rational logical noncontradictory answer why should a writer photograph his subjects indiscriminately and unselectively because they really happened to record what really happened is the job of a reporter or of a historian not of a novelist to enlighten readers and educate them that is the job of science not of literature of nonfiction writing not of fiction to improve mens lot by exposing their misery but that is a valuejudgment and a moral purpose and a didactic messageall of which are forbidden by the naturalist doctrine besides to improve anything one must know what constitutes an improvementand to know that one must know what is the good and how to achieve itand to know that one must have a whole system of valuejudgments a system of ethics which is anathema to the naturalists thus the naturalists position amounts to giving a novelist full esthetic freedom in regard to means but not in regard to ends he may exercise choice creative imagination valuejudgments in regard to how he portrays things but not in regard to what he portraysin regard to style or characterization but not in regard to subject manthe subject of literaturemust not be viewed or portrayed selectively man must be accepted as the given the unchangeable the nottobejudged the status quo but since we observe that men do change that they differ from one another that they pursue different values who then is to determine the human status quo naturalisms implicit answer is everybody except the novelist the novelistaccording to the naturalist doctrinemust neither judge nor value he is not a creator but only a recording secretary whose master is the rest of mankind let others pronounce judgments make decisions select goals fight over values and determine the course the fate and the soul of man the novelist is the only outcast and deserter of that battle his is not to reason whyhis is only to trot behind his master notebook in hand taking down whatever the master dictates picking up such pearls or such swinishness as the master may choose to drop as far as i am concerned i have too much selfesteem for a job of that kind i see the novelist as a combination of prospector and jeweler the novelist must discover the potential the gold mine of mans soul must extract the gold and then fashion as magnificent a crown as his ability and vision permit just as men of ambition for material values do not rummage through city dumps but venture out into lonely mountains in search of goldso men of ambition for intellectual values do not sit in their backyards but venture out in quest of the noblest the purest the costliest elements i would not enjoy the spectacle of benvenuto cellini making mudpies it is the selectivity in regard to subjectthe most severely rigorously ruthlessly exercised selectivitythat i hold as the primary the essential the cardinal aspect of art in literature this means the storywhich means the plot and the characterswhich means the kind of men and events that a writer chooses to portray the subject is not the only attribute of art but it is the fundamental one it is the end to which all the others are the means in most esthetic theories however the endthe subjectis omitted from consideration and only the means are regarded as esthetically relevant such theories set up a false dichotomy and claim that a slob portrayed by the technical means of a genius is preferable to a goddess portrayed by the technique of an amateur i hold that both are esthetically offensive but while the second is merely esthetic incompetence the first is an esthetic crime there is no dichotomy no necessary conflict between ends and means the end does not justify the meansneither in ethics nor in esthetics and neither do the means justify the end there is no esthetic justification for the spectacle of rembrandts great artistic skill employed to portray a side of beef that particular painting may be taken as a symbol of everything i am opposed to in art and in literature at the age of seven i could not understand why anyone should wish to paint or to admire pictures of dead fish garbage cans or fat peasant women with triple chins today i understand the psychological causes of such esthetic phenomenaand the more i understand the more i oppose them in art and in literature the end and the means or the subject and the style must be worthy of each other that which is not worth contemplating in life is not worth recreating in art misery disease disaster evil all the negatives of human existence are proper subjects of study in life for the purpose of understanding and correcting thembut are not proper subjects of contemplation for contemplations sake in art and in literature these negatives are worth recreating only in relation to some positive as a foil as a contrast as a means of stressing the positivebut not as an end in themselves the compassionate studies of depravity which pass for literature today are the dead end and the tombstone of naturalism if their perpetrators still claim the justification that these things are true most of them arentthe answer is that this sort of truth belongs in psychological case histories not in literature the picture of an infected ruptured appendix may be of great value in a medical textbookbut it does not belong in an art gallery and an infected soul is a much more repulsive spectacle that one should wish to enjoy the contemplation of values of the goodof mans greatness intelligence ability virtue heroismis selfexplanatory it is the contemplation of the evil that requires explanation and justification and the same goes for the contemplation of the mediocre the undistinguished the commonplace the meaningless the mindless at the age of seven i refused to read the childrens equivalent of naturalistic literaturethe stories about the children of the folks next door they bored me to death i was not interested in such people in real life i saw no reason to find them interesting in fiction this is still my position today the only difference is that today i know its full philosophical justification as far as literary schools are concerned i would call myself a romantic realist consider the significance of the fact that the naturalists call romantic art an escape ask yourself what sort of metaphysicswhat view of lifethat designation confesses an escapefrom what if the projection of valuegoalsthe projection of an improvement on the given the known the immediately availableis an escape then medicine is an escape from disease agriculture is an escape from hunger knowledge is an escape from ignorance ambition is an escape from sloth and life is an escape from death if so then a hardcore realist is a vermineaten brute who sits motionless in a mud puddle contemplates a pigsty and whines that such is life if that is realism then i am an escapist so was aristotle so was christopher columbus there is a passage in the fountainhead that deals with this issue the passage in which howard roark explains to steven mallory why he chose him to do a statue for the stoddard temple in writing that passage i was consciously and deliberately stating the essential goal of my own workas a kind of small personal manifesto i think youre the best sculptor weve got i think it because your figures are not what men are but what men could beand should be because youve gone beyond the probable and made us see what is possible but possible only through you because your figures are more devoid of contempt for humanity than any work ive ever seen because you have a magnificent respect for the human being because your figures are the heroic in man today more than twenty years later i would want to changeor rather to clarifyonly two small points first the words more devoid of contempt for humanity are not too exact grammatically what i wanted to convey was untouched by contempt for humanity while the work of others was touched by it to some extent second the words possible only through you should not be taken to mean that mallorys figures were impossible metaphysically in reality i meant that they were possible only because he had shown the way to make them possible your figures are not what men are but what men could beand should be this line will make it clear whose great philosophical principle i had accepted and was following and had been groping for long before i heard the name aristotle it was aristotle who said that fiction is of greater philosophical importance than history because history represents things only as they are while fiction represents them as they might be and ought to be why must fiction represent things as they might be and ought to be my answer is contained in one statement of atlas shruggedand in the implications of that statement as man is a being of selfmade wealth so he is a being of selfmade soul just as mans physical survival depends on his own effort so does his psychological survival man faces two corollary interdependent fields of action in which a constant exercise of choice and a constant creative process are demanded of him the world around him and his own soul by soul i mean his consciousness just as he has to produce the material values he needs to sustain his life so he has to acquire the values of character that enable him to sustain it and that make his life worth living he is born without the knowledge of either he has to discover bothand translate them into realityand survive by shaping the world and himself in the image of his values growing from a common root which is philosophy mans knowledge branches out in two directions one branch studies the physical world or the phenomena pertaining to mans physical existence the other studies man or the phenomena pertaining to his consciousness the first leads to abstract science which leads to applied science or engineering which leads to technologyto the actual production of material values the second leads to art art is the technology of the soul art is the product of three philosophical disciplines metaphysics epistemology ethics metaphysics and epistemology are the abstract base of ethics ethics is the applied science that defines a code of values to guide mans choices and actionsthe choices and actions which determine the course of his life ethics is the engineering that provides the principles and blueprints art creates the final product it builds the model let me stress this analogy art does not teachit shows it displays the full concretized reality of the final goal teaching is the task of ethics teaching is not the purpose of an art work any more than it is the purpose of an airplane just as one can learn a great deal from an airplane by studying it or taking it apart so one can learn a great deal from an art workabout the nature of man of his soul of his existence but these are merely fringe benefits the primary purpose of an airplane is not to teach man how to fly but to give him the actual experience of flying so is the primary purpose of an art work although the representation of things as they might be and ought to be helps man to achieve these things in real life this is only a secondary value the primary value is that it gives him the experience of living in a world where things are as they ought to be this experience is of crucial importance to him it is his psychological life line since mans ambition is unlimited since his pursuit and achievement of values is a lifelong processand the higher the values the harder the struggleman needs a moment an hour or some period of time in which he can experience the sense of his completed task the sense of living in a universe where his values have been successfully achieved it is like a moment of rest a moment to gain fuel to move farther art gives him that fuel art gives him the experience of seeing the full immediate concrete reality of his distant goals the importance of that experience is not in what he learns from it but in that he experiences it the fuel is not a theoretical principle not a didactic message but the lifegiving fact of experiencing a moment of metaphysical joya moment of love for existence a given individual may choose to move forward to translate the meaning of that experience into the actual course of his own life or he may fail to live up to it and spend the rest of his life betraying it but whatever the case may be the art work remains intact an entity complete in itself an achieved realized immovable fact of realitylike a beacon raised over the dark crossroads of the world saying this is possible no matter what its consequences that experience is not a way station one passes but a stop a value in itself it is an experience about which one can say i am glad to have reached this in my life there are not many experiences of that kind to be found in the modern world i have read a great many novels of which nothing remains in my mind but the dry rustle of scraps long since swept away but the novels of victor hugo and a very few others were an unrepeatable experience to me a beacon whose every brilliant spark is as alive as ever this aspect of art is difficult to communicateit demands a great deal of the viewer or readerbut i believe that many of you will understand me introspectively there is a scene in the fountainhead which is a direct expression of this issue i was in a sense both characters in that scene but it was written primarily from the aspect of myself as the consumer rather than the producer of art it was based on my own desperate longing for the sight of human achievement i regarded the emotional meaning of that scene as entirely personal almost subjectiveand i did not expect it to be shared by anyone but that scene proved to be the one most widely understood and most frequently mentioned by the readers of the fountainhead it is the opening scene of part iv between howard roark and the boy on the bicycle the boy thought that mans work should be a higher step an improvement on nature not a degradation he did not want to despise men he wanted to love and admire them but he dreaded the sight of the first house poolroom and movie poster he would encounter on his way he had always wanted to write music and he could give no other identity to the thing he sought let me see that in one single act of man on earth let me see it made real let me see the answer to the promise of that music dont work for my happiness my brothersshow me yoursshow me that it is possibleshow me your achievementand the knowledge will give me courage for mine this is the meaning of art in mans life it is from this perspective that i will now ask you to consider the meaning of naturalismthe doctrine which proposes to confine men to the sight of slums poolrooms movie posters and on down much farther down it is the romantic or valueoriented vision of life that the naturalists regard as superficialand it is the vision which extends as far as the bottom of a garbage can that they regard as profound it is rationality purpose and values that they regard as naivewhile sophistication they claim consists of discarding ones mind rejecting goals renouncing values and writing fourletter words on fences and sidewalks scaling a mountain they claim is easybut rolling in the gutter is a noteworthy achievement those who seek the sight of beauty and greatness are motivated by fear they claimthey who are the embodiments of chronic terrorwhile it takes courage to fish in cesspools mans soulthey proclaim with selfrighteous prideis a sewer well they ought to know it is a significant commentary on the present state of our culture that i have become the object of hatred smears denunciations because i am famous as virtually the only novelist who has declared that her soul is not a sewer and neither are the souls of her characters and neither is the soul of man the motive and purpose of my writing can best be summed up by saying that if a dedication page were to precede the total of my work it would read to the glory of man and if anyone should ask me what it is that i have said to the glory of man i will answer only by paraphrasing howard roark i will hold up a copy of atlas shrugged and say the explanation rests octobernovember the simplest thing in the world a short story this story was written in it did not appear in print until the november issue of the objectivist where it was published in its original form as written the story illustrates the nature of the creative processthe way in which an artists sense of life directs the integrating functions of his subconscious and controls his creative imagination henry dorn sat at his desk and looked at a sheet of blank paper through a feeling of numb panic he said to himself this is going to be the easiest thing youve ever done just be stupid he said to himself thats all just relax and be as stupid as you can be easy isnt it what are you scared of you damn fool you dont think you can be stupid is that it youre conceited he said to himself angrily thats the whole trouble with you youre conceited as hell so you cant be stupid can you youre being stupid right now youve been stupid about this thing all your life why cant you be stupid on order ill start in a minute he said just one minute more and then ill start i will this time ill just rest for a minute thats all right isnt it im very tired youve done nothing today he said youve done nothing for months what are you tired of thats why im tiredbecause ive done nothing i wish i could id give anything if i could again stop that stop it quick thats the one thing you mustnt think about youre to start in a minute and you were almost ready you wont be ready if you think of that dont look at it dont look at it dont look at he had turned he was looking at a thick book in a ragged blue jacket lying on a shelf under old magazines he could see on its spine the white letters merging with the faded blue triumph by henry dorn he got up and pushed the magazines down to hide the book its better if you dont see it while youre doing it he said no its better if it doesnt see you doing it youre a sentimental fool he said it was not a good book how do you know it was a good book no that wont work all right it was a good book its a great book theres nothing you can do about that it would be much easier if you could it would be much easier if you could make yourself believe that it was a lousy book and that it had deserved what had happened to it then you could look people straight in the face and write a better one but you didnt believe it and you had tried very hard to believe that but you didnt all right he said drop that youve gone over that over and over again for two years so drop it not now it wasnt the bad reviews that i minded it was the good ones particularly the one by fleurette lumm who said it was the best book shed ever readbecause it had such a touching love story he had not even known that there was a love story in his book and he had not known that what there was of it was touching and the things that were there in his book the things he had spent five years thinking of and writing writing as carefully as scrupulously as delicately as he knew howthese things fleurette lumm had not mentioned at all at first after he had read the reviews he had thought that these things were not in his book at all he had only imagined they were or else the printer had left them outonly the book seemed very thick and if the printer had left them out what filled all those pages and it wasnt possible that he had not written the book in english and it wasnt possible that so many bright people couldnt read english and it wasnt possible that he was insane so he read his book over again very carefully and he was happy when he found a bad sentence in it or a muddled paragraph or a thought that did not seem clear he said theyre right it isnt there it isnt clear at all it was perfectly fair of them to miss it and the world is a human place to live in but after he had read all of his book to the end he knew that it was there that it was clear and beautiful and very important that he could not have done it any betterand that hell never understand the answer that he had better not try to understand it if he wished to remain alive all right he said thats about enough now isnt it youve been at it longer than a minute and you said you would start the door was open and he looked into the bedroom kitty sat there at a table playing solitaire her face looked as if she were very successful at making it look as if everything were all right she had a lovely mouth you could always tell things about people by their mouth hers looked as if she wanted to smile at the world and if she didnt it was her own fault and she really would in a moment because she was all right and so was the world in the lamplight her neck looked white and very thin bent attentively over the cards it didnt cost any money to play solitaire he heard the cards thumping down gently and the steam crackling in the pipe in the corner the doorbell rang and kitty came in quickly to open the door not looking at him her body tight and purposeful under the childish wideskirted print dress a very lovely dress only it had been bought two years ago and for summer wear he could have opened the door but he knew why she wanted to open it he stood his feet planted wide apart his stomach drawn not looking at the door listening he heard a voice and then he heard kitty saying no im sorry but we really dont need an electrolux kittys voice was almost a song of release as if she were making an effort not to sound too foolish as if she loved the electrolux man and wished she could ask him in to visit he knew why kittys voice sounded like that she had thought it was the landlord kitty closed the door and looked at him crossing the room and smiled as if she were apologizinghumbly and happilyfor her existence and said i dont want to interrupt you dear and went back to her solitaire all you have to do he said to himself is think of fleurette lumm and try to imagine what she likes just imagine that and then write it down thats all there is to it and youll have a good commercial story that will sell immediately and make you a lot of money its the simplest thing in the world you cant be the only one whos right and everybody else wrong he said everybodys told you that thats what you must do youve asked for a job and nobody would give you one nobody would help you find one nobody had even seemed interested or serious about it they said a brilliant young man like you look at paul pattison they said eighty thousand a year and not half your brain but paul knows what the public likes to read and gives it to them if youd just stop being so stubborn they said you dont have to be intellectual all the time why not be practical for a while and then after youve made your first fifty thousand dollars you can sit back and indulge yourself in some more high literature which will never sell they said why waste your time on a job what can you do youll be lucky if you get twentyfive a week its foolish when youve got a great talent for words you know you have if youd only be sensible about it it ought to be easy for you if you can write fancy difficult stuff like that it ought to be a cinch to toss off a popular serial or two any fool can do it they said stop dramatizing yourself do you enjoy being a martyr they said look at your wife they said if paul pattison can do it why cant you think of fleurette lumm he said to himself sitting down at his desk you imagine that you cant understand her but you can if you want to dont try to be so complicated be simple shes simple to understand thats it be simple about everything just write a simple story the simplest most unimportant story you can imagine for gods sake cant you think of anything thats not important not important at all not of the slightest possible importance cant you are you as good as that you conceited fool do you really think youre as good as that that you cant do anything unless its great profound important do you have to be a worldsaver all the time do you have to be a damn joan darc stop kidding yourself he said you can youre no better than anyone else he chuckled thats the kind of rotter you are people tell themselves theyre no worse than anyone else when they need courage you tell yourself youre no better i wish youd tell me where you got that infernal conceit of yours thats all it is not any great talent not any brilliant mindjust conceit youre not a noble martyr to your art youre an inflated egotistand youre getting just what you deserve good are you what makes you think youre good what right have you to hate what youre going to do you havent written anything for months you couldnt you cant write any more you never will again and if you cant write what you want to writewhat business have you to despise the things people want you to write thats all youre good for anyway not for any great epics with immortal messages and you ought to be damn glad to try and do it not sit here like a convict in a death cell waiting for his picture to be taken for the front pages now thats better i think you have the right spirit now now you can start how does one start those things well lets see it must be a simple human story try to think of something human how does one make ones mind work how does one invent a story how can people ever be writers come on youve written before how did you start then no you cant think of that not of that if you doyoull go completely blank again or worse think that youve never written before its a new start youre turning over a new leaf there that was good if you can think in lousy bromides like that youll do it youre beginning to get it think of something human oh come on think hard well try it this way think of the word human think of what it meansyoull get an idea somewhere human whats the most human thing there is whats the quality that all the people you know have got the outstanding quality in all of them their motive power fear not fear of anyone in particular just fear just a great blind force without object malicious fear the kind that makes them want to see you suffer because they know that they too will have to suffer and it makes it easier to know that you do also the kind that makes them want to see you being small and funny and smutty small people are safe its not really fear its more than that like mr crawford for instance whos a lawyer and whos glad when a client of his loses a suit hes glad even though he loses money on it even though it hurts his reputation hes glad and he doesnt even know that hes glad god what a story there is in mr crawford if you could put him down on paper as he is and explain just why he is like that and yeah he said to himself in three volumes which no one would ever publish because theyd say it was not true and call me a hater of humanity stop it stop it fast thats not at all what they mean when they say a story is human but its human but its not what they mean what do they mean youll never know oh yes you do you know it you know it very wellwithout knowing oh stop this why must you always know the meaning of everything theres your first mistakeright there do it without thinking it mustnt have any meaning it must be written as if youd never tried to find any meaning in anything not ever in your life it must sound as if thats the kind of person you are why do people resent people who look for a meaning whats the real reason that stop it all right lets try to go at it in a different way entirely dont start with an abstraction start with something definite anything think of something simple obvious and bad so bad that you wont care one way or the other say the first thing you can think of for instance a story about a middleaged millionaire who tries to seduce a poor young working girl thats good thats very good now go on with it quick dont think go on with it well hes a man of about fifty hes made a fortune unscrupulously because hes ruthless shes only twentytwo and very beautiful and very sweet and she works in the fiveandten yes in the fiveandten and he owns it thats what he isa big tycoon who owns a whole slew of fiveandtens this is good one day he comes to this particular store and he sees this girl and he falls in love with her why would he fall in love with her well hes lonely hes very terribly lonely he hasnt got a friend in the world people dont like him people never like a man whos made a success of himself also hes ruthless you cant make a success of yourself unless you hold onto your one goal and drop everything else when you have a great devotion to a goalpeople call you ruthless and when you work harder than anyone else when you work like a freight engine while others take it easy and so you beat them at itpeople call you unscrupulous thats human also you dont work like that just to make money its something else its a great driving energya creative energyno its the principle of creation itself its what makes everything in the world dams and skyscrapers and transatlantic cables everything weve got it comes from men like that when he started the shipyardsoh hes a fiveandten tycoonno he isnt to hell with the fiveandtenwhen he started the shipyards that he made his fortune from there was nothing there but a few shacks and a lot of clam shells he made the town he made the harbor he gave jobs to hundreds of people theyd still be digging for clams if he hadnt come along and now they hate him and hes not bitter about it hes accepted that long ago he just doesnt understand now hes fifty years old and circumstances have forced him to retire hes got millionsand hes the most miserable man in the world because he wants to worknot to make money just to work just to fight and take chancesbecause that great energy cannot be kept still now when he meets the girlwhat girloh the one in the fiveandten oh to hell with her what do you need her for hes married long agoand thats not the story at all what he meets is a poor struggling young man and he envies this boybecause the boys great struggle is still ahead of him but this boynow thats the pointthis boy doesnt want to struggle at all hes a nice able likeable kid but he has no real driving desire for anything hes been adequate at several different jobs and hes dropped them all theres no passion to him no goal what he wants above all is security he doesnt care what he does or how or who tells him to do it hes never created anything hes given nothing to the world and he never will but he wants security from the world and hes liked by everybody and he has everybodys sympathy and there they arethe two men which one is right which one is good which ones got the truth what happens when life brings them face to face oh what a story dont you see its not just the two of them its more much more its the whole tragedy of the world today its our greatest problem its the most important oh god do you think you can do you think youll get away with it maybe if youre very clever if you disguise it so theyll think its just a story about an old man nothing very serious i dont mind if they miss it i hope they miss it let them think theyre reading trash if theyll only let me write it i dont have to stress it i dont have to have much of it of whats good i can hide it i can apologize for it with a lot of human stuff about boats and women and swimming pools they wont know theyll let me no he said they wont dont fool yourself theyre as good at it as you are they know their kind of story just like you do yours they might not even be able to explain it what it is or where but theyll know they always know whats theirs and what isnt besides its a controversial issue the leftists wont like it it will antagonize a lot of people what do you want a controversial issue forin a popular magazine story no go back to the beginning where hes a fiveandten tycoon no i cant i cant waste it ive got to use that story ill write it but not now ill write it after ive written this one commercial piece that will be the first thing ill write after i have money thats worth waiting for now start all over again on something else come on it isnt so bad now is it you see it wasnt difficult at all thinking it came by itself just start on something else get an interesting beginning something good and startling even if you dont know what its all about and where to go from there suppose you open with a young girl who lives on a rooftop in one of those storerooms above a loftbuilding and shes sitting there on the roof all alone its a beautiful summer evening and suddenly theres a shot and a window in the next building cracks open glass flying all over the place and a man jumps out of the window onto her roof there you cant possibly go wrong on that its so bad that its sure to be right well why would a girl live in a loftbuilding because its cheap no the ywca would be cheaper or sharing a furnished room with a girlfriend thats what a girl would do no not this girl she cant get along with people she doesnt know why but she cant so shed rather be alone shes been very much alone all her life she works in a huge busy noisy stupid office she likes her rooftop because when shes there alone at night she has the whole city to herself and she sees it not as it is but as it could have been as it should have been thats her troublealways wanting things to be what they should be and never are she looks at the city and she thinks of whats going on in the penthouses little islands of light in the sky and she thinks of great mysterious breathstopping things not of cocktail parties and drunks in bathrooms and kept women with dogs and the building next doorits a smart hotel and theres this one large window right over her roof and the window is of frosted glass because the view is so ugly she cant see anything in that windowonly the silhouettes of people against the light only the shadows and she sees this one man therehes tall and slender and he holds his shoulders as if he were giving orders to the whole world and he moves as if that were a light and easy job for him to do and she falls in love with him with his shadow shes never seen him and she doesnt want to she doesnt know anything about him and she never tries to learn she doesnt care its not what he is its what she thinks of him as being its a love without future without hope or the need of hope a love great enough to find happiness in nothing but its own greatness unreal inexpressible undemandingand more real than anything around her and henry dorn sat at his desk seeing what men cannot see except when they do not know they are seeing it seeing his own thoughts in a way of sight brighter than any perception of the things around him seeing them not pushing them forward but seeing them as a detached observer without control of their shape each thought a corner and a bright astonishment meeting him behind each corner not creating anything but being carried along not helping and not resisting through minutes of a feeling like a payment for all the agony he would ever bear a feeling continuing only while you do not know that you feel it and then that evening she is sitting alone on the roof and theres a shot and that window is shattered and that man leaps out onto her roof she sees him for the first timeand this is the miracle for once in her life he is what she had wanted him to be he looks as she had wanted him to look but he has just committed a murder i suppose it will have to be some kind of justifiable murder no no no its not a justifiable murder at all we dont even know what it isand she doesnt know but here is the dream the impossible the idealagainst the laws of the whole world her own truthagainst all mankind she has to oh stop it stop it stop it well pull yourself together man pull yourself together well for whom is it youre writing that story for the womens kitchen friend no youre not tired youre all right its all right youll write this story later youll write it after you have money its all right it wont be taken away from you now sit quiet count ten no i tell you you can you can you havent tried hard enough you let it get away with you you begin to think cant you think without thinking listen cant you understand a different way of doing it dont think of the fantastic dont think of the unusual dont think of the opposite of what anyone elsed want to think but go after the obvious the easy easyfor whom come on now its this its because you ask yourself what if that starts the whole trouble what if its not what it seems to be at all wouldnt it be interesting if thats what you do and you mustnt you mustnt think of what would be interesting but how can i do anything if i know it isnt interesting but it will beto them thats just why it will be to thembecause it isnt to you thats the whole secret but then how do i know what or where or why listen cant you stop it for a little while cant you turn it offthat brain of yours cant you make it work without letting it work cant you be stupid cant you be consciously deliberately coldbloodedly stupid cant that be done in some way everybody is stupid about some things the best of us and the brightest everybody has blind spots they say cant you make it be this dear god let me be stupid let me be dishonest let me be contemptible just once because i must dont you see its a matter of one reversal just make one single reversal instead of believing that one must try to be intelligent different honest challenging that one must do the best possible to the best of ones ability and then stretch it some more to do still betterbelieve that one must be dull stale sweet dishonest and safe thats all is that the way other people do it no i dont think so theyd end up in an insane asylum in six months then what is it i dont know it isnt thatbut it works out like that maybe if we were told from the beginning to reverse it but we arent but some of us get wise to it earlyand then theyre all right but why should it be like that why should we drop it youre not settling world problems youre writing a commercial story all right quick and cold now hold yourself tight and dont let yourself like the story above all dont let yourself like it lets make it a detective story a murder mystery you cant possibly have a murder mystery with any serious meaning come on quick cold and simple there must be two villains in a mystery story the victim and the murdererso nobody would feel too sorry for either of them thats the way its always done well you can have some leeway on the victim but the murderers got to be a villain now the murderer must have a motive it must be a contemptible motive lets see ive got it the murderer is a professional blackmailer whos holding a lot of people in his clutches and the victim is the man whos about to expose him so the blackmailer kills this man thats as low a motive as you could imagine theres no excuse for that or is there what if wouldnt it be interesting if you could prove that the murderer was justified what if all those people he blackmails are utter lice the kind that do horrible things but just manage to remain within the law so theres no way of defending yourself against them and this man chooses deliberately to become a crusading blackmailer he gets things on all those people and he forces them to do justice a lot of men make careers for themselves by knowing where some body or other is buried well this man goes out after such bodies only he doesnt use them for personal advancement he uses them to undo the harm these people are doing hes a robin hood of blackmail he gets them in the only way they can be gotten for instance one of them is a corrupt politician and the herono the murdererno the hero gets the dope on him and forces him to vote right on a certain measure another one is a big hollywood producer whos ruined a lot of livesand the hero makes him give a talented actress a break without forcing her to become his mistress another one is a crooked businessmanand the hero forces him to play straight and when the worst one of the lotwhats the worst one of the lot a hypocritical reformer i thinkno thats dangerous to touch too controversialoh what the hellwhen this reformer traps the hero and is about to expose him the hero kills him why shouldnt he and the interesting thing about the story is that all those people will be presented just as they appear in real life nice people pillars of society liked admired and respected and the hero is just a hard lonely kind of outcast oh what a story prove that prove what some of our popular people are really like blow the lid off society show it for what its worth prove that the lone wolf is not always a wolf prove honesty and courage and strength and dedication prove it through a blackmailer and a murderer have a story with a murderer for a hero and let him get away with it a great story an important story which henry dorn sat very still his hands folded in his lap hunched seeing nothing thinking of nothing then he pushed the sheet of blank paper aside and reached for the times help wanted ads index a abstractions
